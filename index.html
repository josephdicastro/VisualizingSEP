                                    <h3>Hover Mode and Click Mode</h3>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>There are two fundamental ways to navigate the graph: <em>Hover Mode</em> and <em>Click Mode</em>.
                                            These are exclusive modes, and the graph can only be in one mode at a time.</li>
                                        <li>The current mode is always listed in the <em>“Graph Mode”</em> box in the top right corner. Toggle between the two modes by <b>single-clicking</b> this box. Switching modes will clear out the graph.</li>
                                        <li>Regardless of the current Graph Mode, <b>Double-click</b> any node or title to make a new selection and reload the graph with the new selection.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                        <h4>Preview Mode</h4>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>This is the default modal state of the graph. </li>
                                            <li>In this mode, when you <b>hover/mouseOver over a node or title</b>, the entire graph will be re-drawn to preview the 
                                                information that emerges from the hovered reference. The article details in the left sidebar will be temporarily replaced 
                                                with preview information for the hovered node, and if the hovered node also links to other articles in the same 
                                                graph, a dashed line will be drawn between the nodes that are also linked together to indicate this relationship.</li> 
                                            <li>As soon as you stop hovering over that node, the graph will return to its original state. 
                                                And when you hover over another node, the graph will be redrawn, etc. </li>
                                            <li>At any point, you can always <b>double-click a node or title</b> to draw a brand new graph with this new node as the main selection.</li>
                                            <li>Preview Mode provides a powerful way to quickly view the relationships in the Article Graph. However,
                                                it doesn’t really allow a deep exploration of the relationships between the selected article and the links.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                        <h4>Explore Mode</h4>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Explore Mode is for deep-diving into the relationships between the selected entry and 
                                                the linked articles, as well as to make a more detailed inquiry into the linked articles themselves. </li>
                                            <li>The power of this mode comes in when the user <b>single-clicks a node or title</b>. The graph will then be frozen in that state. Each time the 
                                                users clicks a new node, the graph updates and is then re-frozen.</li>
                                            <li>In this state, the user can then explore all the details of all the linked articles, can follow how linked articles are themselves 
                                                linked to other articles in the graph, or can look at, for examplke, only articles that are out-going links or only articles whose primary 
                                                domain is epistemology, etc.</li>
                                            <li>When you <b>hover over a node or title</b> in Explore Mode, the data in the left sidebar will be replaced with a preview of the hovered article, 
                                                but the main graph features remain the same. The graph itself is only re-drawn when you click a node. </li>
                                            <li>At any point, you can always <b>double-click a node or title</b> to draw a brand new graph with this new node as the main selection.</li>
                                        </ul>

                                    <li>When the graph is first loaded, the nodes are visible, but the labels are not. You can hover over the nodes to see the node title, 
                                        and to see which articles in the domain that particular article is linked to. You can also hover over the titles in the "Most Connected Nodes" panel,
                                        or the titles in the "List of Articles" panel, to see the same information.

                                    <li>There are two fundamental ways to navigate the graph: <em>Preview Mode</em> and <em>Explore Mode</em>.
                                        These are exclusive modes, and the graph can only be in one mode at a time.</li>
                                    <li>The current mode is always listed in the <em>“Graph Mode”</em> box in the top right corner. Toggle between the two modes by <b>single-clicking</b> this box. Switching modes will clear out the graph.</li>
                                    <li><b>Double-click</b> any node or title to select that node and then load the Article Graph with that node as the selection.</li>

                                    <h4>Preview Mode</h4>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>This is the default modal state of the graph. </li>
                                        <li>In this mode, when you <b>hover/mouseOver over a node or title</b>, the entire graph will be re-drawn to preview the 
                                            information that emerges from the hovered reference. The article details in the left sidebar will be temporarily replaced 
                                            with preview information for the hovered node, and if the hovered node also links to other articles in the same 
                                            graph, a dashed line will be drawn between the nodes that are also linked together to indicate this relationship.</li> 
                                        <li>As soon as you stop hovering over that node, the graph will return to its original state. 
                                            And when you hover over another node, the graph will be redrawn, etc. </li>
                                        <li>At any point, you can always <b>double-click a node or title</b> to draw a brand new graph with this new node as the main selection.</li>
                                        <li>Preview Mode provides a powerful way to quickly view the relationships in the Article Graph. However,
                                            it doesn’t really allow a deep exploration of the relationships between the selected article and the links.</li>

                                    <h4>Explore Mode</h4>

                                        <li>Explore Mode is for deep-diving into the relationships between the selected entry and 
                                            the linked articles, as well as to make a more detailed inquiry into the linked articles themselves. </li>
                                        <li>The power of this mode comes in when the user <b>single-clicks a node or title</b>. The graph will then be frozen in that state. Each time the 
                                            users clicks a new node, the graph updates and is then re-frozen.</li>
                                        <li>In this state, the user can then explore all the details of all the linked articles, can follow how linked articles are themselves 
                                            linked to other articles in the graph, or can look at, for examplke, only articles that are out-going links or only articles whose primary 
                                            domain is epistemology, etc.</li>
                                        <li>When you <b>hover over a node or title</b> in Explore Mode, the data in the left sidebar will be replaced with a preview of the hovered article, 
                                            but the main graph features remain the same. The graph itself is only re-drawn when you click a node. </li>
                                        <li>At any point, you can always <b>double-click a node or title</b> to draw a brand new graph with this new node as the main selection.</li>

                                    <h3>Color</h3>
                                    <p>Each article node and title is colored according to its <i>primary domain</i> designation, which is the domain chosen as the most representative
