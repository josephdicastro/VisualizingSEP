                                <p>Visualizing SEP is an interactive visualization and search engine for exploring the <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/">Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy</a> beautifully and powerfully.</p>
                                <div id="validContent" class="scrollbars">
                                    <p>The fundamental motivation of Visualizing SEP is that the web of knowledge that links different ideas, philosophers, and schools of thought together is as important as any particular topic itself, so the application brings these intertextual connections to the forefront of the research process. Every article returned by the application’s search engine is presented within a network graph of all the other articles to which it is directly linked, allowing users to easily deep-dive into the topic and its surrounding contexts, or to continually explore new avenues of related knowledge. Visualizing SEP is first and foremost a powerful research tool, but it also doubles as a fun way to explore the incredible resource that is the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy.

                                    <p>Visualizing SEP is an interactive data visualization for exploring the <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/" target="_blank">Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy</a>, one of the Web’s foremost resources on the history and practice of philosophy. The application uses network graphs to explore the inter-relationships of all the articles in the Encyclopedia. There have been a number of wonderful visualizations of the SEP before, but there has not been a single application that combines the beauty, ease, and power of exploring the SEP in the way this application does.</p>
                                    <p>This application is a passion project. It is a tribute to the authors and the editors of the SEP who have developed such a wonderful resource for the world. I am not a professional philosopher myself, but I am a developer and engineer, and I wanted to make my own small contribution to the SEP community by building a tool to explore and navigate the SEP in ways that weren’t possible before.</p>
                                    <p style="font-weight: bold;">Please Note: Visualizing SEP is not affiliated with the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy in any way.</p>
                                    <h2>Domain Taxonomy</h2>
                                    <p>The domain taxonomy used for grouping articles is not derived from the SEP itself. It is based on the taxonomy from the <a href="https://www.inphoproject.org/taxonomy"  target="_blank">Indiana University Philosophy Ontology Project (InPhO)</a>. The domain groupings should be seen more like language games with loosely fit boundaries between related articles instead of rigid determinations with bright-line differences between them. </p>
                                    <p>Each article is tagged with a <em>primary domain designation</em>, which is the individual domain that an article was considered best grouped with, as well as a general <em>domain_tags</em> field, which indicates other domains that the article can reasonably be tagged with. In this way, an article can appear in multiple domain groups. Each domain is given a color reference, and all article nodes and titles are colored by the color reference of its <em>primary domain designation</em>. </p>

When you <strong>MouseOver</strong> one of those titles, the preview text and article domain information in the Left Sidebar is updated for the selected article, and a dashed line is drawn from the title to its corresponding node in the graph, which indicates the position of the article within the current domain network.</li>
