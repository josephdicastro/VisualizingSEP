<div id="preamble">

<p>

The object of attitudes valorized in the major religious traditions is
typically regarded as maximally great. Conceptions of maximal
greatness differ but theists believe that a maximally great reality
must be a maximally great <em>person</em> or God. Theists largely
agree that a maximally great person would be omnipresent, omnipotent,
omniscient, and all good. They do not agree on a number of God's other
attributes, however. We will illustrate this by examining the debate
over God's impassibility in western theism and a dispute over God's
relation to the space-time world in Indian theism. The entry concludes
by examining some concepts of limited deities.</p>

<h2><a name="UltConMaxGre">1. Ultimate Concern and Maximal Greatness</a></h2>

<p>

Paul Tillich believed that the essence of religious attitudes is
“ultimate concern.” Ultimate concern is
“total.” Its object is experienced as numinous or holy,
distinct from all profane and ordinary realities. It is also
experienced as overwhelmingly real and valuable—indeed, so real
and so valuable that, in comparison, all other things appear empty and
worthless. As such, it demands total surrender and promises total
fulfillment.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#1" name="note-1">1</a>]</sup></p>

<p>

Tillich's claim is not self-evident. For one thing, it is doubtful
that ultimate concern is either a necessary or a sufficient condition
of a religious attitude. A late pagan's attitude towards his gods was
often too casual to be described as ultimate in Tillich's sense and
yet was surely religious. Moreover, Tillich himself believed that a
commitment to one's nation or party could be ultimate in his sense
(although he thought that if one's concern were to take this form, it
would be “idolatrous”).  Whether the Nazi's attitude
towards his nation and party can be properly described as religious is
doubtful, however. Strictly speaking, then, Tillich's claim is
probably false. Nevertheless, ultimate concern <em>does</em> appear to
be a distinctive feature of the religious attitudes of devout members
of the major religious traditions.</p>

<p>

These attitudes seem fully appropriate only if their object is
maximally great—so perfect and splendid that nothing greater is
conceivable. And, in fact, the major religious traditions have (if
only implicitly) construed the object of their devotion in precisely
these terms. The nature of maximal perfection is controversial,
however.</p>

<p>

For one thing, the <em>form</em> a religious community's ultimate
concern takes (and the conception of its object with which it is bound
up) varies from one religious community to another.  Ultimate concern
may take the form of worship, and involve praise, love, gratitude,
supplication, confession, petition, and the like. But it can also take
the form of a quest for the ultimate good. The object of the quest is
an existentially appropriated knowledge of the ultimate good or a
union with it that transforms us and overcomes our wrongness. The two
forms of ultimate concern may be combined or exist separately.
Christianity and theistic Hinduism combine both. In Theravada Buddhism
and Taoism, on the other hand, ultimate concern typically takes the
second form but not the first.</p>

<p>

In practice, a religious community's conception of the divine is
largely determined by its conviction that the object of its devotion
is maximally great, by the spoken or oral texts it regards as
authoritative, and by metaphysical assumptions and valuations widely
shared by the community's members. Of course these sources aren't
independent of each other. The form ultimate concern takes in a
community <em>incorporates</em> its most fundamental evaluations, and
the authoritative texts which express and shape its ultimate concern
present pictures of the world and our place in it which include
explicit or implicit metaphysical claims. The Buddhist's picture, for
example, expresses the vision of a world in constant flux—devoid
of fixity or any kind of permanent substance.</p>

<p>

Since the form ultimate concern takes, the texts regarded as
authoritative, and the metaphysical assumptions and evaluations
inextricably bound up with these forms and texts vary from one
religious community to another, it is hardly surprising that
conceptions of maximal greatness vary as well.</p>

<p>

The most striking disagreement is between those who regard the divine
reality as personal and those who do not. Theists believe that even
though the object of their ultimate concern transcends all finite
realities it is more like a person than anything else with which we
are ordinarily familiar, and typically conceptualize it as a maximally
perfect person. Persons are rational agents, however—beings who
have beliefs about themselves and the world and act on the basis of
them. The major theistic traditions have therefore described ultimate
reality as an omniscient mind and an omnipotent will. Other religious
traditions are non-theistic. Advaita Vedanta is an important
example.</p>

<p>

Advaita Vedanta's rejection of theism is a consequence of its
insistence that “Brahman [ultimate reality] is without parts or
attributes…one without a second.” (Shankara [traditional
attribution], second half of the 8th century: 101) If the Brahman has
<em>no</em> properties, it necessarily lacks the properties of
omniscience, perfect goodness, omnipotence, and personhood, and cannot
therefore be understood as God. </p>

<p>

The rejection of theism also follows from Advaita's conviction that
Brahman contains no internal diversity (“is without
parts”) and is identical with the whole of reality (”is
one without a second”). If Brahman is all there is, for
example,then there is nothing outside Brahman that could serve as an
object of its knowledge. And if it is devoid of internal diversity,
there can be no self-knowledge either, for self-knowledge involves an
internal differentiation between the self as knower and the self as
known. Nor can the Brahman be a causal agent. If Brahman is maximally
perfect, it must be unlimited. But it <em>is</em> limited if something
exists outside it. The Brahman must therefore be all there is. If the
Brahman is identical with the whole of reality, though, and Brahman
contains no plurality, then reality as a whole is an undifferentiated
unity. The space-time world with its distinctions between times,
places, and events is consequently unreal. <em>Real</em> causal
relations are relations between two real things, however. So Brahman
is neither the cause of the space-time world as a whole nor of the
events in it, and is thus neither the space-time world's creator nor
its ruler. It follows from these considerations that Brahman is
neither an omniscient mind nor an omnipotent and active will. It
cannot be a maximally perfect <em>person</em>, therefore, and so
cannot be <em>God</em>.</p>

<p>

Advaita does contain what might be called “theistic
elements.” For example, it distinguishes the nirguna from the
saguna Brahman.  The former is the Brahman without attributes. The
latter is the Brahman with attributes, and is roughly described in the
way that theists describe God.  The nirguna Brahman is the
Brahman <em>as it really is</em>, however, while the saguna Brahman is
ultimately illusory. The concept of the saguna Brahman is a useful
tool for those who are still on their spiritual journey but is finally
cast aside by the fully enlightened. Yet even though Advaita believes
that, like all conceptualizations of the Brahman, the idea of an
omnipotent, omniscient, and all good cause of the space-time world is
ultimately false, they regard it as superior to others. Furthermore,
Advaita describes the <em>real</em> Brahman as an infinite, joyous
consciousness (albeit a consciousness that has no objects or contents
and is thus “empty”). Because Advaita refuses to ascribe
either knowledge or activity to ultimate reality, though, it is
essentially non-theistic. Its maximally perfect reality isn't the God
of the theistic traditions—all powerful, all knowing, all good,
the sovereign lord of heaven and earth. It is instead an
“infinite ocean” of joyous empty
consciousness—impersonal, inactive, and anonymous.</p>

<p>

Some schools of Vedanta are theistic, however, and their response to
Advaita is instructive. Vishishtadvaita Vedanta, for example,
maintains that Brahman is personal and, indeed, the <em>supreme</em>
person (paramatman)—creator and lord (ishvara) who leads the
world's creatures to salvation. Far from being devoid of attributes,
Brahman (which Vishishtadvaita identifies with Vishnu) is the sum of
all “<em>noble</em>” attributes—omniscient,
omnipotent, omnipresent, and all merciful.</p>

<p>

What accounts for this difference?  In part, the suspicion that the
Advaitin account of a maximally great reality is incoherent.  Ramanuja
(1017?-1137?), for instance, argued that Advaita's conception of the
Brahman is logically incoherent because it conceives of Brahman as a
substance without properties whereas, <em>by definition</em>, a
substance is what <em>has</em> or <em>underlies</em>
properties. Furthermore, because cognitively grasping something
involves classifying or identifying it as a thing of a certain kind,
and things are classified or identified on the basis of their
properties, one can't cognitively grasp a thing without properties. It
follows that the Advaitin's Brahman can't be known, and that Advaita
itself thus doesn't know it. Finally, Ramanuja argued that the denial
of the reality of distinctions undercuts Advaita's appeal to
scripture. If the scriptures are valid, then some language accurately
describes reality (for scriptural language does so). But language
necessarily involves distinctions (between subject and verb, noun and
adjective, and the like) and so, if any language accurately describes
reality, some distinctions must be real. Therefore, if distinctions
<em>aren't</em> real (as Advaita maintains), the scriptures it appeals
to aren't valid.</p>

<p>

Advaitins aren't without recourse, of course. For example, they will
deny that they are construing Brahman as a substance without
properties. Since, in their view, <em>no</em> concept applies to the
Brahman, neither the concept of a property <em>nor</em> the concept of
substance applies to it. Again, even if <em>conceptual</em> cognition
necessarily involves classification or identification, Advaitins will
insist that not all cognition is conceptual. The fact that Brahman
can't be conceptually cognized thus doesn't entail that it can't be
known.  The important point in the present connection however, is that
the Vishishtadvaitin's and Advaitin's disagreements on these issues
are rooted in basic differences in metaphysics and
epistemology—whether a reality without properties is possible,
for instance, and whether cognition involves at least some conceptual
content.</p>

<p>

Other differences are even more fundamental. All the Vedantin schools
profess to elucidate the true meaning of a common set of
scriptures—the Brahma Sutras, the Bhagavad Gita and,
preeminently, the Vedas (especially their last part, the
Upanishads). In practice, though, both theistic and non-theistic
Vedantins privilege some texts over others. Advaitins, privilege the
Isha and other non-theistic Upanishads and interpret theistic sounding
texts in their light. Theistic Vedantins, on the other hand, privilege
the Bhagavad Gita and theistic Upanishads such as the Shvetashvatara
Upanishad, taking these texts pretty much at face value, and then
explaining away apparent inconsistencies between their privileged
texts and others which, on their face, seem clearly non-theistic.</p>

<p>

These differences are themselves rooted in fundamental differences in
spiritual practice. </p>

<p>

Advaitins, for example, emphasize ascetic practices designed to
existentially appropriate the truth of the “great words”of
scripture such as “Thou art that [you are the Brahman],”
“All that is is one only,” or “All is one without
distinction,” and place a high value on “monistic”
mystical experiences—joyous states of consciousness in which the
mind is emptied of contents and distinctions disappear. While these
experiences aren't the aim of the Advaitin's quest, they are more or
less explicitly regarded as a model of the unifying and transfiguring
Brahman-knowledge that is the goal of their religious
journey. Theistic Vedantins, on the other hand, were Vaishnavas
(devotees of Vishnu), and their attitudes, outlook, and actions were
profoundly shaped by devotional practices designed to express and
cultivate love of, and surrender to, Vishnu. While theistic Vedantins
did not deny the reality of monistic mystical consciousness, they
downplayed its significance for, in their view, the ultimate aim of
the religious life is an ecstatic and permanent loving union with God
(Vishnu).</p>

<p>

In short, while Advaitins and theistic Vedantins agree that the proper
object of ultimate concern is maximally great, they disagree on just
how maximal greatness should be construed. This disagreement, in turn,
is rooted in metaphysical and epistemological disagreements, in
differences in scriptural interpretation, and in differences in
religious practice and aspiration. The most fundamental difference,
however, is, arguably, a difference in evaluation. Theistic Vedantins
prize love in a way in which Advaitins do not. Since love is a
relation between persons, it is not surprising that, in their view,
maximal greatness necessarily includes personhood.</p>

<p>

But while theists agree that a maximally great reality must be a
transcendently great person, they sometimes disagree over just what
other attributes maximal greatness includes. Most theists do think
that God is omnipresent, omniscient, omnipotent, and all good,
although there are disagreements over just how these attributes should
be construed. Other differences are more radical. I will illustrate
this point by examining the debate over God's impassibility in western
theism and a dispute over God's relation to the space-time world in
Indian theism.</p>

<h2><a name="Imp">2. Impassibility</a></h2>

<p>

Most theists agree that God is (in Ramanuja's words) the
“supreme self” or person—omniscient, omnipotent, and
all good. But classical Christian theists have <em>also</em> ascribed
four “metaphysical attributes” to God—simplicity,
timelessness, immutability, and impassibility. The doctrine of
simplicity states that each of God's real or intrinsic properties is
identical with his other real or intrinsic properties, and with his
being or nature.  God's knowledge is identical with his power, for
example, and both are identical with his being. Just as “Thomas
Jefferson” and “the third president of the United
States” have different meanings but refer to the same person, so
“the knowledge of God” and “the power of God,”
although differing in meaning, refer to the same reality, namely, the
infinitely perfect divine life or activity.</p>

<p>

Many classical western theists have also thought that God is
timeless—altogether outside of time. God resembles abstract
objects like numbers or propositions in having no temporal location or
extension. God isn't an abstract object, of course, but an infinitely
perfect life or activity. One shouldn't think of this life and
activity as being in time, however—not even as everlasting. Thus
God timelessly knows and wills that conscious life will emerge on
earth after certain events and before others.  But while temporality
is a property of <em>what</em> God knows and wills, it isn't a
property of God's <em>act</em> of knowledge or will. The objects of
God's knowledge and act of will are in time but God himself and his
activity are not.</p>

<p>

God is also believed to be immutable. Something is immutable if its
real properties can't change. Immutability follows from God's
simplicity. An object undergoes real change when it loses one real
property and/or acquires another. Real change thus entails that some
of the object's real properties aren't identical. (If <em>P</em>,
<em>Q</em>, and <em>R</em> are real properties, and <em>x</em> retains
<em>P</em> through a change but loses <em>Q</em> and acquires
<em>R</em>, then <em>P</em>, <em>Q</em>, and <em>R</em> are different
properties.)  So if God is simple, he can't undergo real change. God's
immutability also follows from his timelessness since change entails a
temporal transition from one state to another.</p>

<p>

Finally, classical western theists have thought that God is
impassible. God creates, sustains, and governs the world.  It depends
on him both for its being and for its qualities. But nothing acts on
God or causally affects him. While the world is affected by God, God
is not affected by it.</p>

<p>

Why think that the metaphysical attributes are perfections?  For
several reasons. Most religious traditions stress the imperfections of
the temporal order. The space-time world is a world in constant
flux. Nothing in it is permanent or secure. All temporal values are
threatened and ultimately lost. In human experience, complexity, time,
change, and dependency are bound up with loss and imperfection. It
thus isn't surprising that religiously sensitive people often conclude
that a maximally perfect reality must be free from them.  Moreover,
this conclusion is reinforced by the experiences of Christian and
other mystics who claim to have glimpsed a divine reality exhibiting
the metaphysical attributes—a holy unity transcending
distinctions and time and change, wholly active and never passive, and
upon which they and everything else are absolutely dependent.</p>

<p>

There are obvious tensions between these themes and other strands of
the Christian tradition, however. Even though the Bible asserts that
God is beginningless and endless, for example, he is depicted as if he
were in time. He is also depicted as changing (although his existence
and character are said to remain constant). In addition, the God of
the Bible not only acts upon his creatures, he is affected by
them—pitying their distress, being angered by their sin,
responding to their petitions, and the like. These considerations
aren't conclusive of course since even the most scripturally centered
theists agree that not everything in the Biblical pictures can be
taken literally. God isn't literally jealous, for instance, nor does
he literally repent of his former actions. So perhaps those features
of the Biblical picture of God which seem inconsistent with God's
possessing metaphysical attributes can also be interpreted as
metaphors or analogies or symbols. Other difficulties are more
serious, however.  God's personality is essential to theism, and many
wonder whether personhood is compatible with simplicity, timelessness,
immutability, and impassibility. One may also wonder whether a God
with these attributes is the God of popular devotion. We will explore
this question by examining the attribute of impassibility in more
depth.</p>

<p>

According to the doctrine of impassibility, God is not affected by his
creatures. Everything other than God depends upon him for both its
existence and qualities. God himself, though, depends upon
nothing. Critics think this has two unacceptable consequences.</p>

<p>

In the first place, impassibility seems inconsistent with God's
knowledge of the world. Knowledge relates two terms, the knower and
the object he or she knows. Typical instances of the relation exhibit
two important features. First, the act of knowledge involves a real
modification of the knower but not of the object he or she knows. And,
second, the act of knowledge depends on its object while the object of
knowledge does not depend on the subject's knowledge of it. I know,
for example, that the Pittsburgh Steelers won the Superbowl in
2006. But while my knowledge that the Steelers won is a real property
of mine, it is not a real property of the Steelers' victory. Knowing
that the Steelers won the Superbowl really modifies me (I am
internally different than I would have been if I did not know that
they had won); it does not modify or make a real difference to the
Steelers' winning. Moreover, my knowledge that the Steelers won
depends on the Steelers having won whereas the Steelers' winning does
not depend on my knowledge of it.</p>

<p>

But if God is impassible, his knowledge of the world can't be like
that. For the doctrine of impassibility implies that God's real
properties depend on nothing other than himself.  So if God's
knowledge of the world is a real property of God (as theists have
usually thought), it cannot depend on its object and is thus very
different from paradigmatic instances of knowledge like the one
discussed in the previous paragraph. </p>

<p>

One way of handling this difficulty is to claim that everything other
than God is determined by him. Many theists believe that it is. Madhva
(whom we will discuss later), orthodox Muslims, Augustine, Luther,
Calvin, and some Thomists are examples. In their view, God knows that
the Steelers won the Superbowl in 2006 because he eternally decreed
that they would. God's knowledge of their victory is an aspect or
consequence of his willing it and thus doesn't depend on it.</p>

<p>

However, other theists believe that God does not fully determine
everything. In their view some of our actions are free in the
metaphysical libertarian's sense. They lack sufficient causes, and
thus aren't determined either by antecedent natural conditions
<em>or</em> by God's decrees. If they aren't, God can't know them in
knowing his decrees.  So, in this case at least, God's knowledge
appears to depend upon its object. But if it does, God cannot be
impassible. (It should be noted that this difficulty can't be evaded
by appealing to the doctrine of middle knowledge.
  <!-- (See the entry on
  <a href="../omniscience/">omniscience</a>.) -->
 For even though God's knowledge of our free actions does not depend
upon those actions on this view, it <em>does</em> depend upon his
knowledge of what creatures would freely do in various circumstances
in which he might place them, and the truth of subjunctive
conditionals like “If Adam were placed in the Garden of Eden, he
would freely sin,” while contingent, is not determined by
God.)</p>

<p>

The second and more pressing problem for the doctrine of divine
impassibility, however, is this. All theists describe God as
compassionate. Each chapter of the <em>Quran</em>, for instance,
begins with the words “In the name of Allah, the compassionate
and merciful.” Yet if God really is compassionate, then it would
seem that his knowledge of free actions isn't the only divine property
that depends upon the world, for his affective states do so as
well. God isn't aloof or unmoved by our distress but shares our griefs
as we share those of people we love. His joy is thus tempered by
sympathetic sorrow. The degree and quality of God's happiness is
partly determined by the state of sentient creatures.</p>

<p>

Charles Hartshorne, for instance, has argued that while certain forms
of independence are admirable others are not. “One should not
simply agree to every whim of [one's] child,” for example,
“but neither should one try to act and think and feel just as
one would have acted or thought or felt had the child's joy been
sorrow, or her sorrow joy…” Nor is there anything
admirable about a happiness that is unaffected by the sorrows of
others. We don't admire people who “can be equally happy and
serene and joyous regardless of how men and women suffer around”
them. (Hartshorne: 43–44) <em>Human</em> sympathies are
necessarily limited, of course. But a <em>perfect</em> being would be
<em>maximally</em> responsive to the joys and sufferings of other. If
it is, it could not be impassible.</p>

<p>

Classical Christian theology provides several attempts to reconcile
God's compassion with his impassibility. Thus, Anselm argued that
while God acts <em>as if</em> he were compassionate, he does not
<em>experience</em> compassion. “For when You look upon us in
our misery it is we who feel the effect of Your mercy, but You do not
experience the feeling. Therefore you are both merciful because You
save the sorrowful and pardon sinners against You; and You are not
merciful because You do not experience any feeling of compassion for
misery.” (Anselm: chapter viii) This seems unsatisfactory,
however, for a compassion without feeling isn't real compassion. A
recognition of this may have led Bernard of Clairvaux and Thomas
Aquinas to offer their own, rather different, solutions.</p>

<p>

Bernard claimed that while God neither suffers nor experiences
compassion in his own nature, he <em>does</em> suffer and experience
compassion in the human nature that he assumes at the Incarnation. God
became man so that he might “learn by his own experience how to
commiserate and sympathize with those who are…suffering and
tempted.” (Bernard: chapter 3). Bernard's solution is superior
to Anselm's because it implicitly recognizes that compassion
necessarily includes feeling or emotion. It isn't available to
non-Christian theists, however, and fails to locate compassion in the
divine nature itself.</p>

<p>

Thomas Aquinas's solution does so. Some emotions can be literally
(albeit analogically) ascribed to God. Love and joy are
examples. Other emotions such as anger and sorrow cannot.  What
accounts for this difference?  Love and joy are “pure
perfections” (good-making properties that entail no
imperfection). As such they can be literally ascribed to God although
the mode in which God experiences them differs from that in which we
do so. (God's love and joy are purely active emotions, qualifications
of his will. Our love and joy, on the other hand, are both actions
<em>and</em> passions, partly voluntary and partly involuntary
reactions of our animal nature.)</p>

<p>

Anger and sorrow can be appropriate, and hence good-making, qualities
of the person who experiences them. But they are not <em>pure</em>
perfections because they entail perturbation and suffering. They
cannot, then, be literally ascribed to God.  Even so, compassionate
sorrow differs from anger. When God acts as a justifiably angry person
would we can ascribe anger to God metaphorically. But nothing
<em>in</em> God (no internal modification of God) corresponds to the
feeling or emotion of anger in us. By contrast, “God is said to
be saddened in so far as certain things take place contrary to what He
loves and approves.” (Aquinas: Book One, chapter 7, #17) Hence,
while God doesn't literally grieve with us, there is something
<em>in</em> God that we apprehend as sorrow, namely, his love.  For
Aquinas, “God is compassionate” not only entails that God
acts as a compassionate person would (as it does for Anselm), it also
entails that those actions are expressions of a divine emotion or
“feeling state”—an emotion or feeling state which
qualifies the divine nature itself, and not just the assumed
<em>human</em> nature (as Bernard thought).</p>

<p>

While Aquinas's solution is superior to those of Anselm and Bernard,
it does have problems. Aquinas's distinction between anger and
compassion may be specious, since it seems that both could be treated
in the same way. Since God's righteousness or love of justice is a
pure perfection we can ascribe it to God literally. God's anger can
then be interpreted as the way God's righteousness is apprehended by
those who have rejected him or recognize that he has been
rejected. God not only acts as a justifiably angry person would act,
those acts are the expression of an internal modification (namely, his
love of justice) which is a real property of God's own being. A more
important problem, though, may be the fact that the emotion or feeling
state which grounds God's acts of compassion, according to Aquinas,
isn't literally tinged with sorrow. For it is at least doubtful that a
“compassion” that doesn't include sympathetic
<em>suffering</em> is really compassion.</p>

<p>

The most important point in the present connection, however, is
this. The debate between modern theists like Hartshorne, on the one
hand, and classical theists like Aquinas, on the other, revolves
around the following question: Can a maximally perfect being be
touched by suffering? Hartshorne thinks it must since a maximally
perfect being would be maximally responsive to the joys and sorrows of
others, and would therefore grieve with all who grieve. Friedrich von
Hügel, on the other hand, speaks for the tradition when he says
that not only is suffering intrinsically evil, it is inconsistent with
unalloyed goodness and perfect joy. God is “Perfect Love,
Unmixed Joy, Entire Delectation…We will not admit the presence
of any Evil, be it sin or even only sorrow, be they actual or even
only potential, in Him Who thus dwarfs for us all our little human
goodness and earthly joy by his utter Sanctity and sheer
Beatitude.” (von Hügel: 208–09) The controversy over
God's impassibility is thus ultimately rooted in a clash of value
intuitions, a deep disagreement over what properties God must have to
be unqualifiedly admirable and worthy of worship.</p>

<h2><a name="TheVedGodRelWor">3. Theistic Vedanta and God's Relation to the World</a></h2>

<p>

Our second example of how a dispute over what constitutes maximal
greatness can affect one's concept of God is furnished by a
disagreement between the great Vishishtadvaitin, Ramanuja, and the
founder of the Dvaita school of Vedanta, Madhva (1197–1276).</p>

<p>

Vishishtadvaita maintains that God is related to the world as the soul
(jivatman) is related to its body. According to Ramanuja, bodies are
“absolutely dependent” upon their souls. A soul-body
relationship is a relation between (1) support and thing supported
(bodies are incapable of separate existence), (2) controller and thing
controlled, and (3) “principal” (sheshin) and
“accessory” (shesha). (“The accessory is that whose
[whole] nature is…to render due glory to…the
principal.” [Ramanuja, quoted in Lipner: 131], that which can
fulfill itself only in serving its principal. Examples of
principal-accessory relationships are the relation between an owner
and his or her disposable property and the relation between a master
and “born servant.”) The point of saying that bodies are
related to souls as supported to support and controlled to controller
is that bodies are ontologically and epistemically dependent on
souls. They can neither exist nor act apart from them, and they can
only be understood in relation to them. The point of saying that
bodies are related to souls as accessory to principal is that bodies
are also <em>evaluatively</em> dependent on their souls—they
have no worth apart from their relation to them.</p>

<p>

To say that the world is God's body, then, is to say that God is the
world's support, controller, and principal. Just as bodies are
absolutely dependent on their souls, so the world is absolutely
dependent on God. And, in fact, the dependence in the latter case is
even more complete than it is in the former. For souls need bodies to
accomplish their purposes whereas God does <em>not</em> need the
world. (In support of this contention, Ramanuja quotes the Bhagavad
Gita: “I am the supporter of all beings; they are of no help to
me at any time.” [Lott: 49]) Moreover, human bodies enjoy a
certain temporary and limited independence when death separates them
from their souls. The world's dependence on God, on the other hand, is
complete.  The upshot is that the body-soul relation is only fully
exemplified by the world-God relation. The world is absolutely
dependent on God; God in no way depends upon it. (It is worth noting
that classical western theism's principal objections to the claim that
the world is God's body—that it makes God dependent on the world
and subject to its imperfections—aren't relevant to Ramanuja's
position. For, in the latter's view, not only does the dependence
relation run only one way [from body to soul and not vice versa], but
the body's defects do not affect the soul.)</p>

<p>

Ramanuja and Madhva were both theists, both Vedantins, and both
Vaishnavas (that is, both identified God with Vishnu), sharing a
common allegiance to the same set of scriptures and engaging in
similar religious practices. Yet in spite of these similarities, the
flavor of their views is quite different. The central motif of
Madhva's theology is God's infinite majesty, utter transcendence, and
absolute sovereignty: “What is incompatible with the divine
sovereignty should be rejected. Inconsistency with the divine majesty
is itself the criterion of what is unworthy of acceptance.”
(Madhva, quoted in Lott: 58) This motif works itself out in a number
of ways. For example, while Ramanuja has a very strong doctrine of
grace, he appears to allow some room for libertarian free will. Madhva
does not. From eternity souls have different qualities or
potentialities (different “aptitudes”). Because of the
eternal difference in their qualities and potentialities, souls have
different destinies. Some (those with “an innate aptitude for
good”) are destined for various levels of bliss. Others (those
with “an innate aptitude for evil”) are destined for
different levels of suffering. (Thus Dvaita is one of the few Hindu
schools with something like a doctrine of eternal damnation. Some
souls are permanently bound to this world with its endless cycle of
births and rebirths.)  The important point is that these differences
in the souls' qualities and potentialities (“aptitudes”)
are determined by God's will.  Hence, says Madhva, “The Lord is
the real doer, and the cause of the soul's activity.” (Quoted in
Lott: 114) Everything depends upon the divine will, and salvation is
through grace alone. (It should be noted that Madhva's view was
modified by some of his followers. Thus Vyasa Raya [1460–1539]
insisted that because innate aptitudes for good or for evil are
beginningless, they are not caused by God.)</p>

<p>

Madhva's most striking departure from Ramanuja, however, is his
absolute rejection of the notion that the world is God's body. In
Madhva's opinion, the Vishishtadvaitin view compromises God's
transcendence and independence. The relation between God and the world
isn't a relation between a soul and its body but between a sovereign
will and its effect.  “He is the supreme Lord by whose grace
exist matter, action (<em>karma</em>), time, nature and souls, and by
whose displeasure all these cease to exist.” (Quoted in Lott:
111) However, surprisingly (from a western perspective at least),
Madhva thinks that while prakriti (the material or stuff out of which
the space-time world is composed), time, space, and souls derive their
<em>qualities</em> from God, they don't derive their
<em>existence</em> or substantial being from him. God's being and
activity explain why spatio-temporal things have the properties they
do but doesn't explain why they exist in the first place.</p>

<p>

Ramanuja, by contrast, thinks that it does. Because bodies depend upon
souls for their existence, and the world is God's body, the world
depends upon God for its being as well as for its qualities. The
world's dependence upon God is thus more complete in Ramanuja's
theology than it is in Madhva's.</p>

<p>

What accounts for this difference?  Why, in particular, does Madhva
adopt a position which seems inconsistent with his emphasis on God's
absolute sovereignty?  The answer appears to Madhva's equally emphatic
insistence on God's transcendence and independence.</p>

<p>

Indian thought tended to assume that the cause of a thing's being or
existence must be a kind of material or substratum (a “material
cause”) which is then shaped or formed to make it an existent
being of a particular sort—an existent elephant, for example, or
an existent earth or water atom. The substratum is the cause of a
thing's being or existence; the process of shaping or forming is the
cause of its being a particular <em>kind</em> of being or existent,
that is, of its having one set of qualities rather than
another. (Thus, the potter's activity causes the clay to be a
<em>pot</em>; but the clay gives the pot its being or existence.)  If
God were the cause of the existence of the world as well as the cause
of its qualities (that is, if he were its material as well as its
efficient cause), then God would be the world's substratum. (As he in
a sense is for Ramanuja. Prakriti is the world's substratum, and
prakriti, according to Ramanuja, is an aspect of God's body.)  But
this is inconsistent with God's transcendence and independence of the
world. If God is truly perfect, then, he cannot be the cause of the
world's existence.</p>

<p>

This example is particularly instructive because it illustrates how an
emphasis on different aspects of God's perfection (the absolute
dependence of everything other than God on God, on the one hand, and
God's transcendence and independence, on the other) can cause
theologians with otherwise quite similar views to draw very different
conclusions about God.</p>

<h2><a name="LimDei">4. Limited Deities</a></h2>

<p>

Are limited deities counter examples to this entry's claim that
religious consciousness tends to construe ultimate reality as
maximally perfect?  Most apparent counter examples are merely
apparent. The limited deity is either not thought to be ultimate or it
isn't really believed to be limited (that is, less perfect than a
being could possibly be). The following two examples illustrate these
possibilities.</p>

<p>

Plato introduced the concept of the demiurge (from the Greek
<em>demiourgos</em>, meaning “artisan” or
“craftsman”) in his <em>Timaeus</em>. Being perfectly
good, the demiurge wishes to communicate his own goodness. Using the
Forms as a model, he shapes the initial chaos into the best possible
image of these eternal and immutable archetypes. The visible world is
the result. The demiurge is the highest god and the best of causes. He
is nonetheless limited. For the material he shapes isn't created by
him and, because it is disorderly and indeterminate, partially resists
his ordering. The demiurge is not ultimate, however, since his
ontological and axiological status is lower than that of the Forms,
especially the Form of the Good. Plato's concept of the demiurge thus
isn't a counter example to the thesis that religious consciousness
tends to construe <em>ultimate</em> reality as maximally perfect.</p>

<p>

The God of process philosophy illustrates the second
possibility. While differences among process philosophers make
generalizations difficult, its critics accuse its God of being a mere
demiurge, one power among others who, while influencing everything,
controls nothing. Whether God, rather than the process of becoming of
which God is a part, is ultimate in this system is a moot point. More
important for our purposes, however, is the fact that the God of the
most theologically interesting process philosopher <em>is</em> thought
to be maximally perfect. Charles Hartshorne agrees that God's power
and knowledge are limited. While God influences everything that
transpires he neither determines nor controls it. Nor does God know
with any certainty just what the future holds in store.  But
Hartshorne denies that these “limitations” are
imperfections. In his view, persuasion or influence is a better or
more perfect form of power than control, and knowledge of the
contingent future is metaphysically impossible. Although God's power
and knowledge <em>are</em> limited, they are as perfect as power and
knowledge could possibly be. If a maximally perfect being is the most
perfect <em>possible</em> being, then God <em>is</em> maximally
perfect.</p>

<p>

John Stuart Mill's picture of God, on the other hand, may constitute a
genuine counter example to the thesis that conceptions of God are
attempts to articulate the concept of a maximally great ultimate
reality. Mill believes that there is some evidence for the existence
of a “demiourgos” of enormous power and intelligence, and
some benevolence. But because nature's contrivances are imperfect,
because omnipotence could altogether dispense with contrivances,
and because organisms are principally contrived for the mere persistence
of the individual or species and not for pleasure or happiness,
the evidence not only fails to point to a being of unlimited
power, intelligence, and benevolence, it is actually
incompatible with it. Still, the evidence <em>is</em>
compatible with the existence of a being of limited power and/or
intelligence but <em>unlimited</em> benevolence. Furthermore, there are good
pragmatic reasons for imaginatively dwelling on the possibility that
such a being exists, and for hoping that it does. For <em>if</em> the
demiurge's benevolence is infinite then, given its enormous power and
intelligence, there is some reason to think that death will not have
the last word and that good will eventually get the upper hand over
evil. And “the beneficial effect” of this “hope with
regard to the government of the universe and the destiny of man after
death…is far from trifling. It makes life and human nature a
far greater thing to the feelings and gives greater strength as well
as a great solemnity to all” our nobler sentiments and to our
resolve to “cultivate the improvement of character up to the end
of life.” Furthermore, “there is another and a most
important exercise of the imagination which…has been kept up
principally by means of religious belief” which reinforces the
first, and which Mill not only countenances but endorses since
“human excellence greatly depends upon the sufficiency of the
provision made for it”—“the idealization of our
standard of excellence in a person.” (Mill: 81–82)</p>

<p>

Does Mill's position provide a counter example to our thesis?  The
answer isn't entirely straightforward. On the one hand, Mill doesn't
<em>begin</em> with the idea of a maximally great reality as mature
religious consciousness normally does, and then—given his
metaphysical, empirical, and evaluative commitments—ask
<em>how</em> maximal greatness should be construed On the other hand,
Mill's reflections on religion <em>are</em> shaped from their
beginning by his conceptions of value—of what is truly
“God-befitting” or worthy of admiration and
emulation. But, for Mill what matters for humankind's spiritual growth
and development are ideals of <em>moral</em>, not metaphysical
perfection.  It isn't surprising, then, that in spite of the fact that
Mill's divinity isn't maximally perfect <em>tout court</em>, it is
maximally <em>morally</em> perfect. In short, while Mill's reflections
on God aren't driven by a concept of maximal perfection simpliciter,
they are importantly driven by a concept of maximal moral
perfection.</p>
