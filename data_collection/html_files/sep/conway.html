<h1>Lady Anne Conway</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Thu Feb 13, 2003; substantive revision Fri Mar 7, 2014</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>

Lady Anne Conway (nee Anne Finch) was one of a tiny minority of
seventeenth-century women who was able to pursue an interest in
philosophy. She was associated with the Cambridge Platonists,
particularly Henry More (1614-1687). Her only surviving treatise,
<em>Principles of the Most Ancient and Modern Philosophy</em>, was published
posthumously and anonymously in 1690. This propounds an ontology of
spirit, derived from the attributes of God, which she sets out in
opposition to More, Descartes, Hobbes and Spinoza. Her concept of the
monad, which is indebted to the Kabbalism, anticipates Leibniz.

<h2><a name="1">1. Life</a></h2>

<p>

Lady Anne Conway (n√©e Finch) (1631-1679) was the posthumous
daughter of Sir Heneage Finch and his second wife Elizabeth Cradock,
widow of Sir John Bennet. She was born in London in 1631, and raised in
the house now known as Kensington Palace, which then belonged to the
Finch family. The youngest child in a large family, she was especially
close to her half-brother, John Finch. Nothing is known of her
education, though she was clearly well-read by the time she made the
acquaintance of one of the
 <a href="../cambridge-platonists/">Cambridge Platonists</a>,
 Henry More (1614-1687). Of Anne Conway's remarkable
philosophical education, much more is known. Thanks to her brother, who
was his pupil at Christ's College, University of Cambridge, More agreed
to give her instruction in philosophy. Since, as a woman, she was
debarred from attending the university, he instructed her by letter.
The few letters that survive from this early correspondence indicate
that Cartesianism formed the basis of the course of instruction she
followed. Thereafter, Anne Conway and More remained friends for the
rest of her life. By this means she had a permanent link to
intellectual life beyond the confines of her domestic situation.</p>

<p>

In 1651 Anne Conway married Edward, third Viscount Conway, who was
heir to estates in Warwickshire and County Antrim in Ireland. Their one
child, Heneage, died in infancy. The Conway family possessed one of the
finest private libraries of the period, and her husband appears to have
encouraged his wife's intellectual interests. However, from her teens
she suffered from periodic bouts of illness, which became more acute
and more frequent as she got older. It was as a result of a search for
relief from this that she came into contact with the Flemish physician
and philosopher, Francis Mercury van Helmont, son of the iatrochemist,
Jan Baptiste van Helmont. During the last decade of her life, the
younger Van Helmont lived in her household. It was through Van Helmont
that Anne Conway was introduced to kabalistic thought and to Quakerism.
These encounters resulted in radical new departures for her: on
the one hand, her study of the Jewish kabbalah contributed to her
decisive break with the Cartesianism of her philosophical upbringing;
on the other hand, her encounter with Van Helmont's Quaker friends led
to her conversion to Quakerism, shortly before she died in 1679.</p>

<h2><a name="2">2. Philosophy</a></h2>

<p>

Anne Conway is known to be the author of a single treatise of
philosophy. This was written at the end of her life and published
anonymously in Amsterdam in 1690 in a Latin translation with the title,
<em>Principia philosophiae antiquissimae et recentissimae</em>. It was
translated back into English and printed in London in 1692 as <em>The
Principles of the Most Ancient and Modern Philosophy</em>. The other source
for her philosophical activities is her correspondence with Henry More.</p>

<p>

Anne Conway's treatise is a work of Platonist metaphysics in which
she derives her system of philosophy from the existence and attributes
of God. The framework of Conway's system is a tripartite ontological
hierarchy of ‚Äòspecies‚Äô, the highest of which is God, the
source of all being. Christ, or ‚Äòmiddle nature‚Äô, links God
and the third species, called ‚ÄòCreature‚Äô. God as the most
perfect being is infinitely good, wise and just. A principle of
likeness links God and creation. Since God is good and just, his
creation too is good and just. Created substance, like God, consists of
spirit, but, unlike God, is constituted of particles called monads. All
created substance is living, capable of motion and perception. Anne
Conway denies the existence of material body as such, arguing that
inert corporeal substance would contradict the nature of God, who is
life itself. Incorporeal created substance is, however, differentiated
from the divine, principally on account of its mutability and
multiplicity even so, the infinite number and constant mutability of
created monads constitute an obverse reflection of the unity, infinity,
eternity and unchangeableness of God. The continuum between God and
creatures is made possible through ‚Äòmiddle nature‚Äô, an
intermediary being, through which God communicates life, action,
goodness and justice. ‚ÄòMiddle nature‚Äô, partakes of the
nature of both God and creation, and is therefore both a bridge and a
buffer between God and created things. Thus, although she conceives of
created substance as a continuum, and understands mutability as
capacity for increased perfection, she sought to avoid the charge of
pantheism. The spiritual perfectionism of Anne Conway's system has dual
aspect: metaphysical and moral. On the one hand all things are capable
of becoming more spirit-like, that is, more refined qua spiritual
substance. At the same time, all things are capable of increased
goodness. She explains evil as a falling away from the perfection of
God, and understands suffering as part of a longer term process of
spiritual recovery. She denies the eternity of hell, since for God to
punish finite wrong-doing with infinite and eternal hell punishment
would be manifestly unjust and therefore a contradiction of the divine
nature. Instead she explains pain and suffering as purgative, with the
ultimate aim of restoring creatures to moral and metaphysical
perfection. Anne Conway's system is thus not just an ontology and but a
theodicy.</p>

<p>

Anne Conway presents her system as an answer to the dominant
philosophies of her time. Several chapters of her treatise are devoted
to a refutation of the dualism of Henry More, and Descartes. (She does,
however, express her admiration for Descartes' physics). She also takes
issue with Hobbes and Spinoza, whom she charges with material
pantheism, which confounds God and created substance. Anne Conway's
concept of substance probably owes much to Platonism and Kabbalism
(which, in the version she encountered was heavily Platonised). Her
thinking also shows the impact of the teachings of the heterodox
Christian theologian, Origen, who was much admired by her teacher,
Henry More. As a theodicy and monadology, her system anticipates the
philosophy of Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, who owned a copy of her
treatise (probably a gift to him by their mutual friend, Van Helmont),
and who received her work favourably. However, although she was unusual
as a female philosopher of the seventeenth century, by virtue of the
fact that her philosophy achieved publication, the anonymity of her
work has ensured that she has suffered the same neglect that has been
the lot of most pre-modern female philosophers.</p>
