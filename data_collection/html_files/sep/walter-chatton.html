<h1>Walter Chatton</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Tue Jun 20, 2006; substantive revision Fri Jun 22, 2018</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p> 
Walter Chatton or more rarely “Catton”
(c. 1290–1343) was an English theologian and philosopher who
trained at Oxford around the same time as his famous colleague and
frequent philosophical target, William of Ockham. More inclined to
speculative metaphysics and less skeptical of reason than Ockham,
Chatton was one of the most energetic and gifted critics of the
influential brand of nominalism which arose in early
fourteenth-century England around Ockham. As a constructive
philosopher, Chatton was not a system-builder, but a defender of
certain parts of the more systematic philosophy of John Duns Scotus,
and an advocate of perspectivist accounts of cognition. Historically
he is an interesting figure because he combined the realist tendencies
of Scotism with the appreciation of logic and language we see in
Ockham; thus it is common to find Chatton defending Scotistic
theses and criticizing Ockham using the same sorts of semantic ideas
that Ockham himself popularized. His unyielding attacks on Ockham bore
him fruit intellectually and otherwise: we have evidence of
Ockham changing his mind on several seminal issues as a direct result
of Chatton’s critiques. Moreover, he seems to have built a very
successful ecclesiastical career, no doubt based in part on his
cleverness; he served as an advisor to two popes, and earned for
himself, but did not live long enough to enjoy, a bishopric in Wales.
His stature as a theologian rose high enough in his lifetime that his
opinions on sacramental efficacy were remembered and cited at the
Council of Trent, two hundred years after his death.</p>

<p>

Although his importance has long been known to Ockham specialists,
complete critical editions of his work have only recently become
available, and detailed scholarly analysis of his views, influence,
and intellectual life are in a nascent stage. Consequently, this
article will not summarize his positions under broad, modern headings
such as ‘metaphysics’, ‘epistemology’, etc.,
but will rather present exposition and analysis of his contributions
to several narrower problems which remain philosophically viable
today.</p>

<div id="main-text">

<h2 id="Life">1. Life</h2>

<p>

Chatton’s life and career can be divided into four 
 stages.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-1" id="ref-1">1</a>]</sup></p>

<p>

<strong>Childhood, ordination, and philosophical training (birth to
1315)</strong>. Walter Chatton was born between 1285 and 1290 in the small
village of Chatton, just west of Durham, in the far north of modern
England. He entered the Franciscan Order before the age of 14, and was
ordained a subdeacon on 20 May, 1307. He very likely received his early
education and philosophical training in the north as well.</p>

<p>

<strong>Early bachelor of theology studies (1315 to 1321)</strong>.
During this period Chatton finished his early education and was sent
south to Oxford to study theology. There he came in contact with
William of Ockham who was lecturing at Oxford at this same time, although
at a slightly more advanced career stage. Chatton began to oppose
Ockham very early and very vocally, and this opposition was to last
the entire duration of his Oxford career (i.e., into the early
1330s).</p>

<p>

<strong>Advanced bachelor studies and regency (1321 to 1332)</strong>.
We have the least amount of hard biographical data for this period,
although it is clearly the most interesting and intense intellectual
period of his life. Textual evidence allows us to argue with varying
degrees of certainty that four of his five extant
works – <em>Reportatio</em>, <em>Lectura</em> (which includes the
separately edited <em>Collatio et
Prologus</em>), <em>Quodlibet</em>, <em>De paupertate evangelica</em>,
and <em>Sermo de visione beatifica</em> – were written during
this 
 period.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-2" id="ref-2">2</a>]</sup> We
have long possessed reasonable dates (although they are wide, in one
case) for the first two of these works: he probably delivered
his <em>Reportatio</em> lectures during the academic biennium
1321–23, and his <em>Lectura</em> must have been written between
1324 and 1330.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-3" id="ref-3">3</a>]</sup>
The first three works listed above are of primary philosophical
importance in his corpus. During this period Chatton delivered an
important set of lectures in which Ockham’s thought is strenuously criticized
(probably in London), completed his training at Oxford, and attained
the final academic rank marking that achievement, regent master, in
academic year 
 1329–1330.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-4" id="ref-4">4</a>]</sup></p>

<p>

<strong>Later career in Avignon, and death (1332 to 1343/4)</strong>.
Chatton is known to have been in Avignon on 17 January, 1333. He was
summoned there in order to participate in hearings against Thomas
Waleys, and eventually he served as an advisor to Pope Benedict XII.
His career took an excellent upward turn in 1343 when he was appointed
bishop of the Welsh See of Asaph, but this good fortune reversed itself
when it turned out the position was not really vacant. That winter,
earthly good fortune gave up on Chatton completely, and he died in
Avignon, late in 1343 or perhaps early
 1344.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-5" id="ref-5">5</a>]</sup></p>

<h2 id="InteWorl">2. Intellectual World</h2>

<p>

Three points should be noted about Chatton’s intellectual
environment. First, the theological context in which Chatton and his
contemporary philosopher-theologians operated was religiously framed
but not intellectually static or sterile. The central metaphysical
tenets of the faith were treated as fixed-points, not hypotheses, but
mediaeval Latin philosophers varied widely in their attitudes, and
much of this variability is easily recognizable to modern
people – there are skeptics, realists, nominalists, etc.</p>

<p>

A second, connected point concerns the genres of mediaeval
philosophical writing. Much of mediaeval philosophy was written in the
form of commentaries or debates with contemporaries (sometimes
polemical, sometimes not). There are no mediaeval ‘research
articles’ and not many systematic, seemingly spontaneous meditations on
philosophical topics by theologians. There was little concern, in
short, with doctrinal or topical originality, broadly speaking.
Rather, to exposit past masters with clarity and ingenuity, to match
wits skillfully with one’s contemporaries – these were the chief
activities of the philosopher-theologians. All Chatton’s written works
were commissioned in an academic or ecclesiastical context, hence all
are in this way theological, but they contain much which almost any
modern person would identify as philosophically interesting and
innovative.</p>

<p>

Third, it is useful to know that Chatton’s immediate academic and
intellectual world was small and intense, shaped mostly by figures and
events at the University of Paris and at Oxford. His primary opponents,
interlocutors, and sources were Aristotle and Augustine among the
ancients, but among contemporaries and near-contemporaries he cites
Thomas Aquinas, John Duns Scotus, William Ockham, Richard Campsall,
Adam Wodeham, and Peter Auriol. In particular, much of his writing is
so shaped by debates against Ockham (some of them conducted not only in
writing but almost certainly face-to-face) that his mature views are
nearly unintelligible in their details apart from Ockham’s philosophy,
and vice versa. Especially illustrative of this interdependence is
Chatton’s anti-Ockhamist ontological principle, often called his
‘anti-razor’.</p>

<h2 id="AntiRazo">3. The Anti-Razor</h2>

<h3 id="OntoComm">3.1 Ontological Commitment</h3>

<p>

Philosophers frequently disagree about what is real. Sometimes they
disagree so profoundly on this matter for so long a time that they see
themselves as members of schools or parties in a conflict, or as part
of larger historical trends that play themselves out over and over in
the history of ideas. For example, some philosophers tend to argue for
all kinds of invisible metaphysical structure in the world – that
numbers, properties, causality, free will, etc., are all entities in
their own right, somehow existing independently of our grasp or use
of them, as real in their own way as the ordinary physical objects we
seem constantly to rely on in daily life. We usually call such people
‘realists’. But others see this outlook as a theoretical
extravagance, a needless proliferation of ontology. We tag
partisans of such views ‘nominalists’.</p>

<p>

It often happens that parties on either side of such debates will seek
leverage against their opponents by articulating higher level rules
meant to govern metaphysics itself – rules meant to apply, not
to the question ‘What is real?’, but instead to the
question ‘What methods of argument are rightly applied to the
question “What is real?”’ In other words, philosophers
sometimes argue not about what is real but about what is the best way
to argue about what is real. The goal is often negative: if a
philosopher does not believe in the existence of some entity

Under the influence of the articulate
twentieth-century American philosopher W. V. O. Quine, this 
issue – when and whether certain facts about language require us to
admit that certain kinds of entities exist – is often referred
to as ‘ontological commitment’.</p>

<p>

Quine himself was a nominalist, as was Ockham. Both of them repudiated
certain realist styles of argumentation in the metaphysics of their
own times. Ockham in particular was so famous for this attitude that
we still discuss reductionary explanatory tendencies under the label
‘Ockham’s razor’ – do not multiply entities beyond
necessity.</p>

<h3 id="ChatPrin">3.2 The Chatton Principle</h3>

<p>

But as it is usually understood today, this is not a principle that
Ockham believed in or defended; neither is it specific enough of a
principle of ontological commitment to attach seriously and
exclusively to one philosopher. Ockham’s actual theory of ontological
commitment was something like this:</p>

<blockquote>No extra-mental distinction among extra-mental things
(<em>res</em>) should be assumed unless it can be proved (a) by
arguments from self-evident premises, or premises of indubitable
experience or, (b) by unquestionable experience of extra-mental things,
or (c) by some infallible authority such as the Bible, the Saints, or
certain Ecclesiastical pronouncements.</blockquote>

<p>

Since it gives negative advice, telling us when not to make a
distinction among things, it is reductive in orientation, and we might
call it one example of a <em>principle of parsimony</em>. Ockham
coupled this attitude to a complex and original theory of how sentences
get to be true. When coupled these two theories yielded interesting
arguments which reject the existence of motion, and of most
relations.</p>

<p>

Chatton seemed to think that relying on this standard would yield
bad results in certain cases; in particular he thought that despite
Ockham’s insistence to the contrary, certain semantic arguments could
be adduced to establish the existence of a restricted class of
relations. He developed his attack on Ockham and supported his own
ontological commitment to real relations with a counter-razor he called
<em>propositio mea</em> = ‘my proposition’ and an <em>ars
respondendi</em> = ‘a method of responding’, and also
simply <em>regula mea</em> = ‘my rule’. I shall call it the
‘Chatton Principle’, to contrast with ‘Ockham’s
Razor’.</p>

<p>

Here is an early general formulation of the Chatton Principle from
<em>Reportatio</em> I, d. 30, q. 1, a. 4:</p>

<ol start="1">

<li>Consider an affirmative proposition, which, when it is verified,
is verified only for things; if three things do not suffice for
verifying it, one has to posit a fourth, and so on in turn [for four
things, or five, etc.]. (<em>Reportatio</em> I, 10–48, paragraph
57, p. 237)</li></ol>

<p>

He states different versions of the Principle in other places, but throughout
his career the basic idea is always the same: we must admit that
there are as many things as are required to make a certain proposition
true.</p>

<p>

Later on, due to the Principle’s increasing importance to him, and
to Ockham’s direct criticisms of it (some of which are recorded, for
example in his <em>Quodlibeta Septem</em> I, 5), Chatton developed a
long defense for the Principle and a richer formulation of it.
The richest formulation of the Principle we have is from
<em>Lectura</em> I, d. 3, q. 1, a. 1:</p>

<ol start="2">

<li>Whenever an affirmative proposition is apt to be
verified for actually existing things, if two things, howsoever they
are present according to arrangement and duration, cannot suffice for
the verification of the proposition while another thing is lacking,
then one must posit that other thing. (<em>Lectura</em> I, d. 3, q. 1, a. 1, paragraph 4, p. 2)</li></ol>

<p>

Similar versions occur in his <em>Collatio et
 Prologus</em>.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-6" id="ref-6">6</a>]</sup></p>

<p>

By itself, this principle is trivial, of course, since anyone would
agree that we should posit as many entities as we need. But there is
more to the theory than this. Chatton explicitly breaks his Principle
into two parts for purposes of justification and for application as
well. His full theory can be thought of as a two-stage meditation on
ontology. Stage one is given in version (2) above. To
summarize stage one, we could say that language can serve as a guide to
ontology in a certain way; setting aside the passage of time and the
occurrence of motion – think of an ‘ontological
snapshot’, if you like – and given a true proposition

Principle says is (1) that the truth-makers of propositions are things
(<em>res</em>), and (2) that, under certain conditions, propositions
are a guide to ontology.</p>

<p>

As noted, this is all well and good as far as it goes; we must posit
as many things in reality as are sufficient to make the proposition
true, when it is true. But all by itself this simply begs the question
of sufficiency. Chatton sees this and so claims therefore that the
Chatton Principle involves a second stage:</p>

<ol start="3">

<li>
Hence it is required to posit a second proposition
… and it is this: those things are not sufficient to account for
the fact that a proposition is true with which it is consistent that,
in whatever way they are present according to arrangement and duration
without a new thing, the proposition would be false. (<em>Lectura</em> I,
d. 3, q. 1, a. 1, paragraph 17, p. 7)</li></ol>

<p>

Here Chatton gives us a test for when a certain number of entities is
insufficient to make a true sentence true. His test is phrased in
terms of the consistency of the falsehood of the proposition and the
existence of certain things without another. By studying other texts
we are able to see that Chatton has in mind a kind of <em>a
priori</em> version of Mill’s methods. We are to imagine, within the
absolute power of God, whether the causal powers attributed to the
kinds of entities in a given ontological snapshot would be sufficient
to make the proposition in question turn out true. If they are not, we
then imagine other entities coming into being, adding each to the
ontological snapshot one at a time, checking to see after each
addition whether the proposition would at that point have to be
true. So long as the insufficiency remains, we add another object to
the picture. We check that the insufficiency remains
via <em>consistency</em>: so long as there remains no manifest
contradiction between the existence of the currently considered
snapshot and the falsehood of the proposition, the insufficiency
remains, and we must continue to posit more things. Given this
method, it would seem to follow that, for any set of entities, if the
causal powers of those entities are found wanting on the basis of
consistency and yet the proposition in question were known to be true,
then another kind of entity, with its attendant causal powers, would
have to exist.</p>

<p>

At this point we might ask what licenses us to conclude that the
entity whose existence Chatton proves is indeed a <em>res</em>? Can’t
propositions get to be true and false for other reasons besides a
<em>res</em> coming to be or passing away? Chatton did not think
they could, at least in most cases, and his Principle exhibits this
commitment in version (2) above; the only way to add to an ontological
snapshot is to add things (<em>res</em>) to the picture. Hence he
relies on and is clearly committed to an assumption which says that if
an existent makes a difference to truth then it must be a real thing
(<em>res</em>). This assumption can be found in Aristotle (e.g.,
<em>Physics</em>, 225a 1–20) and Scotus
(e.g., <em>Ordinatio</em> I d. 30 qq. 1–2, n. 41). Often
called <em>the principle of contradictories</em>, it can be stated as
follows: “There can be no passage from contradictory state to
contradictory state without the generation or corruption of some thing
(<em>res</em>).”</p>

<h3 id="OckhCritChatPrin">3.3 Ockham’s Criticism of the Chatton Principle</h3>

<p>

Ockham explicitly rejects this assumption as needlessly profligate
and it is precisely on this point that he attacked the Chatton 
 Principle.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-7" id="ref-7">7</a>]</sup>
Ockham’s strategy for overcoming Chatton’s (and Scotus’) realist
results is two-fold: (1) he reforms the principle of contradictories by
expansion; and (2) he capitalizes on this expansion by offering an
alternative semantic account (connotation theory) which explains what
happens when a proposition passes from being true to being false.</p>

<p>

Ockham opens up the principle of contradictories by deriving from
the proposition, “There can be no passage from contradictory to
contradictory apart from the generation or corruption (of some
thing)”, the following expansion:</p>

<blockquote>It is impossible for contradictories to be successively
verified for one and the same thing, except (i) on account of local
motion of something, or (ii) on account of the passage of time, or
(iii) on account of the production or destruction of some thing.
(Ockham, <em>Scriptum</em> = <em>OTh IV</em>), I, d. 30, q. 1, p. 396,
lines 8–9)</blockquote>

<p>

Clearly this is just Scotus’ principle of contradictories, expressed
in clause (iii), with clauses (i) and (ii) added by Ockham. The thrust
of Ockham’s alteration is to recognize that there are more ways to
account for change in truth value besides changes in what things there
are; a change in time or a change of location can also explain
it. But, if Ockham’s version is correct and Scotus’s is not, then
Chatton’s plurality argument using his Principle will not go through:
we don’t have to posit that <span class="MathJax_Preview" style="color: inherit;"><span class="MJXp-math" id="MJXp-Span-15"><span class="MJXp-mi MJXp-italic" id="MJXp-Span-16">n</span><span class="MJXp-mo" id="MJXp-Span-17" style="margin-left: 0.267em; margin-right: 0.267em;">+</span><span class="MJXp-mn" id="MJXp-Span-18">1</span></span></span><span class="MathJax MathJax_Processed" id="MathJax-Element-8-Frame" tabindex="0" style=""><nobr><span class="math" id="MathJax-Span-22"><span style="display: inline-block; position: relative; width: 0em; height: 0px; font-size: 103%;"><span style="position: absolute;"><span class="mrow" id="MathJax-Span-23"><span class="mi" id="MathJax-Span-24" style="font-family: MathJax_Math-italic;">n</span><span class="mo" id="MathJax-Span-25" style="font-family: MathJax_Main; padding-left: 0.222em;">+</span><span class="mn" id="MathJax-Span-26" style="font-family: MathJax_Main; padding-left: 0.222em;">1</span></span></span></span></span></nobr></span><script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-8">n + 1</script> things exist if

since the truth may be adequately explained simply by the passage of
time or the occurrence of change. It is absolutely clear that Ockham’s
expansion of the principle of contradictories and Chatton’s
‘howsoever they are present according to arrangement and
duration’ clause in version (2) of the Principle above play off
each other, and in these formulas we see some of the intense mutual
influence between Ockham and Chatton.</p>

<p>

Notice too that Chatton’s clause essentially forces us to hold time
and movement as constants, and only <em>then</em> ask what would make
the true proposition true. In this way, he forces us to see that a
<em>res</em> must in fact be posited in such cases, since there is no
change of place or lapse of time to explain the passage from
contradictory to contradictory. By itself this begs the question
against Ockham, and Chatton’s principle has no general leverage against
Ockham. In the end the Chatton Principle had to be supplemented with
direct attacks on Ockham’s alternative semantics, viz., connotation
theory.</p>

<h2 id="CateUniv">4. Categories and Universals</h2>

<p>
Mediaeval philosophers accepted the ten categories in
Aristotle’s <em>Categories</em>: substance, quantity, quality,
relation, time, place, action, passion, position, and state or
having. They wondered, however, whether categories were categories of
concepts or words or things, on what basis one could arrive at all
ten, and whether Aristotle’s list was exhaustive. Chatton addresses a
number of questions about categories, positioning himself between
Scotus and Ockham. While Scotus argues that the categories are
primarily ontological – there are ten basic extra-mental
essences or natures – and secondarily semantic (conceptual and
linguistic), Ockham argues that the categories are purely
semantic. Like Scotus, Chatton holds that there are ten basic classes
of things, but like Ockham, Chatton insists that the categories are ten
kinds of terms. What is notable about Chatton’s contribution to
theories of categories is that he uses the Chatton Principle to argue
for the ontological classes that underpin the categories.</p>

<h3 id="SemaCate">4.1 Semantic Categories</h3>

<p>
The categories are categories of simple terms, ultimately concepts
(e.g., <em>substance</em>, <em>redness</em>) but also the words of
conventional languages (e.g., ‘substance,’
‘redness’), that pick out extra-mental things of various
kinds. Chatton describes a category in the traditional manner as:</p>

<blockquote>
an essential order of predicables, through which the intellect is
naturally apt to descend from a transcendental concept by dividing and
compounding to assemble a specific definition of some
thing. (<em>Lectura</em> I, d. 8, q. 1, a. 3, paragraph
118)</blockquote>

<p>
A category is an ordered set of predicates, produced by the activity
of the intellect, arranged according to degree of generality from a
most general genus concept (<em>substance</em>) down to a least
general species concept (<em>human being</em>), passing through the
intermediate levels of more or less general genus concepts
(<em>body</em>, <em>organism</em>, <em>animal</em>). Above the
categories are ‘transcendental’ concepts
like <em>being</em>, which signify the items of more than one category
and are, therefore, even more general than the concepts of any one
category. Below the categories are individual concepts like <em>this
human being</em> or <em>Socrates</em> that pick out one and only one
thing.</p>

<p>
Category concepts are important for constructing the definitions with
which we express the essential properties of things. Chatton’s
particular interest are the real definitions of species concepts
– “specific definitions” – and the things that
those concepts signify, which are, to use modern terminology, natural
kinds like human beings and roses. Specific definitions are
constructed by compounding a genus concept and an essential difference
concept. For example, the definition of <em>human being</em>
is <em>rational animal</em>, where ‘rational’ is the
essential difference and ‘animal’ is the genus; the
definition of <em>animal</em> is <em>sentient organism</em>, where
‘sentient’ is the essential difference and
‘organism’ the genus. Two key semantic features, connected
to definitions, were commonly ascribed to category concepts, which are
(1) essential and (2) universal predicates. The terms
‘animal’ and ‘sentient’ are essentially
predicable of each and every term falling under ‘animal,’
e.g., ‘cat,’ ‘human being,’
‘frog,’ etc., precisely because ‘animal’ and
‘sentient’ appear in the definitions of ‘cat,’
etc.</p>

<p>
Although categorial items are not extra-mental things, Chatton
mentions classes of categorial things, suggesting there are things in
categories and genera. He explains that an individual
(<em>individuum</em>), an extra-mental thing, is in a category if the species concept that signifies it can be
essentially predicated by all the genus concepts within its categorial
line (<em>Lectura</em> I, d. 8, q. 1, a. 1, paragraph 93). Socrates is
in the category of substance, in a manner of speaking,
because <em>substance</em>, <em>body</em>, <em>organism</em>,
and <em>animal</em> are all essentially predicable of <em>human
being</em> and <em>human being</em> is essentially predicable of the
individual concept <em>Socrates</em> or <em>this human being</em>,
pointing to Socrates.</p>

<p>
In asking how we arrive at the canonical ten categories, Chatton
argues against Peter Auriol and Ockham’s view that the categories are
generated by asking ten different questions of a substance. On this
view, the responses to “what is it” form the
category <em>substance</em> (e.g., ‘animal,’
‘body’), to “how many” or “how
much” form the category <em>quantity</em> (e.g.,
‘three’), to “how is it” form the
category <em>quality</em> (e.g., ‘brown,’
‘curved’), to “whose is it” or “in
respective of what is it” form the category <em>relation</em>
(e.g., ‘mother,’ ‘similar’) and so on. Chatton
objects to this view on three grounds: (1) we can ask many more
questions of substance than these ten so the choice is arbitrary
without further elaboration; (2) why limit the questions to questions
about substance? Why not ask “how much” or “what is
it” of quality too? And finally (3) God would end up in all or
most of the categories since we can ask these questions of him.</p>

<h3 id="OntoClas">4.2 Ontological Classes</h3>

<p>
Chatton thinks that there are ten categories and that they are those
ten,
namely <em>substance</em>, <em>quantity</em>, <em>quality</em>, <em>relation</em>, <em>time</em>, <em>place</em>, <em>action</em>, <em>passion</em>, <em>position</em>,
and <em>state</em> or <em>having</em>, because there are ten basic
classes of real things for which we construct specific definitions,
the terms of which come out of the categories. The categories are
devised to define and thus neatly map onto ontological
classes. Chatton disapproves of Ockham’s contention that there are ten
categories for only two sorts of things, substances and some of their
qualities. To establish his ontological claim, Chatton argues for each
class on a case-by-case basis, employing the Chatton Principle (see
above 3.2). He had already done this in the case of relations in the
earlier <em>Reportatio</em>, arguing that we are ontologically
committed to certain classes of relational entities in order to make
the propositions “a heat causes heat” or “the soul
causes an intellection” and “Plato generates
Socrates” true. Now, in the <em>Lectura</em>, he argues that we
must grant the existence of substances, qualities, and quantities as
really distinct from one another as well as from relations, which
include not only relations proper but also the six kinds of relations
picked out by the last six categories,
namely <em>time</em>, <em>place</em>, <em>action</em>, <em>passion</em>,
<em>position</em>, and <em>state</em>. Here is a reconstruction of his
argument for quantities found in <em>Lectura</em> 1, d. 8, q. 1,
paragraph 109:</p>

</ol>

<p>
Chatton’s appeal to the Eucharist, where a piece of bread miraculously converts into the substance of the body of Christ, is unsurprising in the late medieval context though striking to modern eyes. Transubstantiation forced medieval theologians, trained in Aristotle’s metaphysics and natural philosophy, to think about a number of philosophical issues including the inherence (or non-inherence) of accidents in their substances but also the ontological status of quantity. Prior to consecration, the host is a piece of bread whose substance is bread substance and has various perceptible accidental qualities and quantities, e.g. being-white, being-round, having such and such dimensions, etc. During consecration, when the bread substance has been converted into the substance of the body of Christ, all the bread’s perceptible accidents remain present yet without being anchored in the bread substance.
</p>

<p>
With respect to premise (2), Chatton argues that substances, at least
extended substances, cannot make <span class="MathJax_Preview" style="color: inherit;"><span class="MJXp-math" id="MJXp-Span-31"><span class="MJXp-mi MJXp-italic" id="MJXp-Span-32">p</span></span></span><span class="MathJax MathJax_Processed" id="MathJax-Element-15-Frame" tabindex="0" style=""><nobr><span class="math" id="MathJax-Span-45"><span style="display: inline-block; position: relative; width: 0em; height: 0px; font-size: 103%;"><span style="position: absolute;"><span class="mrow" id="MathJax-Span-46"><span class="mi" id="MathJax-Span-47" style="font-family: MathJax_Math-italic;">p</span></span></span></span></span></nobr></span><script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-15">p</script> true, since there are no
such substances on the altar at all. The substance of the body of
Christ is present in every consecrated host, on every altar, but
unextended while the extended substance of the bread is of course
absent. Nor does Chatton think that <span class="MathJax_Preview" style="color: inherit;"><span class="MJXp-math" id="MJXp-Span-33"><span class="MJXp-mi MJXp-italic" id="MJXp-Span-34">p</span></span></span><span class="MathJax MathJax_Processed" id="MathJax-Element-16-Frame" tabindex="0" style=""><nobr><span class="math" id="MathJax-Span-48"><span style="display: inline-block; position: relative; width: 0em; height: 0px; font-size: 103%;"><span style="position: absolute;"><span class="mrow" id="MathJax-Span-49"><span class="mi" id="MathJax-Span-50" style="font-family: MathJax_Math-italic;">p</span></span></span></span></span></nobr></span><script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-16">p</script> is true of qualities
because qualities clearly can naturally exist in the same spatial
arrangement at the same time. The very same body or parts of a body
can be white and cold all over and at once. So, neither extended
substances nor qualities suffice to make <span class="MathJax_Preview" style="color: inherit;"><span class="MJXp-math" id="MJXp-Span-35"><span class="MJXp-mi MJXp-italic" id="MJXp-Span-36">p</span></span></span><span class="MathJax MathJax_Processed" id="MathJax-Element-17-Frame" tabindex="0" style=""><nobr><span class="math" id="MathJax-Span-51"><span style="display: inline-block; position: relative; width: 0em; height: 0px; font-size: 103%;"><span style="position: absolute;"><span class="mrow" id="MathJax-Span-52"><span class="mi" id="MathJax-Span-53" style="font-family: MathJax_Math-italic;">p</span></span></span></span></span></nobr></span><script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-17">p</script> true. A third
entity is necessary and this, Chatton thinks, is a quantity, an entity
of which it is true to say that two such entities cannot naturally
exist in the same spatial arrangement at the same time. No two
quantities, or quantified bodies, can naturally penetrate one another;
rather, the one will push out the other. Interestingly, Chatton associates quantity principally with impenetrability rather than extension, conceding to Ockham that substances and qualities may be extended by themselves and irrespective of having any quantity. They cannot, however, be impenetrable without some quantity. This explains why <span class="MathJax_Preview" style="color: inherit;"><span class="MJXp-math" id="MJXp-Span-37"><span class="MJXp-mi MJXp-italic" id="MJXp-Span-38">p</span></span></span><span class="MathJax MathJax_Processed" id="MathJax-Element-18-Frame" tabindex="0" style=""><nobr><span class="math" id="MathJax-Span-54"><span style="display: inline-block; position: relative; width: 0em; height: 0px; font-size: 103%;"><span style="position: absolute;"><span class="mrow" id="MathJax-Span-55"><span class="mi" id="MathJax-Span-56" style="font-family: MathJax_Math-italic;">p</span></span></span></span></span></nobr></span><script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-18">p</script> refers to two hosts that cannot naturally interpenetrate rather than one whose parts are extended to establish the category of quantity.</p>

<h3 id="NatuIndi">4.3 Natures and Individuation</h3>

<p>
The genus and species concepts that we find in the categories are what
mediaeval philosophers took to be universals, which following
Aristotle they unanimously agreed are what is “predicable of
many” (<em>On Interpretation</em> 7, 17a38–b1). No one disagreed
that the term ‘humanity’ was predicable of many particular
human beings. The pressing metaphysical question was rather whether
there is a property of being-human, i.e. humanity, that all singular
human beings share or not, which would explain why it is true to say
that Plato and Socrates, for instance, are human beings. The realist
holds that there is some kind of universal entity – a repeatable
and instantiable property – that all the particular entities or
members of some kind exemplify. But since it is obvious that Socrates
and Plato are both human beings and yet that each is a singular,
individual entity, the realist also has to give some account of how
the property of being-human is individuated so as to constitute
Socrates on the one hand and Plato on the other. The nominalist, by
contrast, denies that any such universal entity exists, holding
instead that all entities are just particular.</p>

<p>
Chatton wades into the debate between Scotus, a realist, and Ockham, a
nominalist, most extensively in <em>Lectura</em> d. 2, q. 5, defending
Scotus’ position against Ockham’s unrelenting attack contained in the
latter’s <em>Ordinatio</em> d. 2, q. 6. We see that Chatton adopts
Scotus’ basic picture of the metaphysical structure of substances,
both immaterial substances like angels and material substances like
human beings, cats, and trees. In each case, the particular entities
of a given kind, for instance each and every human being, are
constituted by various natures – humanity, animality,
etc. – and what Chatton calls an ‘individual
property.’ Also known as a haecceity, the individual property
of, say Socrates, is what individuates each substantial and accidental
nature such that they are <em>Socrates’s</em> humanity, animality,
whiteness, etc. and not Plato’s, who has his own individual property
that makes his humanity, animality, whiteness. his own. The nature of
humanity as such is a repeatable and instantiable property but as
individuated, Socrates’s humanity is not; it is utterly individual and
singular. Scotus thought, and Chatton emphasizes this in the face of
Ockham’s conviction that every thing is radically particular, that
natures never exist as such out there in external reality. Natures
either exist in extra-mental reality as individuated and singular,
Socrates’s humanity and Plato’s humanity each being numerically one
and distinct from one another, or natures exist in the mind as
universal concepts where they are indeed predicable of many.</p>

<p>
Chatton insists that despite the fact that Socrates’s humanity can
only exist as individuated, as Socrates’s humanity and no one else’s,
nonetheless if taken as such and in abstraction from its instantiation
in Socrates, humanity is the sort of thing for which it is not
contradictory to be instantiated by another individual, like
Plato. The reason, he thinks, is that the definition of Socrates’s
humanity, definable as ‘rational animal’, is <em>intrinsically</em>
general, containing no reference to Socrates that would restrict its
signification to his and only his humanity. If Socrates’s humanity
were intrinsically particular to him, its definition would have to be
something like ‘this rational animal’ pointing at
Socrates. Yet, this cannot be the case for the simple reason that
human beings other than Socrates exist and each of their humanities is
likewise definable as ‘rational animal’ and not
‘this rational animal’.</p>

<p>
The upshot of this is that there must be some kind of distinction
within Socrates between his humanity as it is definable by its
specific definition and his individual property
(e.g., <em>Lectura</em> 2, d. 5, paragraph 24). In light of this
distinction, it is, then, not contradictory (Chatton uses the
expression “not repugnant to”) to Socrates’s humanity to
be Plato’s even though it is in fact impossible for Socrates’s
humanity to be Plato’s. This complicated line of counter-factual
reasoning finds its inspiration in Scotus but takes centre-stage in
Chatton’s discussion of natures and individuation. It is not repugnant
to natures, taken as such, to be instantiated by multiple particular
entities of the same kind at once. It is repugnant to natures, as
individuated, to be instantiated by multiple particular entities of
the same kind at once.</p>

<p>
It should now be clear what Chatton means when he says that an
individual is in a category. Socrates is the individual <em>res</em>
whose species concept – ‘human being’ – is
essentially predicated by all the genus concepts within its given
categorial line – ‘animal,’ ‘body,’
‘substance’ – and he is nothing but a set of
individuated natures. Similarly, the whiteness that inheres in
Socrates, whose specific concept ‘whiteness’ is
essentially predicated by ‘colour,’ ‘sensible
quality,’ ‘quality’ is an individuated
nature. Individuals, or rather individuated natures, fall into the ten
basic classes of things that are signified by category concepts.</p>

When change seems smooth we often regard it as continuous. For
example, we think that a color increasing continuously in intensity
takes on every intermediate brightness value as it intensifies, and an
object changing location continuously (i.e., moving) takes up every
intermediate space between its starting point and its destination.
Moreover, it is customary in geometry to assume the absolute continuity
of the line, say. A line is absolutely smooth, divisible in thought at
any location we like. An important point for the analysis of such cases
is that the smoothness of continuous magnitudes and changes can be
expressed by and correlated with <em>infinite divisibility</em>. A
simple example makes this plain.</p>

<p>

Think of a string of pearls. This necklace itself is not smooth,
since each pearl is a discrete self-contained unit, sitting next to
another pearl, that is, next to another discrete self-contained unit,
with a slight gap in between each unit. Such an entity, composed of
finite discrete units, can only be divided into these units finitely
often. If we divide a pearl strand enough we eventually reach the level
of an individual pearl – an indivisible <em>atom</em> in broad
sense of the term – and we cannot divide further without changing
the <em>sort</em> of dividing that we are doing. A pearl necklace has a
lowest level of division.</p>

<p>

The string that threads the pearls together is, by contrast,
smoother; one part of the string is like any other. If I take a knife
to the string I get the same results depending on where I cut; indeed,
any division of the string seems to yield smaller bits of string.
String of length 1 can be divided, string of length 1/2 can be divided,
of length 1/4, and so on, and we seem not to reach a level where we
move from string to non-string, that is, to a place where a
metaphysical shift occurs from continuous to discrete. Thus the ability
to be divided indefinitely, or as we say, <em>infinite
divisibility</em>, is central to the idea of smoothness here. Of
course, strictly speaking, actual physical string is not absolutely
continuous. Modern atomic theory tells us that in fact physical strings
are composed of physical atoms, which are discrete entities, so
eventually we will reach a point where we shift from string to
something else. String is not absolutely continuous, but only
relatively continuous, that is, it is smooth<em>er</em>, <em>less</em>
gappy, than the pearl strand. But this leads us to ask: Is any part of
reality absolutely continuous?</p>

<p>

Return to the geometrical line. This is an abstraction, an
idealization, not a physical thing. When we divide the geometrical
line, we make a division in thought, not in physical matter, and so the
problem that we had with the string disappears; no physical theory will
ever intervene to tell us we have <em>in fact</em> cut a piece of line
so small that we have changed to a new metaphysical category. There are
no physical facts about mental abstractions, so nothing can tell us we
have reached the atoms. Indeed, what could a spatial atom even be? The
geometrical line seems absolutely continuous precisely <em>because</em>
it seems infinitely divisible. And indeed infinite divisibility seems a
hallmark of continuity.</p>

<p>

It is possible to object here: “What about a point in the
geometrical line? Isn’t this a piece of a continuum so small that it
cannot be divided?” Now it seems we need a distinction to keep this
story working. We might say this: lines do not divide into points, but
into intervals, and intervals always have some magnitude. By contrast,
a point has no magnitude and is simply a location of cutting on the
line. Having made this distinction, we can now answer the objection: we
should say that an absolute continuum like a line divides into
intervals of arbitrarily small magnitude (that is, pieces as small as
you like), and that the locations for these division are specifiable as
points, or as instants, if we are talking about time, say, or as
point-intensities of a certain color.</p>

<p>

However, given this distinction, we are not able to say
that the line, or any continuum, is composed of indivisibles such as
points, because then points would be the bottom level of the line, and we
would have to say the line is not infinitely divisible after all. That
contradicts continuity. But since points are vital to our thinking about lines, it seems we should be able to say more about how they occur there. This is
one puzzle that animated mediaeval thinkers: how do the indivisible
points on a continuous line relate to that line?</p>

<h3 id="CompThes">5.2 The Compositionality Thesis</h3>

<p>

It seems the sentence ‘A geometrical line contains indivisible
points.’ is reasonable if it means ‘A geometrical line is
<em>divisible by</em> indivisible points, anywhere you wish to divide
it.’ But ‘A geometrical line contains indivisible
points.’ seems unreasonable and even puzzling if it means
‘A geometrical line is <em>composed of</em> indivisible
points’. In fact, any theory claiming that absolute continua are
<em>composed of</em> indivisible elements seems very strange because
continua are supposed to be infinitely divisible.</p>

<p>

Let us call this odd-sounding claim – that continua are
<em>composed of</em> indivisible elements – the
<em>compositionality thesis</em>. Given the above explanation of
continuity in terms of infinite divisibility, the compositionality
thesis seems plainly untenable; it violates the useful distinction
between points and beads; the compositionality thesis seems to say that
the line contains points the way a bead necklace contains beads.</p>

<p>

Most philosophers in the Middle Ages agreed that the
compositionality thesis is wrong: points do not compose a line. And in
general they denied that continua are composed of indivisible atoms.
Yet despite all this, there were very bright people in the Middle Ages
who believed and defended the compositionality thesis: they said that
in fact continua were composed of indivisible atoms. Today we call
these people <em>indivisibilists</em> and their view is called
<em>indivisibilism</em>. Two of the most famous indivisibilists in
England were Henry Harclay, who was head of Oxford University in 1312,
and Walter Chatton.</p>

<p>

Since indivisibilism was a minority view, and since there were many
anti-indivisibilist arguments in the philosophical literature running
all the way back to Aristotle, much of the time the indivisibilists
spent explaining their own views was really spent defending themselves
from these powerful attacks. Harclay and Chatton were no exception.
However, some of Chatton’s direct rebuttals of anti-indivisibilist
arguments exhibit low mathematical acumen, and are not worth
summarizing here. His positive views are, however, quite unique.</p>

<h3 id="ChatSolu">5.3 Chatton’s Solution</h3>

<p>

Practically all indivisibilists, and certainly Henry Harclay, agreed
with their opponents that continua are infinitely divisible; the
indivisibilists simply insisted on a further point: that these
infinitely divisible entities, say geometrical lines, nevertheless are
composed of lowest elements which are themselves indivisible.
Anti-indivisibilists saw a simple contradiction in this coupling, which
the following argument brings out:</p>

But the indivisibilist view is that there are elements <span class="MathJax_Preview" style="color: inherit;"><span class="MJXp-math" id="MJXp-Span-65"><span class="MJXp-mi MJXp-italic" id="MJXp-Span-66">Y</span></span></span><span class="MathJax MathJax_Processed" id="MathJax-Element-32-Frame" tabindex="0" style=""><nobr><span class="math" id="MathJax-Span-96"><span style="display: inline-block; position: relative; width: 0em; height: 0px; font-size: 103%;"><span style="position: absolute;"><span class="mrow" id="MathJax-Span-97"><span class="mi" id="MathJax-Span-98" style="font-family: MathJax_Math-italic;">Y<span style="display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; height: 1px; width: 0.182em;"></span></span></span></span></span></span></nobr></span><script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-32">Y</script>

This directly
contradicts the conclusion of the reasoning above. According to this
argument, the problem with indivisibilism arises from thinking
compositionally about the continuous, because there is a mismatch
between the idea of compositionality on the one hand and the idea of
infinite divisibility on the other. It is almost as though we could
say the indivisibilist (mis)understands infinite divisibility to be
division <em>into</em> points instead of division <em>by</em>
points.</p>

<p>

Because he would agree about premise (1), Harclay was forced to
rethink the very idea of composition. He does this by finessing the
notion of ‘touching’ in order to argue that although
indivisibles can touch each other in the line they compose, they do not
therefore have parts, and so are still properly indivisible. In this
way Harclay can keep premise (1) and by side-stepping premise (2),
avoid the conclusion in (4).</p>

<p>

Chatton also finesses premise (2), but he bluntly rejects premise (1)
by asserting the astonishing claim that finite continua are composed
of <em>finitely many</em> indivisibles. New evidence is emerging that
he was not alone in this finitist view in contemporary England.
William Crathorn (fl. 1330) seems to have held a similar opinion, and
and John Wyclif (d. 1384) toys with it as well, perhaps even under the
influence of Chatton’s own work. Chatton was clearly one of the
pioneers of the revitalization of this surprising subspecies of
indivisiblism in the fourteenth century.</p>

<p>

The heart of Chatton’s account involves
clarifying the idea of ‘composition’. To the obvious
question of how something continuous could be composed of finitely many
indivisibles and not be gappy, Chatton responds that continua are only
potentially divisible into indivisibles, not actually so divisible, so
there are no actually existing indivisibles in this sense. He rejects
the model discussed above, in which beads compose a necklace; in that
example the beads have a separate existence in act, and each has a
length which it lends to the necklace when strung onto it. But
Chattonian indivisibles do not exist independently and then, when added
together, yield continuous lengths. Existing only potentially, they
compose the line in only in the reduced sense of being a part.
Chatton’s point is that any potential division of the line is in fact
<em>finite</em>, and can yield at most finitely many parts. His
conviction is not that there exist indivisible discrete building-blocks
of material things, but that there is some level of division that is
basic or lowest, a theoretical maximum. The indivisible elements at the
theoretical maximum can, in the reduced sense explained above, be said
to compose the continuous whole they are in because, as indivisibles,
they do not have part touching parts, but instead they have
<em>nothing</em> between them; they are immediate to each other and
distinct in place.</p>

<p>

Although Chatton seems thereby to evade some standard objections
advanced against indivisibilism, in doing so he seems to have
completely lost touch with some important mathematical intuitions and
motivations that allow us to reason efficaciously about continua.
Even if it is partially defensible, it is not clear what Chatton’s
indivisibilist theory can <em>do</em>.</p>

<h2 id="FutuCont">6. Future Contingents</h2>

<h3 id="FataArgu">6.1 A Fatalist Argument</h3>

<p>

What philosophers call <em>the problem of future contingents</em>
goes together naturally with the related and more well-known
<em>problem of free will and determinism</em>. In the Middle Ages, as
now, we really find a cluster of several related problems radiating
from a single common conundrum or paradox. One important difference is
that the mediaeval problem has some theological branches that today
receive less philosophical attention. For example, few modern
philosophers seriously consider the seeming inconsistency between
veridical prophecy and the contingency of the future, or whether angels
of high rank can reveal future contingents to inferior angels, but
these were important issues with their own test cases in the Middle
Ages. Moreover, the problem was far more stark, severe, and difficult
for mediaeval Christian thinkers than for modern secular philosophers,
since it was doctrinally unacceptable to solve the problem by ejecting
some element of the paradox – <em>all</em> elements of the
paradox were important pieces of Christian doctrine. One felicitous
consequence of this struggle is that some very original and deep
philosophy was created and employed in an attempt to find a stable
solution. I will briefly present the conundrum at the heart of the
matter, and then examine Chatton’s own radical and relatively original
solution to the
 problem.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-8" id="ref-8">8</a>]</sup></p>

<p>

Consider the following grouping of ideas, objects, and events in our
universe (Chatton’s usual Latin terms for certain cognates are
distinguished in parentheses):</p>

<table class="vert-top hrules cellpad-small-dense avoid-break">
<tbody><tr>

<p>

No kind of strict paring between list entries across from each other
on the right and left is intended here. Rather, we should notice three
things. (1) All of the putative objects and phenomena on the left-hand
under the heading RIGID are elements of the universe that are firm and
unchanging, and their existence seems to entail a kind of immutability
of reality; the world cannot be otherwise. (2) Those putative objects
under OPEN, by contrast, seem indeterminate and loose, and their
existence demands recognition of alternatives; the world can be
otherwise. (3) It is common and quite attractive to believe in the
existence of many of the elements on the left and on the right
simultaneously, but it seems clear that the implications of that belief
are often contradictory, entailing that one and the same piece of
reality both can be otherwise and cannot be otherwise in the same way
at the same time. In short, certain mixtures of these elements, right
and left, are nearly irresistible parts of our total outlook on the
universe, but unfortunately they seem to yield contradictions. Not
every pairing of items yields a paradox, e.g., 1 and 8 do not. There
can be both necessity and contingency in the world. The reader is
invited to consider, however, just how many left-right pairings from
these lists do seem both attractive and impossible.</p>

<p>

There are as many possible solutions to these paradoxes as may be
imagined, but there are really only three ways out; either: (1) accept
the rigid element of reality at the expense of the open element, or (2)
accept the open element at the expense of the rigid element, or (3)
show that the contradiction between the two is only a seeming
contradiction. Most mediaeval philosophers took this third approach in
their solutions.</p>

By the time Chatton was writing, it was quite common to present a
basic fatalist or necessitarian argument to show that God’s
foreknowledge, which seems deeply connected to his providence, is not
consistent with future contingent things and events. Here is Chatton’s
version of this standard fatalist argument:</p>

<blockquote>Herein lies the difficulty of this question – if it
were consistent with the contingency of future events that God knows
future contingents, then this consequence would follow:
‘God knew that the Antichrist will come; therefore the
Antichrist will come’. The antecedent of this consequence is
necessary, as is the consequence itself, hence the consequent is
necessary. But the [necessary] consequent ‘the Antichrist will
come’ is not consistent with the contingency [of the future event
<em>the Antichrist comes</em>]. Therefore [God’s knowledge is not
consistent with the contingency of the future].
(<em>Reportatio</em> I, 10–48, d. 38, paragraph 2, p. 347)</blockquote>

<p>

Two things to note. (1) <em>The coming of the Antichrist</em> is a
standard example of a future event that is anticipated but which seems
contingent; however, there is no special importance attached to the
content of the example; equally popular was the less dramatic example
‘Socrates will sit’. (2) A <em>consequence</em> is what we
call a <em>consecution</em> today (something of the form
‘<span class="MathJax_Preview" style="color: inherit;"><span class="MJXp-math" id="MJXp-Span-71"><span class="MJXp-mi MJXp-italic" id="MJXp-Span-72">p</span></span></span><span class="MathJax MathJax_Processed" id="MathJax-Element-35-Frame" tabindex="0" style=""><nobr><span class="math" id="MathJax-Span-105"><span style="display: inline-block; position: relative; width: 0em; height: 0px; font-size: 103%;"><span style="position: absolute;"><span class="mrow" id="MathJax-Span-106"><span class="mi" id="MathJax-Span-107" style="font-family: MathJax_Math-italic;">p</span></span></span></span></span></nobr></span><script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-35">p</script> therefore <span class="MathJax_Preview" style="color: inherit;"><span class="MJXp-math" id="MJXp-Span-73"><span class="MJXp-mi MJXp-italic" id="MJXp-Span-74">q</span></span></span><span class="MathJax MathJax_Processed" id="MathJax-Element-36-Frame" tabindex="0" style=""><nobr><span class="math" id="MathJax-Span-108"><span style="display: inline-block; position: relative; width: 0em; height: 0px; font-size: 103%;"><span style="position: absolute;"><span class="mrow" id="MathJax-Span-109"><span class="mi" id="MathJax-Span-110" style="font-family: MathJax_Math-italic;">q<span style="display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; height: 1px; width: 0.014em;"></span></span></span></span></span></span></nobr></span><script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-36">q</script>’), but in this case we
can, without distortion, model the reasoning by treating it as a
conditional. The fatalist argues that (IF God knew the Antichrist will
come THEN the Antichrist will come) is necessary, and moreover, the
antecedent, ‘God knows the Antichrist will come’, is also
necessary, since God’s knowledge is certain and firm. But if (IF

we can conclude that the coming of the Antichrist is necessary, which
violates our assumption that the future is open. Chatton
summarizes the fatalist argument this way:</p>

<blockquote>This whole thing can also be made more compact with the
formula: ‘God knew that <span class="MathJax_Preview" style="color: inherit;"><span class="MJXp-math" id="MJXp-Span-84"><span class="MJXp-mi MJXp-italic" id="MJXp-Span-85">a</span></span></span><span class="MathJax MathJax_Processed" id="MathJax-Element-41-Frame" tabindex="0" style=""><nobr><span class="math" id="MathJax-Span-124"><span style="display: inline-block; position: relative; width: 0em; height: 0px; font-size: 103%;"><span style="position: absolute;"><span class="mrow" id="MathJax-Span-125"><span class="mi" id="MathJax-Span-126" style="font-family: MathJax_Math-italic;">a</span></span></span></span></span></nobr></span><script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-41">a</script> will be; therefore <span class="MathJax_Preview" style="color: inherit;"><span class="MJXp-math" id="MJXp-Span-86"><span class="MJXp-mi MJXp-italic" id="MJXp-Span-87">a</span></span></span><span class="MathJax MathJax_Processed" id="MathJax-Element-42-Frame" tabindex="0" style=""><nobr><span class="math" id="MathJax-Span-127"><span style="display: inline-block; position: relative; width: 0em; height: 0px; font-size: 103%;"><span style="position: absolute;"><span class="mrow" id="MathJax-Span-128"><span class="mi" id="MathJax-Span-129" style="font-family: MathJax_Math-italic;">a</span></span></span></span></span></nobr></span><script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-42">a</script>
will necessarily be’. (<em>Reportatio</em> I, 10–48, d. 38, paragraph 2,
p. 347)</blockquote>

<p>

This is the argument to be defeated. After brief consideration of
some other views, including Peter Auriol’s, which seems to have
influenced him in certain respects, Chatton draws together the threads
of his discussion into a solution that is quite original and radical,
but which he supports only hesitantly, not apparently out of
intellectual reservations but out of fear of falling into heresy.
Although his hesitation makes it difficult to pin him down, a
reasonably secure reconstruction of his ideas seems possible. His
solution has two parts: (1) He offers a counter-argument to the
fatalist’s reasoning, and (2) he clarifies the <em>way</em> God knows
future contingents.</p>

Chatton rebuts this argument by denying the second premise. He

Two remarks need to be made. First, premise 4 seems to have
originated with Chatton, and he was followed in this by the next
generation of Oxford theologians, for example, Robert
 Holcot.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-10" id="ref-10">10</a>]</sup> 
 Second, even if we
accept this argument, Chatton still owes us an explanation of what the
<em>first</em> conjunct means in the conjunction ‘God knows

raise the problem of future contingents all over again, focusing on the

definiendum is taken to be a <em>cognition</em>. (<em>Reportatio</em>
I, 10–48, d. 38, paragraph 28, p. 352.)</blockquote>

<p>

Chatton explains his idea of divine cognition by recourse to an
analogy, a distinction, and a claim about all operations of the divine
intellect.</p>

<p>

Chatton’s analogy is this: <em>cognition is to knowledge as
apprehension is to assent or assertion</em>. Just as apprehension
implies the mere grasp of something without additional judgment about
it, so too cognition implies the mere grasp of something, without the
additional affirmative judgment implied in the term
‘knowledge’. Hence, when Chatton uses the phrase
‘God knows <span class="MathJax_Preview" style="color: inherit;"><span class="MJXp-math" id="MJXp-Span-208"><span class="MJXp-mi MJXp-italic" id="MJXp-Span-209">a</span></span></span><span class="MathJax MathJax_Processing" id="MathJax-Element-95-Frame" tabindex="0"></span><script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-95">a</script>’ in the above solution, it should be
understood as ‘God cognizes <span class="MathJax_Preview" style="color: inherit;"><span class="MJXp-math" id="MJXp-Span-210"><span class="MJXp-mi MJXp-italic" id="MJXp-Span-211">a</span></span></span><span class="MathJax MathJax_Processing" id="MathJax-Element-96-Frame" tabindex="0"></span><script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-96">a</script>’, meaning that we
are only talking about God’s <em>grasp</em> of <span class="MathJax_Preview" style="color: inherit;"><span class="MJXp-math" id="MJXp-Span-212"><span class="MJXp-mi MJXp-italic" id="MJXp-Span-213">a</span></span></span><span class="MathJax MathJax_Processing" id="MathJax-Element-97-Frame" tabindex="0"></span><script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-97">a</script>, not about
any kind of approval, disapproval, agreement, disagreement, etc.
(<em>Reportatio</em> I, 10–48, d. 39, paragraph 14, p. 363). In
cognizing, the divine intellect is somehow holding <span class="MathJax_Preview" style="color: inherit;"><span class="MJXp-math" id="MJXp-Span-214"><span class="MJXp-mi MJXp-italic" id="MJXp-Span-215">a</span></span></span><span class="MathJax MathJax_Processing" id="MathJax-Element-98-Frame" tabindex="0"></span><script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-98">a</script> without
confirming it, judging it, or creating it. Only one part of the divine
intellect is in play, not divine assent or the divine will.</p>

<p>

Another difference between knowledge and cognition is that
<em>knowledge is necessarily of a present existent, whereas cognition
does not have this restriction</em> (<em>Reportatio</em> I, 10–48, d.
38, paragraph 42, p. 355). The upshot of the distinction in this
context is that God cannot <em>know</em> future objects, for example,
since they are <em>not yet</em>; however, he can <em>cognize</em>
them.</p>

<p>

Finally (and this claim he intends to apply to both divine cognition
and divine knowledge), <em>God’s knowledge and cognition are neither
mediated by propositions nor are they generally of propositions</em>
(<em>Reportatio</em> I, 10–48, d. 39, paragraph 14, p. 363;
<em>Quodlibet</em>, q. 1, paragraph 36). Chatton holds that God’s
intellectual activity is not discursive or representative in any way,
and that the usual objects of divine intellectual activity are not
propositions, but rather real things, that is, <em>res</em>. God does
not require any mediator in the operation of his intellect with respect
to creation; for example, he requires no concepts or propositions in
order to know or to cognize. Rather, God directly cognizes (for
example) the future contingent things (<em>res</em>) that he cognizes,
whether those things are people, the shoes on their feet, or even
occasionally and somewhat trivially, the spoken, written, or mental
propositions they talk, write, or think with. God sees them all through
a kind of direct vision or intuition. As noted above, Chatton was a
realist about relations, and since relations are accidents inhering in
their subjects, for God to cognize a future <em>res</em> is also for
him to cognize the relational accidents of that <em>res</em>. So, in
cognizing a <em>res</em>, God cognizes everything about it, and so
directly cognizes all the situations or states of affairs of this
<em>res</em> as well, Thus, his grasp of it is complete. Because it has
no intermediary, God’s cognition is not something separate from him;
there is no determinate representation of a thing <em>by which</em> he
cognizes. Consequently, divine cognition is, in a sense, not really
distinct from God himself.</p>

<p>

With the idea of divine cognition thus developed, we can now return
to the problems we raised at the end of the last section. First, we
asked: How can ‘God knows <span class="MathJax_Preview" style="color: inherit;"><span class="MJXp-math" id="MJXp-Span-216"><span class="MJXp-mi MJXp-italic" id="MJXp-Span-217">a</span></span></span><span class="MathJax MathJax_Processing" id="MathJax-Element-99-Frame" tabindex="0"></span><script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-99">a</script>’ be necessary
when <span class="MathJax_Preview" style="color: inherit;"><span class="MJXp-math" id="MJXp-Span-218"><span class="MJXp-mi MJXp-italic" id="MJXp-Span-219">a</span></span></span><span class="MathJax MathJax_Processing" id="MathJax-Element-100-Frame" tabindex="0"></span><script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-100">a</script> is both future and contingent? After all, it
seems the firmness of God’s knowledge of <span class="MathJax_Preview" style="color: inherit;"><span class="MJXp-math" id="MJXp-Span-220"><span class="MJXp-mi MJXp-italic" id="MJXp-Span-221">a</span></span></span><span class="MathJax MathJax_Processing" id="MathJax-Element-101-Frame" tabindex="0"></span><script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-101">a</script> and the determinacy
of his concepts of <span class="MathJax_Preview" style="color: inherit;"><span class="MJXp-math" id="MJXp-Span-222"><span class="MJXp-mi MJXp-italic" id="MJXp-Span-223">a</span></span></span><span class="MathJax MathJax_Processing" id="MathJax-Element-102-Frame" tabindex="0"></span><script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-102">a</script> are a sign that <span class="MathJax_Preview" style="color: inherit;"><span class="MJXp-math" id="MJXp-Span-224"><span class="MJXp-mi MJXp-italic" id="MJXp-Span-225">a</span></span></span><span class="MathJax MathJax_Processing" id="MathJax-Element-103-Frame" tabindex="0"></span><script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-103">a</script> cannot be
otherwise. But now we have our answer. By ‘God knows
<span class="MathJax_Preview" style="color: inherit;"><span class="MJXp-math" id="MJXp-Span-226"><span class="MJXp-mi MJXp-italic" id="MJXp-Span-227">a</span></span></span><span class="MathJax MathJax_Processing" id="MathJax-Element-104-Frame" tabindex="0"></span><script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-104">a</script>’ Chatton means only ‘God cognizes
<span class="MathJax_Preview" style="color: inherit;"><span class="MJXp-math" id="MJXp-Span-228"><span class="MJXp-mi MJXp-italic" id="MJXp-Span-229">a</span></span></span><span class="MathJax MathJax_Processing" id="MathJax-Element-105-Frame" tabindex="0"></span><script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-105">a</script>’, and divine cognition is (1) non-judgmental and
non-voluntaristic, (2) not necessarily of determinate existents, and
(3) a complete, though non-discursive, direct awareness. Consequently,
when God cognizes some future <span class="MathJax_Preview" style="color: inherit;"><span class="MJXp-math" id="MJXp-Span-230"><span class="MJXp-mi MJXp-italic" id="MJXp-Span-231">a</span></span></span><span class="MathJax MathJax_Processing" id="MathJax-Element-106-Frame" tabindex="0"></span><script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-106">a</script>, that cognition is in no way
judgmental, confirming or otherwise approving of <span class="MathJax_Preview" style="color: inherit;"><span class="MJXp-math" id="MJXp-Span-232"><span class="MJXp-mi MJXp-italic" id="MJXp-Span-233">a</span></span></span><span class="MathJax MathJax_Processing" id="MathJax-Element-107-Frame" tabindex="0"></span><script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-107">a</script>, nor does
it entail the existence of <span class="MathJax_Preview" style="color: inherit;"><span class="MJXp-math" id="MJXp-Span-234"><span class="MJXp-mi MJXp-italic" id="MJXp-Span-235">a</span></span></span><span class="MathJax MathJax_Processing" id="MathJax-Element-108-Frame" tabindex="0"></span><script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-108">a</script>, although it does grasp all that
matters about <span class="MathJax_Preview" style="color: inherit;"><span class="MJXp-math" id="MJXp-Span-236"><span class="MJXp-mi MJXp-italic" id="MJXp-Span-237">a</span></span></span><span class="MathJax MathJax_Processing" id="MathJax-Element-109-Frame" tabindex="0"></span><script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-109">a</script>. In short, divine cognition is an omniscience
that does not interfere in any way with the natural operation or
condition of <span class="MathJax_Preview" style="color: inherit;"><span class="MJXp-math" id="MJXp-Span-238"><span class="MJXp-mi MJXp-italic" id="MJXp-Span-239">a</span></span></span><span class="MathJax MathJax_Processing" id="MathJax-Element-110-Frame" tabindex="0"></span><script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-110">a</script>, nor does it force <span class="MathJax_Preview" style="color: inherit;"><span class="MJXp-math" id="MJXp-Span-240"><span class="MJXp-mi MJXp-italic" id="MJXp-Span-241">a</span></span></span><span class="MathJax MathJax_Processing" id="MathJax-Element-111-Frame" tabindex="0"></span><script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-111">a</script> to exist, or
imply it already does. The divine will is out of the picture; mere
cognition of <span class="MathJax_Preview" style="color: inherit;"><span class="MJXp-math" id="MJXp-Span-242"><span class="MJXp-mi MJXp-italic" id="MJXp-Span-243">a</span></span></span><span class="MathJax MathJax_Processing" id="MathJax-Element-112-Frame" tabindex="0"></span><script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-112">a</script> is not causative of <span class="MathJax_Preview" style="color: inherit;"><span class="MJXp-math" id="MJXp-Span-244"><span class="MJXp-mi MJXp-italic" id="MJXp-Span-245">a</span></span></span><span class="MathJax MathJax_Processing" id="MathJax-Element-113-Frame" tabindex="0"></span><script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-113">a</script>. Neither do we
have to worry about the rigidity of some structure called ‘God’s
knowledge’ and its relation to <span class="MathJax_Preview" style="color: inherit;"><span class="MJXp-math" id="MJXp-Span-246"><span class="MJXp-mi MJXp-italic" id="MJXp-Span-247">a</span></span></span><span class="MathJax MathJax_Processing" id="MathJax-Element-114-Frame" tabindex="0"></span><script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-114">a</script>. All divine
intellection is direct, and so God does not have a body of propositions
about <span class="MathJax_Preview" style="color: inherit;"><span class="MJXp-math" id="MJXp-Span-248"><span class="MJXp-mi MJXp-italic" id="MJXp-Span-249">a</span></span></span><span class="MathJax MathJax_Processing" id="MathJax-Element-115-Frame" tabindex="0"></span><script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-115">a</script> or any intermediary concepts of <span class="MathJax_Preview" style="color: inherit;"><span class="MJXp-math" id="MJXp-Span-250"><span class="MJXp-mi MJXp-italic" id="MJXp-Span-251">a</span></span></span><span class="MathJax MathJax_Processing" id="MathJax-Element-116-Frame" tabindex="0"></span><script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-116">a</script> by which he
cognizes it.</p>

<p>

In short, Chatton’s view is that the necessity we detect in
‘God knows <span class="MathJax_Preview" style="color: inherit;"><span class="MJXp-math" id="MJXp-Span-252"><span class="MJXp-mi MJXp-italic" id="MJXp-Span-253">a</span></span></span><span class="MathJax MathJax_Processing" id="MathJax-Element-117-Frame" tabindex="0"></span><script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-117">a</script>’ attaches to <em>God</em> as a
necessary cognizer, i.e., it attaches to the divine intellect alone,
not to the objects it cognizes or to some distinct, determinate body of
truths called ‘God’s knowledge’. It is almost as if, for
Chatton, ‘God cognizes [future contingent] <span class="MathJax_Preview" style="color: inherit;"><span class="MJXp-math" id="MJXp-Span-254"><span class="MJXp-mi MJXp-italic" id="MJXp-Span-255">a</span></span></span><span class="MathJax MathJax_Processing" id="MathJax-Element-118-Frame" tabindex="0"></span><script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-118">a</script>’
simply means, ‘the all-seeing God exists and contingent
<span class="MathJax_Preview" style="color: inherit;"><span class="MJXp-math" id="MJXp-Span-256"><span class="MJXp-mi MJXp-italic" id="MJXp-Span-257">a</span></span></span><span class="MathJax MathJax_Processing" id="MathJax-Element-119-Frame" tabindex="0"></span><script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-119">a</script> will exist’.</p>

<p>

From these considerations we also get Chatton’s answer to the second
difficulty: Does God’s knowledge of the world change when the world
changes? Chatton can formulate his answer with the same notion of
cognition. There is no change implied in God when contingent <span class="MathJax_Preview" style="color: inherit;"><span class="MJXp-math" id="MJXp-Span-258"><span class="MJXp-mi MJXp-italic" id="MJXp-Span-259">a</span></span></span><span class="MathJax MathJax_Processing" id="MathJax-Element-120-Frame" tabindex="0"></span><script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-120">a</script>
comes into existence: (1) God’s cognition has not changed, certainly,
since cognition is indifferent to existence, but (2) God’s knowledge
has not changed either, at least not in any serious sense. For there
are only three ways that God’s knowledge could be said to change: (2a)
it could be that the mental proposition ‘Socrates is
sitting’ in God’s intellect goes from being false to true, say,
when standing Socrates sits, i.e., it literally changes truth value in
God’s mind; or (2b) it could be that Socrates is now sitting and before
he was not, and so before God’s knowledge contained the proposition
‘Socrates is not sitting’ but now it contains the
proposition ‘Socrates is sitting’ instead; or similarly,
(2c) it could be that Socrates is now sitting and before he was not,
and so before God knew the non-seated Socrates which was signified by
‘Socrates is not sitting’ but now he knows the seated
Socrates signified by ‘Socrates is sitting’.</p>

<p>

(2a) and (2b) are not a problem because God’s knowledge is not
generally of propositions, nor is it mediated by them. And even when it
is of propositions, there is nothing special about how he knows a
proposition’s shift from truth to falsity, as distinguished from any
other form of change. (2c) is not a problem, because Chatton famously
held that the thing signified by ‘Socrates is sitting’, is
exactly the same as the thing signified by ‘Socrates is not
 sitting’.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-11" id="ref-11">11</a>]</sup>
 God
cognizes of every proposition when it will be true; he cognizes the
“truth career” of each proposition. But he cognizes this at once, as of
now. And when a proposition he cognizes becomes true, he knows it. But
again, this is no change in God, who does not think discursively, but
rather sees every created thing, including propositions, as
<em>res</em>.</p>

<p>

There are still many questions we would like answered here, of
course. For example, what is the ontological status of the not-yet
existing things that God cognizes? Exactly what does God cognize
when he cognizes a present non-existent? These issues require a
more extensive treatment than can be given here.</p>

<h2 id="InteTheoConc">7. The <em>Intellectio</em> Theory of Concepts</h2>

<p>

In the last half of the twentieth century the most documented and
discussed aspect of Chatton’s thought concerned his views on human
cognition and the metaphysics of concepts. He was not especially
innovative on these topics, but he had considerable influence on
contemporary debates, having brought about a dramatic change of heart
in Ockham concerning the nature of general concepts.</p>

<p>

Ockham famously rejected the existence of anything metaphysically
universal outside the human mind; he was an uncompromising nominalist
in the mediaeval debate on universals. His rejection followed, not from
his razor, but from his conviction, supported through long
argumentation, that the very idea of a ‘universal substance
existing outside the mind’ was simply incoherent, contradictory,
or false. No adequate theory of this idea had been or could ever be
given; everything outside the mind is irreducibly individual, not on
account of some distinct individuating force, as Scotus had said, but
simply <em>in se ipso</em>. On his view, the only things in reality
that could in any way be truly denominated ‘universal’ are
the general concepts existing in the human mind, for example the
concept <em>man</em> or the concept <em>white</em>. The general concept
<em>white</em> is universal, but only in the following reduced,
metaphysically innocuous sense: <em>white</em> applies to many
individual things.</p>

<p>

This line of thought led Ockham quite naturally to offer an account
of the metaphysical status of general concepts. To what Aristotelian
category do they belong? Are concepts in the human mind
<em>substances</em>, that is, ‘things’ in their own right,
and so are in their own way as real and independent as people and
horses? Or are they instead <em>accidents</em>, that is, not
stand-alone entities, but rather modifications of stand-alone entities,
the way for Aristotle <em>tall</em> is not a stand-alone subject, but
simply a <em>way</em> that a stand-alone subject can be? Ockham
began his career defending the first option, but ended it defending the
latter. The cause of this transformation was the sustained
attacks of Walter Chatton.</p>

<p>

Ockham’s early theory of concepts, often dubbed ‘the
<em>fictum</em> theory’, was probably influenced in some measure
by the work or at least the terminology of Peter Auriol. According to
Ockham’s first account, a concept is an Aristotelian substance, but not a
normal material substance, such as a human being, nor a nonmaterial
substance, such as an angel – such beings can be the subjects of
accidents and so could be said to have <em>esse subjectivum</em>
(=subjective being) – rather, concepts are in an entirely
different class of substances, which have the sort of existence in the
mind that an object fashioned by thought has, to wit, <em>esse
objectivum</em> (the being of a thought-object), or, as he sometimes
says, a concept is a <em>fictum</em> (=a mentally-fashioned being).</p>

<p>

Chatton criticized this theory relentlessly, primarily on the ground
that concepts as <em>ficta</em> are an unnecessary intermediary
between the cognizer and the thing cognized, such that the cognizer
would be immediately aware only of the general concept, and not of the
individuals picked out by the general concept. In short, the
<em>fictum</em> theory is not consistent with direct realism, which
was a hallmark of Ockhamist epistemology. Chatton suggested that it
made the most sense from an Aristotelian point of view to treat
concepts as accidents, and not as substances at all. On Chatton’s
view, concepts are modifications of the soul, and in particular my
concept of <span class="MathJax_Preview" style="color: inherit;"><span class="MJXp-math" id="MJXp-Span-260"><span class="MJXp-mi MJXp-italic" id="MJXp-Span-261">X</span></span></span><span class="MathJax MathJax_Processing" id="MathJax-Element-121-Frame" tabindex="0"></span><script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-121">X</script> is nothing more than my act of thinking about

Concepts are not intermediaries that we then think with,
but are rather simply our very acts of thinking themselves, i.e., my
concept of <span class="MathJax_Preview" style="color: inherit;"><span class="MJXp-math" id="MJXp-Span-264"><span class="MJXp-mi MJXp-italic" id="MJXp-Span-265">X</span></span></span><span class="MathJax MathJax_Processing" id="MathJax-Element-123-Frame" tabindex="0"></span><script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-123">X</script> is just my <em>intellectio</em> (=act of

In response to Chatton’s criticism and his
positive alternative, Ockham abandoned his <em>fictum</em> theory, at
first with some hesitation, wavering between this early theory and
Chatton’s new <em>intellectio</em> model, subsequently embracing it
more fully, and finally, in his most mature philosophical reflection
on the topic, even arguing against the old <em>fictum</em> theory. The
stages of Ockham’s change of mind are well documented in the different
versions of his commentary on the <em>Sentences</em>, and are even an
important source for our dating of those different versions.</p>

<h2 id="VirtInte">8. Virtues and Intentions</h2>

<p>

Throughout the late 1320s and into the 1330s Chatton became
increasingly interested in questions of virtue and vice, the objects of
moral acts, and the role of intentions in
 ethics.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-12" id="ref-12">12</a>]</sup>
 Much of what he says
follows or agrees with Scotus and opposes Ockham.</p>

<p>

Mediaeval philosophers often made much of the distinction between
willing or intending to do a thing and actually doing it. Let
<span class="MathJax_Preview" style="color: inherit;"><span class="MJXp-math" id="MJXp-Span-268"><span class="MJXp-mi MJXp-italic" id="MJXp-Span-269">A</span></span></span><span class="MathJax MathJax_Processing" id="MathJax-Element-125-Frame" tabindex="0"></span><script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-125">A</script> be any action that a human being might contemplate, choose,
and want to execute. Then person <span class="MathJax_Preview" style="color: inherit;"><span class="MJXp-math" id="MJXp-Span-270"><span class="MJXp-mi MJXp-italic" id="MJXp-Span-271">P</span></span></span><span class="MathJax MathJax_Processing" id="MathJax-Element-126-Frame" tabindex="0"></span><script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-126">P</script>’s <em>willing
<span class="MathJax_Preview" style="color: inherit;"><span class="MJXp-math" id="MJXp-Span-272"><span class="MJXp-mi MJXp-italic" id="MJXp-Span-273">A</span></span></span><span class="MathJax MathJax_Processing" id="MathJax-Element-127-Frame" tabindex="0"></span><script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-127">A</script></em> is considered an <em>interior act</em> with respect to
<span class="MathJax_Preview" style="color: inherit;"><span class="MJXp-math" id="MJXp-Span-274"><span class="MJXp-mi MJXp-italic" id="MJXp-Span-275">A</span></span></span><span class="MathJax MathJax_Processing" id="MathJax-Element-128-Frame" tabindex="0"></span><script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-128">A</script>, because the willing is internal to the human soul. This is
meant to contrast with the corresponding <em>exterior act</em>, that
is, the event that <span class="MathJax_Preview" style="color: inherit;"><span class="MJXp-math" id="MJXp-Span-276"><span class="MJXp-mi MJXp-italic" id="MJXp-Span-277">P</span></span></span><span class="MathJax MathJax_Processing" id="MathJax-Element-129-Frame" tabindex="0"></span><script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-129">P</script> <em>actually executes

Note that <span class="MathJax_Preview" style="color: inherit;"><span class="MJXp-math" id="MJXp-Span-280"><span class="MJXp-mi MJXp-italic" id="MJXp-Span-281">A</span></span></span><span class="MathJax MathJax_Processing" id="MathJax-Element-131-Frame" tabindex="0"></span><script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-131">A</script> itself may be in some sense
‘interior’, e.g., let <span class="MathJax_Preview" style="color: inherit;"><span class="MJXp-math" id="MJXp-Span-282"><span class="MJXp-mi MJXp-italic" id="MJXp-Span-283">A</span><span class="MJXp-mo" id="MJXp-Span-284" style="margin-left: 0.333em; margin-right: 0.333em;">=</span></span></span><span class="MathJax MathJax_Processing" id="MathJax-Element-132-Frame" tabindex="0"></span><script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-132">A =</script> thinking well
of my enemy. Then, although <span class="MathJax_Preview" style="color: inherit;"><span class="MJXp-math" id="MJXp-Span-285"><span class="MJXp-mi MJXp-italic" id="MJXp-Span-286">A</span></span></span><span class="MathJax MathJax_Processing" id="MathJax-Element-133-Frame" tabindex="0"></span><script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-133">A</script> is itself internal inasmuch as
thinking takes place in my mind, nevertheless we can distinguish the
interior act of <em>willing to think well of my enemy</em> from the
exterior act <em>thinking well of my enemy</em>. Thus
‘interior’ and ‘exterior’ here signify
primarily the distinction between choosing to do <span class="MathJax_Preview" style="color: inherit;"><span class="MJXp-math" id="MJXp-Span-287"><span class="MJXp-mi MJXp-italic" id="MJXp-Span-288">A</span></span></span><span class="MathJax MathJax_Processing" id="MathJax-Element-134-Frame" tabindex="0"></span><script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-134">A</script> and doing

se.</p>

<p>

It was Ockham’s considered view, evidenced in many of his writings,
that only the interior act was properly regarded as meritorious or
sinful; the corresponding exterior act makes no moral difference.
Ockham is unwilling to allow external factors to play any significant
role in moral evaluation. Chatton argues against this in many ways, the
most effective being theological: for example, Christ always willed to
redeem humanity, so if willing were sufficient, then his exterior act
of being executed on the cross was unnecessary. Similarly, intending to
confess would be as meritorious as actually confessing. However,
Chatton also points out several philosophical disadvantages to Ockham’s
overall position.</p>

<p>

Ockham’s insistence that the interior act alone is subject to moral
appraisal leads him to pack as much as he can into the act of will to
be evaluated, and Chatton often criticized this strategy as
disingenuous. For example, Ockham seemed to think of the objects of
moral acts as anything the intellect needs to consider in advising the
will to act, including even the circumstances under which the act is
done; acts are finely distinguished with circumstances as a part of
their identity conditions. For example, we cannot evaluate the internal
act ‘willing to tell a lie’, since it is too general; to
properly identify and evaluate this interior act we must specify it with
all its morally relevant circumstances. So, strictly speaking, we
should rather evaluate whether it is right to will to tell a lie to
cover up a certain fact, to a certain person, to whom we are related in
a certain way, etc.</p>

<p>

Chatton opposed this view. The objects of moral acts can (and often
should) be thought of in a far more reduced sense, including only the
exterior action of the actor himself, which the intellect approves and
which the will then wills (that is, the case of <em>virtuous</em>
acts). Circumstances are, properly speaking, variables existing on the
perimeter of a moral act, while the objects and goals of acts are,
properly speaking, more intimate to the act itself. Chatton admits
that sometimes, when the will has a complex object that includes
temporal, causal, or locative qualifiers, these
‘circumstances’ can be said in a certain way to be an
object of the act. But such conditions, insofar as they are objects of
the act, are therefore not in the same way <em>the environment
surrounding</em> the act, and so are no longer really
<em>circumstances</em> in those cases. There are two practical
implications of this point. (1) Ockham writes and argues as though in
his ethics he considers only internal factors in moral evaluation, and
excludes the external completely, but this result is obtained only by
sneaking in external factors through the back door, and building them
into the objects of the will, making them internal only by <em>ad
hoc</em> stipulation. (2) If, with Chatton and against Ockham, we
reject the idea that every act of will must include all its
circumstances as a partial object, we thereby make it possible to say
that some acts of will are intrinsically good (or bad) no matter what
circumstances they are done in. This possibility is important for
Ockhamist ethics, because Ockham insists that there is (and indeed
that there must be) at least one intrinsically good act of will, which
he identifies with loving God for his own sake. But if we always roll
the circumstances of an act up with the intended object of the act,
then it is possible to make any seemingly virtuous act wicked by
‘in-building’ bad intent, and so no act can be
intrinsically virtuous. Chatton constructs this example against
Ockham:</p>

<blockquote>For example, when I love my neighbor for the sake of God,
it is required that love of God move me toward a love of neighbor. But
this fact can be understood in two ways. (1) It can be understood that
the object <em>taken as a whole</em> is loved, that is, the entire
object <em>neighbor for the sake of God</em>. In this case the act that
has this as an object can be done malevolently, say for the sake of
desirability, or more for the sake of desirability than for the glory
of God. (2) Alternatively, my friend could be loved by me for the sake
of God in the sense that love of God itself is the very thing that
moves me and causes my love of him. In this second case the love is
virtuous. (<em>Quodlibet</em> question 12, paragraph 14.)</blockquote>

<p>

Similarly, a person could love God for his own sake for the sake of
something unworthy:</p>

<blockquote>I say that the act of ‘loving God for his own
sake’ can, as a whole, be done malevolently; therefore, in order
that it be done benevolently, some additional necessary factor must be
present. It is clear that this act can be done malevolently,
since a person can have as his total object <em>loving God for his own
sake for the sake of money</em>. (<em>Quodlibet</em> question 12,
paragraph 13)</blockquote>

<p>

It might be objected that <em>loving God for his own sake for the
sake of money</em> is an impossible object for the will, since good and
evil objects or motives cancel each other out. But it is not clear how
this affects Chatton’s point, since the human will really can (and
sometimes does) have impossible objects and motives associated with
it.</p>

<h2 id="Conc">9. Conclusion</h2>

<p>

It is sometimes suggested that Walter Chatton was not a very
original philosopher. There is some fairness in this claim, but it is
also a little misleading. What is true is that he is not as
recognizably important a figure today as Ockham or Aquinas, and that
his philosophy tends to be negative (i.e., critical) and conservative
in character, in the following respect: in many of his writings
we find him attacking the novel work of others, frequently Ockham, and
sometimes defending the more accepted work of others, frequently
Scotus. Moreover, he did not strive to develop and set out a unique
systematic view of reality, that is, a <em>system</em> of his own. But,
in fairness, such was not the goal of philosophical theology in the
fourteenth century. Moreover, as the examples above show, Chatton was
philosophically quite creative, and incisive in his attacks on
Ockham’s thought. So while we find no evidence of a large following after his
death (there was no large Chattonian ‘school’ or
‘movement’ that we know of), he did have considerable
influence well into the middle of the fifteenth century in England,
particularly on those who reacted strongly to Ockham’s nominalism and
semantic theory, and also in the intricate and intense debate over
future contingents.</p>

Prologus</em>”. Not really a separate work, this is simply the most
polished version of the prologue of his <em>Sentences</em> commentaries
listed above; it may have been meant as an introduction to his
<em>Lectura</em>, and probably dates to the same period.</li>

<li><em>Quodlibet</em>. We have only an unpublished transcription of

Pontifical Institute of Mediaeval Studies, 1982. The author is listed
therein as ‘pseudo-Richard Campsall’, and his real identity
is unknown. Chatton is sometimes suggested as a candidate for
authorship but it is not likely his work. However, it shows his
influence quite clearly, and cites his anti-razor explicitly in two
places.</li>

<li><em>Quaestio de compositione continui</em>. This is a defense of
Chatton’s indivisibilist stance on the continuum. The textual evidence
for attributing this work to him is weak, but the <em>Quaestio</em> is
doctrinally very close to Chatton’s views in <em>Reportatio</em> II,
and quotes that work verbatim. It is edited in Murdoch and Synan, “Two

Wodeham, O.F.M.” <em>Franciscan Studies</em> 26 (1966): 212–88.</li>
