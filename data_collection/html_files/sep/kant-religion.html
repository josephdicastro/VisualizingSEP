<h1>Kant’s Philosophy of Religion</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Tue Jun 22, 2004; substantive revision Fri Jul 18, 2014</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>

Throughout his career, Immanuel Kant engaged many of the major issues
that contemporary philosophy groups together under the heading
“philosophy of religion.” These include arguments for the
existence of God, the attributes of God, the immortality of the soul,
the problem of evil, and the relationship of moral principles to
religious belief and practice. In the writings from his so-called
“pre-critical” period, i.e., before the publication of the
<em>Critique of Pure Reason</em> in 1781, Kant was interested
principally in the theoretical status and function of the concept of
God. He thus sought to locate the concept of God within a
systematically ordered set of basic philosophical principles that
account for the order and structure of world. In developing his
critical philosophy he proposed a new role for philosophical
principles in understanding the order and structure of the world. As a
result, the critical project had a significant impact upon his
treatment of the status and the role of the concept of God within the
theoretical enterprise of metaphysics. In addition, the critical
philosophy provided a locus from which Kant could address other
important dimensions of the concepts of God and religion more
explicitly than he had done in his earlier writings. Chief among these
are the moral and the religious import that human beings attribute to
the concept of God.  In view of these developments in Kant's thinking
this entry thus will locate his earlier discussions of these topics
within the general philosophical context of his pre-critical period;
it will then reference his treatment of these topics after 1781 to key
elements of his critical project. It will also highlight issues that
remain important for philosophical inquiry into religion. These are
the philosophical function of the concept of God, arguments for the
existence of God, the relationship between morality and religion
(including the notions of “moral faith” and “radical
evil”), and the role of religion in the dynamics of human
culture and history. A supplementary section, 
 “<a href="supplement.html">The Influence of Kant's Philosophy of Religion</a>,” 
 discusses the impact of Kant's account of religion upon subsequent
philosophical and theological inquiry.</p>

<h2><a id="OveBac">1. Overview and background</a></h2>

<p> Among the important early works of Kant that touched upon the
topic of God are <em>A New Exposition of the First Principles of
Metaphysical Knowledge</em> (1755), <em>Universal Natural History and
Theory of the Heavens</em> (1755), and <em>The One Possible Basis for
a Demonstration of the Existence of God</em> (1763).  These writings
were shaped by his interest in problems in the natural sciences (or,
in the terminology of his era, “natural philosophy”) and
by an intellectual context in which rationalist philosophies stemming
from the work of Leibniz and Wolff held general sway. His treatment of
topics such as the relationship of the power of God to the order of
the universe was thus primarily aimed in these and other early
writings to situate an understanding of the concept of God within
those fields of philosophical inquiry called “metaphysics”
and “cosmology.” The former was concerned with
articulating the general principles of all that is, while the latter
focused on the physical principles governing the workings of the
natural universe.</p>

<p>

At this early stage, Kant's discussions of the concept of God do not
focus primarily upon on what <em>religious</em> content and function
this concept may have for humans and their activity — e.g., how
God may be an object of worship. Their focus is more upon properly
locating the concept of God within a systematically ordered set of
basic <em>philosophical</em> principles that account for the order and
structure of world. This interest in the theoretical status and
function of the concept of God continues throughout Kant's entire
career. One result is that even in much later writings his treatment of
issues of interest to philosophers of religion will be found not only
in treatises that focus on religion as a specific form of human
activity (e.g., <em>Religion within the Boundaries of Mere Reason</em>)
or in the courses on “philosophical theology” that he
occasionally gave in the University of Königsberg (published after
his death as <em>Lectures on the Philosophical Doctrine of
Religion</em>). Some of Kant's important analyses and arguments that
bear on questions of religious concepts, beliefs and practices are
found instead in the works written primarily to advance the agenda of
the critical philosophy he inaugurated with the 1781 publication of the
<em>Critique of Pure Reason</em>.</p>

<p>

That project, inasmuch as it proposed a new role for philosophical
principles in understanding the order and structure of the world, had a
significant impact upon Kant's treatment of the status and the role of
the concept of God within the theoretical enterprise of metaphysics. It
also provided a locus in which Kant would address more explicitly a
number of important issues connected with the religious import that
human beings attribute to the concept of God. In consequence, Kant's
critical philosophy developed, on the one hand, a more fundamental line
of argument than he had previously deployed against standard
rationalist accounts of God's relationship to the ordering of the
world. In those accounts, the concept of God stood as the supreme
constitutive element in such ordering, i.e., as the fundamental
explanatory principle as well as the ultimate and absolute causal
ground of the world. Against this view, Kant will argue that the
concept of God properly functions only as a “regulative”
— i.e., limiting — principle in causal accounts of the
spatio-temporal order of the world. Kant's critical philosophy thus
undercuts what rationalist metaphysics had offered as proofs for the
existence of God. On the other hand, the critical philosophy does more
than simply dismantle the conceptual scaffolding on which previous
philosophical accounts of the concept of God had been constructed. In a
positive vein, it more fully articulates an account of the function
that an affirmation of God, made on the basis of what Kant terms
“moral faith,” plays in human efforts to sustain
conscientious moral endeavor throughout the course of life.</p>

<p>

While Kant's scientific interests and the traditions of
philosophical rationalism influenced the initial trajectory of his
treatment of God as a key concept for metaphysics, other aspects of his
historical and social context also played a role in setting the stage
for his treatment of religion — particularly in the mature stages
of his critical philosophy — as a feature of human life and
culture. Among the most important was his upbringing in the milieu of
Pietism, a reform movement within German Lutheranism that stressed
inner religious conversion and upright conduct over doctrinal
exactness. Kant's parents were Pietists and his early education took
place in the Collegium Fridericianum, a school established by the
Pietist pastor, F. A. Schultz. Kant retained an appreciation for the
inner moral conscientiousness that Pietism sought to foster as
fundamental to religion even as he reacted strongly against the
external ritual and devotional practices of Christian public worship
and prayer that Pietism continued to promote. A second important factor
in the development of his philosophical approach to understanding
religion was his long-standing interest in the variety of human
cultures and the dynamics of human social interaction. This provided
Kant with a perspective from which to view religion as principally a
human phenomenon in which the various aspects of our human make-up
— the sensible, the intellectual, the historical and the social
— interact in ways that are significant for understanding
humanity's role in the cosmos.</p>

<p>

One consequence of the interplay of these multiple elements in shaping
Kant's thinking is that no single work of his on religion — even
his most extensive treatment in <em>Religion within the Boundaries of
Mere Reason</em> — provides a comprehensive overview of his
analyses and reflections on religion. No one work brings them together
into a systematically organized “philosophy of religion.”
Any account of Kant's philosophical treatment of religious concepts
and of the human phenomenon of religion, moreover, must attend not
only to the context in which his own thinking on these matters took
shape but also to developments and changes in his views that occur in
the course of five decades of philosophical reflection.  The rest of
this entry thus will locate the more important works in which Kant's
discussion of these topics takes place, first, within the general
philosophical context of his so-called “pre-critical”
period; it will then reference his treatment of these topics after
1781 to key points on the philosophical agenda of his critical
project. As part of this chronologically ordered overview, it will
highlight issues that Kant addresses which remain important for
philosophical inquiry into religion. These are the philosophical
function of the concept of God, arguments for the existence of God,
the relationship between morality and religion (including his notion
of “moral faith” and his treatment of “radical
evil”), and the role of religion in the dynamics of human
culture and history. A supplementary section will
note a number of ways in which Kant's account of religion has
influenced the subsequent course of philosophical and theological
inquiry. Kant's treatment of these issues has been such that he can be
considered one of the thinkers whose work helped to establish
philosophy of religion as a distinct field for specialized
philosophical inquiry. At the same time, his work on religion also
placed important items on the agenda for subsequent theological
discussions. A brief consideration will also be given to these
theological consequences of his work, since they are sometimes
overlooked in accounts of his philosophy of religion.</p>

<h2><a id="KanPreCriDisGod">2. Kant's pre-critical discussions of God</a></h2>

<p>

Kant's early writings such as <em>A New Exposition of the First
Principles of Metaphysical Knowledge</em> (1755), <em>Universal Natural
History and Theory of the Heavens</em> (1755), and <em>The One
Possible Basis for a Demonstration of the Existence of God</em> (1763),
engage the concept of God in terms of principles and arguments that had
been framed by the metaphysical systems of Leibniz and Wolff as well as
by the theoretical structure of Newtonian physics. Kant had not yet
articulated a definitive break with the approach of the rationalist
metaphysics of his predecessors, so his discussions presuppose the
validity of the enterprise of constructing an adequate theoretical
argument for the existence of God. Even so, he makes a number of points
in these works that prefigure key arguments that his mature critical
philosophy will later raise against the way rationalist metaphysics had
traditionally treated the status and function of the concept of God. In
particular, these works show that Kant was already concerned to address
the three main lines of argument that he took these traditions
characteristically to employ for demonstrating the existence of God:
the ontological argument, the cosmological argument, and the
physico-theological argument (Dell'Oro, 1994).</p>

<h3><a id="ArgForExiGodPreCriPer">2.1 Arguments for the existence of God: Pre-critical period</a></h3>

<p>

Among the three early works noted above, Kant's most focused
treatment of these arguments for the existence of God can be found in
<em>The One Possible Basis for a Demonstration of the Existence of
God</em>. He classifies arguments for God under just two headings, one
that moves to the affirmation of God from a rational concept of the
possible, the second that moves from experiential concepts of existent
things. The ontological argument, as well as the argument Kant himself
poses in this work as the only valid one, fall under the first heading.
The cosmological and the physico-theological arguments fall under the
second heading.</p>

<p>

With respect to the positions about the validity and value of
theoretical arguments for the existence of God that Kant later espouses
and which are considered his definitive views, there are three features
worth noting from this earlier work:</p>

<p>

First, he has already formulated a central feature of the main
objection that he will raise against the ontological argument in the
<em>Critique of Pure Reason</em>, namely, that existence is not a
predicate. Kant's objection is directed against rationalist accounts
that took the judgment “Something exists” to predicate a
property — i.e., “existence” — that is included
in the concept of that thing. (An example of a property so predicated
would be “extension” as a property of the concept
“physical object.”) Fundamental to the ontological argument
is the view that “existence” is necessarily a property of
the concept of God. This then functions as the decisive consideration
for the conclusion that God must exist. Against this, Kant argues that
in no case — even that of God — can we predicate
“existence” to be a property that is included in the
concept of any object. He illustrates this by pointing out that the
difference between the one-hundred dollars in my pocket and the one
hundred dollars I imagine to be in my pocket is not a difference in the
<em>concept</em> of “one hundred dollars.” To say that
something “exists” — even in the case of God —
is not to predicate a property that its concept lacks if the thing did
not exist.</p>

<p>

Second, at this earlier stage of his philosophical development he
holds, in contrast to the position he takes in his critical philosophy,
that there can be a theoretical argument that validly leads to the
conclusion that God exists; of note about the argument he proposes,
moreover, is that it falls under the same heading under which he has
classified the ontological argument, namely an argument that starts
from a concept of the possible.</p>

<p>

Third, he groups the cosmological and physico-theological arguments
under a single heading as “cosmological,” inasmuch as he
sees each making an inference to God from our experience of things as
they exist in the world, but he already differentiates them from one
another in terms of their relative cogency and persuasive power. One
line of argument — which he will designate in his later
terminology as the “cosmological argument” — moves in
terms of a concept of causality to its conclusion that there must be a
first necessary being. He does not consider this line of argument,
which he sees as characteristic of metaphysics in the tradition of
Wolff, to be valid. As in his later criticism of this argument in the
first <em>Critique</em>, he sees it ultimately resting upon the same
conceptual considerations that function within the ontological
argument, most notably the claim that existence is a predicate. The
other — which he will designate in his later terminology as the
“physico-theological” argument — moves from
observations of order and harmony in the world to its conclusion that
there must be a wise creator of that order. This argument he also finds
lacking in strict probative force; he nonetheless considers it an
important marker of the dynamics of human reason to seek an explanatory
totality, even though it does not thereby provide a sure demonstrative
route to an affirmation of God.</p>

<h2><a id="KanRelDurCriPer">3. Kant's Philosophy of Religion during the Critical Period</a></h2>
<p>

Kant has long been seen as hostile to faith. Many of his
contemporaries, ranging from his students to the Prussian authorities,
saw his Critical project as inimical to traditional Christianity. The
impression of Kant as fundamentally a secular philosopher became even
more deeply entrenched through the Twentieth Century, due in part to
various interpretative conventions (such P.F. Strawson's
“principle of significance”) whereby the meaningfulness
and/or thinkability of the supersensible is denied, as well as through
an artifact of how Kant's philosophy religion is introduced to
most, namely through the widespread anthologization of his objections
to the traditional proofs for God's existence.</p>

<p>

Although the secular interpretation of Kant is widespread, it is
belied by a significant share of the Critical corpus. Not only do we
find powerful defenses of religious belief in all
three <em>Critique</em>s, but a considerable share of Kant's work
in the 1790s is devoted to the positive side of his philosophy of
religion. This includes his 1791 “Theodicy”
essay, <em>Religion within the Boundaries of Mere Reason</em>,
“The End of All Things,” “Real Progress,” and
the <em>Conflict of the Faculties</em>. Moreover, his lectures on
logic, <em>Reflexionen</em>, and the Jäsche Logic present
a robust account of the nature of religious belief/faith
[<em>Glaube</em>]. So, while Kant does deny the possibility of
religious knowledge (as well as opinion), he considers this denial
necessary to safeguard faith, as the proper mode of religious assent.
One must, therefore, understand the negative elements in his philosophy
of religion, such as his infamous objections to the traditional proofs
for God's existence, in this context. As stated in the B-Preface
to the <em>Critique of Pure Reason</em>, a central goal of the
Critical project is to establish the limits to knowledge “in
order to make room for faith” (Bxxx).</p>

<p>

Accordingly, throughout Kant's writings, we find ample discussions
of religious issues. These are, in many instances, clearly affirmative,
though they are often framed within objections to theoretical
reason's enchroachments into the domain that is instead proper to
faith. Although his discussions of God and immortality are familiar to
most Kantians, the Critical corpus moves well beyond just these.
Especially in the 1790s, we find detailed studies of the nature of
faith, biblical hermeneutics, miracles, revelation, as well as many
distinctively Christian doctrines such as Original Sin, Vicarious
Atonement, the Trinity, and the Virgin Birth.</p>

<p>

Unfortunately, however, the many positive elements of Kant's
philosophy of religion have been eclipsed by its initial negative
moments, moments not meant to oppose religion, but rather reflective of
Kant's continuing commitment to the Lutheranism (or more
precisely, the anti-liturgical Lutheran Pietism) of his youth. Just as
with Luther's own negative polemics against religious despotism
and scholastic arcana, we see in Kant a parallel dialectic, where he,
rather than opposing religion, sought to free it from the
“monopoly of the schools” and set it on a footing suitable
to “the common human understanding” (Bxxxii). Hence, as we
will discuss through this entry, the aforementioned passage, that he
sought out the limits to knowledge [<em>Wissen</em>] in order to
“make room for faith [<em>Glaube</em>]” (Bxxx), is not an
empty bromide, but is rather the key anthem for his overall philosophy
of religion.</p>

<h3><a id="RecVieBacPreFor">3.1 The Received View: its Background and its Present Form</a></h3>

<p>

The dominant interpretative tendency can be traced back to various
figures of the late Eighteenth Century who spoke out against the threat
they perceived in Kant's work. This includes, most notoriously,
members of the <em>Ältere Tübinger Schule</em> as well as the
Prussian Censors installed under the reign of Frederick William II.
Kant's work on religion, nevertheless, did inspire many,
including the young Fichte as well as many theologians within the
compass of the Liberal Christian movement such as Schleiermacher and
Ritschl. Many prominent Neo-Kantians have likewise recognized the
duality of Kant's approach to the philosophy of religion, and
thus we see, particularly in the works of Hermann Cohen and Bruno
Bauch, explorations of Kant's Lutheran roots as well as the
ecumenical implications of <em>Religion within the Boundaries of Mere
Reason</em>'s “Pure Rational System of Religion.”</p>

<p>

By the mid-Twentieth Century, however, Kant's attempts to
“make room for faith” were being ignored or dismissed as
incompatible with the broader Critical Project. Through various early
Anglophone interpreters, most notably through P. F. Strawson and his
“principle of significance,” the image of Kant as a
proto-positivist gained dominance, and the epistemic strictures of
Transcendental Idealism came to be seen as barriers not just to
religious assent but even to the meaningfulness of any propositions
regarding the supersensible. Reinforced by Norman Kemp Smith's
maladroit translation of both <em>Wissen</em> and <em>Erkenntnis</em>
as “knowledge,” important distinctions were blurred and the
affirmative religious elements found throughout the corpus came to be
seen as unfortunate “wobbles” that detracted from what
should have been a more thoroughgoingly secular philosophy.</p>

<p>

As a result, <em>Religion</em>, despite its daring and original
philosophical theology, has been given only a small fraction of the
attention that his other books have received. With the exception of
Part One's account of moral evil, the remainder of the text has
been dismissed as a marginal work, maligned as a capitulation to the
Christian powers of Kant's day, or just a garrulous account of
our moral ideals symbolically portrayed in an “imaginatively
enhanced or pictorial form.” So, despite all that
<em>Religion</em> contains, philosophers and theologians have instead
assumed that the negative elements of the <em>Critique of Pure
Reason</em> adequately capture Kant's views on religion.</p>

<h3><a id="GodCriPurReaTraDia">3.2 God in the <em>Critique of Pure Reason</em>'s Transcendental Dialectic</a></h3>

<h4>3.2.1 The <em>Ens Realissimum</em></h4>

<p>

The Transcendental Dialectic's “Ideal of Reason”
contains the best known and most frequently anthologized components of
Kant's philosophy of religion. In addition to its portrayal of
the <em>ens realissimum</em>, one finds within it Kant's
objections to the Ontological, Cosmological and Physico-theological
(Design) arguments for God's existence. It is thus the text most
central to the negative elements of Kant's philosophy of religion
and is integral to the widely held view that Kant is deeply hostile to
faith.</p>

<p>

The general aim of the Transcendental Dialectic is to expose
reason's excesses, its drive to move beyond the limits of
possible experience, and to bring all concepts into a systematic unity
under an “unconditioned condition.” The Transcendental
Dialectic begins with a critique of reason's illusions and errors
within the sphere of Rational Psychology. It then moves on to a
critique of cosmological metaphysics, and then to the “Ideal of
Reason” where Kant turns to Rational Theology and its pursuit of
religious knowledge.</p>

<p>

As Kant explains, underlying all the traditional proofs for
God's existence is the concept of the <em>ens realissimum</em>,
the most real being. Reason comes to the idea of this being through the
principle that every individuated object is subject to the
“principle of <em>complete</em> determination.” While the
generality of concepts allow them to be less than fully determined
(e.g. our concept of a horse extends over horses that are different
colors, heights, etc.), individuated objects must be completely
determined (e.g. an individual horse must have specific colors, a
specific height, etc.).</p>

<p>

Hence, where the particular determinations of actual objects are
discovered through experience, our concepts, which in themselves are
not objects of experience, necessarily remain partly indeterminate.
Nevertheless, reason can construct for itself what is on the one hand
still an abstraction but yet also an individuated entity. Kant refers
to such entities as “ideals” and in most instances they are
used by us regulatively as archetypes for reflection. For example, when
considering whether or not to get a pet, one might envision an ideal
pet, a pet with the optimal set of desirable attributes. Such an
archetype for thought, however, is still not completely determined, for
the ideal can still be neutral between various attributes that are not
regarded as relevant to one's interests (for example, one may not
consider any specific nostril width salient to one's choice of
pet).</p>

<p>

By contrast, the <em>ens realissimum</em> is the concept of an
individual object that is completely determined, and is such through
reason alone. In the case of most ideals, their determinations are the
result of various empirical concepts as well as various subjective
interests (such as what one believes a pet would bring to one's
daily life). However, in the <em>ens realissimum</em>, all its
determinations are set solely through reason's formal application
of the principle of complete determination, aggregating together all
possible predicates and selecting from these predicates all those which
have a fully positive reality (no negative predicates, no derivative
predicates). That is, following the concept of “the most real
being,” reason brings together all possible predicates and
eliminates those which involve some limitation or deficiency.</p>

<p>

In doing this, the faculty does not violate any of the standards
Kant sets out within Transcendental Idealism, for reason is merely
applying the formal principle of complete determination to all possible
predicates and constructing an idea (or more precisely, an ideal)
thereby. This construction can then be entertained by the intellect, or
perhaps, used as a regulative principle, as one does with other less
grand ideals. </p>

<p>
Transcendental error comes in, however, if reason also
then tenders the <em>ens realissimum</em> as not merely a formal
construct but as the metaphysical ground of all that is: since it (in
principle) contains all determinations, and these determinations are of
actual entities, a “transcendental subreption” may occur
that transforms the <em>ens realissimum</em> from just an intellectual
construct into a metaphysical reality as the sum total of all
actuality.</p>

<p>

As with other transcendental errors, we can subreptively conflate a
subjective principle, generated by our intellects and of only
regulative use, to one that is objective – a real being not
constructed in thought, but discovered through thought. Such, we may
say, is the source of error in Spinoza's use of substance and in other
monistic metaphysics. Our construction of the <em>ens realissimum</em>
has the appearance of an actual unity since it is the concept of the
sum total of all positive predicates. This appearance then casts an
illusion unrecognized by the metaphysicians, leading them into the
subreptive error.</p>

<h4>3.2.2 Kant's Critique of the Traditional Arguments for God's Existence</h4>
<p>

According to the Ontological Argument, it is self-evident from the
idea of the most real being that that being exists. Whatever it is that
is this most real being, it must include all predicates that contribute
to its greatness or reality; and given that actual existence is
(allegedly) one such predicate, whatever it is that is the most real
being is therefore a being who by definition must exist. Hence, if one
were to compare two beings, both equally great in all respects except
that one exists and one does not, the one that does not exist, by
virtue of its non-existence, is lacking a predicate that contributes to
the greatness of the other. The correct conception of <em>that than
which nothing greater can be conceived</em> must, therefore, include
existence.</p>

<p>

Kant's famous objection to this argument is that
“existence is not a predicate.” This is explained through
appeal to the distinction between an actual and non-actual unit of
currency, say one hundred dollars. Between the two, there is no
difference in the concepts of each: existence adds nothing to the
concept of one hundred dollars. So, when one claims that “one
hundred dollars exist,” one is not picking out one of its
predicates, part of the nature of a hundred dollars, but rather is just
“positing” that one has this hundred dollars. Likewise, to
claim that “the most real being exists” is merely to posit
its existence. It is not a statement about a property essential to this
being, for existence, as it is not a predicate or property, cannot be a
property of an essence.</p>

<p>

Kant's further contends that the Cosmological Argument is
parasitic on the Ontological. He demonstrates this by taking
Leibniz's Modal Argument as emblematic of all other Cosmological
Arguments and then contends that a being posited as necessary in order
to explain the contingency of creation has built into it the same error
as discussed above. According to Leibniz's Modal Argument, the
existence of a contingent reality can only be ultimately explained
through a cause whose existence is in itself necessary. However,
something whose existence is in itself necessary is something whose
existence cannot depend upon anything else but itself, its own nature.
This returns us to the Ontological Argument, or at least the
objectionable idea at its heart, for the necessary being that the
Cosmological Argument proposes is also the idea of a being whose
essence involves existence. So, as before, since existence is not a
predicate, Kant rejects the coherence of the idea of a being whose
existence depends upon nothing but its own nature.</p>

<p>

Kant's treatment of the Physico-Theological (Design) Argument
is, however, substantially different from the other two classic proofs.
While he still contends that it remains ultimately grounded upon the
Ontological Argument's assumption that existence is a predicate,
this objection does not cut to the argument's core. Surprisingly,
Kant expresses considerable sympathy for the Physico-Theological
Argument, and claims, for instance, that it “always deserves to
be mentioned with respect” (A623/B651). He describes it as
“the oldest, the clearest, and the most accordant with the common
reason of mankind” (A623/B651). He further regards it as having
considerable utility for the Natural Sciences, a point he repeats in
both the Appendix to the Transcendental Dialectic and in the Canon of
Pure Reason.</p>

<p>

In fact, Kant claims that the argument <em>succeeds</em> in at least
establishing “an <em>architect</em> of the world” and a
cause “proportioned” to the order of nature. So, up to this
point in the argument, he writes, “we have nothing to bring
against the rationality and utility of this procedure, but have rather
to commend it further” (A624/B652). What Kant cannot accept,
however, is its advance from a “Wise Author of Nature” to
an infinite creator. When it moves from architect to creator, it
proposes an “original” and “supreme” cause, and
in so doing, it calls for a being whose existence depends upon nothing
but itself. This returns us to the Cosmological/Modal argument, and
thus to its dependency on the Ontological.</p>

<h3><a id="VerPosPosKanRel">3.3 On The Very Possibility of a Positive Kantian Philosophy of Religion</a></h3>

<p>

Despite Kant's explicit claim that one of the underlying
drivers of Transcendental Idealism is to defend faith against
theoretical reason, it is widely believed that his philosophical system
powerfully challenges, if not outright bars, religious belief. His
criticisms of the traditional arguments for God's existence are
taken as illustrative of his opposition to religion, and the so-called
“Restriction Thesis” of Transcendental Idealism is regarded
as a barrier against all legitimate religious assent.</p>

<p>

According to Kant, we can have no knowledge of anything outside of
experience, outside the scope of the spatio-temporal-causal order.
Hence, there can be no knowledge of God, of the soul, of the afterlife,
or anything else beyond that order. To compound this restriction, Kant
also asserts that we also can have no “cognition”
[<em>Erkenntnis</em>] of objects outside the scope of experience. While
the former is less ambiguous, the latter has generated more debate,
hanging very much on what it is to have a “cognition.”</p>

<p>

Many have taken “cognition” to be a semantic notion, and
so have taken Kant's denial of the cognizability of the
supersensible as a denial of even the intelligibility of religious
concepts. Thus, it is not merely that we cannot prove whether or not
God exists, but the concept of God itself, like all other concepts
of supersensible entities and properties, (allegedly) cannot even have
meaning for us.</p>

<p>

The former position, that we can have no knowledge of the
supersensible, is textually well supported. Knowledge
[<em>Wissen</em>], for Kant, follows its traditional tripartite model
as justified-true-belief, and if there is neither experience nor
rational proof of any supersensible claim, no such claim can meet with
suitable justification.</p>

<p>

The latter position, that we can have no cognition of supersensible
objects, is likewise correct. However, the alleged implication that
this makes meaningful thought about them impossible is false. Kant does
not reject the thinkability of the supersensible, and, in fact, the
body of arguments in the Transcendental Dialectic shows this to be
clearly the case. If, for example, propositions about the supersensible
were incoherent according to Kant, then he would not need his
Antinomies or Paralogisms. Rather, he could sweep them all away quite
simply through the charge that they fall short of the conditions for
meaning.</p>

<p>

The problem, thus, is not that we cannot coherently think the
supersensible. It is, rather, that we can think about it in too many
ways. Absent experience, reason is without a touchstone through which
hypotheses can be refuted. Instead, so long as the ideas of reason are
internally consistent, the faculty can construct a multitude of theses and
antitheses about the supersensible. It can, moreover, argue quite
robustly in favor of each, something we see both in the Antinomies and
all the more grandly in the great tomes of the metaphysicians. The
problem, for Kant, is thus not about meaning, but rather it is
epistemic: having no possible experience of the supersensible, we lack
the theoretical resources to adjudicate between competing claims.
So, instead, to cognize, for Kant, is to think an object or proposition
in relation to the order of nature and the material conditions that
govern whether or not it obtains – what Kant calls the
cognition's “Real Possibility.” The conditions for
Real Possibility, in turn, provide the investigational framework
through which we can verify or falsify what is being cognized.</p>

<p>

“Cognition,” thus, is not a semantic notion, but
epistemic. It is a mode of thinking that is not just fanciful imagining
but is directed to objects whose reality can be determined. Thinking
requires merely the logical possibility of what is being entertained.
So long as it is not self-contradictory, it can be thought. Cognition,
by contrast, embeds the thought in the material conditions for, or the
Real Possibility of, the object of thought, something that is not
possible once one steps beyond the scope of possible experience.</p>

<p>

Hence, we cannot have a cognition of God because, as Kant argues in
the Transcendental Dialectic's Ideal of Reason, there is no
viable argument for God's existence. Likewise, we cannot prove or
disprove a miracle, for its alleged supersensible cause is not
something whose conditions are determinable for us. Even if we
experience some event whose cause is supersensible, we have no way
whatsoever to establish that this is so, and have nothing to guide our
hypotheses about how to test for miracles or how they come to be.</p>

<p>

None of this challenges the intelligibility of religious doctrines.
So long as they are not self-contradictory, they are thinkable. It is
just that their truth or falsehood cannot possibly be known. Moreover,
since they are not within the spectrum of epistemic evaluation, we
cannot opine regarding them, for opinion [<em>Meinung</em>], as Kant
understands the term, is a mode of assent based upon the weighing of
theoretical grounds (evidence and argument) for and against truth.</p>

<p>

Yet, this does not leave us with agnosticism either. Along with
knowledge and opinion, Kant identifies faith as our third legitimate
mode of holding-to-be-true [<em>Fürwahrhalten</em>]. Faith is, for
Kant, a mode of justified assent, though the nature of its
justification is quite different from opinion and knowledge. It is not
rooted in experience or argument, but rather in what he characterizes
as the “needs of practical reason.” Hence, for Kant,
religious belief finds its proper seat not in intellectual reflection
but in our practical lives. Issuing from his Lutheran heritage, Kant
regards the former, theoretical reason's attempt to have
knowledge, as a serious threat to authentic religion. When religion is
intellectualized, it alienates religion from the laity, makes them
dependent upon a special class of theological experts, and, further,
casts the appearance that it is through what one believes vs. how one
lives that one finds salvation (cf Bxxx-xxxii, 6:180-190, 7:36-69).</p>

<p>

Moreover, Kant sees faith, unlike knowledge, as engaging with our
will, calling it a “free assent.” This is important for the
practical function of faith, since our commitment to morality does not
so simply depend on our affirmation of the postulates, but in our free
act of faith through which we more completely bind ourselves to
morality. Morality, thus “inevitably leads to religion”
(6:6), since we need the latter in order to sustain or fully realize
our commitment to the former. This, however, must not be interpreted as
“theological ethics,” as if the authority of the moral law
depended upon God. It is not its authority that is in question (perhaps
with the exception of the argument at 5:114 in the <em>Critique of
Practical Reason</em>). Rather, this advance from morality to religion
concerns how we bind ourselves to the former (cf. A632/B660, 5:481,
6:3).</p>

<p>

Thus, from Kant's objections to the traditional proofs for
God's existence through to his rejection of supersensible
knowledge, the negative elements of his philosophy of religion are not
to be understood as denials of or even challenges to faith. They exist,
rather, in order to make sure that the true worth of religion is not
lost as a consequence of reason's excesses. Hence, despite more
than two centuries of interpreters who have regarded Kant's
criticisms as expressions of hostility, the barriers he establishes are
not meant to abolish faith but to save it. It is, thus, a profound
irony that Kant is so commonly portrayed in theological circles as the
greatest enemy to faith that has ever emerged out of the history of
philosophy. Not only is this incorrect, but it is an error that has
deprived theologians (perhaps Lutheran Theologians in particular) of an
important ally. Kant is not faith's enemy, but rather, one might
say, its champion in exile.</p>

<h3><a id="MorRatFai">3.4 Moral/Pure Rational Faith</a></h3>

<p>

According to Kant, there are three fundamental modes of (legitimate)
“holding-to-be-true” [<em>Fürwahrhalten</em>]:
knowledge, opinion, and faith. Whereas “persuasion”
[<em>Überredung</em>] arises out of psychological biases or
personal desires, knowledge, opinion and faith have grounds that are
objectively valid. In the case of knowledge and opinion, these grounds
are either experiential or theoretical proofs, while in the case of
faith, its grounds are in the “needs of practical reason.”
These needs, Kant maintains, are common to all, and thus in contrast to
the subjective and idiosyncratic bases of “persuasion,” the
grounds of faith, just like knowledge and opinion, are such that they
ought to bring all to the same assent. Hence, quite in contrast to the
popular conception of faith as a private mode of assent, with some sort
of personal grounding unique to each person, faith is elevated above
persuasion and made, like knowledge, a mode of legitimate
“conviction” [<em>Überzeugung</em>] because its
grounds, though still practical rather than theoretical/epistemic, are
nevertheless, objective and universal.</p>

<p>

The objective nature of faith is implicit in many of discussions,
but is articulated most directly in a footnote found within the
<em>Critique of Practical Reason</em>'s section “On Assent
from a Need of Pure Reason.” In this footnote, Kant responds to a
criticism advanced by Thomas Wizenmann, who accuses him of advancing a
form of religious assent that is ultimately just wishful thinking and
self-deception. As Wizenmann claims, just as a man in love may delude
himself about the putative beauty of his beloved, so likewise Kant has
us subreptively transfer our personal wants into objective claims.</p>

<p>

Kant's response is that a “need of practical
reason” is not a matter of inclination or mere psychological
bent. It is not, like desire, something idiosyncratic, contingent, or
variable from one person to the next. He asserts instead that this need
arises “from an <em>objective</em> determining ground of the
will” (5:143n) and, at least as argued in the <em>Critique of
Practical Reason</em>, the Highest Good is an object of faith for us,
because it is “an a priori necessary object of our will and
inseparably bound up with the moral law” (5:114). As such, he
contends that “the impossibility of the first must also prove the
falsity of the second” (5:114), and thus, our practical
conviction or faith is secured by something that necessarily pertains
to us all, via the authority and bindingness of the moral law.</p>

<p>

Nevertheless, there are some important ways in which practical
assent is distinct from its theoretical counterpart. As noted above, it
is a “free assent,” rather than a movement of the
intellect, as knowledge is often portrayed. In addition, Kant
distinguishes between the certainty of faith vs. that of knowledge,
noting that “I must not even say ‘It is morally certain
that there is a God,’ but rather ‘I am morally
certain’ (A829/B857). Hence, even though both faith and knowledge
are considered certain for us, and even though faith, like knowledge,
is a form of conviction rather than persuasion, the nature of the
commitment still does have, in its own way, a subjective quality.</p>

<p>

This quality may be understood through an analogy to
Descartes' <em>Cogito</em>. Like this famous argument, there is a
first-person privileged stance through which the certainty of faith
arises. We see this most clearly in the Second
<em>Critique</em>'s Fact of Reason. Although it is
“apodictically certain” it, nevertheless, “cannot be
proved by any deduction, by any efforts of the theoretical reason,
speculative or empirically supported” (5:47). It is, rather,
through the first-person awareness of one's own deliberative
activity that the bindingness of the moral law upon our own selves is
recognized (5:32). Hence, there is no argument we can communicate and
share to prove that we are all bound by the moral law. The certainty
instead is only available to each of us with regards to the bindingness
of the moral law for our own selves. Like the <em>Cogito</em>, we can
communicate to others what they must reflect upon in order to become
certain, but we cannot claim certainty about the bindingness of the
moral law upon them. The Fact of Reason has, rather, a first-person
character such that we can only be certain about the bindingness of the
moral law upon ourselves.</p>

<p>

This is why Kant claims that “Belief yields a conviction that
is not communicable (because of its subjective ground)”
(<em>Ref.</em> 2489). It further explains what he means here and
elsewhere (e.g. A829/B857) by the “subjective ground” of
faith. As should be apparent through his response to Wizenmann, the
subjective character of faith is quite distinct from the
subjective-psychological inclinations of persuasion. The causes for
assent in the case of the latter are common to all. By contrast, all
(finite) agents bound by the moral law encounter this law in accordance
with the Fact of Reason, and will all, likewise, face the “needs
of practical reason” that lead to the Highest Good and its
postulates.</p>

<p>

As previously mentioned, another important feature of faith for Kant
is that it allows us to extend cognition into the supersensible. This
does not mean that we gain through it some mystical intuition. Rather,
his claim is merely that unlike other thoughts about
things-in-themselves, we have some guidance through which we can
adjudicate between different possibilities. As is illustrated by the
Antinomies, Kant does not deny the thinkability of
things-in-themselves, but rather once concepts are extended beyond the
realm of experience, we are without a basis to justifiably endorse one
theoretical construction over another. By contrast, because the needs
of practical reason gives us direction, we can have a determinate
cognition of God. We do not merely muse about possibilities here, but
instead postulate an objective reality, one that is shaped and
justified by the needs of practical reason.</p>

<p>

It is, however, important to note that the above description
pertains to just “moral faith” or “pure rational
faith,” for Kant also uses <em>Glaube</em> quite expansively
through the corpus. This breadth is due in part to the simple fact that
<em>Glaube</em> has both a mundane and religious use, corresponding to
the English “belief” and “faith” respectively.
Second, it is important to note that many of Kant's discussions
of faith, especially those prior to 1790, are co-mingled with the
analyses found in Georg Friedrich Meier's <em>Auszug aus der
Vernunftlehre</em>, the textbook from which Kant lectured on logic for
forty years. Hence, it is important to recognize that Kant's own
understanding of faith developed over time, shifting away from
Meier's treatment, to one that became more tightly connected to
Kant's own practical philosophy.</p>

<p>

Lastly, we find in <em>Religion</em> and the <em>Conflict of
the Faculties</em> an array of new technical distinctions, including
“saving faith,” “servile faith,” and, most
importantly, “ecclesiastical faith” and “historical
faith.” Although the last of these terms is also used by Meier,
in <em>Religion</em>, Kant appropriates it for a different purpose. In
<em>Meier</em>, the term has to do with a belief based on testimony,
such as we find in Kant's Lectures on Logic as well as in his
1786 “What does it Mean to Orient Oneself in Thinking.”
However, in <em>Religion</em> (and in the <em>Conflict of the
Faculties</em>), Kant uses it to refer to actual religious traditions
and their doctrines. So, Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, etc. are
referred to as “historical faiths” and their doctrines are
objects of “historical faith” or “ecclesiastical
faith.” We will return to Kant's distinction between pure
rational faith and historical faith below.</p>

<h3><a id="HigGoo">3.5 The Highest Good</a></h3>

<p>

Kant's doctrine of the Highest Good is essential to his
positive philosophy of religion. With the exception of some musings
(esp. in the <em>Critique of Pure Reason</em>) about an assent driven
by our regulative employment of purposiveness (cf. B426, A670/B698 and
A826/B854), the proper path to religion is through the Highest Good,
for it is through this doctrine that he endorses God's existence
as well as the immortality of the soul. However, there are considerable
interpretative difficulties here, due in part to various artifacts of
the secondary literature, and due as well to the significant
differences in how Kant argues for the Highest Good in each of the
three <em>Critique</em>s and in <em>Religion.</em> We will consider
each of these arguments in turn, but before doing so, let us first
explore the doctrine itself, what Kant takes to be the Highest
Good.</p>

<h4>3.5.1 What is the Highest Good?</h4>

<p>

In the <em>Critique of Practical Reason</em>, Kant distinguishes
between the “supreme,” the “complete,” and
“highest” good. By “supreme good,” he means the
good that is “not subordinate to any other” (5:110). That
is, if there are a plurality of values, the supreme good is the one
that overrides the rest. Hence, if pleasure were taken as a value, its
value would be subordinate to morality, and thus its value would be
defeated or overridden if the pleasure comes through a violation of the
moral law.</p>

<p>

The “complete good” is one that “is not part of a
still greater whole of the same kind” (5:110). Kant then explains
that while morality is the supreme good, it is not the complete good
“as the object of the faculty of desire of rational finite
beings” (5:110). This is because in addition to morality, finite
rational beings also desire happiness. So, although happiness is
subordinate to morality, morality is not the “complete
good” because it does not encompass all that we desire.</p>

<p>

Kant then presents the Highest Good as a synthesis of morality and
happiness in order to meet the axiological principles of supremacy and
completeness. As such, this synthetic principle fulfils a need of
practical reason parallel to theoretical reason's need for the
unconditioned condition. Like its theoretical counterpart, practical
reason demands “the absolute totality of conditions for a given
conditioned” (5:107), and because of our dual interest in both
morality and happiness, this totality requires the synthesis of these
two interests.</p>

<p>

Kant further argues against both the Stoic and Epicurean models of
how happiness and morality are related. In the case of the latter, they
take there to be an analytic relationship between the two, for the
moral good, as seen by the Epicurean, is nothing but happiness. In the
case of the former, Kant writes that according to the Stoics,
“the feeling of happiness was already contained in consciousness
of one's virtue” (5:112). He then maintains that the
relation here is also analytic, though it is less clear how this is so,
for it seems rather that the Stoics are advancing the synthetic
<em>causal</em> claim that the cultivation of virtue yields
happiness.</p>

<p>

Kant nevertheless rejects both under the contention that morality
and happiness are conceptually distinct irreducible values; and even if
one were to resist his claim that the Stoic conception of the Highest
Good is analytic, there is still a suitable Kantian objection that can
be made against it, for he repeatedly denies the possibility of a
causal link between morality and happiness. As stated in the
<em>Critique of Practical Reason</em>, “no necessary connection
of happiness with virtue in the world, adequate to the highest good,
can be expected from the most meticulous observance of the moral
laws.” (See also: A810/B838, 5:452). Thus, even if one were to
disagree with Kant about the analyticity of the Stoic position, the
Kantian can still reject the Stoic rendering of the Highest Good for it
assumes something that Kant clearly opposes: that a life of virtue can
on its own secure happiness.</p>

<p>

When Kant then turns to his own position, positing a synthetic
relationship between morality and happiness, he argues that if
practical reason's need for a total object is to be met, morality
and happiness can only be brought together through not merely a
synthetic law, but more precisely, through a normative (rather than
causal) synthetic law. That law is given to us through morality,
proffering that happiness <em>ought</em> to be proportionate to moral
worth. Thus, Kant sees the Highest Good as an ideal state of affairs,
one in which there is a distribution of happiness “in exact
proportion to morality,” but one that cannot be expected from our
efforts, even “from the most meticulous observance of the moral
laws.”</p>

<p>

Let us refer to the Highest Good rendered in this way as
HG<sub>i</sub> (the Highest Good as <em>ideal</em>). However, this is
just one aspect of his doctrine. In addition to this ideal, Kant also
presents the Highest Good as a duty for us, a duty to for us to promote
the realization of HG<sub>i</sub>. Let us refer to this duty as
HG<sub>d</sub>. Divisions of this sort, between two distinct aspects of
the Highest Good are common in the literature. Unfortunately, however,
there is considerable controversy about the specifics.</p>

<p>

While most agree that Kant does imagine for HG<sub>i</sub> a state
of affairs in which morality and happiness are somehow made
proportionate, the duty to promote this state of affairs has
significantly different renderings. Those who prefer to read
HG<sub>i</sub> as a human, this-worldly achievement, consider
HG<sub>d</sub> to be akin to a social obligation to promote a just
society. By contrast, those who point to Kant's appeal to the
Postulates of God and immortality, consider HG<sub>i</sub> to obtain in
a “future life,” one governed by God's will.
According to this position, Kant turns to the Postulates because we
lack both the capacity to judge one another's moral worth as well
as the capacity to secure the distribution of happiness in proportion
to moral worth. Our duty, thus, is not to bring this distribution into
existence. It is, rather, to become worthy of the happiness it affords.
More precisely, as presented in <em>Religion</em>, HG<sub>d</sub> is a
corporate duty, a “duty <em>sui generis</em>…. of the
human race toward itself” (6:97) to become collectively worthy of
the happiness promised in HG<sub>i</sub>.</p>

<h4>3.5.2 Kant's Arguments for the Highest Good</h4>

<p>

Although the <em>Critique of Practical Reason</em> is often seen as
the <em>locus classicus</em> for Kant's doctrine of the Highest
Good, it may rather be best to take it as a transitional text, since
its argument for the Highest Good is quite different from those that
come after. Moreover, its characterization of the postulate of
immortality deviates from what is found through Kant's other
published discussions of the topic. Hence, rather than using it as the
template for a singular argument for the Highest Good, one that forces
together its very different treatments through the Critical Period, it
is best to see this fundamental doctrine of Kant's philosophy of
religion as evolving through the 1780s and 1790s. Accordingly, we shall
consider four distinct arguments for the Highest Good, one from each of
the three <em>Critique</em>s and a fourth, which is found in the First
Preface to <em>Religion</em>.</p>

<h4>3.5.3 Kant's Argument for the Highest Good in the <em>Critique of Pure Reason</em></h4>

<p>

In the <em>Critique of Pure Reason</em>'s “Canon of Pure
Reason,” Kant's argument for the Highest Good rests upon a
hold-over from his pre-Critical philosophy. Even though 1781 is usually
taken to demarcate the point of transition to his mature philosophical
period, it still takes a few more years before it fully comes into
being, or at least before Kant fully articulates the conception of
moral motivation that has us capable of acting from pure practical
reason. Thus, the vision of moral agency in the First
<em>Critique</em>, the vision that there draws him to the Highest Good,
is not that of the <em>Groundwork</em> or his subsequent works.</p>

<p>

Through his Pre-Critical years, and lingering still in the First
<em>Critique</em>, Kant's conception of morality was split
between Rationalist and Sentimentalist theses. He subscribed to the
former's claim that morality must be law-like, its
“principle of appraisal of obligation” needs to be
universal and necessary. But he followed the latter's view that
“the principle of performance or execution” is driven by
affective desire. We find this schism in his 1764 “Inquiry
Concerning the Distinctness of the Principles of Natural Theology and
Morality” (the so-called Prize essay of 1764) as well as through
many of his lectures and <em>Reflexionen</em> of the 1760's and 1770's.
For instance, we find in Collins 2 lectures: “the supreme
principle of all moral judgment lies in the understanding; the supreme
principle of the moral impulse to do this thing lies in the
heart” (27:274); and in the Mrongovius notes, Kant discusses what
he sees as a fundamental disconnect between the understanding and
feeling: “When a man has learned to appraise all actions, he
still lacks the motive to perform them….the understanding has no
<em>elateres animi</em>… man has no such secret organization,
that he can be moved by objective grounds” (27:1429).</p>

<p>

Similarly, in the Canon of the First <em>Critique</em>, Kant writes
that “the majestic ideas of morality are, to be sure, objects of
approbation and admiration but not incentives for resolve and
realization” (A813/B841). Thus, in order for us to move from our
awareness of a moral principle to an action that (at least) conforms to
it, we still need something that can bring us to act on “the
majestic ideas of morality”, to turn them into “incentives
for resolve and realization”. By the time of the
<em>Groundwork</em>, Kant comes, of course, to see pure practical
reason as itself able to motivate us. But in the First
<em>Critique</em>, while still at the cusp of the Critical Period, he
continues to follow Sentimentalism's view that reason is
motivationally impotent: “man has no such secret organization,
that he can be moved by objective grounds” (27:1429).</p>

<p>

Accordingly, the Canon proposes that we “connect appropriate
consequences with their rule <em>a priori</em>, and thus carry with
them <em>promises</em> and <em>threats</em>” (A811/B839). Without
these incentives, the “majestic ideas” of morality would
have no connection with our practical lives. They could be
“objects of approbation and admiration” (A813/B841) but
would be impotent and “empty figments of the brain”
(A811/B839). This is where the hope for happiness gains its
justification. The stature of morality depends upon its having some way
to connect with our wills, and the connection is here established by
the hope to be rewarded if one obeys and the fear of punishment if one
does not. Through this connection “the system of morality is
therefore inseparably combined with the system of happiness”
(A809/B837).</p>

<p>

It is in relation to the connection between happiness and morality
that Kant introduces the doctrine of the Highest Good: “I call
the idea of such an intelligence, in which the morally most perfect
will, combined with the highest blessedness, is the cause of all
happiness in the world, insofar as it stands in exact relation with
morality (as the worthiness to be happy), the ideal of the highest
good” (A810/B839). HG<sub>i</sub> is here introduced as the
object of hope, one that is rationally justified in order that
morality's “majestic ideas” can be accepted as
commands for us, which they “could not be if they did not connect
appropriate consequences with their rule <em>a priori,</em> and thus
carry with them <em>promises</em> and <em>threats</em>”
(A811/B840).</p>

<h4>3.5.4 Kant's Argument for the Highest Good in the <em>Critique of Practical Reason</em></h4>

<p>

With the advances to his theory of agency found in the
<em>Groundwork</em> and thereafter, the First <em>Critique</em>'s
argument for the Highest Good becomes nugatory. We no longer need the
hope for happiness to move us to act morally, and in fact, such a
motivation comes to be considered inadequate to our true moral
vocation. Duties do not merely have to be enacted, but must be adopted
for their own sake. Hence, with the motivational power of pure
practical reason itself, the “majestic ideas of morality”
themselves can and ought to serve as “incentives for [their own]
resolve and realization”.</p>

<p>

Yet, Kant did not abandon his commitment to the Highest Good.
Instead he cast for it a new role, announced in the <em>Critique of
Practical Reason</em>'s “Dialectic of Pure Practical
Reason.” Just as the First <em>Critique</em> contains a
Transcendental Dialectic devoted to the faculty of reason in its
theoretical employment, so we have in the Second <em>Critique</em>, an
inquiry into practical reason's quest for “the absolute
totality of conditions for a given conditioned” (5:107). But
there is a profound difference between the two dialectics.</p>

<p>

In the First <em>Critique</em>, Kant takes great pains to expose the
errors that may arise from theoretical reason's quest for the
unconditioned condition. It generates various illusions, <em>focii
imaginarii</em> (A644/B672), that on the one hand, can help direct our
intellectual practices, but on the other hand, lead us into error. The
latter can be avoided so long as these <em>focii imaginarii</em> are
used merely regulatively, such as by facilitating scientific inquiry
through their setting out various desiderata. However, Kant claims that
reason's quest for the unconditioned condition, leads us to latch
on to what should be merely regulative principles and treat them
instead as transcendentally real principles or entities.</p>

<p>

Accordingly, the primary aim of the First <em>Critique</em>'s
Dialectic is to prevent our slide from illusion into error. It begins
by identifying the cause of this slide, illustrates what philosophy has
become as a result, and thereby seeks to disabuse us of such enduring
errors. From its opening paragraphs, it seems at first as if the Second
<em>Critique</em>'s Dialectic is going to offer us a similar
exposé of reason in its practical employment. It begins by
comparing its mission with its predecessor, stating that “reason
in its practical use is no better off. That is, as pure practical
reason, it likewise seeks the unconditioned for the practically
conditioned (which rests on inclinations and natural needs)”
(5:108). Yet, as we move forward, we discover that the fate of
practical reason's quest for the unconditioned condition is quite
different from what Kant presents in the Dialectic of the First
<em>Critique</em>. Shortly after the above quote, Kant identifies the
Highest Good as the object that fulfils pure practical reason's
quest; but rather than declaring it to be an illusion and cautioning us
against affirming it, he instead launches into a defense of it and of
the Postulates necessary for its realization.</p>

<p>

As discussed in the previous section, Kant had a reason to affirm
the Highest Good in the Canon of the First <em>Critique</em>. At the
cusp of the Critical Period, he still needed some affective principle
through which “the majestic ideas of morality” could become
“incentives for resolve and realization” (A813/B841). He
thus turned to the hope for happiness offered by the Highest Good as
the motivational ground for moral action. But after the developments
first seen in the <em>Groundwork</em>, this strategy could no longer be
used. We are now past Kant's introduction of the possibility of
acting from duty, and thus the Highest Good cannot be justified as it
was in the First <em>Critique</em>. This is something that Kant does
seem to recognize, as he states that “though the highest good may
be the whole <em>object</em> of pure practical reason, that is, of a
pure will, it is not on that account to be taken as its <em>determining
ground</em>” (5:109).</p>

<p>

This quote further illustrates the shift in how he employs the
Highest Good, rejecting its earlier motivational role, and
repositioning it as, rather, an architectonic principle for practical
reason. It is now cast as the “whole object” or
“unconditioned totality of the object of pure practical
reason” (5:108). Put succinctly, this object functions as the
unconditioned condition for pure practical reason. It is the object
that the faculty seeks to bring its principles into systematic unity.
But this should be an arresting claim for astute readers, for in it we
see a very different attitude towards the quest for the unconditioned
in theoretical versus practical reason. We are taught in the Dialectic
of the First <em>Critique</em> that we should guard against such
objects and regard them as illusions cast by the pathologies of reason.
Yet, in the Second <em>Critique</em>'s Dialectic, Kant celebrates
practical reason's quest for an object that can serve as its
unconditioned condition.</p>

<p>

It would be far too question-begging to explain this difference
simply as a result of the former's Dialectic having to do with
theoretical reason, while the latter concerns practical reason. Merely
appealing to these two modalities or applications of reason does not
explain why the latter is justified in its pursuit and adoption of what
is taken as illusion and error in the former. Hence, we need to face
the question as to why we are justified in affirming the unconditioned
condition of practical but not theoretical reason.</p>

<p>

There must be some warrant that permits our assent, though one that
has its basis in the needs of practical reason, since the assent is a
matter of faith rather than knowledge or opinion. Of course, it would
be just as bromidic to settle the issue by stating that as faith,
rather than knowledge or opinion, it is perfectly fine to just affirm
it. If faith were so open, so blind, then presumably we could also
affirm the various illusions of theoretical reason as well. So,
although the distinction between theoretical and practical reason is
germane to the question of what warrants our assent to the Highest
Good, a more precise account of how it is germane is still needed. The
Second <em>Critique</em>, must therefore provide some argument, rooted
in the needs of practical reason, in order to explain why in its
Dialectic, versus that of the First <em>Critique</em>, we may accept
its pursuit of the unconditioned condition and the object it identifies
with this condition as meriting legitimate, intersubjectively valid
assent.</p>

<p>

As we have discussed, the First <em>Critique</em>'s argument
for the Highest Good is rooted in our need to find some motivation to
act morally. But this is not how Kant argues for the Highest Good in
the Second <em>Critique</em>. It is not about our human motivational
needs. It is rather, so Kant at least for the moment argues, that the
authority of the moral law itself depends upon the Highest Good:</p>

<p>

Now, since the promotion of the highest good, which contains this
connection [between morality and happiness] in its concept, is an a
priori necessary object of our will and inseparably bound up with the
moral law, the impossibility of the first must also prove the falsity
of the second. If, therefore, the highest good is impossible in
accordance with practical rules, then the moral law, which commands us
to promote it, must be fantastic and directed to empty imaginary ends
and must therefore in itself be false. (5:114).</p>

<p>

The above quotation captures the core argument for the Highest Good
in the Second <em>Critique</em>. It presents the elusive warrant that
justifies our assent to the doctrine, and thereby, also what justifies
the Dialectic of Pure Practical Reason's having a more positive
outcome than its theoretical counterpart. In contrast to the First
<em>Critique</em>'s focus on HG<sub>i</sub>, we see in the Second
<em>Critique</em>, an argument that is instead grounded on
HG<sub>d</sub>. At least as presented in the above passage, our duty to
promote the Highest Good is “inseparably bound up with the moral
law” and as such, following the logic of <em>ought implies
can</em>, the <em>ought</em> of HG<sub>d</sub> requires that
HG<sub>i</sub> must be possible.</p>

<h4>3.5.5 Kant's Argument for the Highest Good in the <em>Critique of Judgment</em></h4>

<p>

While the Second <em>Critique</em> treats the doctrine of the
Highest Good as built into the justificatory structure of pure
practical reason, the Third <em>Critique</em> assigns to the Highest
Good a far more modest function. In fact, in at least two passages,
Kant explicitly renounces the Second <em>Critique</em>'s
contention that the authority of the moral law depends upon the Highest
Good. The first of these passages is as follows: “This
proof…is not meant to say that it is just as necessary to assume
the existence of God as it is to acknowledge the validity of the moral
law, hence that whoever cannot convince himself of the former can judge
himself to be free from the obligation of the latter. No!… Every
rational being would still have to recognize himself as forever
strictly bound to the precepts of morals; for its laws are formal and
command unconditionally without regard to ends” (5:451).</p>

<p>

Then, a few paragraphs later, he adds that even if one were to
become persuaded that there is no God and that there will not be an
ultimate distribution of rewards and punishments, it would be a mistake
“on that account…to hold the laws of duty to be merely
imaginary, invalid, and nonobligatory” (5:451).</p>

<p>

The Third <em>Critique</em> does perpetuate the distinction between
Highest Good as an ideal state of affairs and as a duty “to
strive after” (5:450). It also continues to endorse the
Postulates of God and Immortality as necessary for the realization of
the former (5:452, 5:469, 5:471). But its argument is more akin to the
<em>Critique of Pure Reason</em>'s far simpler appeal to our
motivational needs. As in the First <em>Critique</em>, so in the Third
as well, Kant argues that our motivation to follow the moral law
depends upon the happiness that it promises to those who are worthy of
it. But in its revised form, the motivation that the Highest Good
offers is merely a buttress that helps maintain our commitment to
morality.</p>

<p>

This return to a motivation argument does not, however, imply an
abandonment of the motivational power of pure practical reason. Rather,
as imperfect agents, influenced by inclination, Kant acknowledges that
our commitment to morality is fragile. Whereas he elsewhere
characterizes our moral commitment as vulnerable to self-interested
desires, here he adds as well that our confrontation with “all
the evils of poverty, illness, and untimely death” (5:452), could
lead to moral despair. So, while the moral law's authority is not
here made contingent on the possibility of HG<sub>i</sub>, our
commitment to the law is. We thus need to believe in the Highest Good,
and with it, the Postulates of God and Immortality.</p>

<p>

Although Kant does not withdraw his view that pure practical reason
can itself move us to action, he does qualify its motivational force
and presents us as morally frail, lacking adequate fortitude to rebuff
the psychological threats arising from the “purposeless chaos of
matter” (5:452). Despite his claim that we (generally) have
sufficient self-control to not give in to our desires, it does appear
that fear and despair seem now able to condition our autonomy; and when
they take hold, they must be fought back with a different affective
motivation, <em>viz</em>., hope. Interestingly, this gives the Highest
Good a role that will seem quite appropriate to many religious
believers, for it presents our need for religion as one that is drawn
from an inward, subjective struggle over the meaningfulness of our
existence.</p>

<h4>3.5.6 Kant's Argument for the Highest Good in <em>Religion</em></h4>

<p>

It is not uncommon to fold Kant's argument for the Highest
Good in the First Preface of <em>Religion</em> into the Third
<em>Critique</em>'s argument. While they both present the Highest
Good in relation to the needs of our human condition, rather than
grounded, as we saw in the Second <em>Critique</em>, in the
architectonic of practical reason itself, a shortcoming of the argument
of the Third <em>Critique</em> is that it places the Highest Good too
far into the margins of our practical lives. That is, its argument
implies that an agent could possibly sustain his commitment to the
Moral Law if through good fortune he were sheltered from life's
harsher truths. For it is through the impact that tragedies have on our
moral resolve that we need the motivational supplement offered by the
Highest Good.</p>

<p>

By contrast, the argument of <em>Religion</em>'s First Preface
links the Highest Good with a ubiquitous element of our practical
lives. As described in the text, Kant claims that we are inevitably
concerned with the “whither” of our actions. Although
“morality can perfectly well abstract from ends altogether”
(6:4), it is “natural to the human being, of having to consider
in every action, besides the law, also an end” (6:7n). This, he
further describes as “one of the inescapable limitations of human
beings” (6:7n) and when we choose, we inevitably have some
expectation, some intended results towards which the choice is
oriented.</p>

<p>

Whereas the rightness of an action remains grounded on the moral law
itself, Kant's claim here is that given what we are like as human
beings, interested in the outcomes of our actions, our commitment to
the moral law also has us commit to an outcome that “we simply
cannot do without” (6:5). The Highest Good is thus the outcome
that moral agents take on as the “special point of reference for
the unification of all ends” (6:5). It reflects the morally
proper relationship between the competing interests of morality and
self-interest, and thus at least for those agents who give priority to
morality over happiness, regarding the former as the proper condition
for the latter, HG<sub>i</sub> will be the “whither”
intended by their actions.</p>

<p>

In other words, those who commit to the priority of morality over
self-interest will likewise, due to their “natural need” to
direct their actions towards an end, commit to an end that
reflects this prioritization. HG<sub>i</sub> will be that end, since it
sets morality as the condition for happiness, and thus brings together
these two ends into one, synthethizing them under a rule set by
morality, namely that happiness ought to be distributed in accordance
with moral worth.</p>

<p>

However, as in other texts, Kant states ones again that this is not
an end we can ourselves bring about. It is the end that moral agents
will want to obtain, and will want likewise to see their actions as
somehow directed towards it. So, on the one hand, we must postulate God
and immortality as conditions necessary for the just distribution of
happiness; but on the other, what we contribute to the realization of
HG<sub>i</sub> is our moral worthiness. Accordingly, Parts One and Two
of <em>Religion</em> articulate our moral circumstances, what it means
to be morally unworthy, and what we must do to become worthy. Part
Three of <em>Religion</em> then turns from the individual moral dynamic
to the corporate, for Kant there explains that HG<sub>d</sub> is a
“duty <em>sui generis</em>, not of human beings towards human
beings, but of the human race towards itself” (6:97). Although
God is still given charge over the distribution of happiness, it is up
to us to populate HG<sub>i</sub> and towards this end, “[e]ach
must …. conduct himself as if everything depended on him”
(6:101). So, if a day of judgment were to come and no one was yet
worthy of God's blessings, then that judgment would bring with it
a justice that offers only punishment. Happiness would still be
proportioned to moral worth, but with no one deserving of happiness, no
happiness would be conferred. Hence, without our efforts, HG<sub>i</sub>
would be just an empty shell.</p>

<h3><a id="PraPos">3.6 The Practical Postulates</a></h3>
<p>

Although Kant enumerates three postulates, freedom, God, and
immortality, their etiologies differ. In contrast to the latter two,
the postulate of freedom is more directly tied to the Fact of Reason,
taken as a necessary condition for the bindingness of the moral law
upon us. By contrast, the postulates of God and Immortality are rooted
in the Highest Good. As such we will here only be concerned with the
latter two “religious” postulates.</p>

<p>

An interesting tension in Kant's conception of faith is that
while he distinguishes its ground from those of opinion and knowledge,
the two clearest objects of faith are still partly dependent upon
theoretical inference. That is, our faith in God and immortality are
justified on the grounds that they are necessary conditions for the
realization of HG<sub>i</sub>. As such, at least within the conditional
<em>if HG</em><em><sub>i</sub></em> <em>obtains, then there must be a
God and an afterlife</em>, there is a dependency relation that is not
clearly different from the sort of inferences common to theoretical
demonstration. Hence, if Kant is correct that these postulates are in
fact necessary for HG<sub>i</sub>, one might think it best to consider
them instead as objects of knowledge.</p>

<p>

However, as the antecedent (or perhaps its ultimate ground in the
Fact of Reason) is not a matter of knowledge but faith, one may regard
its propositional attitude as transitive to how one holds the
consequent to be true. This is how we can understand Kant's
claim that the postulates remain objects of faith rather than
knowledge, despite their status as necessary conditions for the
antecedent(s). In other words, if one were to take either one's
commitment to the Highest Good or the Fact of Reason as instances of
faith, then their necessary conditions as well would be held as
instances of faith (even though mediated by a theoretical claim about
necessary conditions).</p>

<h4>3.6.1 The Postulate of God</h4>
<p>

Although some interpreters prefer a secular rendering of the Highest
Good, this is not reflected in the actual corpus. All three
<em>Critique</em>s, <em>Religion</em>, and many essays of the 1790s
continue to maintain both postulates and continue to present the
possibility of HG<sub>i</sub> as dependent upon an omnipotent,
omniscient and just divinity.</p>

<p>

While the <em>Critique of Pure Reason</em> shows some sympathy for
the argument from Design, Kant remarks that it can only get us to a
“Wise Author of Nature,” a being who is responsible for the
order of nature, rather than a creator, a being with infinite
capacities, or a moral being. By contrast, the Canon of the First
<em>Critique</em> advances a conception of God as omnipotent,
omniscient, and omnibenevolent. Hence, as argued, in order for
HG<sub>i</sub> to obtain, there must be a being capable of arranging
the world such that happiness is exactly proportioned to moral worth.
This being must further have the cognitive powers necessary to judge or
moral worth, and, presumably, a will aligned with morality.</p>

<p>

Similar reasoning can be found in the Second and Third <em>Critique</em>s, in
<em>Religion</em>, and in various essays of the 1790s. Furthermore, we also find
this appeal to God within Kant's discussion of the Ethical
Community in Part Three of <em>Religion</em>. Some secondary literature does not
differentiate between the Ethical Community and the secular order
discussed in the “Idea for a Universal History with a
Cosmopolitan Aim” and “Perpetual Peace.” However, the
passages in <em>Religion</em> where the Ethical Community is discussed makes it
clear that it, like HG<sub>i</sub>, demands a “supreme
lawgiver…who knows the heart” and can “penetrate to
the most intimate parts of the disposition” (6:99). Hence, the
Ethical Community is, for Kant, a religious ideal and could be taken as
just another term for HG<sub>i</sub>. As depicted in Religion, the
Ethical Community is “a work whose execution cannot be hoped for
from human beings but only from God himself” (6:100).</p>

<h4>3.6.2 The Postulate of Immortality</h4>
<p>

The postulate of immortality is typically found alongside
Kant's discussions of the postulate of God. He regards both as
necessary conditions for the realization of HG<sub>i</sub>, though the
function of this postulate undergoes far more radical revisions through
the Critical Period.</p>

<p>

In the <em>Critique of Pure Reason</em>, Kant presents two distinct
arguments for it. The first is a non-moral argument and is found in the
B-Paralogism, after his rejection of Mendelssohn's argument for
the same. Mendelssohn's argument builds off the thesis that the
soul is a simple entity and cessation of existence involves a
disillusion of one part and then another. He thus concludes that since
the soul is simple, it is impossible for it to cease to exist. Kant
rejects this argument on the grounds that even simple beings can have a
degree of reality (an intensive magnitude) that can diminish to zero,
he shortly thereafter presents his own argument for the soul's
immortality, one that has a similar metaphysical bent: (a) since
throughout nature there is a proportionality between purposes and the
conditions for the realization of those purposes, there should be a
similar proportionality between our capacities and the conditions for
their realization, and (b) since the grandeur of our capacities,
including both our natural talents and moral vocation, exceeds what can
be realized in this life, it follows (c) that we are justified in
affirming a “future life.” This argument, or one very
similar to it, is also present in the Canon's discussion of
“doctrinal belief” [<em>doctrinale Glaube</em>]. However,
this is not an argument that endures beyond the 1780s. It is absent in
later works, and in the <em>Critique of Judgment</em>, Kant explicitly
dismisses it along with all other non-moral arguments for the afterlife
(cf. 5:460 and 5:468).</p>

<p>

The other and better known argument for this postulate is first
found in the <em>Critique of Pure Reason</em>'s Canon. Like his
argument for the Postulate of God, Kant also argues that we must
postulate the immortality of the soul as a necessary condition for the
distribution of happiness in HG<sub>i</sub>. Given the exigencies of
the natural order, this distribution cannot be secured within this
order. We must therefore posit a “future life,” a
“Kingdom of Grace” where “every happiness awaits us
as long as we do not ourselves limit our share of it through the
unworthiness to be happy” (A812/B840). Hence, in the First
<em>Critique</em>, the purpose of the afterlife is to provide a domain
for HG<sub>i</sub>'s distribution of happiness.</p>

<p>

However, in the Second <em>Critique</em>, the postulate undergoes a
significant revision. As Kant no longer needs the Highest Good as the
motivational basis for our observance of morality, it is recast as part
of the architectonic of pure practical reason; and, likewise, the
postulate of immortality gains a new function. Whereas Kant formerly
turned to immortality as part of his account of how the happiness of
HG<sub>i</sub> is to be distributed, he now presents it as necessary
for our becoming worthy of that happiness.</p>

<p>

In the section of the Second <em>Critique</em> devoted to this
postulate (5:122 - 5:124), Kant presents a dilemma regarding what is
required of us to become worthy of the happiness offered in the Highest
Good. As he explains, we do not want to make this requirement too
meager, thereby degrading our moral vocation, “making it out to
be <em>lenient</em> (indulgent)” (5:122). Yet, on the other hand,
we must also reject as an “unattainable vocation” the
“hoped-for full acquisition of holiness of will.” Such, he
writes, is an “enthusiastic <em>theosophical</em> dream”
(5:122).</p>

<p>

Through the remainder of the section, Kant then develops his
solution, one that actually puts him quite in line with the dominant
Christian view of Justifying Grace (something from which Kant departs
in <em>Religion</em>). Most Christians would maintain that neither can
we become fully adequate to God's call through our own efforts,
nor even through Divine aid can we achieve this. Rather, just as Kant
proposes, our efforts are instead recognized by God who then through an
act of forgiveness takes our “progress which, though it has to do
with a goal endlessly postponed…as possession”
(5:123n)… or as more incisively stated in Lewis White
Beck's translation, this progress “in God's sight is
regarded as equivalent to possession” (5:123n).</p>

<p>

In other words, the argument of the Second <em>Critique</em>
assumes: (a) that the realization of the Highest Good involves not just
the formality of the distribution of happiness in accordance with moral
worth (for that could be satisfied if no one gains such worthiness and
correspondingly, there is no happiness); and (b) the happiness to be
distributed is taken as an absolute, rather than degreed, thus
requiring “the complete conformity of our dispositions to the
moral law” (5:122). However: (c) as this conformity is not
possible in this life, Kant posits one yet to come; and (d) since even
in the life to come we still cannot achieve moral perfection, God then
accepts this infinite striving as sufficient, taking it, through an act
of grace, “as equivalent to possession.”</p>

<p>

By the 1790's however, Kant returns to a view closer to that of the
First <em>Critique</em>. In the Third <em>Critique</em>, in
<em>Religion</em>, in “The End of All Things,” “Real
Progress” as well as in various other texts of that decade, Kant
reprises the significance of our hope for the happiness contained in
the Highest Good; and so, as in the First <em>Critique</em>'s
Canon, he argues for the postulate as required for this
distribution.</p>

<p>

Before moving forward, there are two further issues that ought to be
discussed. The first is the belief found in some quarters of Kant
scholarship that he abandoned the postulate of immortality in the
1790s, and the second concerns Kant's conception of the afterlife
and its relationship to his Pietist upbringing.</p>

<h4>3.6.3 The Postulate of Immortality in the 1790s</h4>
<p>

Beginning with the first, the thesis that Kant abandoned the
postulate can easily be rebutted by reading his works of the 1790s. In
fact, we actually find this postulate discussed far more often during
the 1790s than in the 1780s. Moreover, whereas Kant seemed to vacillate
as to its function from the First to the Second <em>Critique</em>, from
the Third <em>Critique</em> onwards, he consistently appeals to it as
necessary for the distribution of happiness. Thus, in §91 of the
<em>Critique of Judgment</em>, in <em>Religion</em>, the “End
of All Things,” “Real Progress” and elsewhere, the
1790s is replete with discussions of the immortality of the soul.</p>

<p>

By contrast, those who prefer to see the Highest Good as
this-worldly, and presume that Kant came to reject the postulate of
immortality, frequently point to 5:450 in the <em>Critique of
Judgment</em>, where Kant uses the phrase “the highest good in
the world.” This, however, is scant evidence since the phrase
also appears well before the putative shift to a secular model of the
Highest Good. It occurs, for instance, in the First <em>Critique</em>
(e.g. A814/B842) and quite abundantly in the Second <em>Critique</em>
(5:122, 5:125, 5:126, 5:134, 5:141, etc..).</p>

<p>

Second, “in the world” is used in contexts where one
could not plausibly take it to have a secular meaning. The most glaring
example of this is at 5:122 in the <em>Critique of Practical
Reason</em>, right in the opening line of the section “The
Immortality of the Soul as a Postulate of Pure Practical Reason”
– that is, right where Kant argues for the postulate of
immortality. Similarly, “in the world” can be found in the Second
<em>Critique</em>'s section that discusses how we are justified
through the “extension of pure reason for practical
purposes” (5:134) to affirm freedom, immortality and God. Kant
there reminds us that by “the theoretical path,” the
postulates cannot be established; yet “by the practical law that
commands the existence of the highest good possible in a world, the
possibility of those objects of pure speculative reason…is
postulated” (5:134). Thus, it hardly seems reasonable to assume
that “in the world” should be read as referring to just the
natural causal order of this life, for there are many passages
where Kant uses the phrase to indicate something more broad, akin to
“all that is” or “all of creation”.</p>

<p>

Thirdly, Kant in fact explicitly discusses the meaning of
<em>Welt</em> in the <em>Critique of Pure Reason</em>, noting that
“We have two expressions, <em>world</em> and <em>nature</em>,
which are sometimes run together.” (A418/B446). But, he
continues, they can also differ in meaning. When dealing with
cosmology, for instance, Kant assigns to “world” a
“transcendental sense,” namely, “the absolute
totality of the sum total of existing things” (A419/B447).
Therefore, given that he does use “in the world” in
contexts that clearly include the afterlife, it is appropriate to
understand the phrase in this way.</p>

<h4>3.6.4 Immortality and “The World to Come”</h4>
<p>

Turning to our next interpretative issue, let us consider
Kant's conception of the afterlife. The contemporary vision of
the afterlife, with its harps and halos, is not how it was depicted
within his Pietistic upbringing. Their vision, rather, conformed more
to the World To Come, this world in “glorified form.” In
contrast to the more Hellenistic imagery found in contemporary culture,
many early Christians anticipated something far more akin to
Judaism's <em>Olam Ha-Ba</em>, a “New Earth” or
“New Jerusalem” brought about through the messiah. The dead
would be then be resurrected and live in a Kingdom of God on Earth.
Although the more Hellenistic vision of the afterlife has become more
dominant over the past few centuries, the more Judaic vision was very
much present through most of Christian history, including early
Lutheran thought and its Pietistic offshoot.</p>

<p>

Kant was, nevertheless, not of a single mind regarding the details
of this future life. He was, for example, conflicted as to whether or
not one should regard the afterlife as corporeal. The body
“glorified” or “purified” was part of Pietist
teachings, and was promoted by Franz Albert Schulz, who was an
important figure in the religious life of Kant's family. But the
mature Kant was conflicted. On the one hand, since he saw happiness as
intimately tied to the physical, there are times where he seems to lean
toward the corporeal account. However, he also writes that
“pleasure and pain (since they belong to the senses) are both
included in the temporal series, and disappear with it” (6:70n).
Moreover, he repeatedly expresses distaste for the idea of
“dragging along, through eternity, a body” (6:129n), even
if it is in some “purified” form (6:129n).</p>

<p>

More generally, Kant pressed that there is no theoretical basis for
any knowledge or opinion about the afterlife. While doctrines may be
proffered on practical grounds, even then, he remained unsure as to
which doctrines will yield the best practical benefits. For example, in
<em>Religion,</em> he seems to oppose the thesis that some will suffer
eternal damnation (6:69n), whereas in the “End of All
Things” he recognizes the merits of a “dualism” of
eternal reward and punishment (8:328-8:330).</p>

<p>

Ultimately, however, Kant recommends not only theoretical neutrality
but also practical caution regarding most doctrines about the
afterlife. Aside from the details dictated by the needs of pure
practical reason, we should not put much weight on any further claims
about the hereafter. So, if he does nevertheless prefer the Judaic
conception over the Hellenistic, little is offered as to what our
“glorified” or “purified” state would be like.
It is something that we simply cannot resolve and for “practical
purposes we can be quite indifferent as to whether we shall live merely
as souls after death or whether our personal identity in the next world
requires the same matter that now forms our body” (7:40).</p>

<h3><a id="PurRatFaiVsHisFai">3.7 Pure Rational Faith vs. Historical Faith</a></h3>
<p>

In <em>Religion</em>, Kant distinguishes between two concentric
spheres of religious doctrine. The innermost sphere contains those
principles that constitute what he calls the “pure rational
system of religion.” These are principles that can be derived
from reason alone and are considered by Kant to be essential to our
becoming “well pleasing to God.” They include not only the
Highest Good and its postulates, but also, as we see through
<em>Religion</em>'s first two parts, an account of our moral
corruption (radical evil) and redemption (change of heart).</p>

<p>

Since the two spheres of religion are concentric, the wider sphere
contains the smaller. Thus, the doctrines that constitute the pure
rational system of religion are also to be found in (most) actual
historical religions. Although Kant focuses on Christianity, he does
affirm that other religions, Islam, Buddhism, Hinduism, etc. also
contain the pure rational system, using, however, their own distinctive
symbols and rituals.</p>

<p>

Each of these religions thus serve as “vehicles” for the
pure rational system of religion, providing their own “mystical
cover” (6:83) and “vivid mode of representing” (6:83)
what is essential to our salvation. This does not, however, mean that
there are substantially different paths to salvation, for as Kant so
ardently protests through Part Four of <em>Religion</em>, it is not
ritual observance or doctrinal profession that makes us well pleasing
to God. Rather, our standing before God depends on the moral status of
our <em>Gesinnung</em>, i.e., whether we give priority to self-interest
over morality or undergo a “change of heart” whereby
morality is given priority over self-interest. Hence, there is only one
true path, but it can be packaged in different forms.</p>

<p>

This packaging is also of particular importance to those lacking philosophical
training. While those with greater sophistication may be able to
understand the pure rational system of religion absent its
“mystical cover,” most of humanity will need rituals and symbols
to grapple with “the highest concepts of reason” (6:109).
The vehicles of historical faith, accordingly, satisfy a “natural
need,” giving people “something that <em>the senses can
hold on to</em>” (6:109).</p>

<p>

In themselves, these symbols and rituals are “intrinsically
contingent” (6:105) and “arbitrary precepts” (6:106),
for it is not the symbols that matter to Kant, but the principles that
they represent. Ecclesiastical practices, festivals, claims about
miracles and revelations, are thus inessential to our salvation, not
part of what we must do in order to become “well pleasing to
God.” Moreover, because the outer sphere expands beyond the
inner, not all that is contained within historical faith will directly
correlate with the principles of pure rational faith. Some doctrines
(Kant mentions the Virgin Birth and Trinity) are without any obvious
tie to the inner principles of faith.</p>

<p>

Nevertheless, Kant does not dismiss the whole of the outer sphere.
While its contents are likewise “contingent” and
“arbitrary” from the standpoint of what is necessary for
our moral vocation, he still grants that within this domain there still
may be genuine revelation and miracles. While theoretical reason must
keep “a respectful distance” (6:191) with regards to their
truth, Kant recognizes that it would be “arrogant peremptorily to
deny that the way a church is organized may perhaps also be a special
divine dispensation” (6:105); and also accepts as possible that
“the historical introduction of the latter [a new religion] be
accompanied and as it were adorned by miracles” (6:84).</p>

<p>

So, even though we are to remain agnostic regarding the truth of any
particular claim about a miracle or revelation, for there is nothing in
experience that can tell us whether or not some event has a
supernatural cause, Kant nevertheless endorses an openness to these
possibilities. Such an openness may help sustain us morally and may
help infuse the practices of historical faith with a vitality that
promotes its institutions.</p>

<p>

Kant, however, does at times seem conflicted as to whether or not
some form of historical faith is necessary (even though each particular
form is in itself contingent). On the one hand, there is, as noted
above, a “natural need” for symbols and rituals. Moreover,
he also recognizes that the advance of the species towards the Ethical
Community needs a universal church. Yet, he also hopes for a time when
religion can “be freed of all empirical grounds of determination,
of all statutes that rest on history” (6:121). So, while
historical faith has served as a vehicle for pure rational faith, it
seems that he still holds out hope for a time when “finally we
can dispense of that vehicle” (6:115). If humanity eventually
matures to this state (perhaps part of the state we will be in once the
species as a whole is worthy of membership in HG<sub>i</sub>), it may
be that the external trappings of religion can finally be shed. In the
meantime, however, there will be organizational structures, customs and
traditions, with their distinctive histories, including claims of
divine involvement in their founding and growth.</p>

<h3><a id="Chu">3.8 The Church</a></h3>
<p>

Kant was not interested in participating in the public religious
life of Königsburg. Even when he served as Rector of the
University and was in that capacity expected to attend campus services,
he was routinely “indisposed.” One might speculate that
this reticence was due to his upbringing in the Pietist tradition, with
its emphasis on quiet, personal devotion rather than public worship;
or, it may be that he did not want to participate in the specific
churches and chapels of his community, finding them too distant from
the ideal religious institutions envisioned in <em>Religion</em>'s
Third and Fourth Parts.</p>

<p>

What, however, is clear is that Kant did see the church as an
important element in the moral development of humanity. Although in
Part Three of <em>Religion</em>, he pines for a time when
“religion will gradually be freed of all empirical grounds of
determination, of all statutes that rest on history” (6:121), and
“the pure faith of religion will rule over all” (6:121), he
nevertheless recognizes that that time has not yet come. So, at least
for now, the church is needed.</p>

<p>

Moreover, the church plays a further role for Kant, for it offers a
partial response to the problem of moral recidivism. As Kant explains
at the opening of Part Three of <em>Religion</em>, even those who have
gone through a “change of heart,” still carry their
propensity to evil, which can be reactivated through the corrupting
influence of other people. Reprising the unsocial sociability of his
1784 “Idea for a Universal History with a Cosmopolitan
Aim,” Kant maintains that “human beings…mutually
corrupt each other's moral disposition and make one another
evil” (6:94).</p>

<p>

Most of our social institutions promote competition and fuel our
self-oriented interests. By contrast, the proper function of the church
is to promote the “duty <em>sui generis</em>, not of human beings
towards human beings, but of the human race towards itself”
(6:97). It thus offers a counterpoint to our more worldly institutions
and their promotion of our unsocial sociability. Through the church,
individuals can mutually cooperate in a mutual end, and thus, ideally
at least, can help bring people together in a way that does not
activate the “malignant inclinations” of jealousy,
schadenfreude, addiction to power, or greed.</p>

<p>

While the above captures Kant's positive ecclesiology, he also
devotes most of Part Four of <em>Religion</em> to critique. He there
explains that just as we as individuals invert the proper order of
incentives, giving priority to self-interest over morality, a parallel
inversion also takes place in religious institutions. Ultimately driven
by the same corrupting influences, a church can “totally
reverse” the proper moral order between means and ends, making
the former “unconditionally commanded,” elevating it
“to the rank of saving faith” (6:165). That is, where
rituals and symbols are suppose to serve as instruments through which
individuals can grasp “the highest concepts and grounds of
reason,” they can be distorted, and taken as themselves what is
required for us to become “well-pleasing to God.”</p>

<h3><a id="MirProEsc">3.9 Miracles, Providence and Eschatology</a></h3>
<p>

Although Kant maintains that theoretical reason must keep a
“respectful distance” from all claims of miracles and
revelation, he nevertheless recognizes that most historical faiths
regard God as active in history. Of course, this is not something that
can be proven true or false, nor is it even something suitable for
opining, given his technical understanding of this mode of assent.
Nevertheless, in many works of the 1790s, he acknowledges the
possibility of miracles and revelation, and seems quite willing to have
them as part of church doctrine, though suitably calibrated to his
epistemic strictures.</p>

<p>

He writes, for example, that it would be “arrogant
peremptorily to deny that the way a church is organized may perhaps
also be a special divine dispensation” (6:105) and acknowledges
that revelation “at a given time and a given place might be wise
and very advantageous to the human race” (6:155). As noted above,
he even accepts the possibility that the founding of Christianity was
accompanied by various miracles (6:84). Hence, once one gives
<em>Religion</em> its due significance within the corpus, it should be
recognized that Kant is not only not an atheist or agnostic, but he is
not even a Deist. While theoretical reason is agnostic, and pure
rational faith likewise is neutral with regards to any particular
historical claim, Kant is clearly open to divine agency in the
world.</p>

<p>

Kant, further, considers Providence in <em>Religion</em>, and
presents history as an advance towards the “Kingdom of God on
earth” (6:132). While practically speaking, we should never
expect or depend upon divine aid in this advance, for each person
should act as if “everything depended on him” (6:101), Kant
nevertheless represents the Highest Good and the Ethical Community
eschatologically, as “a work whose execution cannot be hoped for
from human beings but only from God himself” (6:100). So, while
we must never relieve ourselves of our moral efforts, as we remain
responsible for our own moral transformation, this does not exclude
divine aid in other respects. Through miracles and revelation, the
founding of the Christian church, and so forth, Kant is open to
God's agency in this world, giving us the tools we need to
facilitate our individual and corporate moral endeavors.</p>

<p>

Of course, this remains still far removed from Kant affirming as
true any particular claim of divine aid. He accepts Providence as a
vital part of historical faith. He recognizes the value of an openness,
an acceptance that God may be active in history. He even sees the idea
of Providence as helpful to our understanding of the Highest Good as
the <em>telos</em> of creation. Providence thus gives us a
“representation in a historical narrative… a beautiful
ideal of the moral world-epoch brought about by the introduction of the
true universal religion” (6:135). However, he repudiates those
who push farther, treating our belief in miracles and revelation as
essential or necessary to our salvation. He likewise, particularly in
the “End of All Things,” opposes Chiliasm, for that
presumes a knowledge of when the end time will arrive. Beyond what is
more strictly bound up with the practical function of the postulate of
immortality, we have no theoretical grounds to positively affirm any
model of the life to come, or a timetable for “the transition
from time into eternity” (8:327).</p>

<h2><a id="GodOpuPos">4. God in the <em>Opus Postumum</em></a></h2>

<p>During his final years, Kant worked on a manuscript, left
incomplete at his death, that has become known as the <em>Opus
Postumum</em>. The manuscript contains sections in which Kant
continues to explore the relationship between the concept of God and
our consciousness of being moral agents, i.e., our consciousness that
we can subject ourselves freely, through our acknowledgment of the
categorical imperative, to the requirement of rightness in the choice
of our actions. These reflections suggest that Kant may have been
trying to draw a connection between the idea of God and the
acknowledgment of the categorical imperative that is even more direct
than that found in the moral argument. Such a connection would make
the idea of God totally immanent within human moral consciousness
(Förster, 2000). Given the fragmentary nature of the manuscript,
it is difficult to reach a conclusive judgment on the content and
significance of Kant's last reflections on God and religion.</p>
