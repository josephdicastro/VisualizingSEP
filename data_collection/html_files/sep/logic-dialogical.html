<p>
The expression <em>dialogical logic</em> refers to a research
tradition that can be traced back to Greek antiquity, when logic was
conceived as the systematic study of dialogues in which two parties
exchange arguments over a central claim. In its modern form,
dialogical logic uses concepts of game theory to design dialogue games
that provide a semantics for a wide range of logical systems. The
modern approach, originally developed in the context of constructive
mathematics and logic, has proved to be fruitful for the study,
comparison and combination of various logical systems, such as
paraconsistent, free, modal, and substructural logics.</p>

<h2><a name="HisOve">1. Historical Overview</a></h2>

<p>
The dialogical approach to logic stems from the introduction of
game-theoretical concepts in the definition of fundamental logical
notions. A historical sketch of the relations between logic and games
can be found in the entry on 
 <a href="../logic-games/#Hist">logic and games</a>,
 and a detailed account can be found in Lorenz (2001).  Dialogical logic, as we
know it today, comes from Paul Lorenzen in his work on the
operative approach to constructive logic and mathematics.  Lorenzen's
dialogical approach was invented as a solution to some of the problems
of the operative program.  (For details on operative logic, see
Lorenzen (1955)). In particular, the operative notion
of <em>derivation</em>, which is essential to the definition of the
operative notion of proposition, is, in general,
undecidable. Furthermore, even if the derivation predicate were
decidable, a serious problem would remain: defining a proposition via
the notion of proof has the strange consequence that undecided
propositions are not propositions at all. To address these problems,
Lorenzen and Lorenz proposed the concept of dialogue:</p>

<blockquote>
  Fully spelled out it means that for an entity to be a proposition
  there must exist a dialogue game associated with this entity, i.e.,
  the proposition <em>A</em>, such that an individual play of the game
  where <em>A</em> occupies the initial position, i.e., a
  dialogue <em>D</em>(<em>A</em>) about <em>A</em>, reaches a final
  position with either win or loss after a finite number of moves
  according to definite rules: the dialogue game is defined as a
  finitary open two-person zero-sum game. (Lorenz 2001)
</blockquote>

<p>
To briefly sketch the central concept, let us say that dialogues are
games where what is at stake is a formula. The set of rules is
designed in such a way that the formula is valid (in some definite
sense of the term) iff the player defending the formula has a winning
strategy in the game.  An important aspect of constructivity in
dialogical logic is obvious in this definition: infinity plays no
role, i.e., it does not rely on a quantification over the set of
models.  The dialogical notion of proof is based on the notion of
game, and, as mentioned in the quote above, dialogue games are
finitary.</p>

<p>
The dialogical approach yielded a semantics for intuitionistic and
classical logic. Landmark publications include: Lorenzen (1958);
Lorenz (1961); Stegmüller (1964); Lorenzen and Lorenz (1978); and
Felscher (1985). The progressive clarification of the main concepts
during the 70s opened the way, from the 80s up to present times, to an
active research programme. During this period, Rahman and
collaborators developed the original ideas into a conceptual framework
that, for reasons the following sections will set out, proved useful
for studying, comparing and combining non-classical logics (see
Rückert 2001).</p>

<p>
Another tradition in dialogical logic developed in parallel with the
just-described one, with occasional and fruitful contacts with
dialogical logic.  The parallel tradition consists of the study of
concrete dialogues, such as those that occur, for example, in natural
languages.  The aim of the parallel tradition was the study of the
underlying logical regularities of these concrete dialogues. This
tradition includes (to name but a few) the new rhetoric of Perelman
(Perelman &amp; L. Olbrechts-Tyteca 1958), Toulmin's argumentation
theory (Toulmin 1958), Barth and Krabbe's theory of dialogue (Barth
&amp; Krabbe 1982), and Woods' work in argumentation theory
(Woods <em>et al.</em> 2000). There has recently been an effort to
bridge the two traditions of dialogical logic, especially in the
context of the logical analysis of legal and more generally
nonmonotonic reasoning.  For more on these efforts, see, Prakken
(2005).</p>

<h2><a name="ForDia">2. Formal Dialogues </a></h2>

<p>
Dialogues provide a way to specify the semantics of a given logic.
This section is devoted to a formal description of the rules of
dialogical games for first-order logic in both its classical and
intuitionistic versions. A detailed account of these rules can be
found in Rahman &amp; Keiff (2004) and Rahman &amp; Tulenheimo
(2006). For a textbook presentation (in French), see Fontaine &amp;
Redmond (2008). We first define a
language, <strong>FO</strong>[τ], as the result of enriching a
first-order language over vocabulary τ with the following
metalogical symbols:</p>

<ol type="i">
  <li>two <em>force symbols</em>, ? and !;</li>
  <li>the symbols <em>L</em>, <em>R</em>, ∨,
    ∀<em>x</em>/<em>c</em>, ∃<em>x</em> (where <em>x</em>
    and <em>c</em> stand, respectively, for any variable and any
    constant of the vocabulary τ);</li>
  <li>two <em>labels</em>, <strong>O</strong> and <strong>P</strong>
    (standing for the players, Opponent and Proponent,
    respectively).</li>
</ol>

<p>

An <em>expression</em> of our language is either a first-order formula
or one of the symbols listed above under (ii.). A <em>dialogically
signed expression</em> is a triple
⟨<strong>X</strong>, <em>f</em>, <em>e⟩</em>,
where <strong>X</strong> is a label, <em>f</em> is a force symbol
and <em>e</em> is an expression. For convenience we
write <strong>X</strong>-<em>f</em>-<em>e</em>. The intended meaning
of such expressions is that player <strong>X</strong> played a move
corresponding to expression <em>e</em>, and this move has to be
considered as an <em>attack</em> (?) or a <em>defence</em> (!). We
use <strong>X</strong> and <strong>Y</strong> as variables ranging on
{<strong>O</strong>, <strong>P</strong>}, always assuming that<strong>
X</strong> ≠<strong> Y</strong>. It should be emphasized that it is
not necessary to conceive the players of dialogical games as empirical
human beings involved in a concrete game. They are often best seen as
idealized agents, described by a strategy function, even if the
connection with actual epistemic subjects is an important part of the
dialogical foundation of meaning.</p>

<h3><a name="RulForDiaGam">2.1 Rules for dialogical games</a></h3>

<p>
Let us now introduce the rules of the dialogical games. There are two
kinds of such rules. <em>Particle rules</em> abstractly
describe the way a formula can be attacked and defended,
according to its main connective. <em>Structural rules</em>, on the
other hand, specify the general organization of the game.</p>

<h4>2.1.1 Particle Rules</h4>

<p>
A particle rule (also known as an argumentation form) abstractly
describes the way a formula of a given main connective may be objected
to, and how to answer the objection. By definition, an argumentation
form is a tuple consisting of (1) an assertion, (2) a set of attacks,
(3) a set of defences, and (4) a relation specifying for each attack
the corresponding defence(s).  Argumentation forms are abstract in the
sense that, in their definition, no reference is made to the context
of argumentation in which the rule is applied (understood as a
situation in a process of argumentation, e.g., as the set of argument
moves made before the assertion for which the particle rule is
defined). The particle rules thus constitute the <em>local
semantics</em> of a logic, for they determine the dialogical meaning
of each logical constant but say nothing about the way this meaning
may be related to anything else. Yet the local semantics given by the
particle rules are intrinsically dependent of the notion of dialogue,
since they describe sequences of language acts.</p>

<p>
In the following tables, <em>A</em> and <em>B</em> are formulas and
<em>A</em>[<em>x</em>/<em>c</em>] denotes the formula resulting from
the substitution of <em>c</em> for any free occurrence of the variable
<em>x</em> in <em>A</em>.  Notice that there is no argumentation form
for atomic formulas.</p>

<p>
In the context of a dialogue, a pair consisting of an attack and the
corresponding defence is called a <em>round</em>. The attack is said
to <em>open</em> the round, and the defence to <em>close</em> it.</p>

<p>
The explication of these rules is fairly obvious. Disjunction and
conjunction differ only by the player who has the choice of the
immediate subformula with which the game will proceed: in a
conjunction, the challenger may choose, confident that either disjunct
can be refuted; in a disjunction the choice lies with the defender.
Thus, to defend a conjunction, a player must be able to defend any of
the conjuncts, while in the case of a disjunction, it is sufficient to
be able to defend one of the disjuncts. The rules are similar in the
case of quantifiers: when attacking a universal quantifier, the
challenger can choose the instantiation he fancies for the bound
variable. When the assertion is existentially quantified, the defender
chooses the instantiation. There is admittedly something less
immediately intuitive in the case of negation and implication. In both
cases, the attack bears a <em>defence</em> force (!). One may convince
himself this is indeed correct by considering the following: in a
dialectical situation, the only way to attack the assertion
¬<em>A</em> is to assert <em>A</em>, and be prepared to defend
this assertion. Thus there is no proper defence against such an
attack, but it may be possible to counterattack the assertion
of <em>A</em>. Along the same lines, to challenge an implication
essentially amounts to providing a proof of the antecedent and
claiming that the other player will fail to build a proof of the
consequent from it. The defence against such an attack then consists
of a proof of the consequent. As underlined in the historical
overview, dialogical logic was born in the context of constructivism,
so it is not a surprise that the attack against ¬<em>A</em>
and <em>A</em>→<em>B</em> is the same: the constructive negation
of <em>A</em> reads as
<em>A</em>→⊥.</p>

<p>
It should be noted that this phenomenon is by no means a trifle: as
will be shown later, stipulations about the way the Proponent can make
use of the assertive content of such attacks by the Opponent are
precisely what yields a variety of dialogical systems corresponding to
(e.g.) minimal logic, intuitionistic logic, free logics, or
paraconsistent logics (see
 <a href="#DiaForNonClaNotVal">Section 3: Dialogues for Non-Classical Notions of Validity</a>
 and the supplementary document
 <a href="supplement.html">Some Dialogical Systems for Non-Classical Logics</a>.).</p>

<p>
Another way to understand the particle rules is to think of them as
describing the evolution of the
<em>state of the</em> (structurally unspecified)
<em>dialogue</em>. States of the dialogue contain information on the
formula about which the debate is running and on the mapping of roles
(challenger and defender) onto the set of players. Let
<em>A</em> ∈ <strong>FO</strong>[τ]. Let
<strong>C</strong>={<em>c</em><sub>0</sub>, <em>c</em><sub>1</sub>,
…} be a set of individual constants. A state of the dialogue
for <em>A</em> is a triple
 <em>S</em>=⟨ρ, σ, Φ⟩ where:</p>

<ul>

  <li>ρ: {<strong>O</strong>, <strong>P</strong>} → {?,!} is
  an assignment of roles (challenger, defender) to players. ρ is
  assumed to be a one-to-one correspondence. We write ρ′ for
  the complement of ρ, i.e., the assignment that reverses the roles
  between <strong>O</strong> and <strong>P</strong> (note that
  ρ′′ = ρ). ρ<sup>−1</sup> is the inverse
  function of ρ, i.e., an assignment of players to roles.</li>
 
 <li>σ: <em>Free</em>[<em>A</em>]→<strong>C</strong> is a function
 mapping each free variable of <em>A</em> into an individual
 constant.</li>
 
 <li>Φ is a player-signed formula,
 either <strong>P</strong>-<em>B</em>
 or <strong>O</strong>-<em>B</em>,
 with <em>B</em> ∈ Sub(<em>A</em>)∪{<em>A</em>}
 (where Sub(<em>A</em>) denotes the set of proper subformulas
 of <em>A</em>). We say that <em>B</em> is the formula <em>at
 stake</em> in <em>S</em>.</li>

</ul>

<p>
Note that the player label of Φ is independent of the
role distribution defined by ρ, i.e., the player that
asserts a formula in a dialogue may be either challenger or
defender. We say that the state of the dialogue
<em>S</em><sub>2</sub> = ⟨ρ<sub>2</sub>, σ<sub>2</sub>,
Φ<sub>2</sub>⟩ is <em>reachable</em> from the state
<em>S</em><sub>1</sub> =
⟨ρ<sub>1</sub>, σ<sub>1</sub>, Φ<sub>1</sub>⟩
iff <em>S</em><sub>2</sub> follows from <em>S</em><sub>1</sub> as a
result of the players making the moves stipulated by the corresponding
particle rules, in the roles determined by ρ<sub>1</sub>. The
player whose role is challenger (?)  states an attack, the other (!)
states a defence. Thus particle rules tell us what states of the
dialogue are reachable from a given state
<em>S</em><sub>1</sub> = ⟨ρ<sub>1</sub>, σ<sub>1</sub>,
Φ<sub>1</sub>⟩, according to the main connective in the
formula <em>B</em> in Φ<sub>1</sub>. What follows is a recursive
definition of the reachability relation between states. As already
mentioned, ρ<sub>1</sub><sup>−1</sup>(!) denotes the player
defending the formula at stake in the corresponding state of the
dialogue (i.e., under a specified role assignment), and
ρ<sub>1</sub><sup>−1</sup>(?) denotes the challenger of this
formula. Let Φ<sub>1</sub> =
ρ<sub>1</sub><sup>−1</sup>(!)-<em>B</em>. <em>S</em><sub>2</sub>
= ⟨ρ<sub>2</sub>, σ<sub>2</sub>,
Φ<sub>2</sub>⟩ is <em>reachable</em> from the state</p>

<blockquote>
  <em>S</em><sub>1</sub> = ⟨ρ<sub>1</sub>,
  σ<sub>1</sub>,
  ρ<sub>1</sub><sup>−1</sup>(!)-<em>B</em>⟩
</blockquote>

<p>
if <em>S</em><sub>2</sub> satisfies the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>
  <strong>Particle rule for conjunction</strong>.  If <em>B</em>
  is of the form <em>C</em>∧<em>D</em>, then
  both <em>S</em><sub>2</sub> and <em>S</em><sub>3</sub> are
  reachable, namely:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <em>S</em><sub>2</sub> = ⟨ρ<sub>1</sub>,
    σ<sub>1</sub>,
    ρ<sub>1</sub><sup>−1</sup>(!)-<em>C</em>⟩
  </blockquote>
  
  <blockquote>
    <em>S</em><sub>3</sub> = ⟨ρ<sub>1</sub>,
    σ<sub>1</sub>,
    ρ<sub>1</sub><sup>−1</sup>(!)-<em>D</em>⟩
  </blockquote>
  
  <p>
  according to the choice of ρ<sub>1</sub><sup>−1</sup>(?),
  between the two attacks ?-<em>L</em> and ?-<em>R</em>. The role
  assignment is not altered.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>
  <strong>Particle rule for disjunction</strong>.  If <em>B</em> is of
  the form <em>C</em>∨<em>D</em>, then both <em>S</em><sub>2</sub>
  and <em>S</em><sub>3</sub> are reachable, namely:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <em>S</em><sub>2</sub> = ⟨ρ<sub>1</sub>,
    σ<sub>1</sub>,
    ρ<sub>1</sub><sup>−1</sup>(!)-<em>C</em>⟩
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote>
    <em>S</em><sub>3</sub> = ⟨ρ1, σ1,
    ρ1<sup>−1</sup>(!)-<em>D</em>⟩
  </blockquote>

  <p>
  according to the choice of ρ<sub>1</sub><sup>−1</sup>(!),
  after an attack ?-∨ of
  ρ<sub>1</sub><sup>−1</sup>(?). The role assignment is not
  altered.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Let us now turn to the less obvious rules for negation and
implication.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>
  <strong>Particle rule for negation</strong>.  If <em>B</em> is of
  the form ¬<em>C</em>, then</p>

  <blockquote>
    <em>S</em><sub>2</sub> = ⟨ρ<sub>1</sub>′,
    σ<sub>1</sub>,
    ρ<sub>1</sub>′<sup>−1</sup>(!)-<em>C</em>⟩
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
    
<p>
Notice that the distribution of roles is inverted
(ρ<sub>1</sub>′), so that in the new state of the
dialogue, the player that was previously challenger of ¬<em>C</em>
is now defender of <em>C</em>. Nevertheless, the
move ρ<sub>1</sub>′<sup>−1</sup>(!)-<em>C</em> is an
attack.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>
  <strong>Particle rule for implication</strong>.  If <em>B</em> is of
  the form <em>C</em>→<em>D</em>, then</p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <em>S</em><sub>2</sub> = ⟨ρ<sub>1</sub>′,
    σ<sub>1</sub>,
    ρ<sub>1</sub>′<sup>−1</sup>(!)-<em>C</em>⟩
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>
Again, to attack an implication amounts to being prepared to defend
its antecedent, so it should be noted that the move
ρ<sub>1</sub>′<sup>−1</sup>(!)-<em>C</em> counts as an
attack. The game will then proceed, up to the choice of
ρ<sub>1</sub>′<sup>−1</sup>(?), according to the
relevant particle rule for <em>C</em>, or to a new state of the
dialogue</p>

<blockquote>
  <em>S</em><sub>3</sub> = ⟨ρ<sub>1</sub>,
  σ<sub>1</sub>,
  ρ<sub>1</sub><sup>−1</sup>(!)-<em>D</em>⟩
</blockquote>

<p>
Note that the role assignment has changed again
(to ρ<sub>1</sub>′′=ρ<sub>1</sub>), so that
the player defending <em>C</em>→<em>D</em> in <em>S</em><sub>1</sub> is
now defending <em>D</em> in <em>S</em><sub>3</sub>.</p>

<p>
Particle rules for the quantifiers present no difficulty: as for
disjunction and conjunction, the only difference is the player who
chooses the instantiation of the bounded variable.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>
  <strong>Particle rule for universal quantifier</strong>.
  If <em>B</em> is of the form ∀<em>xC</em>(<em>x</em>),
  then</p>

  <blockquote>
    <em>S</em><sub>2</sub> = ⟨ρ<sub>1</sub>,
    σ<sub>1</sub>[<em>x</em>/<em>c</em>],
    ρ<sub>1</sub><sup>−1</sup>(!)-<em>C</em>(<em>x</em>)⟩
  </blockquote>
    
  <p>
  where <em>c</em><sub><em>i</em></sub> is a constant chosen by
  ρ<sub>1</sub><sup>−1</sup>(?) when attacking with
  ?-∀<em>x</em>/<em>ci</em>, and
  σ<sub>1</sub>[<em>x</em>/<em>c<sub>i</sub></em>] stipulates
  that the occurrences of <em>x</em> that were bound by the quantifier
  are now to be interpreted as <em>c<sub>i</sub></em>.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>
  <strong>Particle rule for existential quantifier</strong>.
  If <em>B</em> is of the form ∃<em>xC</em>(<em>x</em>),
  then</p>

  <blockquote>
    <em>S</em><sub>2</sub> = ⟨ρ<sub>1</sub>,
    σ<sub>1</sub>,
    ρ<sub>1</sub><sup>−1</sup>(!)-<em>C</em>(<em>x</em>)⟩
  </blockquote>
  
  <p>
  where <em>c</em><sub><em>i</em></sub> is a constant chosen by
  ρ<sub>1</sub><sup>−1</sup>(!) when defending against the
  attack ?-∃ of ρ<sub>1</sub><sup>−1</sup>(?), and
  σ<sub>1</sub>[<em>x</em>/<em>c<sub>i</sub></em>] stipulates
  that the occurrences of <em>x</em> that were bound by the quantifier
  are now to be interpreted as <em>c<sub>i</sub></em>.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4>2.1.2 Structural rules</h4>

<p>
In the same way as particle rules describe the local meaning of the
logical constants, structural rules determine their global
semantics. As is the case in the context of substructural logics, the
notion of <em>proof</em> in a given dialogue system is determined by
the structural rules. Structural rules thus describe the way an
argumentation is built, which means they are responsible for the
general organization of the dialogues.  The structural rules are meant
to organize the application of the particle rules in such a way that
the set of moves resulting from the application of the rules to an
initial formula (called the <em>thesis</em>) yields a dialogue that
can be seen as a valid argument for the thesis. There is, of course, a
wide range of notions of validity, but here we are particularly
interested in <em>logical validity</em>. So the rules should be
designed in such a way that a certain type of completion of the
dialogue for a given thesis constitutes a proof of its logical
validity. But it should be noted that other normative concepts could
be used to shape the structural rules, e.g., adequacy to idealized
empirical argumentation, like it is in, for example, legal
argumentation theory. See the end of
 <a href="#StrRulLogPlu">Section 2.2.2</a> for some general comments on the
formulation of structural rules.</p>

<p>
As will be emphasized in the next section, the notion of proof in
the context of logical dialogues is based on the existence of a
winning strategy for the Proponent. This will be reflected in the
definitions we use. A <em>dialogue</em> can be thought of as a set of
<em>dialogical games</em>, which are in turn sequences of dialogically
signed expressions
<strong>X</strong>-<em>f</em>-<em>e</em>. Dialogical games are
structured as a <em>tree</em>, the root of which is constituted by a
(possibly empty) sequence of premises together with the thesis of the
dialogue in the final position. Splits in the dialogue tree are
generated by the propositional choices of the Opponent. Any possible
attack by the Opponent against a conjunction, any possible defence of
a disjunction, and either possible reaction in the case of an attack
by the Proponent against a conditional he defends (counterattack or
defence) will generate a new branch in the dialogue tree. No move of
the Proponent will open a new branch. A completed dialogue tree will
thus contain all the Opponent's possible choices.</p>

<p>
As already mentioned, a dialogue is a set of sequences of
dialogically signed expressions. All sequences have as a common root a
(possibly empty) sequence of premises, together with the thesis. All
other members of the games are termed <em>moves</em>, and we say that
a player <em>makes a move</em>. According to the player making the
move, we talk about <strong>P</strong>-<em>moves</em> or
<strong>O</strong>-<em>moves</em>. Any move is either an
<em>attack</em> or a <em>defence</em>. The particle rules stipulate
exactly which of the moves are to be counted as attacks. Obviously,
any move which is not an attack is a defence. A move
<strong>X</strong>-<em>f</em>-<em>e</em> is said to have a
<em>propositional content</em> iff <em>e</em> is a first-order formula
<em>(e</em> ∈ <strong>FO</strong>[τ]). <strong>D</strong>(<em>A</em>)
denotes the dialogue with, as a thesis, a move of the form
<strong>P</strong>-!-<em>A</em>, and we say that
<strong>D</strong>(<em>A</em>) is <em>a</em> <em>dialogue for</em> <em>A</em>. There
exists a dialogue for <em>A</em> iff
<em>A</em> ∈ <strong>FO</strong>[τ]. <em>Premises</em> of a
dialogue must have a propositional content, and are moves of the form
<strong>O</strong>-!-<em>A</em> occurring at the beginning of the
dialogue. <strong>D</strong>(<em>A</em>;<em>A</em><sub>1</sub>, …,
<em>A</em><sub><em>n</em></sub>) denotes a dialogue for <em>A</em>
with premises of propositional content <em>A</em><sub>1</sub>, …,
<em>A</em><sub><em>n</em></sub>. Δ<sub>1</sub>, …,
Δ<sub><em>n</em></sub> denote the dialogical games that are members of
<strong>D</strong>(<em>A</em>). Δ<sub>1</sub>[<em>n</em>]
denotes the <em>n</em>-th member of the sequence Δ<sub>1</sub>,
and we talk of the <em>rank</em> <em>n</em> of the move
Δ[<em>n</em>]: when writing down a dialogue, one keeps track of
the assertion/attack relation by adding an extra label to the attack
moves, namely the rank of the assertion attacked. This will become
clear in the examples.</p>

<p>
Now let us state the structural rules.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>
  <strong>SR-0: Starting Rule</strong>.  <br /> For any Δ
  ∈ <strong>D</strong>(<em>A</em>), the thesis has position
  0:</p>
  
  <blockquote>
    Δ[0]=<strong>P</strong>-!-<em>A</em>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>
For any <em>n</em> &gt; 0 and for any Δ
∈ <strong>D</strong>(<em>A</em>) such that Δ[<em>n</em>]
exists, if <em>n</em> is even then Δ[<em>n</em>] denotes
a <strong>P</strong>-move and otherwise denotes
an <strong>O</strong>-move. If the set of premises is not empty, then
all the dialogical games contain
it. Let <em>A</em><sub>0</sub>, …, <em>A</em><sub><em>i</em></sub> be the
propositional content of the premises. Then for all
Δ ∈ <strong>D</strong>(<em>A</em>), Δ begins
with <em>i</em> terms of
rank <em>H</em><sub>0</sub>, …, <em>H</em><em><sub>i</sub></em>
such that
Δ[<em>H</em><sub>0</sub>] = 
<strong>O</strong>-!-<em>A</em><sub>0</sub>, …,
Δ[<em>H</em><sub><em>i</em></sub>]=<strong>O</strong>-!-<em>A</em><sub><em>i</em></sub>.These
moves are the <em>premises</em> of the
dialogue <strong>D</strong>(<em>A</em>). The set of all premises
of <strong>D</strong>(<em>A</em>) together with the thesis is called
the <em>root</em> of <strong>D</strong>(<em>A</em>).</p>

<p>
Any move following the thesis is a reaction to a previous move by the
other player, and must comply with all the structural and particle
rules of the dialogue.</p>

<blockquote>
  <strong>SR-1<sub>i</sub>: Intuitionistic Round Closure
  Rule</strong>.  <br /> Whenever player <strong>X</strong> is to play,
  he can attack any move of <strong>Y</strong> in so far as the other
  rules let him do so, or defend against the <em>last</em> attack
  of <strong>Y</strong> (i.e., the attack in the game with the highest
  rank), provided he has not already defended against it. A player may
  postpone a defence as long as there are attacks he can put
  forth.
</blockquote>
  
<blockquote>
  <strong>SR-1<sub>c</sub>: Classical Round Closure Rule</strong>.
  <br /> Whenever player <strong>X</strong> is to play, he can attack
  any move of <strong>Y</strong> in so far as the other rules let him
  do so, or defend against <em>any</em> attack of <strong>Y</strong>
  (even the ones against which he has already defended). In other
  terms, players can play again earlier defences (which makes sense
  when another move is available).
</blockquote>

<p>
Notice that the rules of a dialogical system cannot include both
SR-1<sub>i</sub> and SR-1<sub>c</sub> (see <a href="#DiaLog">Section 2.2</a>).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>
  <strong>SR-2: Branching Rule For Dialogical Games</strong>. <br />
  Let Δ ∈ <strong>D</strong>(<em>A</em>) be a dialogical
  game of even length (that is, where <strong>O</strong> is to
  play). There are three cases in which Δ will be extended in
  such a way that it will generate two distinct (new) games
  Δ<sub>1</sub> and Δ<sub>2</sub>. Let <em>n</em> be the
  length of Δ and <em>m</em> be the number of premises
  of <strong>D</strong>(<em>A</em>), then for all <em>i</em> ∈
  {H<sub>0</sub>, …, <em>H</em><em><sub>m</sub></em>,0, …, <em>n</em>},
  Δ<sub>1</sub>[<em>i</em>]=Δ<sub>2</sub>[<em>i</em>].</p>
  
  <ol>
    
    <li>
      Assume for some <em>m</em> such that
      0&lt;<em>m</em>&lt;<em>n</em>, Δ[<em>m</em>]= <strong>O</strong>-!-<em>B</em>∨<em>C</em> and
      Δ[<em>n</em>]= <strong>P</strong>-?-∨. Then <strong>O</strong>
      may choose to extend Δ to Δ<sub>1</sub> and
      Δ<sub>2</sub> with two moves:
      
      <blockquote>
	Δ<sub>1</sub>[<em>n</em>+1]= <strong>O</strong>-!-<em>B</em>
      </blockquote>
      
      <blockquote>
	Δ<sub>2</sub>[<em>n</em>+1]= <strong>O</strong>-!-<em>C</em>
      </blockquote>

    </li>
	
    <li>
      Assume that Δ
      [<em>n</em>]= <strong>P</strong>-!-<em>B</em>∧<em>C</em>. Then <strong>O</strong>
      may choose to extend Δ to Δ<sub>1</sub> and
      Δ<sub>2</sub> with two moves:

      <blockquote>
	Δ<sub>1</sub>[<em>n</em>+1]= <strong>O</strong>-?-L
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>
	Δ<sub>2</sub>[<em>n</em>+1]= <strong>O</strong>-?-R
      </blockquote>
    </li>

  <li>
    Assume for some <em>m</em> such that
    0&lt;<em>m</em>&lt;<em>n</em>, Δ
    [<em>m</em>]= <strong>O</strong>-!-<em>B</em>→<em>C</em> and
    Δ[<em>n</em>]= <strong>P</strong>-!-<em>B</em>. Then <strong>O</strong>
    may choose to extend Δ to Δ<sub>1</sub> and
    Δ<sub>2</sub> with two moves:
    
    <blockquote>
      Δ<sub>1</sub>[<em>n</em>+1]= <strong>O</strong>-?-…
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      Here the dots stand for an attack corresponding to the relevant
      particle rule, according to formula <em>B</em>.</p>
    
    <blockquote>
      Δ<sub>2</sub>[<em>n</em>+1]= <strong>O</strong>-!-<em>C</em>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>
No other game situation will generate distinct dialogical games, i.e.,
in any other case, the next move will be
Δ[<em>n</em>+1]. Actually, one could make SR-2 symmetric, and
let <strong>P</strong> generate new games too. But, as the following
rule will show, it is always strategically the best choice
for <strong>P</strong> to stay in the same context.</p>

<p>
Notice that the explicit reference to logical constants here is just a
convenient way to give a formally precise account of the notion
of <strong>O</strong>-choice. Actually, a general formulation
(although less precise) for this rule would be: any game situation
were <strong>O</strong> is to play and has to chose between several
moves will generate a distinct game for every choice available
to <strong>O</strong>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>
  <strong>SR-3a: Winning Rule For Dialogical Games</strong>.  <br /> A
  dialogical game Δ ∈ <strong>D</strong>(<em>A</em>) is
  said to be <em>closed</em> iff there is some atomic formula which
  has been played by both players. More precisely, Δ is closed
  iff there are two integers <em>m</em> and <em>n</em> and an atomic
  formula α ∈ Sub(<em>A</em>)∪{<em>A</em>}
  such that the propositional content of Δ[<em>m</em>] is
  α and is identical to the propositional content of
  Δ[<em>n</em>], and exactly one of
  {Δ[<em>m</em>], Δ[<em>n</em>]} is
  a <strong>P</strong>-move (the other one being, consequently,
  an <strong>O</strong>-move). A dialogical game is <em>open</em> iff
  it is not closed.</p>

  <p>
  A dialogical game is <em>finished</em> iff it is closed or the rules
  do not allow any further move by the player who has to move. Let
  Δ be a finished game. If Δ is closed, the player who
  stated the thesis (i.e., <strong>P</strong> according to rule
  SR-0) <em>wins</em> it, otherwise he <em>loses</em> it. A finished
  game cannot be extended.</p>
</blockquote>
  
<blockquote>
  <strong>SR-4: Shifting Rule</strong>.  <br /> Let
  Δ, Δ′ ∈ <strong>D</strong>(<em>A</em>) be two
  distinct dialogical games. Assume <strong>O</strong> has chosen to
  play in Δ. <strong>O</strong> may switch to Δ′ iff
  he has lost the game Δ. In other words, <strong>O</strong>
  cannot switch to another game before the game he is playing is
  closed.
</blockquote>

<p>
Notice that <strong>D</strong>(<em>A</em>) can be seen as
a <em>sequence</em> of games, in the sense that the order in
which <strong>O</strong> chooses to play the different dialogical
games of the dialogue yields a different course for the dialogue. Such
an order on the games of a dialogue <strong>D</strong>(<em>A</em>) is
called a <em>play</em>
of <strong>D</strong>(<em>A</em>). ⟨<strong>D</strong>(<em>A</em>), <em>p</em>⟩
denotes the play <em>p</em> of
dialogue <strong>D</strong>(<em>A</em>).</p>

<blockquote>
  <strong>SR-3b: Winning Rule for Dialogical Plays</strong>.  <br />
  Let ⟨<strong>D</strong>(<em>A</em>), <em>p</em>⟩ be a
  play <em>p</em> of <strong>D</strong>(<em>A</em>) of the
  form <em>p</em>=⟨Δ<sub>0</sub>, …,
  Δ<em><sub>n</sub></em>,
  Δ⟩. ⟨<strong>D</strong>(<em>A</em>), <em>p</em>⟩
  is <em>finished</em> iff all games Δ<sub>0</sub>, …,
  Δ<em><sub>n </sub></em>are closed and Δ is
  finished. ⟨<strong>D</strong>(<em>A</em>), <em>p</em>⟩
  is <em>closed</em> iff it is finished and Δ is
  closed. <strong>P</strong> wins the play
  ⟨<strong>D</strong>(<em>A</em>), <em>p</em>⟩ iff
  ⟨<strong>D</strong>(<em>A</em>), <em>p</em>⟩ is closed,
  otherwise <strong>O</strong> wins.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <strong>SR-5: Formal Use of Atomic Formulas</strong>.  <br /> Let
  ⟨<strong>D</strong>(<em>A</em>), <em>p</em>⟩ be a
  dialogical play. Δ<em><sub>i</sub></em>[<em>m</em>] is a
  move <em>previous</em> to Δ<em><sub>i</sub></em>[<em>n</em>]
  iff <em>m</em>&lt;<em>n.</em> An atomic formula α is said to
  be <em>introduced</em> in a play
  ⟨<strong>D</strong>(<em>A</em>), <em>p</em>⟩ by move
  Δ<em><sub>i</sub></em>[<em>n</em>] iff (i) α is the
  propositional content of Δ<em><sub>i</sub></em>[<em>n</em>];
  (ii) there is no previous move
  Δ<em><sub>i</sub></em>[<em>m</em>] such that α is the
  propositional content of
  Δ<em><sub>i</sub></em>[<em>m</em>]. That is, an atomic formula
  is introduced by a move if it has not been played in a previous move
  of the play.
</blockquote>

<p><strong>P</strong> cannot introduce atomic formulas. That
is, <strong>P</strong> can make a move whose propositional content is
an atomic formula α in a play <em>p</em>
of <strong>D</strong>(<em>A</em>) iff <strong>O</strong> introduced
α in a previous move. Atomic formulas cannot be attacked.</p>

<p>
Because of the formal restriction, the game for quantifiers is
asymmetric, in the sense that any time he can, <strong>O</strong> will
try to introduce a new constant (in order to
prevent <strong>P</strong> from using the
information <strong>O</strong> already conceded); and for dual
reasons, <strong>P</strong> will always try to use the constants
already conceded. Some important aspects of the meaning of the SR-5
rule are discussed in the second example of <a href="#Exa">Section 2.3</a>.</p>

<p>
To state the next rule, we first need some definitions.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Definition: Strict Repetitions</strong></p>

  <p>
  A constant is said to be <em>used</em> by a player if the player
  chooses it to attack a universal quantifier or to defend an
  existential quantifier. A constant is said to be <em>new</em> if it
  is used by a player and has not been used by either player in a
  previous move.</p>

  <p>
  Let Δ[<em>m</em>] <strong>X</strong>-?-<em>e</em> be an attack
  against some previous move Δ[<em>n</em>]. We say that
  Δ[<em>m</em>] is a <em>strict repetition</em> iff either (i)
  there exists some move Δ[<em>k</em>] such
  that <em>n</em>&lt;<em>k</em>&lt;<em>m</em>, and Δ[<em>k</em>]
  is an attack against Δ[<em>n</em>] with an
  expression <em>e</em> identical to the expression in
  Δ[<em>m</em>]; or (ii) Δ[<em>m</em>] is an attack
  against an universal quantifier asserted in Δ[<em>n</em>],
  introducing a <em>new</em> constant, and there exists some move
  Δ[<em>k</em>] such
  that <em>n</em>&lt;<em>k</em>&lt;<em>m</em>, and Δ[<em>k</em>]
  also attacks Δ[<em>n</em>] introducing a new constant.</p>

  <p>
  Let Δ[<em>m</em>] <strong>X</strong>-!-<em>e</em> be a defence
  against some previous attack Δ[<em>n</em>]. We say that
  Δ[<em>m</em>] is a <em>strict repetition</em> iff either (i)
  there exists some move Δ[<em>k</em>] such
  that <em>n</em>&lt;<em>k</em>&lt;<em>m</em>, and Δ[<em>k</em>]
  is a defence against Δ[<em>n</em>] with an
  expression <em>e</em> identical to the one in Δ[<em>m</em>];
  or (ii) Δ[<em>m</em>] is a defence of an existential
  quantifier, introducing a <em>new</em> constant, and there exists
  some move Δ[<em>k</em>] such
  that <em>n</em>&lt;<em>k</em>&lt;<em>m</em>, and Δ[<em>k</em>]
  defends the <em>same</em> quantifier, also by introducing a constant
  which was new at <em>k</em>.</p>

  <p>
  Nothing else is a strict repetition.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
We can now state the next rule, which has classical and intuitionistic
variants corresponding respectively to SR-1<sub>c</sub> and
SR-1<sub>i</sub>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <strong>SR-6<sub>c</sub>: Classical No-Delaying-Tactics
  Rule</strong>.  <br /> No strict repetition is allowed.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <strong>SR-6<sub>i</sub>: Intuitionistic No-Delaying-Tactics
  Rule</strong>.  <br /> If <strong>O</strong> has introduced an atomic
  formula which can be now used by <strong>P</strong>,
  then <strong>P</strong> may perform a repetition of an attack. No
  other type of repetition is allowed.
</blockquote>

<h3><a name="DiaLog">2.2 Dialogues as logic </a></h3>

<p>
The rules of the dialogical games are defined, but now the question
is: how do such games relate to logic in the first place? In the
tradition of dialogical logic, it is usual to define validity using
the notion of <em>winning strategy</em> for the Proponent.</p>

<p>
A <em>strategy</em> for player <strong>X</strong> in a dialogical game
is a function taking histories (i.e., sequences of moves of the game
whose first member is the thesis (or the set of premises and the
thesis) and such that all subsequent moves comply with the rules)
where the last move is a <strong>Y</strong>-move as arguments, and
(legal) <strong>X</strong>-moves as values. In other terms, a strategy
is a function that tells to a player what to do according to what has
previously happened in the game. A strategy in this sense must
tell <strong>X</strong> what to do against <em>any</em> possible
sequence of <strong>Y</strong>-moves (i.e., in all possible
histories). A <em>winning</em> strategy for <strong>X</strong> is a
strategy such that <strong>X</strong> will win the game if he makes
all his moves according to the strategy. Notice that the relevant
arguments for a winning strategy for <strong>X</strong> are sequences
of moves that differ in the <strong>Y</strong>-moves, since
the <strong>X</strong>-moves are determined by the strategy
itself.</p>

<p>
The structural rules, in the version presented here, are conceived
with the purpose of reflecting the notion of strategy in the way the
(global) game is organised. Indeed, <strong>P</strong> cannot win a
play of <strong>D</strong>(<em>A</em>) unless he is able to win the
game against all possible moves by <strong>O</strong>: each dialogical
game is defined by a sequence of choices of <strong>O</strong>, so the
set of all the games is the set of all
possible <strong>O</strong>-choices in the dialogue. Thus we can
define the notion of validity without explicit reference to
strategy:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>
  <strong>Definition (Validity)</strong>:</p>

  <p>
  A first-order sentence <em>A</em> is said to be <em>dialogically
  valid</em> if all dialogical games belonging to the
  dialogue <strong>D</strong>(<em>A</em>) are closed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
More generally, we can define a notion of (dia)logical consequence:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>
  <strong>Definition (Dialogical Consequence)</strong>:</p>

  <p>
  A first-order sentence <em>A</em> is said to be a <em>dialogical
  consequence</em> of a finite set
  Γ={<em>A</em><sub>0</sub>, …, <em>A</em><sub><em>n</em></sub>}
  of first-order sentences if all dialogical games belonging to the
  dialogue <strong>D</strong>(<em>A</em>), whose root consists of a
  set of premises of propositional
  content <em>A</em><sub>0</sub>, …, <em>A</em><sub><em>n</em></sub>
  and <em>A</em> as a thesis, are closed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
An interesting philosophical property of the dialogical approach is
that the difference between notions of logical consequence is
expressed as a difference in the structural rules. This feature is
exemplified by the set of rules presented in the previous section. If
one takes the whole set except SR-1<sub>i</sub>, then it can be shown
that an <strong>FO</strong> sentence is dialogically valid iff it is a
valid sentence of <strong>FO</strong> classical logic. If, on the
other hand, one takes the whole set of rules except SR-1<sub>c</sub> and
SR-6<sub>c</sub>, then an <strong>FO</strong> sentence is dialogically
valid iff it is a valid sentence of <strong>FO</strong> intuitionistic
logic.</p>

<p>
To see how such characterization theorems can be proved, observe that
the states of the game as described in the particle rules correspond
exactly to the tableau rules for the same connectives when embedded in
a dialogue. For a thorough introduction to tableau methods, see
d'Agostino <em>et al</em> (1999). The <strong>O</strong>-signed
formulas of the states of the dialogue correspond
to <em>T</em>-labeled formulas of the tableaux,
while <strong>P</strong>-formulas correspond to the <em>F</em>-labeled
formulas. Now observe that the branching rules of dialogical games
correspond to the branching rules of tableaux: dialogical games split
when <strong>O</strong> defends a disjunction
(<em>T</em>-<em>A</em>∨<em>B</em>), attacks
a <strong>P</strong>-conjunction
(<em>F</em>-<em>A</em>∧<em>B</em>), or reacts to an attack against
his assertion of a conditional
(<em>T</em>-<em>A</em>→<em>B</em>). The match between quantifier
rules can be seen thus: when <strong>O</strong> defends an existential
quantifier (<em>T</em>-∃<em>xA</em>) or attacks a universal
quantifier (<em>F</em>-∀<em>xA</em>), his best option is to
prevent <strong>P</strong> from using atomic formulas he himself
conceded previously in the game (remember the formal restriction SR-5)
so any time he can, he will introduce a new constant. Intuitionistic
tableaux are a little more complicated, for the set of formulas to
which the expansion rules can be applied is a subset of the formulas
on the branch, so a marking device is needed in order to keep track of
what formulas are available at a given stage of the tree-building
process. Complete descriptions and proofs can be found in Rahman
(1993). An earlier formulation of the proofs related to natural
deduction and sequent calculus can be found in Haas (1980), and
Felscher (1985). As to Haas (1980) Felscher remarks “it seems
that the technical gaps contained in this work are only minor and can
actually be filled”, (1985, p. 351).</p>

<h4>2.2.1 Dialogues and tableaux</h4>

<p>
When considering dialogues for validity, there is a straightforward
way to transform a dialogue into a tableau and back. Thus the
difference is not so much technical, but rather philosophical. It is
also twofold. First, as already noted, dialogue systems are not
necessarily intended to capture a notion of validity. Concrete plays
of the dialogical games could include errors, fallacies, failure in
proof search, etc. Thus the dialogues that do characterize a definite
notion of validity can be seen as an abstraction from concrete,
empirical dialogue games. This leads to the second point: it has been
claimed (e.g., in Lorenzen &amp; Lorenz 1978) that the genetic link
between concrete dialogues and validity dialogues <em>explain</em> why
the rules of validity games are the way they are. Extrapolating from
this point, one would say then that the dialogical approach offers a
philosophical standpoint that also gives an explanation of the
tableaux rules.</p>

<p>
The last point is of particular interest. The branchings that occur in
a tableau proof receive a natural explanation in a dialogical
perspective, namely in terms of strategies. Actually, one can show
that a tableau proof is a reduct of the extensive form of the
dialogical game, where <strong>O</strong>'s choices are the only ones
that are taken into account. Such a reduct is useful since it exhibits
the winning strategy: <strong>P</strong> has a winning strategy if,
and only if, any leaf of the tree is a <strong>P</strong> move. To see
the connection with the usual tableau closure rule, consider the
following. The propositional content of such a move can only be an
atomic formula (else there would be challenges available
to <strong>O</strong>), and the formal restriction warrants that the
same atomic formula has been introduced by <strong>O</strong> earlier
in the same branch.</p>

<p>
It is thus possible to understand tableau proofs as a form of
metalogical reasoning <em>about</em> a game, whose features determine
and explain the form of the tableau rules.</p>

<h4><a name="StrRulLogPlu">2.2.2 Structural rules and logical pluralism</a></h4>

<p>
From the dialogical perspective, as already noted, differences between
logical systems are conceived as differences in the sets of structural
rules. In this respect, dialogues are akin to the substructural
approach (see the entry
on <a href="../logic-substructural/">substructural logics</a>). This
feature has a philosophical importance that has been elaborated in
J. C. Beall and G. Restall's series of papers dedicated to logical
pluralism (e.g., see Restall 2002).  Quine argues that it makes no
sense to talk about a plurality of logics, because this plurality is
just linguistic, not logical. Changing the meaning of the logical
constants amounts to simply changing the subject, i.e., changing of
idiom. Now, says Quine, when a translation suggests that a speaker is
making use of another notion of logical consequence between the
assertions he makes, Occam's razor (in the form of the Charity
Principle) tells us that it is more parsimonious to consider that our
translation of what the speaker says is incorrect, rather than the
speaker making use of another logic. So logical changes are just
linguistic changes (e.g., paraconsistent negation is, in this
view, <em>not</em> talking about the meaning of “not”, but
rather about some other indigenous connective), and there cannot be
any controversy about the meaning of the logical constants. But from a
dialogical point of view, in so far as local semantics (i.e., the
introduction/elimination rules, or, dialogically, the particle rules)
stay untouched, there seem to be strong grounds to the claim that we
are indeed talking about the <em>same</em> language. So the different
sets of structural rules actually define different theories of
inference, and there seem to be no unquestionable grounds for the
claim that one of them is the only correct one.</p>

<p>
There is no general theory of the way structural rules should be
formulated, and there is no unique language in which all possible
structural rules should be expressed. There are, nevertheless, some
regular patterns that may be worth noting. There is a core of
structural rules that remain fairly unchanged from one system to
another: these rules define what a game is, who the players are, the
order of the moves and what a winning move is (i.e., rules SR-0, 2,
3a, 3b, 4). The structural rules that are altered in
order to produce the dialogical systems overviewed
in <a href="#DiaForNonClaNotVal">Section 3</a> are those that remain. They stipulate
which moves can be attacked, when a defence can be made, and what can
be asserted by the players. Now, with the exception of the modal
systems, many of the dialogical systems in the literature are
subclassical, in the sense that the set of valid formulas of these
systems is a subset of the set of classically valid formulas.  A
typical <em>modus operandi</em> to produce a subclassical system is to
modify the rules in order to restrict the moves available to the
Proponent, thus restricting the set of his winning strategies (i.e., of
the dialogically valid formulas).
 <a href="#DiaForNonClaNotVal">Section 3</a>
 contains
various detailed examples of such restriction-generated systems, and
the interested reader may also consult the supplementary document
 <a href="supplement.html">Some Dialogical Systems for Non-Classical Logics</a>.
  Details of the
connection between structural rules of Gentzen-Style sequent calculi
and their dialogical counterparts are given in
 <a href="#ProTheAspDia">Section 4</a>.</p>

<h4>2.2.3 Dialogues, constructivity and the procedural aspect of proofs</h4>

<p>
As a legacy from the philosophical stance of the fathers of the
dialogical approach, the systems of dialogical logic are usually
constructive procedures to prove the validity of formulas. Let the
length of a dialogue be the sum of the length of all its finished
games. Notice that, in the case of <em>propositional logic</em>, the
SR-6 rules ensure that dialogues for a <em>finite root</em> (i.e., a
root consisting of a finite set of premises and a thesis, all being
formulas of finite length) are of finite length. Indeed, each
attack/defence pair in a game eliminates one connective from the
formula at stake, in the sense that the game will proceed with respect
to a strict subformula of the formula which has been attacked and
defended. So after finitely many such pairs, the game will finish,
reaching the atoms of the formulas in the root of the dialogue, which
(according to SR-5) cannot be attacked, since all attacks and defences
allowed by SR-6 have been performed. Finitely many moves of such a
game will yield a splitting between exactly two finite games, and so
on. So the length of the whole dialogue is finite. This property is
conserved in all the non-classical variants of propositional logic
presented in Section 3 and the supplementary document
 <a href="supplement.html">Some Dialogical Systems for Non-Classical Logics</a>,
 and plays an important role in the GTS-style dialogues
of
 <a href="#ProModBacDiaGTS">Section 5</a>.</p>

<p>
Nevertheless, this doesn't mean that <em>every</em> system of
dialogical logic will constitute a constructive decision
procedure. For instance, one can give dialogue rules for second-order
logic using lambda-abstraction, and such a system would not be a
decision procedure. The reason is that even though one could prove the
system sound and complete (i.e., that there is a winning strategy
for <strong>P</strong> in a dialogue for a second order
formula <em>A</em> iff <em>A</em> is valid), there is no way to
systematically define such a winning strategy. The finding of the
strategy requires from <strong>P</strong> what one could see as a
“creative” step, in the sense that there is no mechanical
way to compute all the moves of an arbitrary strategy.</p>

<p>
Being essentially procedural, dialogues well capture the dynamic
aspects of logic. It was already stated that the point of using
dialogues to give a semantics to intuitionistic logic: the
SR-1<sub>i</sub> rule amounts to requiring of <strong>P</strong>
that <em>at any stage of the game</em> he is able to provide grounds
for his assertions without having to rely on later concessions
of <strong>O</strong> (i.e., attacks against a negation or a
conditional). (See the third example in <a href="#Exa">Section 2.3</a>.) 
Fruitful research in the context of legal reasoning has
shown that dialogues can be devised where some of the rules of the
dialogue can be discussed and modified within the very process of the
dialogue. <strong>V</strong> and <strong>F</strong> operators of
connexive dialogical logic provide an example of the way a change in
the rules can be coded in the syntax (see Section 4 of supplementary
document
the <a href="supplement.html">Some Dialogical Systems for Non-Classical Logics</a>).</p>

<h3><a name="Exa">2.3 Examples </a></h3>

<p>
Let us examine some concrete examples of how a dialogue is built in
the case of simple formulas. A dialogical proof of validity is written
in the form of a table, with as a main division one column
for <strong>O</strong> and one for <strong>P</strong>. Each line of a
table bears one move of the corresponding player. Each of the two
(<strong>O</strong> and <strong>P</strong>) columns is divided in
three: the outer sub-column bears the rank label of the move; when the
move is an attack, the inner sub-column bears the rank of the attacked
move; finally, the centre sub-column indicates the dialogical
expression contained in the move. An attack and the corresponding
defence (when it is performed) are written on the same line. Thus a
completed line represents a closed round.</p>

<p>
Let us begin with a contingent formula.</p>

<blockquote>
The Opponent Wins
<table border="1" cellspacing="0">
  <tbody><tr>
    <th colspan="3" align="center"><strong>O</strong></th>
    <th colspan="3" align="center"><strong>P</strong></th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th align="center"></th>
    <td align="center"></td>
    <td align="center"></td>
    <td align="center"></td>
    <td align="center">(α∨β)→α</td>
    <td align="center">0</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="center">1</td>
    <td align="center">(α∨β)</td>
    <td align="center">0</td>
    <td align="center"></td>
    <td align="center">α</td>
    <td align="center">4</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="center">3</td>
    <td align="center">α</td>
    <td align="center"></td>
    <td align="center">1</td>
    <td align="center">?<sub><em>v</em></sub></td>
    <td align="center">2</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="center">3′</td>
    <td align="center">β</td>
    <td align="center"></td>
    <td align="center"></td>
    <td align="center"></td>
    <td align="center"></td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>
</blockquote>

<p>
Here the Opponent makes a redundant move, namely conceding that
α holds to defend the disjunction asserted in 1. Move 4 closes
this dialogical game, then <strong>O</strong> has the right to switch
to a new game with 3′, where he wins. <strong>P</strong> has to
move, and there is nothing to attack or defend. This play of the game
is finished and not closed; <strong>O</strong> wins, the formula is not
valid.</p>

<p>
Let us now turn to the proof of a simple tautology, a proof which
is almost trivial, and yet displays some of the most important aspects
of dialogical proof theory.</p>

<blockquote>

    <td align="center">3</td>
    <td align="center">?<sub>α</sub></td>
    <td align="center">4</td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>
</blockquote>

<p>
This basic dialogue contains just one game, including moves 0 to
2. The dialogue is obviously closed. Now, such a dialogical proof
features a dynamics in the flow of information that is proper to game
semantics of the dialogical kind. One way to make this flow explicit
is to extend the game with some (abstract sketch of) dialectical
reasoning about the atomic formula. This is what is informally noted
here as moves 3 to 6. <em>Those moves are not a part of the actual
dialogue</em> but a representation of the following
considerations. The justification of the assertion of a complex
sentence in a dialogue is given with respect to its subsentences. The
process is recursive, and eventually stops when reaching atomic
sentences. Now the justification of such atomic assertions is not
considered in the formulation of the game when one wants to capture
the notion of validity. The formal rule says that whatever concept of
justification for atomic sentences is good enough
for <strong>O</strong> will suffice for <strong>P</strong>. But there
is more to say within a game-theoretical framework about the
connection between formal dialogues and other kind of argumentation
processes where atomic sentences are justified. Such processes are
precisely what we refer to with !<sub>α</sub>.</p>

<p>
In 3, the Opponent asks on what grounds the Proponent asserted the
atom α. Now the Proponent's answer is a counterattack (move
4). <strong>P</strong>'s strategy for grounding his assertion that
α holds can be paraphrased thus: “I don't have my own
justification, but whatever grounds <em>you</em> assumed
when <em>you</em> asserted α are good enough for me”. This
so-called <em>copycat strategy</em> is the core of the formal
restriction (SR-5). From this point of view, atoms are nothing but
unknown or arbitrary formulas, for which the proof strategy may even
not be known. SR-5 structurally reflects the existence of an abstract
strategy, which is a winning strategy regardless of the concrete
nature or shape of the proof of the relevant atom.</p>

<p>
The following example illustrates the insights that dialogical logic
offers on the difference between classical and intuitionistic
logic:</p>

<blockquote>

  </tr>
</tbody></table>
</blockquote>

<p>
To defend against attack 1, <strong>P</strong> has to choose
¬α, because the other disjunct is an atom that he cannot
state before <strong>O</strong> has conceded it. In attacking the
negation in 3, <strong>O</strong> concedes the means to defend the
other disjunct. With classical rules, <strong>P</strong> can make use
of this information to defend again in 4 and win. Such a defence is
not allowed in intuitionistic logic, which takes seriously the
procedural nature of the proof. <strong>P</strong>'s defence in 2 will
lead to a loss because <strong>P</strong> has to choose without
knowing which disjunct he has a proof for. When he eventually gets the
information to justify a choice, it will be too late
intuitionistically.</p>

<p>
The following example illustrates the importance of the flow of
information within a proof.</p>

<p>
The decisive move is the defence 6, where <strong>P </strong>defends
again against attack 1, bearing in mind the constant chosen
by <strong>O</strong> in his attack 5. <strong>O</strong>'s attack in
7 gives <strong>P</strong> the right atom in order to defend against
5. The
 <a href="supplement.html#FreLog">dialogue system for free logic</a> shows the
importance of taking the choice of an interpretation for variables as
an <em>explicit move</em>.</p>

<h2><a name="DiaForNonClaNotVal">3. Dialogues for Non-Classical Notions of Validity</a></h2>

<p>
As has been mentioned already, dialogical logic has converted itself
into a conceptual framework of sufficient generality to be able to
express, combine and compare a number of diverse notions of validity
of logical inference. Actually, the idea of dialogical logic as a
general framework emerged during the late 1990s, and represents a
radical change from the strict constructivism of the origins. Here, we
shall concentrate on two examples, namely the dialogical systems for
normal modal logics and for linear logic. See the supplementary 
document
the <a href="supplement.html">Some Dialogical Systems for Non-Classical Logics</a> for
dialogical systems for free, paraconsistent and connexive logics.</p>

<h3><a name="ModDia">3.1 Modal dialogues </a></h3>

<p>
Modal dialogues are developed in Rahman and Rückert (1997).  See
the entry on <a href="../logic-modal/">Modal Logic</a> for an
overview. </p>

<p>
Let us extend our vocabulary with two modal operators, □ and
♢, which as usual we intend to read as (alethic) necessity
(<em>resp.</em> possibility). In order to define the particle rules
for such operators, we must first adjust the syntax of the dialogical
moves. One can see modalities as making explicit the context in which
an assertion is made. In this perspective, modal dialogues should
exhibit in the syntax the contextual nature of the
moves. A <em>modal</em> (dialogically signed) formula thus has the
form <strong>X</strong>-<em>f</em>-<em>e</em>-ν where<strong>
X</strong> and <em>f</em> are the same as usual, ν is a label
(i.e., a string of integers, which will be explained later) denoting
the <em>dialogical context</em>, and <em>e</em> is an expression of
our enriched language, including, for any label ν, an expression of
the form □/ν. Particle rules for modalities are stated in the
following table:</p>

<table border="1" cellspacing="0">
  <tbody><tr> 
    <th>Assert</th>
    <td align="center"><strong>X</strong>-!-□<em>A</em>-ν</td>
    <td align="center"><strong>X</strong>-!-♢<em>A</em>-ν</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Attack</th>
    <td align="center">
      <strong>Y</strong>-?-□/ν′-ν
      <br />
      where ν′ is a dialogical context chosen by <strong>Y</strong>
    </td>
    <td align="center"><strong>Y</strong>-?-♢<em>-ν</em></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Defend</th>
    <td align="center"><strong>X</strong>-!-<em>A</em>-ν′</td>
    <td align="center">
      <strong>X</strong>-!-<em>A</em>-ν′
      <br />
      where ν′ is a dialogical context chosen by <strong>X</strong>
    </td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>
Particle rules can also be defined with respect to the accessibility
relation between <em>states of the modal game</em>, which are tuples
of the form: <em>S</em>=⟨ρ, σ, Φ, λ⟩,
where ρ and σ are the same as usual, Φ is a modal
formula, and λ is an assignment of dialogical contexts to
formulas.</p>

<p>
Let <em>S</em><sub>1</sub> =
⟨ρ, σ, ρ<sup>−1</sup>(!)-□<em>A</em>
, λ⟩.  <em>S</em><sub>2</sub> is accessible
from <em>S</em><sub>1</sub> iff</p>

<blockquote>
  <em>S</em><sub>2</sub> = ⟨ρ, σ, ρ<sup>−1</sup>(!)-<em>A</em>, λ<sub><em>A</em>/ν</sub>⟩
</blockquote>

<p>
where λ<sub><em>A</em>/ν</sub> denotes the result of
extending λ assigning context ν to the
formula <em>A</em>. <em>S</em><sub>2</sub> is reached after an attack
ρ<sup>−1</sup>(?)-□/ν, where ν is a dialogical context
chosen by ρ<sup>−1</sup>(?).</p>

<p>
Let <em>S</em><sub>1</sub> =
⟨ρ, σ, ρ<sup>−1</sup>(!)-♢<em>A</em>, λ⟩. <em>S</em><sub>2</sub> is accessible
from <em>S</em><sub>1</sub> iff</p>

<blockquote>
  <em>S</em><sub>2</sub> = ⟨ρ, σ, ρ<sup>−1</sup>(!)-<em>A</em>, λ<sub><em>A</em>/ν</sub>⟩
</blockquote>

<p>
where λ<sub><em>A</em>/ν</sub> denotes the result of
extending λ assigning context ν to the
formula <em>A</em>. <em>S</em><sub>2</sub> is reached after an attack
ρ<sup>−1</sup>(?)-♢<em>. ν</em> is a dialogical context
chosen by ρ<sup>−1</sup>(!).</p>

<p>
Since the development of the possible worlds semantics for modal
logic, differences between modal logics are usually understood as
differences in the properties of the accessibility relation in Kripke
models. Now, this relation is dialogically captured by the structural
rules stipulating, in the context of a modal game, what labels can be
used by the players in order to attack and defend modal
assertions. Let us be more precise. The syntax of such labels obeys
the following:</p>

<ol type="i">
  <li>they consist of a finite string of integers:
  ν=<em>x</em><sub>0</sub>.<em>x</em><sub>1</sub>. …
  .<em>x<sub>n </sub></em> separated by dots;</li>
  <li>there is one distinguished context, the <em>original
  context</em>, denoted by the label 1;</li>
  <li>the set of labels is semi-ordered by a relation of succession,
  forming a tree, and made explicit in this way: if ν denotes a
  dialogical context, then ν.<em>i</em> (for <em>i</em>=1
  to <em>n</em>) denote the <em>n</em> successors of ν.</li>
</ol>

<p>
The original context has <em>rank</em> 1. For any context of
rank <em>n</em>, its successors have rank <em>n</em>+1. We say that a
player <em>uses</em> a label when he chooses this label to attack a
□ operator or to defend a ♢ operator. A
player <em>introduces</em> a label ν, and a label is <em>new</em>
iff the player uses the label in some move Δ[<em>n</em>] and
there is no previous move Δ[<em>m</em>] in the same game where
ν is used.</p>

<p>
It is important here to keep in mind that modal dialogues
feature <em>two</em> distinct tree structures. First, a <em>dialogical
game</em> is a tree whose branches are plays of the game, and a
branching occurs when <strong>O</strong> has a choice between
different moves. Second, the <em>dialogical contexts</em> are
structured as a tree, where a branch is a chain of contexts connected
by a successor relation. The contexts of the dialogical
expressions <em>in a single play of a dialogical game</em> may well be
structured as a branching tree with the original context as a
root.</p>

<p>
Some of the structural rules have to be rephrased along the following
lines:</p>

<ul>
  <li>SR-O: All the moves in the root of the dialogue bear the label
  1.</li>

  <li>SR-3a: The pair of moves closing a game must obviously
  be made <em>in the same dialogical context</em> (i.e., must bear the
  same label).</li>

  <li>SR-5: <strong>P</strong> cannot introduce atomic
  formulas <em>in a given context</em>. <strong>P</strong> is allowed
  to use an atom α in a context ν iff <strong>O</strong>
  introduced α in ν in a previous move.</li>

  <li>SR-6: As expected, the definitions of strict repetition must be
  relativized to the contexts: moves that differ only through the
  context are considered different moves.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Let us now give the structural rules that will specifically yield a
dialogical notion of validity that is sound and complete with respect
to the principal normal modal systems.</p>

<blockquote>
  <strong>SR-7: Formal Use of Modal Labels</strong>.
  <br /> <strong>O</strong> may introduce a context any time the other
  rules let him do so. <strong>P</strong> cannot introduce a context,
  and his choices when opening a context are restricted by the
  adequate (SR-8) rule which reconstructs the properties of the
  accessibility relation particular to the modal dialogical logic in
  question.
</blockquote>

<p>
For the label accessibility rule, the idea is straightforward. The
minimal <em>K</em>-accessibility relation is expressed by
letting <strong>P</strong> use the label of a successor of the context
he is playing in, provided of course that <strong>O</strong> already
conceded its existence (introduced it). Reflexivity amounts to
letting <strong>P</strong> choose the label of the context he is
already playing in. Symmetry is captured by assuming that when a
context has access to a successor, then this context is accessible
from the successor. Transitivity frees <strong>P</strong> from the
obligation to choose an <em>immediate</em> successor (or predecessor
in the presence of symmetry). The formulation of the structural rule
for the following systems is just the result of a combination of these
notions. Remember that <strong>P</strong>'s choices of labels are
restricted by SR-7.</p>

<blockquote>
  <strong>SR-8<sub>K</sub>: Label Accessibility for K</strong>. <br />
  <strong>P</strong> may choose any dialogical label that has been

  <strong>P</strong> may choose any dialogical label that has been

</blockquote>

<p>
In the case of a serial accessibility relation, characteristic of the
system <em>D</em>, the formal rule SR-7 is inadequate: if we want to
capture the fact that any context has access to at least another one,
then we clearly need to let <strong>P</strong> make use of this
assumption without needing any previous concession
by <strong>O</strong>. In this case, just one modal rule is
needed.</p>

<blockquote>
  <strong>SR-7<sub>D</sub>: Label Accessibility for D</strong>.  <br />
  <strong>P</strong> may choose any dialogical label that has been
  introduced by <strong>O</strong> of rank +1 relative to the label of
  the context he is playing in. If and only if there is no such
  context available, <strong>P</strong> may introduce a context of
  rank +1 relative to the context he is playing in.
</blockquote>

<p>
Actually, the only if part of the condition in SR-7<sub>D</sub> is
redundant, for it is <strong>P</strong>'s strategical interest to try
to stay in the contexts given by <strong>O</strong> because of the
formal restriction (SR-5). This restriction ensures that every move in
the dialogues with the (SR-7<sub>D</sub>) rule strictly corresponds to
what can be assumed about a serial model.</p>

<h4>3.1.1. Hybrid dialogues</h4>

<p>
Blackburn (2001) presents a natural way of bringing together hybrid
modal logics and dialogues. The hybridization of a modal language
amounts to extending its expressive power in such a way that it
becomes possible to refer in the object language to a particular state
of the model (see e.g., Blackburn 2000). One of the salient virtues
of hybrid languages is their ability to express straightforwardly a
wide range of frame conditions with object-language
formulas. Investigators of dialogical proof systems welcomed the
suggested techniques, which proved particularly useful in the context
of temporal dialogues (Rahman, Gorisse &amp; Damien 2004) or
non-normal modal dialogics (Rahman 2002). Hybridization made it
possible to devise a special kind of abductive dialogue where the
Proponent searches for the minimal frame conditions to yield a winning
strategy for a given formula (Keiff 2004).</p>

<h3><a name="LinLog">3.2 Linear logic</a></h3>

<p>
See the entry on <a href="../logic-linear/">Linear Logic</a> for a
general overview of the field. Linear game semantics were introduced
by Blass (1992), then further developed by various people including
Abramsky, Jagadesan, Hyland, Girard himself (the founder of linear
logic) and Japardize. Lorenz/Lorenzen-style dialogues were introduced
in Rahman (2002).</p>

<p>
Following the inventor of linear logic, one could say that the
fundamental intuition at the root of the field is the following: the
subject matter of logic is interaction, or rather the “well
hidden geometrical structure” of it (see Girard 1999). This
notion is declined in two principal ideas (see e.g., Blass 1998): the
conception of negation as a role switch and of the occurrence of a
formula in a proof as a (bounded) resource. As first shown in Blass
(1992), game semantics is a natural setting for these ideas.</p>

<p>
<strong>Linear negation</strong> is the same as dialogical negation:
it consists of a role switch between the players.</p>

<p>
<strong>Localization of formulas</strong>: the conceptual framework of
linear logic is akin to the Brouwer-Heyting-Kolmogorov approach of a
semantics of proofs. To this conception of proofs as objects, linear
logic adds the computation-driven intuition that each occurrence of
the same formula in a proof must be taken as a distinct resource for
the inference process. The basic idea stems from the consideration
that the occurrence of a formula in a proof is <em>located</em>
somewhere, and that one should take seriously the differences in
location. Hence the linear logical consequence relation is
resource-sensitive. Weakening, expansion and contraction rules are
rejected, for they say respectively that a redundant premise can be
added in a derivation, that a given premise can always be used twice,
and that two distinct tokens of the same premise type can be
considered the same. In a sequent Σ ⊢ <em>A</em>, Σ
denotes a multiset of formulas (i.e., a set together with a function
giving for each member of the set the number of its occurences in the
set, to the effect that {<em>A</em>} and {<em>A</em>, <em>A</em>}
denote the same set, but different multisets).</p>

<p>
In the dialogical framework, each move is an action. It is therefore
very natural to consider that two distinct moves are different
actions, consuming different resources, even when the two moves have
the same propositional content. More precisely, </p>

<p>•  An atomic <strong>O</strong>-formula has been used iff
this formula is the propositional content of
a <strong>P</strong>-move. Atomic <strong>P</strong>-formulas are used
by the very move in which they appear.</p>

<p>•  A complex formula <em>A</em> has been used iff all the
possible aggressive and defensive moves related to <em>A</em> have
been stated.</p>

<p>
This general definition will be made more precise when we state the
particle rules for linear connectives. In order to keep track of the
use of formulas in the course of the dialogue, one may use a
bracketing device: once a formula has been used, its propositional
content is bracketed. This allows us to formulate a notion of linear
validity:</p>

<p>
<strong>Linear validity</strong>: A formula <em>A</em> is <em>linearly
valid</em> iff there is a closed dialogue
for <strong>P</strong>-!-<em>A</em> such that the propositional
content of any move has been used (and therefore is bracketed).</p>

<p>
Linear particles offer a very fine-grained perception of the way
pieces of information are combined in a proof (which is one of the
main points of <a href="../logic-substructural/">Substructural
Logic</a>). Let us take an example: the two multiplicative
particles. We will follow the notation used in Blass
(1992). Multiplicative conjunction, (⊗), known as
<em>tensor</em>, has the following Gentzen-style particle rules:</p>

<table cellpadding="5">
  <tbody><tr>
    <td>
      <table style="border-spacing:0px;">
	<tbody><tr>
	  <td align="center" style="border-bottom:1px solid black;">
	    Γ ⊢ <em>A</em>     Δ ⊢ <em>B</em>
	  </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	  <td align="center">
	    Γ, Δ ⊢ <em>A</em>⊗<em>B</em>
	  </td>
	</tr>
      </tbody></table>
    </td>
    <td>
      <table style="border-spacing:0px;">
	<tbody><tr>
	  <td align="center" style="border-bottom:1px solid black;">
	    Γ, <em>A</em>, <em>B</em>, Δ ⊢ <em>C</em>
	  </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	  <td align="center">
	    Γ, <em>A</em>⊗<em>B</em>, Δ ⊢ <em>C</em>
	  </td>
	</tr>
      </tbody></table>
    </td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>
All the information contained in the premises is conserved in the
conclusion, and nothing else is added (except the relevant
particle). Compare with the following rules for multiplicative
disjunction (⅋), known as <em>par</em>:</p>

<table cellpadding="5">
  <tbody><tr>
    <td>
      <table style="border-spacing:0px;">
	<tbody><tr>
	  <td align="center" style="border-bottom:1px solid black;">
	    Γ ⊢ Δ, <em>A</em>, <em>B</em>, Λ</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	  <td align="center">
	    Γ ⊢ Δ, <em>A</em> ⅋ <em>B</em>, Λ
	  </td>
	</tr>
      </tbody></table>
    </td>
    <td>
      <table style="border-spacing:0px;">
	<tbody><tr>
	  <td align="center" style="border-bottom:1px solid black;">
	    Γ, <em>A</em> ⊢ Δ     <em>B</em>, Λ ⊢ Π
	  </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	  <td align="center">
	    Γ, <em>A</em> ⅋ <em>B</em>, Λ ⊢ Δ, Π
	  </td>
	</tr>
      </tbody></table>
    </td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>
The meanings of the two multiplicative particles are obviously dual to
each other. Both pieces of information <em>A</em> and <em>B</em> are
present in the premises. The main difference lies in the geometry of
the proof: the introduction of <em>tensor</em> on the right of a
sequent needs two premises, while <em>par</em> needs two premises when
introduced on the left. Now from the dialogical point of view, these
rules have to be read analytically, i.e., bottom up, and a
two-premises rule means a splitting in the corresponding
dialogue. Such splittings are captured by a notion of context. Linear
dialogues are contextual in a sense akin to modal dialogues. In other
terms, the flow of information within the proof is constrained by an
explicit structure of contexts, ordered by a relation of
subordination. As in the modal case, the introduction of a new context
will always be a consequence of the Opponent's choices. The Proponent
will stay in the same context as long as he can.</p>

<p>
A sequent Γ ⊢ <em>A</em> is the statement that from
assumptions Γ<em>, </em> one could infer
conclusion <em>A</em>. From the dialogical point of view, assumptions
are the Opponent's concessions, while conclusions are the Proponent's
claims. Thus, the rules above indicate that splitting
for <em>tensor</em> occurs when it is asserted by the Proponent, so
the dialogical particle rule will let the challenger choose the
context where the dialogue will proceed. Dually, <em>par</em> will
generate a splitting when asserted by the Opponent, thus the particle
rule will let the defender choose the context.</p>

<p>
Now, the splitting between contexts can have a slightly different
dialogical meaning. Consider the three rules for additive conjunction
(∧):</p>

<table cellpadding="5">
  <tbody><tr>
    <td>
      <table style="border-spacing:0px;">
	<tbody><tr>
	  <td align="center" style="border-bottom:1px solid black;">
	    Γ ⊢ <em>A</em>     Γ ⊢ <em>B</em>
	  </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	  <td align="center">
	    Γ ⊢ <em>A</em> ∧ <em>B</em>
	  </td>
	</tr>
      </tbody></table>
    </td>
    <td>
      <table style="border-spacing:0px;">
	<tbody><tr>
	  <td style="border-bottom:1px solid black;text-align:center;">
	    Γ, <em>A</em>, Δ ⊢ <em>C</em>
	  </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	  <td align="center">
	    Γ, <em>A</em> ∧ <em>B</em>, Δ ⊢ <em>C</em>
	  </td>
	</tr>
      </tbody></table>
    </td>
    <td>
      <table style="border-spacing:0px;">
	<tbody><tr>
	  <td style="border-bottom:1px solid black;text-align:center;">
	    Γ, <em>B</em>, Δ ⊢ <em>C</em>
	  </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	  <td align="center">
	    Γ, <em>A</em> ∧ <em>B</em>, Δ ⊢ <em>C</em>
	  </td>
	</tr>
      </tbody></table>
    </td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>
As in the case of multiplicative conjunction, the challenger will
choose the context, but here the assumptions contained in the context
are the same. To understand the difference, notice that there are two
rules of left-introduction. Dialogically, this means that when the
Opponent has asserted <em>A</em>∧<em>B</em>, there are two
distinct games available to the Proponent (one where the Opponent will
defend <em>A</em> and one where he will defend <em>B</em>). In the
same way, the two premises of the rule of right-introduction
correspond to two distinct games. They are jointly mentioned in the
same rule since the choice between them lies with the challenger,
which happens to be the Opponent, so the validity of the conclusion,
i.e., a winning strategy for the Proponent, must include a winning
strategy in both games.</p>

<p>
The occasions where a choice of context is needed will be determined
by the particle rules, but a structural rule is needed first in order
to regulate the opening of contexts in a dialogue.</p>

<blockquote>
  <strong>SR-11: Linear Contexts Rule</strong>.  <br />
  Only <strong>O </strong> may open new dialogical
  contexts. <strong>P </strong> may choose for his moves between
  dialogical contexts that have already been opened.
</blockquote>

<p>
Now, the previous notions immediately call for a rephrasing of the
formal rule SR-5:</p>

<blockquote>
  <strong>SR-12: Formal Use of Linear Atoms</strong>.
  <br /> <strong>O </strong> may assert atomic formulas whenever he
  needs to (but according to the particle rules and the other
  structural rules). <strong>P </strong> may assert an atomic
  formula <em>a</em> in a dialogical context ν
  iff <strong>O </strong> has asserted <em>a</em> in the dialogical
  context μ before, ν is a subcontext of μ, and <em>a</em>
  has not been used up yet (i.e., does not occur between square
  brackets).
</blockquote>

<p>
For the sake of brevity, we will concentrate on the multiplicative
fragment of linear logic, i.e., which connectives are <em>tensor</em>
(⊗), <em>par</em> (⅋), <em>linear implication</em>
(⊸), and <em>negation</em> (¬).</p>

<p>
Particle rules for the multiplicative connectives are defined with
respect to <em>states of the linear game</em>, which are tuples of the
form: <em>S</em>=⟨ρ, σ, Φ, λ⟩, where ρ
and σ are as usual, Φ is a linear formula, and λ is
an assignment of dialogical contexts to formulas.</p>

<p>
Concerning tensor, the challenger will choose the conjunct to be
defended and the context where it should be defended.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>
  <strong>Particle rule for tensor</strong>: <br />
  Let <em>S</em><sub>1</sub> =
  ⟨ρ, σ, ρ<sup>−1</sup>(!)-<em>A</em>⊗<em>B</em>, λ<sub>φ/ν</sub>⟩,
  where λ<sub>φ/ν</sub> assigns context ν to the
  formula
  ρ<sup>−1</sup>(!)-<em>A</em>⊗<em>B</em>. Both <em>S</em><sub>2</sub>
  and <em>S</em><sub>3</sub> are accessible
  from <em>S</em><sub>1</sub>:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <em>S</em><sub>2</sub> = ⟨ρ, σ, ρ<sup>−1</sup>(!)-<em>A</em>, λ<sub><em>A</em>/μ</sub>⟩
  </blockquote>

  <p>
  where λ<sub><em>A</em>/μ</sub> denotes the result of
  extending λ by assigning context μ to the
  formula <em>A</em>. <em>S</em><sub>2</sub> is reached after an
  attack ρ<sup>−1</sup>(?)-<em>R</em>/μ, where μ is a
  dialogical subcontext of ν chosen by
  ρ<sup>−1</sup>(?).</p>

  <blockquote>
    <em>S</em><sub>3</sub> = ⟨ρ, σ, ρ<sup>−1</sup>(!)-<em>B</em>, λ<sub><em>B</em>/π</sub>⟩
  </blockquote>

  <p>
  where λ<sub><em>B</em>/π</sub> denotes the result of
  extending λ by assigning context π to the
  formula <em>B</em>. <em>S</em><sub>2</sub> is reached after an
  attack ρ<sup>−1</sup>(?)-<em>L</em>/π, where π is a
  dialogical subcontext of ν chosen by
  ρ<sup>−1</sup>(?).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The bracketing device will be as follows: the
expression <em>A</em>⊗<em>B</em> is considered used and is
bracketed iff both states <em>S</em><sub>2</sub>
and <em>S</em><sub>3</sub> have been reached.</p>

<p>
With par, the defender will choose the disjunct to be defended and the
context where it should be defended. He will nevertheless have to
defend both disjuncts. Here lies one of the main points that make
dialogical semantics essential to linear logic. The multiplicative
disjunction has “conjunctive features”, as Girard (1999)
puts it: a proof of <em>A⅋</em><em>B</em> involves a proof
of <em>A and</em> a proof of <em>B</em>. Now the main difference
between conjunction and disjunction in a dialogue is the player
(ρ<sup>−1</sup>(!)  or ρ<sup>−1</sup>(?)) who
chooses how the game will proceed. What makes par a disjunction is
thus the fact that it is the <em>defender</em> who has the choice of
the order in which the proofs are given and the context where they
will be given.  These considerations lead to the following particle
rule for par:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>
  <strong>Particle rule for par</strong>.  <br />
  Let <em>S</em><sub>1</sub> =
  ⟨ρ, σ, ρ<sup>−1</sup>(!)-<em>A⅋</em><em>B</em>, λ<sub>φ/ν</sub>⟩,
  where λ<sub>φ/ν</sub> assigns context ν to the
  formula
  ρ<sup>−1</sup>(!)-<em>A⅋</em><em>B</em>. Both <em>S</em><sub>2</sub>
  and <em>S</em><sub>3</sub> are accessible
  from <em>S</em><sub>1</sub>, according to the choice of
  ρ<sup>−1</sup>(!):</p>

  <blockquote>
    <em>S</em><sub>2</sub> = ⟨ρ, σ, ρ<sup>−1</sup>(!)-<em>A</em>, λ<sub><em>A</em>/μ</sub>⟩
  </blockquote>

  <p>
  where λ<sub><em>A</em>/μ</sub> denotes the result of
  extending λ by assigning context μ to the
  formula <em>A</em>. <em>S</em><sub>2</sub> is reached after an
  attack ρ<sup>−1</sup>(?)-⅋. μ is a dialogical
  subcontext of ν chosen by ρ<sup>−1</sup>(!).</p>

  <blockquote>
    <em>S</em><sub>3</sub> = ⟨ρ, σ, ρ<sup>−1</sup>(!)-<em>B</em>, λ<sub><em>B</em>/π</sub>⟩
  </blockquote>

  <p>
  where λ<sub><em>B</em>/π</sub> denotes the result of
  extending λ by assigning context π to the
  formula <em>B</em>. <em>S</em><sub>2</sub> is reached after an
  attack ρ<sup>−1</sup>(?)-<em>L</em>/π, where π is a
  dialogical subcontext of ν chosen by
  ρ<sup>−1</sup>(!).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The expression <em>A⅋</em><em>B</em> is considered used and is
bracketed iff both states <em>S</em><sub>2</sub>
and <em>S</em><sub>3</sub> have been reached.</p>

<p>
As already noted, linear negation is essentially the usual dialogical
negation, i.e., a role switch, that we noted using a priming on
ρ. There is no contextual change.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>
  <strong>Particle rule for linear negation</strong>. <br />
  Let <em>S</em><sub>1</sub> =
  ⟨ρ, σ, ρ<sup>−1</sup>(!)-¬<em>A</em>, λ<sub>φ/ν</sub>⟩,
  where λ<sub>φ/ν</sub> assigns context ν to the
  formula
  ρ<sup>−1</sup>(!)-¬<em>A</em>. <em>S</em><sub>2</sub>
  is accessible from <em>S</em><sub>1</sub> iff:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <em>S</em><sub>2</sub> = ⟨ρ′, σ, ρ′<sup>−1</sup>(!)-<em>A</em>, λ<sub><em>A</em>/ν</sub>⟩
  </blockquote>
  
  <p>
  The expression ¬<em>A</em> is considered used and is bracketed
  iff state <em>S</em><sub>2</sub> has been reached.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Linear implication is defined as ¬<em>A⅋B</em>, which makes
it a multiplicative connective. If one insists on giving it a particle
rule, then it will be as follows.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>
  <strong>Particle rule for linear implication</strong>. <br />
  Let <em>S</em><sub>1</sub> =
  ⟨ρ, σ, ρ<sup>−1</sup>(!)-<em>A⊸</em><em>B</em>, λ<sub>φ/ν</sub>⟩,
  where λ<sub>φ/ν</sub> assigns context ν to the
  formula
  ρ<sup>−1</sup>(!)-<em>A⊸</em><em>B</em>.  <em>S</em><sub>2</sub>
  is accessible from <em>S</em><sub>1</sub> iff:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <em>S</em><sub>2</sub> = ⟨ρ′, σ, ρ′<sup>−1</sup>(!)-<em>A</em>, λ<sub><em>A</em>/μ</sub>⟩
  </blockquote>

  <p>
  where λ<sub><em>A</em>/μ</sub> denotes the result of
  extending λ by assigning context μ to the
  formula <em>A</em> and μ is a dialogical subcontext of ν
  chosen by ρ<sup>−1</sup>(!). The game may then proceed,
  according to the choice of ρ<sup>−1</sup>(!), according to
  the relevant particle rule for the formula <em>A</em>, or to the
  following state of the game:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <em>S</em><sub>3</sub> = ⟨ρ, σ, ρ<sup>−1</sup>(!)-<em>B</em>, λ<sub><em>B</em>/π</sub>⟩
  </blockquote>

  <p>
  where λ<sub><em>B</em>/π</sub> denotes the result of
  extending λ by assigning context π to the
  formula <em>B</em>, where π is a dialogical subcontext of ν
  chosen by ρ<sup>−1</sup>(!).</p>

  <p>
  The expression <em>A⊸</em><em>B</em> is considered used and
  is bracketed iff both states <em>S</em><sub>2</sub>
  and <em>S</em><sub>3</sub> have been reached.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2><a name="ProTheAspDia">4. Proof-Theoretical Aspects of Dialogues </a></h2>

<p>
One of the strengths of dialogues is the intuitivity of the strategy
building when writing a proof. The freedom that players enjoy when
choosing the next move may obscure the connection between the
structural rules of dialogues and the structural rules of
Gentzen-style sequent calculi
(see <a href="../logic-substructural/">Substructural logics</a>). There
is nevertheless a clear correspondence, that we will make explicit now
for the main structural rules.</p>

<p>
<strong>Exchange:</strong> (commutativity of premise combination) a
player can attack any move of the other, and <strong>P</strong> can
use <strong>O</strong>'s concessions, regardless of the order of these
moves. Dropping exchange forces players to follow the order of the
moves as well as the order of subformulas in conjunctions (i.e., the
challenger should attack a conjunction first with
?<sub><em>L</em></sub> and then with
?<sub><em>R</em></sub>). Furthermore, a concession
by <strong>O</strong> is available for <strong>P</strong>
iff <strong>P</strong> already used all the previous concessions. To
see why such a restriction is needed, consider a dialogue for the
formula
(α→(β→γ))→(β→(α→γ),
which is valid if, and only if, the logic features exchange.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Clearly, <strong>P</strong> has a winning strategy because he is
allowed to use <strong>O</strong>'s concessions in any order he
pleases. Were he to follow the order of the concessions, no move would
be available to him at 6, and the formula would not be valid.</p>

<p>
<strong>Contraction:</strong> the contraction rule says that when two
occurrences of a formula are present in a sequent, one of them can be
eliminated. In the dialogues, proceeding from the conclusion down to
its subformulas, contraction must be seen as corresponding to the
possibility for the Proponent to use twice a formula conceded by the
Opponent. Dropping it calls for a marking system in order to keep
track of the concessions that have been used, as described in the
linear dialogues.</p>

<strong>Weakening:</strong> this structural rule allows the
introduction of redundant premises, and has been one of the targets
of <a href="../logic-relevance/">Relevance Logic</a>. In the
dialogues, weakening corresponds to the fact that not all the
concessions of the Opponent have to be actually used by the Proponent
in the proof (i.e., either attacked or, in the case of an atom, used to
defend against an attack). As explained in <a href="#LinLog">Section 3.2</a>, 
dialogical systems without weakening should feature a
syntactic way of marking the use of a premise.</p>

<p>
In this example, the concession of α in move 3 is used in move 4
(as shown by the brackets), but move 2 only uses half of the
concession in move 1. The concession of β is
redundant, <strong>P</strong> has a winning strategy only if the rules
allow for weakening (i.e., there is no rule requiring all concessions
to be used in order to win).</p>

<p>
<strong>Expansion:</strong> in a sequent calculus where weakening is
absent, expansion allows the addition of another occurrence of a
formula whenever there is already one in a sequent. From a dialogical
point of view, expansion amounts to considering that the use of one
occurrence of a premise uses all the other occurrences.</p>

<h2><a name="ProModBacDiaGTS">5. From Proof to Models and Back (Dialogues and GTS)</a></h2>

<p>
Game-theoretical semantics (GTS) is a well-known approach to semantics
for natural and formal languages, originating in the work of Jaakko
Hintikka (see Hintikka &amp; Sandu (1997) for a general
presentation). The fact that GTS and dialogical logic are sisters has
been widely acknowledged. The differences between the original
approaches have been discussed too: while GTS relates to the study of
truth in a model, dialogical logic explores the possibilities of a
certain type of proof-theoretical approach to validity. Despite a
close relationship between the two approaches, no thorough analysis of
their interaction had been undertaken until Rahman &amp; Tulenheimo
2006, with the exception of an excellent paper by Esa Saarinen
(1978).</p>

<p>
In Rahman &amp; Tulenheimo 2006, this task is carried out
systematically. More precisely, Rahman and Tulenheimo have worked out
for classical propositional logic and classical first-order logic an
exact connection between ‘intuitionistic dialogues with
hypotheses’ and semantic games. Actually, it is not that
surprising since the former can be thought of as implementing an
intuitionistic proof theory supplemented with an axiom schema of the
excluded middle.</p>

<p>
The main result at the interface between dialogical logic and GTS is
that the existence of a winning strategy for <strong>P</strong> in a
dialogue <strong>D</strong>(<em>A</em>, <em>H</em><sub>1</sub>,
…, <em>H</em><sub><em>n</em></sub>) corresponding to a
sentence <em>A</em> with a finite number of
hypotheses <em>H</em><sub><em>i</em></sub> expressing those instances
of the third excluded which are relevant to that sentence, gives rise
to a family of Eloise’s winning strategies in semantic
games <em>G</em>(<em>A</em>, <em>M</em>), one strategy for each
model <em>M</em>; and, conversely, it is shown how to construct a
winning strategy for Proponent in the
dialogue <strong>D</strong>(<em>A</em>, <em>H</em><sub>1</sub>,
…, <em>H</em><sub><em>n</em></sub>) out of Eloise’s winning
strategies in games <em>G</em>(<em>A</em>, <em>M</em>). A definition of
the notion of ‘relevant instances of the excluded middle’ is given
below, for propositional and first-order logic. In the latter case, a
variant of the usual version is preferred. The proofs are constructive
in the sense that it is explicitly shown how a strategy for one type
of game is built using a strategy for the other type of game. One
corollary of the paper is that each disjunct of the hypotheses of the
dialogue at stake yields the dialogical version of truth in a
model. Actually the central idea of the paper is based on the notion
of material dialogues, which furnishes the dialogical version of the
satisfiability of a formula relative to a model.</p>

<p>
In fact, there are two rather straightforward approaches one can
assume; they give rise to what are known as ‘alethic’ and
‘material’ dialogues (see e.g., Rahman &amp; Keiff
2004). As dialogues are designed for dealing with validity, some
additional ingredient must be introduced into dialogues in order to
make them capable of dealing with material truth. Alethic dialogues
are simply obtained by relativizing a dialogue to a model. Hence a
part of the specification of an alethic dialogue in the case of
propositional logic will be a valuation function, and in the case of
first-order logic a τ-structure for an appropriate vocabulary
τ.</p>

<p>
By contrast, the idea behind material dialogues is to avoid having an
extra component to dialogues (such as a specification of a model);
they are meant to do with the resources of dialogues proper (which are
designed for dealing with validity), and the idea is to
‘approximate’ characterization of truth by adding a
sufficient amount of additional hypotheses − taken to be initial
concessions of Opponent − which would serve to specify a model
by using the resources of the object language only.</p>

<p>
What is a sufficient amount, then? In the case of propositional logic,
when discussing the truth of a formula <em>A</em>, any relevant model
can be specified in terms of propositional formulas, namely literals
(positive or negative atomic formulas). Moreover, it suffices to
specify a finite number of such literals. The relevant models are
identified by going through all propositional
atoms <em>p</em><em><sub>i</sub></em> appearing in <em>A</em> (there
are only finitely many of these atoms) and choosing, for
all <em>i</em>, either <em>p<sub>i</sub></em> or its negation
¬<em>p<sub>i</sub></em>. Those are the instances of the excluded
middle relevant to the material truth of the formula at stake in the
propositional case. In this way any relevant model—any
truth-value distribution—can be specified.</p>

<p>
For first-order logic, this approach has the obvious downside that in
general there is no way of capturing a τ-structure in terms of a
finite number of first-order sentences. Take for example a
{<em>P</em>}-structure <em>M</em> with an infinite domain <em>M</em> =
{<em>d<sub>i</sub></em> : <em>i</em> &lt; ω}, where <em>P</em>
is unary. To exhaustively describe <em>M</em> in terms of first-order
sentences, we need an infinite list ⟨<em>l<sub>i</sub></em>
: <em>i</em> &lt; ω⟩ of literals,
where <em>l<sub>i</sub></em> := <em>Pc<sub>i</sub></em>,
if <em>d<sub>i</sub></em> ∈ <em>P</em><sup><em>M</em></sup>,
and <em>l<sub>i</sub></em> := ¬<em>Pc<sub>i</sub></em>,
if <em>d<sub>i</sub></em> ∉ &gt;<em>P</em><sup><em>M</em></sup>. (By
stipulation, the constant <em>c<sub>i</sub></em> stands for the
element <em>d<sub>i</sub></em>.)</p>

<p>
Mathematically there is of course nothing problematic about such
infinite lists of hypotheses. But one desideratum in designing
dialogues typically is that it should be possible to think of them as
humanly manageable, ideally temporal processes. Such a process cannot
really begin by going through an infinity of hypotheses. This is why
material dialogues with an infinity of hypotheses should be considered
unsatisfactory. So what can we do? A solution to this dilemma, found
by Tero Tulenheimo, has been developed in Rahman &amp; Tulenheimo
(2005): given a vocabulary of one unary relation symbol <em>P</em>, a
relevant piece of finite information that the models of classical
first-order logic must satisfy, is expressed by this sentence:</p>

<blockquote>
  ∀<em>x</em>(<em>Px∨</em>¬<em>Px</em>).
</blockquote>

<p>
That is, whatever the value <em>c</em> of <em>x</em>, the
instance <em>Pc</em> ∨ ¬<em>Pc</em> of <em>tertium non
datur</em> must hold. What type of question concerning the sentence
∀<em>x</em>(<em>Px</em> ∨ ¬<em>Px</em>) should we ask in
order for the answer to identify a (possibly infinite) model? Clearly,
we should ask Opponent to choose a Skolem function for this
sentence. No finite amount of questions of the type
?-∀ <sub><em>x</em>/<em>c</em></sub> will reveal this
information, if there are infinitely many values for <em>x</em>
available. On the other hand, a Skolem function</p>

<blockquote>
  <em>f</em> : {<em>c</em><sub>0</sub>, <em>c</em><sub>1</sub>, …} → {<tt>left</tt>, <tt>right</tt>}
</blockquote>

<p>
expressly says, for each possible value <em>c<sub>i</sub></em>
of <em>x</em>, which of the disjuncts Opponent considers as being
satisfied by <em>c<sub>i</sub></em>. This is exactly what it means to
specify a model of vocabulary {<em>P</em>} with the domain
{<em>c</em><sub>0</sub>, <em>c</em><sub>1</sub>, …}.</p>

<p>
Now for a finite vocabulary τ, the finite information we use for
specifying a model will be extracted from the sentences</p>

<blockquote>
  ∀<em>x</em><sub>1</sub>…∀<em>x<sub>n</sub></em>(<em>R</em><em>x</em><sub>1</sub>, …, <em>x<sub>n</sub></em> ∨ ¬<em>R</em><em>x</em><sub>1</sub>, …, <em>x<sub>n</sub></em>),
</blockquote>

<p>
one for each <em>R</em> ∈ τ of arity <em>n</em>. We introduce a
new mode of question, which enables one to ask about a Skolem function
for an operator. <b>x</b>here denotes a finite sequence of
variables <em>x</em><sub>1</sub>,
…, <em>x</em><sub><em>n</em></sub>, and
∀<b>x</b>stands for ∀<em>x</em><sub>1</sub>…∀<em>x</em><sub><em>n</em></sub>. When asked about a
sentence of the form
∀<b>x</b>(<em>R</em><b>x</b> ∨ ¬<em>R</em><b>x</b>), the
question</p>

<blockquote>
??-∨
</blockquote>

<p>
must be answered by providing a second-order object, namely a Skolem
function</p>

<blockquote>
  <em>f</em> : {<em>c</em><sub><em>i</em></sub> : <em>i</em> &lt; ω} → {<tt>left</tt>, <tt>right</tt>}
</blockquote>

<p>
for the unique token of the disjunction ∨ appearing in
∀<b>x</b>(<em>R</em><b>x</b> ∨
¬<em>R</em><b>x</b>). (The double ‘?’ indicates that
the answer should be a second-order object.) If <strong>O</strong>
asserts that <em>f</em> is such a function, <strong>P</strong> is able
to read the interpretation of the relation symbol <em>R</em> from the
function <em>f</em>. <strong>P </strong>can draw all kinds of
inferences from it, for instance check whether the relation symbol is
satisfied by at least one tuple, by checking whether <tt>left</tt>
∈ <em>Im</em>(<em>f</em>) or not.</p>

<p>
The way in which we extract a model from the sentences
∀<b>x</b>(<em>R</em><b>x</b> ∨ ¬<em>R</em><b>x</b>) is by
taking them as initial concessions of <strong>O</strong>, and asking
the question of ??-∨ with respect to each sentence. The questions
??-∨ give rise to the following new structural rule:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>
  <strong>SR-15: Skolem Function Rule</strong>.  <br />
  If <strong>O</strong> has conceded that <em>f</em> is a Skolem
  function for ∨ in</p>

  <blockquote>
    ∀<b>x</b>(<em>R</em><b>x</b> ∨ ¬<em>R</em><b>x</b>),
  </blockquote>

  <p>
  then <strong>O</strong> must also, if asked, concede all instances
  of this second-order concession. That is, for any tuple <b>c</b>
  interpreting the variables <b>x</b>, he must
  concede <em>R</em><b>c</b>, if <em>f</em>(<b>c</b>) = <tt>left</tt>,
  and ¬<em>R</em><b>c</b>, if <em>f</em>(<b>c</b>)
  = <tt>right</tt>. Accordingly, after <strong>O</strong> has replied
  using some <em>f</em> to a question ??-∨, <strong>P</strong> is
  always entitled to pose the question</p>

  <blockquote>
    ?-<em>f</em>/<b>c</b>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
  for any tuple <b>c</b>, asking <strong>O</strong> to confirm that
  indeed he concedes that the tuple <b>c</b> satisfies the
  disjunct <em>f</em>(<b>c</b>). <strong>O</strong> has no real choice
  for his answer: the reply is fully predetermined by his choice
  of <em>f</em> and the requirement that <strong>O</strong> must be
  coherent in his replies.</p>
</blockquote>

dialogues can be found in Rahman &amp; Dégremont (2006).</p>
