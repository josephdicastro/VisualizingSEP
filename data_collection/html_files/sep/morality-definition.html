<h1>The Definition of Morality</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Wed Apr 17, 2002; substantive revision Mon Feb 8, 2016</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
The topic of this entry is not—at least directly—moral
<em>theory</em>; rather, it is the definition of morality. Moral
theories are large and complex things; definitions are not. The
question of the definition of morality is the question of identifying
the <em>target</em> of moral theorizing. Identifying this target
enables us to see different moral theories as attempting to capture
the very same thing. In this way, the distinction between a definition
of morality and a moral theory parallels the distinction John Rawls
(1971: 9) drew between the general <em>concept</em> of justice and
various detailed <em>conceptions</em> of it. Rawls’ terminology,
however, suggests a psychological distinction, and also suggests that
many people have conceptions of justice. But the definition/theory
distinction is not psychological, and only moral theorists typically
have moral theories.</p>

<p>
There does not seem to be much reason to think that a single
definition of morality will be applicable to all moral discussions.
One reason for this is that “morality” seems to be used in
two distinct broad senses: a descriptive sense and a normative sense.
More particularly, the term “morality” can be used
either</p>

<ol>

<li>descriptively to refer to certain codes of conduct put forward by
a society or a group (such as a religion), or accepted by an
individual for her own behavior, or</li>

<li> normatively to refer to a code of conduct that, given specified
conditions, would be put forward by all rational persons.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Which of these two senses of “morality” a theorist is
using plays a crucial, although sometimes unacknowledged, role in the
development of an ethical theory. If one uses “morality”
in its descriptive sense, and therefore uses it to refer to codes of
conduct actually put forward by distinct groups or societies, one will
almost certainly deny that there is a universal morality that applies
to all human beings. The descriptive use of “morality” is
the one used by anthropologists when they report on the morality of
the societies that they study. Recently, some comparative and
evolutionary psychologists (Haidt 2006; Hauser 2006; De Waal 1996)
have taken morality, or a close anticipation of it, to be present
among groups of non-human animals: primarily, but not exclusively,
other primates.</p>

<p>
Any definition of “morality” in the descriptive sense will
need to specify <em>which</em> of the codes put forward by a society
or group count as moral. Even in small homogeneous societies that have
no written language, distinctions are sometimes made between morality,
etiquette, law, and religion. And in larger and more complex societies
these distinctions are often sharply marked. So “morality”
cannot be taken to refer to every code of conduct put forward by a
society.</p>

<p>
In the normative sense, “morality” refers to a code of
conduct that would be accepted by anyone who meets certain
intellectual and volitional conditions, almost always including the
condition of being rational. That a person meets these conditions is
typically expressed by saying that the person counts as a <em>moral
agent</em>. However, merely showing that a certain code would be
accepted by any moral agent is not enough to show that the code is the
moral code. It might well be that all moral agents would also accept a
code of prudence or rationality, but this would not by itself show
that prudence was part of morality.</p>

<p>
As we’ve just seen, not all <em>codes that are put forward by
societies or groups</em> are moral codes in the descriptive sense of
morality, and not all <em>codes that would be accepted by all moral
agents</em> are moral codes in the normative sense of morality. So any
definition of morality—in either sense—will require
further criteria. Still, each of these two very brief descriptions of
codes might be regarded as offering some features of morality that
would be included in any adequate definition. In that way they might
be taken to be offering some <em>definitional</em> features of
morality, in each of its two senses. When one has specified enough
definitional features to allow one to classify all the relevant moral
theories as theories of a common subject, one might then be taken to
have given a definition of morality. This is the sense of
“definition” at work in this entry.</p>

<p>
Explicit attempts to define morality are hard to find, at least since
the beginning of the 20<sup>th</sup> century. One possible explanation
for this is the combined effect of early positivistic worries about
the metaphysical status of normative properties, followed (or
augmented) by Wittgensteinian worries about definitions of any
significant terms whatsoever. Whatever the explanation, when
definitions have been offered, they have tended to be directed at the
notion of moral judgment (Hare 1952, 1981) rather than at morality
itself. To the degree that these definitions are adequate, they might,
without much effort, be converted into definitions of morality in the
descriptive sense. For example, a particular person’s morality
might be regarded as the content of the basic moral judgments that
person is prepared to accept. However, as G. Wallace and A.D.M. Walker
(1970) note, virtually all “definitions” of moral
judgments are only the specification of one definitional feature or
another.</p>

<p>
What counts as definitional of morality, in either sense of
“morality”, is controversial. Moreover, the line between
what is part of a definition, in the sense at issue, and what is part
of a moral theory, is not entirely sharp. For example, some might
regard it as definitional of morality, in the normative sense, that it
governs only interpersonal interactions. Others, however, might take
this to be a substantive theoretical claim. Some might take it as
definitional of “morality” in its descriptive sense that
it be a code of conduct that a person or group takes to be most
important. But others might say that attention to religion casts doubt
on this idea.</p>

<p>
“Morality”, when used in a descriptive sense, has an
important feature that “morality” in the normative sense
does not have: a feature that stems from its relational nature. This
feature is the following: that if one is not a member of the relevant
society or group, or is not the relevant individual, then accepting a
certain account of the content of morality, in the descriptive sense,
has no implications for how one should behave. On the other hand, if
one accepts a moral theory’s account of moral agents, and the
specifications of the conditions under which all moral agents would
endorse a code of conduct as a moral code, then one accepts that moral
theory’s normative definition of “morality”.
Accepting an account of “morality” in the normative sense
commits one to regarding some behavior as immoral, perhaps even
behavior that one is tempted to perform. Because accepting an account
of “morality” in the normative sense involves this
commitment, it is not surprising that philosophers seriously disagree
about which account to accept.</p>

<h2 id="DescDefiMora">1. Descriptive definitions of “morality”</h2>

<p>
An initial naïve attempt at a descriptive definition of
“morality” might take it to refer to the most important
code of conduct put forward by a society and accepted by the members
of that society. But the existence of large and heterogeneous
societies raises conceptual problems for such a descriptive
definition, since there may not be any such society-wide code that is
regarded as most important. As a result, a definition might be offered
in which “morality” refers to the most important code of
conduct put forward and accepted by any group, or even by an
individual. Apart from containing some prohibitions on harming
(certain) others, different moralities—when
“morality” is understood in this way—can vary in
content quite substantially.</p>

<p>
In the middle of the 20<sup>th</sup> century the dominant sense of
“morality” seems to have been the descriptive sense. This
is strikingly illustrated by the fact that both C.H. Whiteley and Neil
Cooper took themselves to be revealing <em>the</em> important
ambiguity in the meaning of “morality” when they
distinguished the sociological sense from the psychological (Whiteley
1959) and the social sense from the individual (Cooper 1966). But
according to the taxonomy at the heart of this entry, all of these are
versions of the descriptive sense, distinguished primarily by the size
of the relevant group.</p>

<p>
Etiquette is sometimes included as a part of morality, applying to
norms that are considered less serious than the kinds of norms for
behavior that are more central to morality. Hobbes expresses this sort
of view when he uses the term “small morals” to describe
“decency of behavior, as how one man should salute another, or
how a man should wash his mouth or pick his teeth before
company”, and distinguishes these from “those qualities of
mankind that concern their living together in peace and unity”
(1660/1994, Chapter XI, paragraph 1). When etiquette is included as
part of morality, morality is almost always being understood in the
descriptive sense. One reason for this is that it is clear that the
rules of etiquette are relative to a society or group. Moreover, there
are no plausible conditions under which we could pick out the
“correct” rules of etiquette as those that would be
accepted by all rational beings.</p>

<p>
Law is distinguished from morality by having explicit written rules,
penalties, and officials who interpret the laws and apply the
penalties. Although there is often considerable overlap in the conduct
governed by morality and that governed by law, laws are often
evaluated—and changed—on moral grounds. Some theorists,
including Ronald Dworkin (1986), have even maintained that the
interpretation of law must make use of morality.</p>

<p>
Although the morality of a group or society may derive from its
religion, morality and religion are not the same thing, even in that
case. Morality is only a guide to conduct, whereas religion is always
more than this. For example, religion includes stories about events in
the past, usually about supernatural beings, that are used to explain
or justify the behavior that it prohibits or requires. Although there
is often a considerable overlap in the conduct prohibited or required
by religion and that prohibited or required by morality, religions may
prohibit or require more than is prohibited or required by guides to
behavior that are explicitly labeled as moral guides, and may allow
some behavior that is prohibited by morality. Even when morality is
not regarded as the code of conduct that is put forward by a formal
religion, it is often thought to require some religious explanation
and justification. However, just as with law, some religious practices
and precepts are criticized on moral grounds, e.g., that the practice
or precept involves discrimination on the basis of race, gender, or
sexual orientation.</p>

<p>
When “morality” is used simply to refer to a code of
conduct put forward by an actual group, including a society, even if
it is distinguished from etiquette, law, and religion, it is being
used in a descriptive sense. It is also being used in the descriptive
sense when it refers to important attitudes of individuals. Just as
one can refer to the morality of the Greeks, so one can refer to the
morality of a particular person. This descriptive use of
“morality” is now becoming more prominent because of the
work of psychologists such as Jonathan Haidt (2006), who have been
influenced by the views of David Hume (1751), including his attempt to
present a naturalistic account of moral judgments. In the
20<sup>th</sup> century R.M. Hare, in his earlier books (1952,
1963), regarded
moral judgments as those judgments that override all nonmoral
judgments and that would be universalized by the person making the judgment. This account of moral judgments
naturally leads to a view of morality as being concerned with behavior
that a person regards as most important and as a guide to conduct that
he wants everyone to adopt.</p>

<p>
Guides to behavior that are regarded as moralities normally involve
avoiding and preventing harm to others (Frankena 1980), and perhaps
some norm of honesty (Strawson 1961). But all of them involve other
matters as well. Hare’s view of morality as that which is most
important allows that these other matters may be more important than
avoiding and preventing harm to others. This view of morality as
concerning that which is most important to a person or group allows
matters related to religious practices and precepts, or matters
related to customs and traditions, e.g., purity and sanctity, to be
more important than avoiding and preventing harm.</p>

<p>
When “morality” is used in a descriptive sense, moralities
can differ from each other quite extensively in their content and in
the foundation that members of the society claim their morality to
have. A society might have a moral code according to which practices
as necessary for purity or sanctity are more important than practices
related to whether other persons are harmed. A society may take as
morally most important that certain rituals are performed or that
certain sexual practices are prohibited, than that harms are avoided
or prevented. Some societies may claim that their morality, which is
more concerned with purity and sanctity, is based on the commands of
God. The descriptive sense of “morality”, which allows for
the view that morality is based on religion in this way, picks out
codes of conduct that are often in significant conflict with all
normative accounts of morality. When this happens, those who use
“morality” in the normative sense discussed in the
following section generally hold all moral agents should follow the
moral code, independent of their religious beliefs. Moreover, most
normative accounts entail that all moral agents would endorse
morality, at least under certain circumstances. And most accounts of
moral agency at work in such accounts do not include any negative
attitudes toward harmless consensual sexual behavior. Many religions
condemn certain harmless consensual sexual behavior as immoral, but
other religions, which hold that morality is primarily concerned with
avoiding and preventing harm, condemn these attitudes themselves as
harmful and immoral.</p>

<p>
A society might have a morality that takes accepting its traditions
and customs, including accepting the authority of certain people and
emphasizing loyalty to the group, as more important than avoiding and
preventing harm. Such a morality might not count as immoral any
behavior that shows loyalty to the preferred group, even if that
behavior causes significant harm to innocent people who are not in
that group. Acting altruistically, at least with regard to those in
the group, might be nearly equated with acting morally, regardless of
its effects on those outside of the group. The familiarity of this
kind of morality, which makes in-group loyalty almost equivalent to
morality, seems to allow some comparative and evolutionary
psychologists, including Frans De Waal (1996), to regard non-human
animals to be acting in ways very similar to those that are regarded
as moral.</p>

<p>
It is possible for a society to have a morality that is concerned
primarily with minimizing the harms that human beings can suffer. Such
a society might claim that their morality is based on some universal
features of human nature or of all rational beings. Although all
societies include more than just a concern for minimizing harm to
(some) human beings in their moralities, this feature of morality,
unlike purity and sanctity, or accepting authority and emphasizing
loyalty, is included in everything that is regarded as a morality by
any society. Because minimizing harm can conflict with accepting
authority and emphasizing loyalty, there can be fundamental
disagreements within a society about the morally right way to behave
in particular kinds of situations. Philosophers such as Bentham (1789)
and Mill (1861), who accept a normative account of morality that takes
the avoiding and preventing harm element of morality to be most
important, criticize all actual moralities (referred to by
“morality” in the descriptive sense) that give precedence
to purity and loyalty when they are in conflict with avoiding and
preventing harm.</p>

<p>
Some psychologists, such as Haidt, take morality to include concern
with, at least, all three of the triad of (1) harm, (2) purity, and
(3) loyalty, and hold that different members of a society can and do
take different features of morality to be most important. Most
societies have moralities that are concerned with, at least, all three
members of this triad. Concern with harm appears in the form of
enforceable rules against killing, causing pain, mutilating, etc. But
beyond a concern with avoiding and preventing such harms to members of
certain groups, there may be no common content shared by all
moralities in the descriptive sense. Nor may there be any common
justification that those who accept morality claim for it; some may
appeal to religion, others to tradition, and others to rational human
nature. Beyond the concern with harm mentioned above, the only other
features that all descriptive moralities have in common is that they
are put forward by an individual or a group, usually a society, in
which case they provide a guide for the behavior of the people in that
group or society. In this descriptive sense of “morality”,
morality might allow slavery or might allow people with one skin color
or gender to behave in ways that those with a different skin color or
gender are not allowed to behave. In this descriptive sense of
“morality”, morality may not even incorporate impartiality
with regard to all moral agents, and it may not be universalizable in
any significant way (compare MacIntyre 1957).</p>

<p>
Although most philosophers do not use “morality” in any of
the above descriptive senses, some philosophers do. Ethical
relativists such as Harman (1975), Westermarck (1960), Prinz (2007),
and Wong (1984, 2006) deny that there is any universal normative
morality and claim that the actual moralities of societies or
individuals are the only moralities there are. These relativists hold
that only when the term “morality” is used in this
descriptive sense is there something that “morality”
actually refers to: a code of conduct put forward by a society or
accepted by an individual. They claim that it is a mistake to take
“morality” to refer to a universal code of conduct that,
under certain conditions, would be endorsed by all rational persons.
Although ethical relativists admit that many speakers of English use
“morality” to refer to such a universal code of conduct,
they claim such persons are mistaken in thinking that there is
anything that is the referent of the word “morality” taken
in that sense. The harm caused by Christian missionaries who used
morality as a basis for trying to change the practices of the
societies with which they came in contact may have been one of the
reasons why many anthropologists endorsed ethical relativism. It is
interesting that one basis for criticizing the behavior of these
Christian missionaries is that it caused harm to the people in those
societies, since this is a basis that would be endorsed by those who
use “morality” in the normative sense.</p>

<p>
When used with its descriptive sense, “morality” can refer
to codes of conduct with widely differing content, and still be used
unambiguously. This parallels the way in which “law” is
used unambiguously even though different societies have laws with
widely differing content. However, when “morality” is used
in its descriptive sense, it sometimes does not refer to the code of a
society, but to the code of a group or an individual. As a result,
when the guide to conduct put forward by, for example, a religious
group conflicts with the guide to conduct put forward by a society, it
is not clear whether to say that there are conflicting moralities,
conflicting elements within morality, or that the code of the
religious group conflicts with morality. Members of the society who
are also members of a religious group may regard both guides as
elements of morality and differ with respect to which of the
conflicting elements of the moral guide they consider most important.
There are likely to be significant moral disputes between those who
consider different elements to be more important.</p>

<p>
In small homogeneous societies there may be a guide to behavior that
is put forward by the society and that is accepted by (almost) all
members of the society. For such societies there is (almost) no
ambiguity about which guide “morality” refers to. However,
in larger societies people often belong to groups that put forward
guides to behavior that conflict with the guide put forward by their
society, and members of the society do not always accept the guide put
forward by their society. If they accept the conflicting guide of some
other group to which they belong (often a religious group) rather than
the guide put forward by their society, in cases of conflict they will
regard those who follow the guide put forward by their society as
acting immorally.</p>

<p>
The above considerations may suggest the use of a descriptive sense of
“morality” according to which morality is that guide to
behavior that is regarded by an individual as overriding and that he
wants to be universally adopted. Understood in this way
“morality” refers to a guide to behavior accepted by an
individual rather than that put forward by a society or any other
group. But, in this sense, “morality” does not refer to
just any guide to behavior accepted by an individual; it is that guide
to behavior that the individual accepts as his overriding guide, and
wants everyone in his group to accept as their overriding guide as
well. This sense of “morality” is a descriptive sense,
because a person can refer to some other individual’s morality
without endorsing it. When relativized to an individual in this way,
morality has less limitation on content than when it is taken to refer
to the code of conduct put forward by a society or group. Whatever
guide to behavior an individual regards as overriding and wants to be
accepted by everyone in his group is that individual’s morality.
Still, if the person is rational, this guide will include prohibitions
on causing harm.</p>

<p>
When people explicitly talk about the morality of a group other than
their own or of a person other than themselves, it is usually clear
that they are using “morality” in a specific descriptive
sense. However, when a person simply claims that morality prohibits or
requires a given action, then the term “morality” is
genuinely ambiguous. It is not clear whether it refers to (1) a guide
to behavior that is put forward by a society, to which that person
might or might not belong; (2) a guide that is put forward by a group,
to which that person might or might not belong; (3) a guide that
someone, perhaps that very person, regards as overriding and wants
adopted by everyone else, or (4) a universal guide that all rational
persons would put forward for governing the behavior of all moral
agents. When a person uses “morality” to refer to a guide
to conduct put forward by a group, unless it is his own group, it is
usually only being used in its descriptive sense. Someone referring to
morality in the descriptive sense of “morality” need not
be endorsing it. When “morality” refers to a guide to
conduct accepted by an individual, unless that individual is himself,
it is usually being used in its descriptive sense. However, if the
individual is referring to his own morality, he is usually using it
normatively; that is, he would usually accept the claim that all
<em>rational</em> persons, at least under certain conditions, would
endorse it.</p>

<p>
“Ethics” is sometimes taken to refer to a guide to
behavior wider in scope than morality, and that an individual adopts
as his or her own guide to life, as long as it is a guide that the
individual views as a proper guide for others. When a general guide to
behavior of this sort endorses self-interest as primary this is
usually because acting in one’s self interest is taken as
fostering the interests of all. However, Sidgwick (1874) regarded
moral rules as any rational rules of conduct. Moreover, because he
held that it is rational to take one’s self-interest as primary,
even if others are seriously harmed, he held that “ethical
egoism” was an ethical theory. He may have been the primary
source of the current philosophical practice that includes ethical
egoism—a view that endorses acting in one’s own
self-interest even when this requires harming innocent people—as
an ethical theory. Because all moralities in the descriptive sense
include a prohibition on harming others, ethical egoism is not a
morality in the descriptive sense. Because, as will be explained in
the following section, all moralities in the normative sense not only
include prohibitions on harming others but also are such that all
rational persons would endorse that morality, ethical egoism is not a
morality in the normative sense either. Only if one equates moral
rules with rational rules of conduct—as Sidgwick does—is
it possible to regard a guide to conduct that takes one’s own
self-interest as sanctioning harming innocent others as a moral guide.
Sidgwick does this, but he is decidedly in the minority in this
respect.</p>

<p>
In the descriptive sense of “morality”, a person’s
own morality cannot be a guide to behavior that that person would
prefer others not to follow. However, that fact that an individual
adopts a moral code of conduct for his own use does not entail that
the person <em>requires</em> it to be adopted by anyone else. An
individual may adopt for himself a very demanding moral guide that he
thinks may be too difficult for most others to follow. He may judge
people who do not adopt his code of conduct as not being as morally
good as he is, without judging them to be immoral if they do not adopt
it. However, such cases do not undermine the restriction; a guide is
plausibly referred to as a morality only when the individual would be
<em>willing</em> for others to follow it, at least if
“follow” is taken to mean “successfully
follow”. For it may be that the individual would not be willing
for others to <em>try</em> to follow that code, because of worries
about the bad effects of predictable failures due to partiality or
lack of sufficient foresight or intelligence.</p>

<h2 id="NormDefiMora">2. Normative definitions of “morality”</h2>

<p>
Those who use “morality” normatively hold that morality is
(or would be) the code that meets the following condition: all
rational persons, under certain specified conditions, would endorse
it. Indeed, this is a plausible basic schema for definitions of
“morality” in the normative sense. Although some hold that
no code could meet the condition, many theorists hold that there is
one that does; we can call the former “moral skeptics” and
the latter “moral realists”.</p>

<p>
Many moral skeptics would reject the claim that there are any
universal ethical claims, where the ethical is a broader category than
the moral. But another interesting class of moral skeptics includes
those who think that we should only abandon the narrower category of
the moral—partly because of the notion of <em>a code</em> that
is central to that category. These moral skeptics hold that we should
do our ethical theorizing in terms of the good life, or the virtues.
Elizabeth Anscombe (1958) gave expression to this kind of view, which
also finds echoes in the work of Bernard Williams (1985). On the other
hand, some virtue theorists might take perfect rationality to entail
virtue, and might understand morality to be something like the code
that such a person would implicitly endorse by acting in virtuous
ways. In that case, even a virtue theorist might count as a moral
realist in the sense above.</p>

<p>
Consequentialist views might not seem to fit the basic schema for
definitions of “morality”, since they do not appear to
make reference to the notions of endorsement or rationality. But this
appearance is deceptive. Mill (1861: 12) himself explicitly defines
morality as </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
the rules and precepts for human conduct, by the observance of which
[a happy existence] might be, to the greatest extent possible,
secured. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
And he thinks that the mind is not in a “right state”
unless it is in “the state most conducive to the general
happiness”—in which case it would certainly favor
morality. And the act-consequentialist J.J.C. Smart (1956) is also
explicit that he is thinking of ethics as the study of how it is most
rational to behave. His embrace of utilitarianism is the result of his
belief that maximizing utility is always the rational thing to do. On
reflection this is not surprising. Unless one thinks that rational
people would endorse the moral system one is defending, one will have
to admit that, having been shown that a certain behavior is morally
required, a rational person might simply shrug and say “So what?
What is that to me?” And, though some exceptions are mentioned
below, very few moral realists think that their arguments leave this
option open. Even fewer think this option remains open if we are
allowed to add some additional conditions beyond mere rationality: a
restriction on beliefs, for example (similar to Rawls’ (1971:
118) veil of ignorance), or impartiality.</p>

<p>
Definitions of morality in the normative sense—and,
consequently, moral theories—differ in their accounts of
rationality, and in their specifications of the conditions under which
all rational persons would necessarily endorse the code of conduct
that therefore would count as morality. These definitions and theories
also differ in how they understand what it is to endorse a code in the
relevant way. Related to these differences, definitions of
“morality”—and moral theories—differ with
regard to those to whom morality applies: that is, those whose
behavior is subject to moral judgment. Some hold that morality applies
only to those rational beings that have certain specific features of
human beings: features that make it rational for them to endorse
morality. These features might, for example, include fallibility and
vulnerability. Other moral theories claim to put forward an account of
morality that provides a guide to all rational beings, even if these
beings do not have these human characteristics, e.g., God.</p>

<p>
Among those who use “morality” normatively, virtually all
hold that “morality” refers to a code of conduct that
<em>applies to</em> all who can understand it and can govern their
behavior by it, though many hold that it <em>protects</em> a larger
group. Among such theorists it is also common to hold that morality
should never be overridden. That is, it is common to hold that no one
should ever violate a moral prohibition or requirement for non-moral
reasons. This claim is trivial if “should” is taken to
mean “morally should”. So the claim about moral
overridingness is typically understood with “should”
meaning “rationally should”, with the result that moral
requirements are asserted to be rational requirements. Though common,
this view is by no means always taken as definitional. Sidgwick (1874)
despaired of showing that rationality <em>required</em> us to choose
morality over egoism, though he certainly did not think rationality
required egoism either. More explicitly, Gert (2005) held that though
moral behavior is always rationally <em>permissible</em>, it is not
always rationally <em>required</em>. Foot (1972) seems to have held
that any reason—and therefore any rational requirement—to
act morally would have to stem from a contingent commitment or an
objective interest. And she also seems to have held that sometimes
neither of these sorts of reasons might be available. Finally, moral
realists who hold desire-based theories of reasons and formal,
means/end theories of rationality would explicitly deny that moral
behavior is always even rationally <em>permissible</em> (Goldman
2009). Still, even theorists such as Sidgwick, Gert, Foot, and Goldman
are by no means precluded from using “morality” in the
normative sense, since this entails only holding that rational people
would put a certain system forward—not that they would always be
motivated to follow that system themselves. But to the degree that a
theorist would deny even the claim about endorsement, and therefore
hold that rational people might not only fail to act morally, but
might even reject it as a public system, that theorist is either not
using “morality” in a normative sense, or is denying the
existence of morality. Such a theorist may be using
“morality” in a descriptive sense, or may not have any
particular sense in mind, and explicitly be relying on context to fix
the sense.</p>

<p>
When “morality” is used in its normative sense, it need
not have either of the two formal features that are essential to
moralities referred to by the descriptive sense: that it be a code of
conduct that is put forward by a society, group, or individual and
that it be accepted as a guide to behavior by the members of that
society or group, or by that individual. Indeed, it is possible that
morality, in the normative sense, has never been put forward by any
particular society, by any group at all, or even by any
individual.</p>

<p>
If one is a moral realist, and one also acknowledges the descriptive
sense of “morality”, one may require that descriptive
moralities at least approximate, in some ways, morality in the
normative sense. That is, one might claim that the guides to behavior
of some societies lack so many of the essential features of morality,
in the normative sense, that it is incorrect to say that these
societies even have a morality in a descriptive sense. This is an
extreme view, however. A more moderate position would hold that all
societies have something that can be regarded as their morality, but
that many of these moralities—perhaps, indeed, all of
them—are defective. That is, a moral realist might hold that
although these actual guides to behavior have enough of the features
of normative morality to be classified as descriptive moralities, they
would not be endorsed in their entirety by all moral agents.</p>

<p>
Moral realists do not claim that any actual society has or has ever
had morality as its actual guide to conduct. However, “natural
law” theories of morality claim that any rational person in any
society, even one that has a defective morality, can know the general
kinds of actions that morality prohibits, requires, discourages,
encourages, and allows. In the theological version of natural law
theories, such as that put forward by Aquinas, this is because God
implanted this knowledge in the reason of all persons. In the secular
version of natural law theories, such as that put forward by Hobbes
(1660), natural reason is sufficient to allow all rational persons to
know what morality prohibits, requires, etc. Natural law theorists
also claim that morality applies to all rational persons, not only
those now living, but also those who lived in the past. These are not
empirical claims about morality; they are claims about what is
essential to morality, or about what is meant by
“morality” when it is used normatively.</p>

<p>
In contrast to natural law theories, other moral theories do not hold
quite so strong a view about the universality of knowledge of
morality. Still, many hold that morality is known to all who can
legitimately be judged by it. Baier (1958), Rawls (1971) and
contractarians deny that there can be an <em>esoteric</em> morality:
one that judges people even though they cannot know what it prohibits,
requires, etc. For all of the above theorists, morality is what we can
call a <em>public system</em>: a system of norms (1) that is knowable
by all those to whom it applies and (2) that is not irrational for any
of those to whom it applies to follow (Gert 2005: 10). Moral judgments
of blame thus differ from legal or religious judgments of blame in
that they cannot be made about persons who are legitimately ignorant
of what they are required to do. Act consequentialists seem to hold
that everyone should know that they are morally required to act so as
to bring about the best consequences, but even they do not seem to
think judgments of moral blame are appropriate if a person is
legitimately ignorant of what action would bring about the best
consequences (Singer 1993: 228). Parallel views seem to be held by
rule consequentialists (Hooker 2001: 72).</p>

<p>
The ideal situation for a legal system would be that it be a public
system. But in any large society this is not possible. As a result,
sometimes people are held legally responsible for violating rules
about which they were legitimately ignorant, and even when it would
have been irrational for them to have followed those rules. Games are closer
to being public systems and most adults playing a game know its rules,
or they know that there are judges whose interpretation determines
what behavior the game prohibits, requires, etc. Although a game is
often a public system, its rules apply only to those playing the game.
If a person does not care enough about the game to abide by the rules,
she can usually quit. Morality is the one public system that no
rational person can quit. This is the point that Kant, without
completely realizing it, captured by saying that morality is
categorical. This characteristic goes beyond what Brink (1997)
intended by saying morality is “inescapable”, since for
him inescapability is merely a negative matter of not depending on
one’s desires or interests. The rules of a club are inescapable
in this way, even though one can escape them by quitting the club.
Rather, the fact that one cannot quit morality means that one can do
nothing to escape being legitimately liable to sanction for violating
its norms, except by ceasing to be a moral agent. Morality applies to
people simply by virtue of their being rational persons who know what
morality prohibits, requires, etc., and being able to guide their
behavior accordingly. Of course there is dispute about what it takes
to be able to guide one’s behavior according to morality. For
example, some (Levy 2007) might say that psychopaths cannot do so,
while others might make the opposite claim (Haji 2003). But in general
one’s answer to this question about psychopaths will parallel
one’s views about whether or not morality applies to them.</p>

<p>
Public systems can be <em>formal</em> or <em>informal</em>. To say a
public system is informal is to say that it has no authoritative
judges and no decision procedure that provides a unique guide to
action in all situations, or that resolves all disagreements. To say
that a public system is formal is to say that it has one or both of
these things (Gert 2005: 9). Professional basketball is a formal
public system; all the players know that what the referees call a foul
determines what is a foul. Pickup basketball is an informal public
system. The existence of persistent moral disagreements shows that
morality is most plausibly regarded as an informal public system. This
is true even for such moral theories as the Divine Command theory and
act utilitarianism, inasmuch as there are no authoritative judges of
God’s will, or of which act will maximize utility, and there are
no decision procedures for determining these things (Scanlon 2011:
261–2). When persistent moral disagreement is recognized, those
who understand that morality is an informal public system admit that
how one should act is morally unresolvable, and if some resolution is
required, the political or legal system can be used to resolve it.
These formal systems have the means to provide unique guides, but they
do not provide the uniquely correct moral guide to the action that
should be performed.</p>

<p>
An important example of a moral problem left unsettled by the informal
public system of morality is whether fetuses are impartially protected
by morality and so whether or under what conditions abortions are
allowed. There is continuing disagreement among fully informed moral
agents about this moral question, even though the legal and political
system in the United States has provided fairly clear guidelines about
the conditions under which abortion is legally allowed. Despite this
important and controversial issue, morality, like all informal public
systems, presupposes agreement on how to act in most moral situations,
e.g., all agree that killing or seriously harming any moral agent
requires strong justification in order to be morally allowed. No one
thinks it is morally justified to cheat, deceive, injure, or kill a
moral agent simply in order to gain sufficient money to take a
fantastic vacation. Many violations of moral rules are such that no
rational person would be willing for all moral agents to know that
violating the moral rule in these circumstances is morally allowed.
However, moral matters are often thought to be controversial because
these everyday decisions, about which there is no controversy, are
rarely discussed. The amount of agreement concerning what rules are
moral rules, and on when it is justified to violate one of these
rules, explains why morality can be a public system even though it is
an informal system.</p>

<p>
Now that we have the notion of an informal public system available, we
can improve the basic schema for definitions of “morality”
in the normative sense. The old schema was that morality is the
<em>code</em> that all rational persons, under certain specified
conditions, would endorse. The improved schema is that morality is the
<em>informal public system</em> that all rational persons, under
certain specified conditions, would endorse. Some theorists might not
regard the informal nature of the moral system as definitional,
holding that morality might give precise answers to every question.
This would have the result that conscientious moral agents often
cannot know what morality permits, requires, or allows. Some
philosophers deny that this is a genuine possibility.</p>

<p>
On any definition of “morality”, whether descriptive or
normative, it is a code of conduct. However, on ethical- or
group-relativist accounts or on individualistic accounts—all of
which are best regarded as accounts of morality in the descriptive
sense—morality often has no special content that distinguishes
it from nonmoral codes of conduct, such as law or religion. Just as a
legal code of conduct can have almost any content, as long as it is
capable of guiding behavior, and a religious code of conduct has no
limits on content, most relativist and individualist accounts of
morality place few limits on the content of a moral code (an exception
is Wong 2006). Of course, actual codes do have certain minimal
limits—otherwise the societies they characterize would lack the
minimum required degree of social cooperation required to sustain
their existence over time. On the other hand, for moral realists who
explicitly hold that morality is an informal public system that all
rational persons would put forward for governing the behavior of all
moral agents, it has a fairly definite content. Hobbes (1660), Mill
(1861), and most other non-religiously influenced philosophers in the
Anglo-American tradition limit morality to behavior that, directly or
indirectly, affects others.</p>

<p>
The claim that morality only governs behavior that affects others is
somewhat controversial, and so probably should not be counted as
definitional, even if it turns out to be entailed by the correct moral
theory. Some have claimed that morality also governs behavior that
affects only the agent herself, such as taking recreational drugs,
masturbation, and not developing one’s talents. Kant (1785) may
provide an account of this wide concept of morality. Interpreted this
way, Kant’s theory still fits the basic schema, but includes
these self-regarding moral requirements because of the particular
account of rationality he employs. However, <em>pace</em> Kant, it is
doubtful that all moral agents would put forward a universal guide to
behavior that governs behavior that does not affect them at all.
Indeed, when the concept of morality is completely distinguished from
religion, moral rules do seem to limit their content to behavior that
directly or indirectly causes or risks harm to others. Some behavior
that seems to affect only oneself, e.g., taking recreational drugs,
may have a significant indirect harmful effect on others by supporting
the illegal and harmful activity of those who benefit from the sale of
those drugs.</p>

<p>
Confusion about the content of morality sometimes arises because
morality is not distinguished sufficiently from religion. Regarding
self-affecting behavior as governed by morality is supported by the
idea that we are created by God and are obliged to obey God’s
commands, and so may be a holdover from the time when morality was not
clearly distinguished from religion. This religious holdover might
also affect the claim that some sexual practices such as homosexuality
are immoral. Those who clearly distinguish morality from religion
typically do not regard sexual orientation as a moral matter. Many
secular American colleges and universities prohibit discrimination on
the basis of sexual orientation, and it is quite common for these
college and university officials, as well as other public officials,
to condemn homophobic behavior as immoral just as they condemn racist
behavior as immoral.</p>

<p>
It is possible to hold that having a certain sort of social goal is
definitional of morality (Frankena 1963). Stephen Toumlin (1950) took
it to be the harmony of society. Baier (1958) took it to be “the
good of everyone alike”. Utilitarians sometimes claim it is the
production of the greatest good. Gert (2005) took it to be the
lessening of evil or harm. This latter goal may seem to be a
significant narrowing of the utilitarian claim, but utilitarians
always include the lessening of harm as essential to producing the
greatest good and almost all of their examples involve the avoiding or
preventing of harm. In favor of the focus on lessening harm, it is
notable that the paradigm cases of moral rules are those that prohibit
causing harm directly or indirectly, such as rules prohibiting
killing, causing pain, deceiving, and breaking promises. Even those
precepts that require or encourage positive action, such as helping
the needy, are almost always related to preventing or relieving harms,
rather than promoting goods such as pleasure. It should be clear that
all rational persons would include these paradigm moral precepts in
the moral code that they would put forward to guide the behavior of
all moral agents. The question is whether they would also include
precepts that require or encourage the promotion of positive benefits
when such benefits do not count as the relieving of deprivation. For
example, if they would include a moral precept encouraging people to
be more entertaining or to cook tastier meals, then Gert would be
wrong.</p>

<p>
Among the views of moral realists, differences in content are less
significant than similarities. For all such philosophers, morality
prohibits actions such as killing, causing pain, deceiving, and
breaking promises. For some, morality also requires charitable
actions, but failure to act charitably on every possible occasion does
not require justification in the same way that any act of killing,
causing pain, deceiving, and breaking promises requires justification.
Both Kant (1785) and Mill (1861) distinguish between duties of perfect
obligation and duties of imperfect obligation and regard not harming
as the former kind of duty and helping as the latter kind of duty. For
Gert (2005), morality encourages charitable action, but does not
require it; it is always morally good to be charitable, but it is not
immoral not to be charitable.</p>

<p>
Even if the plausible basic schema for definitions of
“morality” in the normative sense is accepted, one’s
understanding of what morality is, in this sense, will still depend
very significantly on how one understands rationality. As has already
been mentioned, morality, in the normative sense, is sometimes taken
to prohibit certain forms of consensual sexual activity, or the use of
recreational drugs. However, such prohibitions need not be included in
an account of morality as a universal guide that all rational persons
would put forward for governing the behavior of all moral agents. One
need not regard it as irrational to favor harmless consensual sexual
activities, or to favor the use of certain drugs for purely
recreational purposes.</p>

<p>
One concept of rationality that supports the exclusion of sexual
matters, at least at the basic level, from the norms of morality, is
that for an action to count as irrational it must be an act that harms
oneself without producing a compensating benefit for
someone—perhaps oneself, perhaps someone else. Such an account
of rationality might be called “hybrid”, since it gives
different roles to self-interest and to altruism. An account of
morality based on the hybrid concept of rationality could agree with
Hobbes (1660) that morality is concerned with promoting people living
together in peace and harmony, which includes obeying the rules
prohibiting causing harm to others. Although moral prohibitions
against actions that cause harm or significantly increase the risk of
harm are not absolute, in order to avoid acting immorally,
justification is always needed when violating these prohibitions. Kant
(1797) seems to hold that it is never justified to violate some of
these prohibitions, e.g., the prohibition against lying. This is
largely a result of the fact that Kant’s (1785) concept of
rationality is purely formal, in contrast with the hybrid concept of
rationality described above.</p>

<p>
Most moral realists who offer moral theories do not bother to offer
anything like a definition of morality. Instead, what these
philosophers offer is a theory of the nature and justification of a
set of norms with which they take their audience already to be
acquainted. In effect, they tacitly pick morality out by reference to
certain salient and relative uncontroversial bits of its content: that
it prohibits killing, stealing, deceiving, cheating, and so on. In
fact, this would not be a bad way of defining morality, if the point
of such a definition were only to be relatively theory-neutral, and to
allow theorizing to begin. We could call it “the
reference-fixing definition” or “the substantive
definition”.</p>

<p>
Some, including Hare (1952, 1963), have been tempted to argue against
the possibility of a substantive definition of morality, on the basis
of the claim that moral disapproval is an attitude that can be
directed at anything whatsoever. Foot (1958a, 1958b), argued against
this idea, but the substantive definition still has the drawback is
that it does not, somehow, seem to get at the essence of morality. One
might suggest that the substantive definition has the advantage of
including Divine Command theories of morality, while such theories
might seem to make trouble for definitions based on the plausible
schema given above. But it is plausible to hold that Divine Command
theories rest on Natural Law theories, which do in fact fit the
schema. Divine Command theory that do not rest on Natural Law might
make trouble for the schema, but one might also think that such
theories rest instead on a confusion, since they seem to entail that
God might have made it immoral to act beneficently.</p>

<h2 id="Vari">3. Variations</h2>

<p>
As one gives more substance and detail to the general notions of
endorsement, rationality, and the relevant conditions under which
rational people would endorse morality, one moves further from
providing a definition of morality in the normative sense, and closer
to providing an actual moral theory. And a similar claim is true for
definitions of morality in the descriptive sense, as one specifies in
more detail what one means in claiming that a person or group endorses
a system or code. In the following four sections, four broad ways of
making the definitions of morality more precise are presented. They
are all sufficiently schematic to be regarded as varieties of
definition, rather than as theories.</p>

<h3 id="MoraLinkNormForRespBeha">3.1 Morality as linked to norms for responses to behavior</h3>

<p>
Expressivists about morality do not take there to be any objective
content to morality that could underwrite what we above called
“the substantive definition”. Rather, they explicitly
recognize the existence of significant variation in what rules and
ideals different people put forward as morality in the normative
sense. And they doubt that this variation is compatible with moral
realism. Consequently, they need to offer some unifying features of
these different sets of rules and ideals, despite variation in their
content. As a result of this pressure, some expressivists end up
offering explicit accounts of a <em>distinctively</em> moral attitude
one might hold towards an act token or type. These accounts can of
course be taken to underwrite various forms of morality in the
descriptive sense. But they can also be taken to provide the basis of
one form of moral realism.</p>

<p>
To see how an expressivist view can be co-opted by a moral realist of
a certain sort, consider Allan Gibbard’s (1990) moral
expressivism. Gibbard holds that moral judgments are expressions of
the acceptance of norms for feeling the emotions of guilt and anger.
One can accept Gibbard’s view of what it is to endorse a moral
claim without accepting the view that, in conflicts, all disagreements
are faultless. That is, even a moral realist can use Gibbard’s
view of the nature of moral judgment, and extract from it a definition
of morality. Used by such a theorist, Gibbard’s view entails
that morality, in the normative sense, is the code that is picked out
by the <em>correct</em> set of norms for feeling guilt and anger: that
is, the norms a <em>rational</em> person would endorse. This is
equivalent to accepting the plausible general schema for a definition
of “morality” given above, and understanding endorsement
in a special sense. To endorse a code in the relevant way, on this
definition, is to think that violations of its norms make guilt and
anger appropriate.</p>

<p>
Closely related to Gibbard’s account is one according to which
the norms of relevance are not norms for the emotions, but are norms
for other reactions to behavior. For example, a person’s
morality might be the set of rules and ideals they regard as picked
out by appropriate norms for praise and blame, and other social
sanctions (Sprigge 1964: 317). In fact, reference to praise and blame
may be more adequate than reference to guilt and anger, since the
latter seem only to pick out moral prohibitions, and not to make room
for the idea that morality also recommends or encourages certain
behaviors even if it does not require them. For example, it is
plausible that there is such a thing as supererogatory action, and
that the specification of what counts as supererogatory is part of
morality—whether in the descriptive or normative sense. But it
does not seem likely that we can account for this part of morality by
appeal to norms for guilt and anger, and it is not at all clear that
there are emotions that are as closely linked to supererogation as
guilt and anger are to moral transgression. On the other hand, it
seems plausible that norms for praising action might help to pick out
what counts as supererogatory.</p>

<p>
Another version of the present strategy would replace talk of praise
and blame with talk of reward and punishment. This view would take
morality to be a system that explained what kinds of actions are
appropriately rewarded and—more centrally—punished. This
sort of view, which remains closely related to Gibbard’s
suggestion, can also be regarded as fitting the general schema given
above. On this view, the notion of endorsing a code is unpacked in
terms of the acceptance of norms for reward and punishment. Skorupksi
(1993), following Mill (1861), advocates a definition of morality
along these lines, though he then understands punishment primarily in
terms of blame, and understands blame as very closely linked to
emotion—indeed, merely having the emotion can count as
blaming—so that the resulting view is similar to Gibbard’s
in one important way, at least when one focuses on moral
wrongness.</p>

<p>
It is certainly plausible that it is appropriate to feel guilt when
one acts immorally, and to feel anger at those who act immorally
towards those one cares about. It is even plausible that it is
<em>only</em> appropriate, in some particular sense of
“appropriate”, to feel guilt and anger in connection with
moral transgressions. So norms for guilt and anger may well uniquely
pick out certain moral norms. And similar claims might be made about
norms for praise and blame. However, it is not equally clear that
morality is properly <em>defined</em> in terms of emotions or other
reactions to behavior. For it may be, as Skorupski emphasizes, that we
need to understand guilt and anger, and praise and blame, in terms of
moral concepts. This worry about direction of explanation seems less
pressing for the notions of reward and punishment. These responses to
behavior, at least <em>in themselves</em>, might simply be understood
in terms of the meting out of benefits and harms. Of course they will
only <em>count as reward and punishment</em> when they are linked to
someone’s having followed or violated a rule that all rational
people would want to see enforced by such responses.</p>

<h3 id="MoraLinkAdvoCode">3.2 Morality as linked to advocacy of a code</h3>

<p>
One way of understanding the notion of endorsement is as advocacy.
Advocating a code is a second- or third-personal matter, since one
advocates a code to others. Moreover, it is consistent with advocating
a code, that one does not plan on following that code oneself. Just as
asserting something one believes to be false still counts as asserting
it, hypocritical advocacy of a code still counts as advocacy of that
code. When endorsement is understood as advocacy, it can be used in
definitions of morality, in the descriptive sense, as long as it is
the morality of a group or society. And advocacy can also be used as
an interpretation of endorsement when providing a definition of
morality in the normative sense. Of course those who accept a
definition of morality in any of these senses—as the code that a
group or society endorses, or as the code that would be universally
advocated by all rational agents under certain conditions—do not
hold that the advocacy would necessarily, or even probably, be
hypocritical. But they do hold that the important thing about a moral
code—what picks it out as a moral code—is that it would be
<em>put forward</em> by all the relevant agents, not that it would be
<em>followed</em> by all of them. The notion of advocacy has less of a
place in a descriptive account of a single person’s morality,
since when someone is hypocritical we often deny that they really hold
the moral view that they advocate. Of course it is possible to fail to
live up to one’s own morality, but in that case one would be
expected to feel guilt, or to be torn in some way. And if we use such
feelings to pick out a person’s morality, we are relying on the
sort of definition described above, in
 <a href="#MoraLinkNormForRespBeha">section 3.1</a>.</p>
 
<p>
Mill (1861), in addition to offering a moral theory, takes pains to
explain how morality differs from other normative systems. For him,
norms that simply promote utility are norms of expediency. In order to
qualify as morally wrong, an act must be one that ought to be
punished. Thinking that an act of a certain kind ought to be punished
is a third-personal matter, so it seems plausible to put Mill’s
view of what is definitional of morality into the category being
discussed in this section. It is worth noting that hypocrisy is, for
Mill, not only a possibility, but—given the present sorry state
of moral education—virtually unavoidable. That is because being
motivated to advocate punishment for a certain kind of act is quite
different from being motivated to refrain from that same kind of act.
Advocating punishment for a certain kind of act might be one’s
utility-maximizing choice, while actually performing that kind of act
(trying, of course, to avoid detection) might also be
utility-maximizing. And for Mill what determines what a person will
advocate, and how a person will act, is the foreseeable consequences
<em>for that person</em>.</p>

<p>
Bernard Gert’s (2005) moral view also operates with a definition
of morality that understands endorsement as advocacy, in the sense of
putting forward as a guide for all rational agents. Gert’s way
of filling in the schema for a definition of “morality”
makes use of a normative sense of “rationality”: one
according to which no moral agent would ever advise anyone for whom he
was concerned, including himself, to act irrationally. The hybrid
concept of rationality described in
 <a href="#NormDefiMora">section 2</a>
 satisfies this condition because no moral agent would ever advise
anyone for whom she cared, including herself, to act in any way that
harms herself with no compensating benefit to anyone.</p>

<p>
Gert offers the following two conditions as the conditions under which
all rational persons would put forward a universal guide for governing
the behavior of all moral agents. The first condition is that they are
seeking agreement with all other rational persons or moral agents. The
second condition is that they use only those beliefs that are shared
by all rational persons: for example, that they themselves are
fallible and vulnerable and that all those to whom morality applies
are also fallible and vulnerable. The second condition rules out both
religious beliefs and scientific beliefs since there are no religious
beliefs or scientific beliefs that all rational persons share. This
condition is plausible because no universal guide to behavior that
applies to all rational persons can be based on beliefs that some of
these rational persons do not share.</p>

<p>
Gert offers the following explicit definition of morality: Morality is
an informal public system applying to all rational persons, governing
behavior that affects others, and has the lessening of evil or harm as
its goal. It might seem that this definition is quite different from
the general schema offered above. But Gert argues that this
definition—as he interprets it—results in morality being a
universal guide to behavior that all rational persons would put
forward for governing the behavior of all moral agents.</p>

<h3 id="MoraLinkAcceCode">3.3 Morality as linked to acceptance of a code</h3>

<p>
Another way of understanding the notion of endorsement is as
acceptance. Unlike advocating a code, accepting a code is a
first-personal matter. It might include intending to conform
one’s own behavior to that code, feeling guilty when one does
not, and so on. One cannot hypocritically accept a code. Indeed,
hypocrisy is simply a matter of advocating a code one does not accept.
So this notion of endorsement is available to someone who is trying to
provide a definition of morality in the descriptive sense, even when
considering a single person’s morality.</p>

<p>
Paradigmatic views in the natural law tradition starting with Aquinas
hold both that the laws of morality have their source in God, and that
these laws constitute the principles of human practical rationality
(Finnis 1980; MacIntyre 1999). Views in this tradition may be seen as
using the basic schema for definitions of morality in the normative
sense, understanding endorsement as acceptance. Members of this
tradition typically hold that all rational persons know what kinds of
actions morality prohibits, requires, discourages, encourages, and
allows. It is central to Aquinas’s view that morality is known
to all those whose behavior is subject to moral judgment, even if they
do not know of the revelations of Christianity. This is why Aquinas
holds that knowing what morality prohibits and requires does not
involve knowing why morality prohibits and requires what it does.</p>

<p>
Those who belong to the natural law tradition also hold that reason
endorses acting morally. This sort of endorsement of course has a
cognitive component. But it is also motivational. Aquinas does not
hold that knowledge of morality is always effective: it can be blotted
out by evil persuasions or corrupt habits. But if reason is not
opposed by such forces, any rational person would not only know what
was prohibited and required by morality, but would follow those
prohibitions and requirements. So, for natural law theorists,
endorsement amounts to acceptance.</p>

<h3 id="MoraLinkJustOthe">3.4 Morality as linked to justification to others</h3>

<p>
The lack of an explicit and widely accepted definition of morality may
partially explain the resilience of act-consequentialist accounts of
morality. Without an explicit definition, it may be easier to ignore
the fact that act-consequentialist theories are not particularly
concerned with interpersonal interactions, but typically apply just as
well to desert island scenarios as to individuals who live in
societies. In any case, it has been recognized that in order to combat
consequentialism, it would be helpful to have something more like a
plausible definition of morality that made it clear that the subject
matter of morality is something different from simply the goodness and
badness of consequences. T.M. Scanlon (1982, 1998), applying this
strategy, suggests that the subject matter of morality—what we
are talking about, when we talk about morality—is a system of
rules for the regulation of behavior that is not reasonably rejectable
based on a desire for informed unforced general agreement.</p>

<p>
Scanlon’s suggestion regarding the subject matter of morality
can easily be seen as an instance of the general schema given above.
His “system of rules” is a specific kind of informal
public system; he understands endorsement by all rational people as
non-rejection by all reasonable people; and he offers a specific
account of the conditions under which moral agents would reach the
relevant agreement. But Scanlon also places very heavy emphasis on the
fact that if he is right about the subject matter of morality, then
what compliance with moral norms allows us to do is to justify our
behavior to others in ways that they cannot reasonably reject. Indeed,
the ability to justify ourselves to reasonable people is a primary
source of moral motivation for Scanlon (see also Sprigge 1964: 319).
This might seem to suggest a somewhat different definitional claim
about morality: that morality consists in the most basic norms in
terms of which we justify ourselves to others. But it is plausible
that this purportedly definitional claim is better thought of as a
corollary of Scanlon’s particular version of the general schema,
with endorsement understood as non-rejection. For, if morality is the
system of norms that would be endorsed in this way, we can justify our
actions to others by pointing out that even they, were they
reasonable, would have endorsed rules that allowed our behavior.</p>

<p>
Stephen Darwall’s (2006) moral view can also be seen as flowing
from a version of general schema, and yielding claims about
justifiability to others. Darwall claims that morality is a matter of
an equal accountability among free and rational beings. On his view, I
behave morally towards you to the degree that I respect the claims you
have authority to make on me. Darwall also holds that I will respect
those claims if I acknowledge certain assumptions to which I am
committed simply in virtue of being a rational, deliberating agent. As
a result, his view is that morality—or at least the morality of
obligation—is a “scheme of accountability” (a
certain sort of informal public system) that all rational people will
endorse. Unlike Scanlon’s view, however, Darwall’s view
makes use of a stronger sense of endorsement than non-rejection.
Specifically, it includes the recognition of the reasons provided by
the authoritative demands of other people. And that recognition is
positively motivational.</p>

<p>
Both Scanlon’s and Darwall’s views emphasize the social
nature of morality, taken in the normative sense: Scanlon, by
reference to justification to others; Darwall, by appeal to the
relevance of second-personal reasons. But Darwall builds a
responsiveness to second-personal reasons into the relevant notion of
rationality, while Scanlon simply makes the empirical claim that many
people are motivated by a desire to justify themselves to others, and
notes that his definition of morality will yield rules that will allow
one to do this, if one follows them. The sort of definition described
in
 <a href="#MoraLinkNormForRespBeha">section 3.1</a>
 also makes the social nature of morality essential to it, since it
centrally features the notion of a response to the behavior of others.
The definitions described in sections
 <a href="#MoraLinkAdvoCode">3.2</a>
 and
 <a href="#MoraLinkAcceCode">3.3</a>
 do not <em>entail</em> the social nature of morality—though of
course they are compatible with it—since it is possible to
accept, and even to advocate, a code that concerns only self-regarding
behavior. But on any plausible account of rationality a code that
would be advocated by all moral agents will govern interpersonal
interactions, and will include rules that prohibit causing harm
without sufficient reason. Only the definition offered in
 <a href="#MoraLinkAcceCode">section 3.3</a>
 therefore can be taken as realistically compatible with an egoistic
morality.</p>
