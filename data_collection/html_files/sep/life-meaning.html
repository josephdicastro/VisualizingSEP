<h1>The Meaning of Life</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Tue May 15, 2007; substantive revision Mon Jun 3, 2013</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>

Many major historical figures in philosophy have provided an answer to
the question of what, if anything, makes life meaningful, although
they typically have not put it in these terms. Consider, for instance,
Aristotle on the human function, Aquinas on the beatific vision, and
Kant on the highest good. While these concepts have some bearing on
happiness and morality, they are straightforwardly construed as
accounts of which final ends a person ought to realize in order to
have a life that matters. Despite the venerable pedigree, it is only
in the last 50 years or so that something approaching a distinct field
on the meaning of life has been established in Anglo-American
philosophy, and it is only in the last 30 years that debate with real
depth has appeared. Concomitant with the demise of positivism and of
utilitarianism in the post-war era has been the rise of analytical
enquiry into non-hedonistic conceptions of value, including
conceptions of meaning in life, grounded on relatively uncontroversial
(but not certain or universally shared) judgments of cases, often
called “intuitions.” English-speaking philosophers can be
expected to continue to find life's meaning of interest as they
increasingly realize that it is a distinct topic that admits of
rational enquiry to no less a degree than more familiar ethical
categories such as well-being, virtuous character, and right
action.</p>

<p>

This survey critically discusses approaches to meaning in life that 
are prominent in contemporary Anglo-American philosophical 
literature. To provide context, sometimes it mentions other texts, 
e.g., in Continental philosophy or from before the 20<sup>th</sup> 
century. However, the central aim is to acquaint the reader with 
recent analytic work on life's meaning and to pose questions about it
that are currently worthy of consideration.</p>

<p>

When the topic of the meaning of life comes up, people often pose one
of two questions: “So, what is the meaning of life?” and
“What are you talking about?” The literature can be
divided in terms of which question it seeks to answer. This discussion
starts off with works that address the latter, abstract question
regarding the sense of talk of “life's meaning,” i.e.,
that aim to clarify what we are asking when we pose the question of
what, if anything, makes life meaningful. Afterward, it considers
texts that provide answers to the more substantive question about the
nature of meaning as a property. Some accounts of what make life
meaningful provide particular ways to do so, e.g., by making certain
achievements (James 2005), developing moral character (Thomas 2005),
or learning from relationships with family members (Velleman
2005). However, most recent discussions of meaning in life are
attempts to capture in a single principle all the variegated
conditions that can confer meaning on life. This survey focuses
heavily on the articulation and evaluation of these theories of what
would make life meaningful. It concludes by examining nihilist views
that the conditions necessary for meaning in life do not obtain for
any of us, i.e., that all our lives are meaningless.</p>

<h2><a name="MeaMea">1. The Meaning of “Meaning”</a></h2>

<p>

One part of the field of life's meaning consists of the systematic
attempt to clarify what people mean when they ask in virtue of what
life has meaning. This section addresses different accounts of the
sense of talk of “life's meaning” (and of
“significance,” “importance,” and other
synonyms). A large majority of those writing on life's meaning deem
talk of it centrally to indicate a positive final value that an
individual's life can exhibit. That is, comparatively few believe
either that a meaningful life is a merely neutral quality, or that
what is of key interest is the meaning of the human species or
universe as a whole (for discussions focused on the latter, see
Edwards 1972; Munitz 1986; Seachris 2009). Most in the field have
ultimately wanted to know whether and how the existence of one of us
over time has meaning, a certain property that is desirable for its
own sake.</p>

<p>

Beyond drawing the distinction between the life of an individual and
that of a whole, there has been very little discussion of life as the
logical bearer of meaning. For instance, is the individual's life best
understood biologically, <em>qua</em> human being, or instead as the
existence of a person that may or may not be human (Flanagan 1996)?
And if an individual is loved from afar, can it logically affect the
meaningfulness of her “life” (Brogaard and Smith 2005,
449)?</p>

<p>

Returning to topics on which there is consensus, most writing on 
meaning believe that it comes in degrees such that some periods of 
life are more meaningful than others and that some lives as a whole 
are more meaningful than others (perhaps <em>contra</em> Britton 
1969, 192). Note that one can coherently hold the view that some 
people's lives are less meaningful than others, or even meaningless, 
and still maintain that people have an equal moral status. Consider a
consequentialist view according to which each individual counts for 
one in virtue of having a capacity for a meaningful life (cf. Railton
1984), or a Kantian view that says that people have an intrinsic 
worth in virtue of their capacity for autonomous choices, where 
meaning is a function of the exercise of this capacity (Nozick 1974, 
ch. 3). On both views, morality could counsel an agent to help people
with relatively meaningless lives, at least if the condition is not 
of their choosing.</p>

<p>

Another uncontroversial element of the sense of
“meaningfulness” is that it connotes a good that is
conceptually distinct from happiness or rightness (something
emphasized in Wolf 2010). First, to ask whether someone's life is
meaningful is not one and the same as asking whether her life is happy
or pleasant. A life in an experience or virtual reality machine could
conceivably be happy but very few take it to be a prima facie
candidate for meaningfulness (Nozick 1974: 42–45). Indeed, many
would say that talk of “meaning” by definition excludes the
possibility of it coming from time spent in an experience machine
(although there have been a small handful who disagree and contend
that a meaningful life just is a pleasant life. Goetz 2012, in
particular, bites many bullets.) Furthermore, one's life logically
could become meaningful precisely by sacrificing one's happiness,
e.g., by helping others at the expense of one's self-interest.</p>

<p> 

Second, asking whether a person's existence is significant is not
identical to considering whether she has been morally upright; there
seem to be ways to enhance meaning that have nothing to do with
morality, at least impartially conceived, for instance, making a
scientific discovery.</p>

<p> 

Of course, one might argue that a life would be meaningless if (or
even because) it were unhappy or immoral, particularly given
Aristotelian conceptions of these disvalues. However, that is to posit
a synthetic, substantive relationship between the concepts, and is far
from indicating that speaking of “meaning in life” is
analytically a matter of connoting ideas regarding happiness or
rightness, which is what I am denying here.  My point is that the
question of what makes a life meaningful is conceptually distinct from
the question of what makes a life happy or moral, even if it turns out
that the best answer to the question of meaning appeals to an answer
to one of these other evaluative questions.</p>

<p>

If talk about meaning in life is not by definition talk about
happiness or rightness, then what is it about? There is as yet no
consensus in the field. One answer is that a meaningful life is one
that by definition has achieved choice-worthy purposes (Nielsen 1964)
or involves satisfaction upon having done so (Hepburn 1965;
Wohlgennant 1981).  However, for such an analysis to clearly demarcate
meaningfulness from happiness, it would be useful to modify it to
indicate <em>which</em> purposes are germane to the former. On this
score, some suggest that conceptual candidates for grounding meaning
are purposes that not only have a positive value, but also render a
life coherent (Markus 2003), make it intelligible (Thomson 2003,
8–13), or transcend animal nature (Levy 2005).</p>

<p>

Now, it might be that a focus on any kind of purpose is too narrow 
for ruling out the logical possibility that meaning could inhere in 
certain actions, experiences, states, or relationships that have not 
been adopted as ends and willed and that perhaps even could not be, 
e.g., being an immortal offshoot of an unconscious, spiritual force 
that grounds the physical universe, as in Hinduism. In addition, the 
above purpose-based analyses exclude as not being about life's 
meaning some of the most widely read texts that purport to be about 
it, namely, Jean-Paul Sartre's (1948) existentialist account of 
meaning being constituted by whatever one chooses, and Richard 
Taylor's (1970, ch. 18) discussion of Sisyphus being able to acquire 
meaning in his life merely by having his strongest desires satisfied.
These are prima facie accounts of meaning in life, but do not 
essentially involve the attainment of purposes that foster coherence,
intelligibility or transcendence.</p>

<p>

The latter problem also faces the alternative suggestion that talk of
“life's meaning” is not necessarily about purposes, but is
rather just a matter of referring to goods that are qualitatively
superior, worthy of love and devotion, and appropriately awed (Taylor
1989, ch. 1). It is implausible to think that these criteria are
satisfied by subjectivist appeals to whatever choices one ends up
making or to whichever desires happen to be strongest for a given
person.</p>

<p>

Although relatively few have addressed the question of whether there
exists a single, primary sense of “life's meaning,” the
inability to find one so far might suggest that none exists. In that
case, it could be that the field is united in virtue of addressing
certain overlapping but not equivalent ideas that have family
resemblances (Metz 2013, ch. 2). Perhaps when we speak of
“meaning in life,” we have in mind one or more of these
related ideas: certain conditions that are worthy of great pride or
admiration, values that warrant devotion and love, qualities that make
a life intelligible, or ends apart from base pleasure that are
particularly choice-worthy. Another possibility is that talk of
“meaning in life” fails to exhibit even this degree of unity, and is
instead a grab-bag of heterogenous ideas (Mawson 2010; Oakley
2010).</p>

<p>

As the field reflects more on the sense of “life's
meaning,” it should not only try to ascertain in what respect it
admits of unity, but also try to differentiate the concept of life's
meaning from other, closely related ideas. For instance, the concept
of a worthwhile life is probably not identical to that of a meaningful
one (Baier 1997, ch. 5; Metz 2012). For instance, one would not be
conceptually confused to claim that a meaningless life full of animal
pleasures would be worth living. Furthermore, it seems that talk of a
“meaningless life” does not simply connote the concept of
an absurd (Nagel 1970; Feinberg 1980), unreasonable (Baier 1997,
ch. 5), futile (Trisel 2002), or wasted (Kamm 2003, 210–14)
life.</p>

<p>

Fortunately the field does not need an extremely precise analysis of
the concept of life's meaning (or definition of the phrase
“life's meaning”) in order to make progress on the
substantive question of what life's meaning is. Knowing that
meaningfulness analytically concerns a variable and gradient final
good in a person's life that is conceptually distinct from happiness,
rightness, and worthwhileness provides a certain amount of common
ground. The rest of this discussion addresses attempts to
theoretically capture the nature of this good.</p>

<h2><a name="Sup">2. Supernaturalism</a></h2>

<p>

Most English speaking philosophers writing on meaning in life are 
trying to develop and evaluate theories, i.e., fundamental and 
general principles that are meant to capture all the particular ways 
that a life could obtain meaning. These theories are standardly 
divided on a metaphysical basis, i.e., in terms of which kinds of 
properties are held to constitute the meaning. Supernaturalist 
theories are views that meaning in life must be constituted by a 
certain relationship with a spiritual realm. If God or a soul does 
not exist, or if they exist but one fails to have the right 
relationship with them, then supernaturalism—or the Western 
version of it (on which I focus)—entails that one's life is 
meaningless. In contrast, naturalist theories are views that meaning 
can obtain in a world as known solely by science. Here, although 
meaning could accrue from a divine realm, certain ways of living in a
purely physical universe would be sufficient for it. Note that there 
is logical space for a non-naturalist theory that meaning is a 
function of abstract properties that are neither spiritual nor 
physical. However, only scant attention has been paid to this 
possibility in the Anglo-American literature (Williams 1999; Audi 
2005).</p>

<p>

Supernaturalist thinkers in the monotheistic tradition are usefully 
divided into those with God-centered views and soul-centered views. 
The former take some kind of connection with God (understood to be a 
spiritual person who is all-knowing, all-good, and all-powerful and 
who is the ground of the physical universe) to constitute meaning in 
life, even if one lacks a soul (construed as an immortal, spiritual 
substance). The latter deem having a soul and putting it into a 
certain state to be what makes life meaningful, even if God does not 
exist. Of course, many supernaturalists believe that certain 
relationships with God and a soul are jointly necessary and 
sufficient for a significant existence. However, the simpler view is 
common, and often arguments proffered for the more complex view fail 
to support it any more than the simpler view.</p>

<h3><a name="GodCenVie">2.1 God-centered Views</a></h3>

<p>

The most widely held and influential God-based account of meaning in
life is that one's existence is more significant, the better one
fulfills a purpose God has assigned. The familiar idea is that God has
a plan for the universe and that one's life is meaningful to the
degree that one helps God realize this plan, perhaps in the particular
way God wants one to do so (Affolter 2007). Fulfilling God's purpose
by choice is the sole source of meaning, with the existence of an
afterlife not necessary for it (Brown 1971; Levine 1987; Cottingham
2003). If a person failed to do what God intends him to do with his
life, then, on the current view, his life would be meaningless.</p>

<p>

What I call “purpose theorists” differ over what it is
about God's purpose that makes it uniquely able to confer meaning on
human lives. Some argue that God's purpose could be the sole source of
invariant moral rules, where a lack of such would render our lives
nonsensical (Craig 1994; Cottingham 2003). However, Euthyphro problems
arguably plague this rationale; God's purpose for us must be of a
particular sort for our lives to obtain meaning by fulfilling it (as
is often pointed out, serving as food for intergalactic travelers
won't do), which suggests that there is a standard external to God's
purpose that determines what the content of God's purpose ought to be
(but see Cottingham 2005, ch. 3). In addition, some critics argue that
a universally applicable and binding moral code is not necessary for
meaning in life, even if the act of helping others is (Ellin 1995,
327).</p>

<p> 

Other purpose theorists contend that having been created by God for a
reason would be the only way that our lives could avoid being
contingent (Craig 1994; cf. Haber 1997). But it is unclear whether
God's arbitrary will would avoid contingency, or whether his
non-arbitrary will would avoid contingency anymore than a
deterministic physical world. Furthermore, the literature is still
unclear what contingency is and why it is a deep problem. Still other
purpose theorists maintain that our lives would have meaning only
insofar as they were intentionally fashioned by a creator, thereby
obtaining meaning of the sort that an art-object has (Gordon 1983).
Here, though, freely choosing to do any particular thing would not be
necessary for meaning, and everyone's life would have an equal degree
of meaning, which are both counterintuitive implications (see Trisel
2012 for additional criticisms). Are all these objections sound? Is
there a promising reason for thinking that fulfilling God's (as
opposed to any human's) purpose is what constitutes meaning in
life?</p>

<p>

Not only does each of these versions of the purpose theory have
specific problems, but they all face this shared objection: if God
assigned us a purpose, then God would degrade us and thereby undercut
the possibility of us obtaining meaning from fulfilling the purpose
(Baier 1957, 118–20; Murphy 1982, 14–15; Singer 1996,
29). This objection goes back at least to Jean-Paul Sartre (1948, 45),
and there are many replies to it in the literature that have yet to be
assessed (e.g., Hepburn 1965, 271–73; Brown 1971, 20–21;
Davis 1986, 155–56; Hanfling 1987, 45–46; Moreland 1987,
129; Walker 1989; Jacquette 2001, 20–21).</p>

<p>

Robert Nozick presents a God-centered theory that focuses less on God
as purposive and more on God as infinite (Nozick 1981, ch. 6, 
1989, chs. 15–16; see also Cooper 2005). The basic idea is that for a
finite condition to be meaningful, it must obtain its meaning from 
another condition that has meaning. So, if one's life is meaningful, 
it might be so in virtue of being married to a person, who is 
important. And, being finite, the spouse must obtain his or her 
importance from elsewhere, perhaps from the sort of work he or she 
does. And this work must obtain its meaning by being related to 
something else that is meaningful, and so on. A regress on meaningful
finite conditions is present, and the suggestion is that the regress 
can terminate only in something infinite, a being so all-encompassing
that it need not (indeed, cannot) go beyond itself to obtain meaning 
from anything else. And that is God.</p>

<p>

The standard objection to this rationale is that a finite condition
could be meaningful without obtaining its meaning from another
meaningful condition; perhaps it could be meaningful in itself, or
obtain its meaning by being related to something beautiful, autonomous
or otherwise valuable for its own sake but not meaningful (Thomson
2003, 25–26, 48).</p>

<p>

The purpose- and infinity-based rationales are the two most common 
instances of God-centered theory in the literature, and the 
naturalist can point out that they arguably face a common problem: a
purely physical world seems able to do the job for which God is 
purportedly necessary. Nature seems able to ground a universal 
morality and the sort of final value from which meaning might spring.
And other God-based views seem to suffer from this same problem. For 
two examples, some claim that God must exist in order for there to be
a just world, where a world in which the bad do well and the good 
fare poorly would render our lives senseless (Craig 1994; cf. 
Cottingham 2003, pt. 3), and others maintain that God's remembering 
all of us with love is alone what would confer significance on our 
lives (Hartshorne 1984). However, the naturalist 
will point out that an impersonal, Karmic-like force of nature conceivably could justly 
distribute penalties and rewards in the way a retributive personal 
judge would, and that actually living together in loving 
relationships would seem to confer much more meaning on life than a loving
fond remembrance.</p>

<p>

A second problem facing all God-based views is the existence of 
apparent counterexamples. If we think of the stereotypical lives of 
Albert Einstein, Mother Teresa, and Pablo Picasso, they seem 
meaningful even if we suppose there is no all-knowing, all-powerful, 
and all-good spiritual person who is the ground of the physical 
world. Even religiously inclined philosophers find this hard to deny 
(Quinn 2000, 58; Audi 2005), though some of them suggest that a 
supernatural realm is necessary for a “deep” or 
“ultimate” meaning (Nozick 1981, 618; Craig 1994, 42). 
What is the difference between a deep meaning and a shallow one? And 
why think a spiritual realm is necessary for the former?</p>

<p>

At this point, the supernaturalist could usefully step back and
reflect on what it might be about God that would make Him uniquely
able to confer meaning in life, perhaps as follows from the perfect
being theological tradition. For God to be solely responsible for any
significance in our lives, God must have certain qualities that cannot
be found in the natural world, these qualities must be qualitatively
superior to any goods possible in a physical universe, and they must
be what ground meaning in it. Here, the supernaturalist could argue
that meaning depends on the existence of a perfect being, where
perfection requires properties such as atemporality, simplicity, and
immutability that are possible only in a spiritual realm (Metz 2013,
chs. 6–7; cf. Morris 1992; <em>contra</em> Brown 1971 and
Hartshorne 1996). Meaning might come from loving a perfect being or
orienting one's life toward it in other ways such as imitating it or
even fulfilling its purpose, perhaps a purpose tailor-made for each
individual (as per Affolter 2007).</p>

<p>

Although this might be a promising strategy for a God-centered 
theory, it faces a serious dilemma. On the one hand, in order for God
to be the sole source of meaning, God must be utterly unlike us; for 
the more God were like us, the more reason there would be to think we
could obtain meaning from ourselves, absent God. On the other hand, 
the more God is utterly unlike us, the less clear it is how we could 
obtain meaning by relating to Him. How can one love a being that 
cannot change? How can one imitate such a being? Could an immutable, 
atemporal, simple being even have purposes? Could it truly be a 
person? And why think an utterly perfect being is necessary for 
meaning? Why would not a very good but imperfect being confer some 
meaning?</p>

<h3><a name="SouCenVie">2.2 Soul-centered Views</a></h3>

<p>

A soul-centered theory is the view that meaning in life 
comes from relating in a certain way to an immortal, spiritual 
substance that supervenes on one's body when it is alive and that 
will forever outlive its death. If one lacks a soul, or if one has a 
soul but relates to it in the wrong way, then one's life is 
meaningless. There are two prominent arguments for a soul-based 
perspective.</p>

<p>

The first one is often expressed by laypeople and is suggested by the
work of Leo Tolstoy (1884; see also Hanfling 1987, 22–24; Morris 
1992, 26; Craig 1994). Tolstoy argues that for life to be meaningful 
something must be worth doing, that nothing is worth doing if nothing
one does will make a permanent difference to the world, and that 
doing so requires having an immortal, spiritual self. Many of course 
question whether having an infinite effect is necessary for meaning 
(e.g., Schmidtz 2001; Audi 2005, 354–55). Others point out that one 
need not be immortal in order to have an infinite effect (Levine 
1987, 462), for God's eternal remembrance of one's mortal existence 
would be sufficient for that.</p>

<p>

The other major rationale for a soul-based theory of life's meaning 
is that a soul is necessary for perfect justice, which, in turn, is 
necessary for a meaningful life. Life seems nonsensical when the 
wicked flourish and the righteous suffer, at least supposing there is
no other world in which these injustices will be rectified, whether 
by God or by Karma. Something like this argument can be found in the 
Biblical chapter <em>Ecclesiastes</em>, and it continues to be 
defended (Davis 1987; Craig 1994). However, like the previous 
rationale, the inferential structure of this one seems weak; even if 
an afterlife were required for just outcomes, it is not obvious why 
an <em>eternal</em> afterlife should be thought necessary (Perrett 
1986, 220).</p>

<p>

Work has been done to try to make the inferences of these two
arguments stronger, and the basic strategy has been to appeal to the
value of perfection (Metz 2013, ch. 7). Perhaps the Tolstoian reason
why one must live forever in order to make the relevant permanent
difference is an agent-relative need for one to honor an infinite
value, something qualitatively higher than the worth of, say,
pleasure. And maybe the reason why immortality is required in order to
mete out just deserts is that rewarding the virtuous requires
satisfying their highest free and informed desires, one of which would
be for eternal flourishing of some kind (Goetz 2012). While far from
obviously sound, these arguments at least provide some reason for
thinking that immortality is necessary to satisfy the major premise
about what is required for meaning.</p>

<p>

However, both arguments are still plagued by a problem facing the
original versions; even if they show that meaning depends on
immortality, they do not yet show that it depends on having
a <em>soul</em>.  By definition, if one has a soul, then one is
immortal, but it is not clearly true that if one is immortal, then one
has a soul. Perhaps being able to upload one's consciousness into an
infinite succession of different bodies in an everlasting universe
would count as an instance of immortality without a soul. Such a
possibility would not require an individual to have an immortal
spiritual substance (imagine that when in between bodies, the
information constitutive of one's consciousness were temporarily
stored in a computer). What reason is there to think that one must
have a soul in particular for life to be significant?</p>

<p>

The most promising reason seems to be one that takes us beyond the 
simple version of soul-centered theory to the more complex view that 
both God and a soul constitute meaning. The best justification for 
thinking that one must have a soul in order for one's life to be 
significant seems to be that significance comes from uniting with God
in a spiritual realm such as Heaven, a view espoused by Thomas 
Aquinas, Leo Tolstoy (1884), and contemporary religious thinkers 
(e.g., Craig 1994). Another possibility is that meaning comes from 
honoring what is divine within oneself, i.e., a soul (Swenson 1949).</p>

<p>

As with God-based views, naturalist critics offer counterexamples to
the claim that a soul or immortality of any kind is necessary for
meaning. Great works, whether they be moral, aesthetic, or
intellectual, would seem to confer meaning on one's life regardless of
whether one will live forever. Critics maintain that soul-centered
theorists are seeking too high a standard for appraising the meaning
of people's lives (Baier 1957, 124–29; Baier 1997,
chs. 4–5; Trisel 2002; Trisel 2004). Appeals to a soul require
perfection, whether it be, as above, a perfect object to honor, a
perfectly just reward to enjoy, or a perfect being with which to
commune. However, if indeed soul-centered theory ultimately relies on
claims about meaning turning on perfection, such a view is attractive
at least for being simple, and rival views have yet to specify in a
principled and thoroughly defended way where to draw the line at less
than perfection (perhaps a start is Metz 2013, ch. 8). What less than
ideal amount of value is sufficient for a life to count as
meaningful?</p>

<p>

Critics of soul-based views maintain not merely that immortality is
not necessary for meaning in life, but also that it is sufficient for
a meaningless life. One influential argument is that an immortal life,
whether spiritual or physical, could not avoid becoming boring,
rendering life pointless (Williams 1973; Ellin 1995, 311–12;
Belshaw 2005, 82–91; Smuts 2011). The most common reply is that
immortality need not get boring (Fischer 1994; Wisnewski 2005;
Bortolotti and Nagasawa 2009; Chappell 2009; Quigley and Harris 2009,
75–78). However, it might also be worth questioning whether
boredom is truly sufficient for meaninglessness. Suppose, for
instance, that one volunteers to be bored so that many others will not
be bored; perhaps this would be a meaningful sacrifice to make.</p>

<p>

Another argument that being immortal would be sufficient to make our
lives insignificant is that persons who cannot die could not exhibit
certain virtues (Nussbaum 1989; Kass 2001). For instance, they could
not promote justice of any important sort, be benevolent to any
significant degree, or exhibit courage of any kind that matters, since
life and death issues would not be at stake. Critics reply that even
if these virtues would not be possible, there are other virtues that
could be.  And of course it is not obvious that meaning-conferring
justice, benevolence and courage would not be possible if we were
immortal, perhaps if we were not always aware that we could not die or
if our indestructible souls could still be harmed by virtue of intense
pain, frustrated ends, and repetitive lives.</p>

<p>

There are other, related arguments maintaining that awareness of
immortality would have the effect of removing meaning from life, say,
because our lives would lack a sense of preciousness and urgency
(Lenman 1995; Kass 2001; James 2009) or because external rather than
internal factors would then dictate their course (Wollheim 1984,
266). Note that the target here is <em>belief</em> in an eternal
afterlife, and not immortality itself, and so I merely mention these
rationales (for additional, revealing criticism, see Bortolotti
2010).</p>

<h2><a name="Nat">3. Naturalism</a></h2>

<p>

I now address views that even if there is no spiritual realm, meaning
in life is possible, at least for many people. Among those who believe
that a significant existence can be had in a purely physical world as
known by science, there is debate about two things: the extent to
which the human mind constitutes meaning and whether there are
conditions of meaning that are invariant among human beings.</p>

<p> 

Subjectivists believe that there are no invariant standards of meaning
because meaning is relative to the subject, i.e., depends on an
individual's pro-attitudes such as desires, ends, and choices.
Roughly, something is meaningful for a person if she believes it to be
or seeks it out. Objectivists maintain, in contrast, that there are
some invariant standards for meaning because meaning is (at least
partly) mind-independent, i.e., is a real property that exists
regardless of being the object of anyone's mental states. Here,
something is meaningful (to some degree) in virtue of its intrinsic
nature, independent of whether it is believed to be meaningful or
sought.</p>

<p>
 
There is logical space for an intersubjective theory according to
which there are invariant standards of meaning for human beings that
are constituted by what they would all agree upon from a certain
communal standpoint (Darwall 1983, chs. 11–12). However, this
orthogonal approach is not much of a player in the field and so I set
it aside in what follows.</p>

<h3><a name="Sub">3.1 Subjectivism</a></h3>

<p>

According to this view, meaning in life varies from person to person,
depending on each one's variable mental states. Common instances are
views that one's life is more meaningful, the more one gets what one
happens to want strongly, the more one achieves one's highly ranked
goals, or the more one does what one believes to be really important
(Trisel 2002; Hooker 2008; Alexis 2011). Lately, one influential
subjectivist has maintained that the relevant mental state is caring
or loving, so that life is meaningful just to the extent that one
cares about or loves something (Frankfurt 1982, 2002, 2004).</p>

<p>

Subjectivism was dominant for much of the 20<sup>th</sup> century when
pragmatism, positivism, existentialism, noncognitivism, and Humeanism
were quite influential (James 1900; Ayer 1947; Sartre 1948; Barnes
1967; Taylor 1970; Hare 1972; Williams 1976; Klemke 1981).  However,
in the last quarter of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, “reflective
equilibrium” became a widely accepted argumentative procedure,
whereby more controversial normative claims are justified by virtue of
entailing and explaining less controversial normative claims that do
not command universal acceptance. Such a method has been used to
defend the existence of objective value, and, as a result,
subjectivism about meaning has lost its dominance.</p>

<p>

Those who continue to hold subjectivism often are suspicious of attempts
to justify beliefs about objective value (e.g., Frankfurt 2002, 250; 
Trisel 2002, 73, 79, 2004, 378–79). Theorists are primarily 
moved to accept subjectivism because the alternatives are 
unpalatable; they are sure that value in general and meaning in 
particular exists, but do not see how it could be grounded in 
something independent of the mind, whether it be the natural, the 
non-natural, or the supernatural. In contrast to these possibilities,
it appears straightforward to account for what is meaningful in terms
of what people find meaningful or what people want out of life. 
Wide-ranging meta-ethical debates in epistemology, metaphysics, and 
the philosophy of language are necessary to address this rationale 
for subjectivism.</p>

<p>

There are two other, more circumscribed arguments for subjectivism. 
One is that subjectivism is plausible since it is reasonable to think
that a meaningful life is an authentic one (Frankfurt 1982). If a 
person's life is significant insofar as she is true to herself or her
deepest nature, then we have some reason to believe that meaning 
simply is a function of satisfying certain desires held by the 
individual or realizing certain ends of hers. Another argument is 
that meaning intuitively comes from losing oneself, i.e., in becoming
absorbed in an activity or experience (Frankfurt 1982). Work that 
concentrates the mind and relationships that are engrossing seem 
central to meaning and to be so because of the subjective element 
involved, that is, because of the concentration and engrossment.</p>

<p>
 
However, critics maintain that both of these arguments are vulnerable
to a common objection: they neglect the role of objective value both
in realizing oneself and in losing oneself (Taylor 1992, esp. ch. 4).
One is not really being true to oneself if one intentionally harms
others (Dahl 1987, 12), successfully maintains 3,732 hairs on one's
head (Taylor 1992, 36), or, well, eats one's own excrement (Wielenberg
2005, 22), and one is also not losing oneself in a meaning-conferring
way if one is consumed by these activities. There seem to be certain
actions, relationships, states, and experiences that one ought to
concentrate on or be engrossed in, if meaning is to accrue.</p>

<p>

So says the objectivist, but many subjectivists also feel the pull of
the point. Paralleling replies in the literature on well-being,
subjectivists often respond by contending that no or very few
individuals would desire to do such intuitively trivial things, at
least after a certain idealized process of reflection (e.g., Griffin
1981). More promising, perhaps, is the attempt to ground value not in
the responses of an individual valuer, but in those of a particular
group (Brogaard and Smith 2005; Wong 2008). Would such an
intersubjective move avoid the counterexamples? If so, would it do so
more plausibly than an objective theory?</p>

<h3><a name="Obj">3.2 Objectivism</a></h3>

<p>

Objective naturalists believe that meaning is constituted (at least in part) by 
something physical independent of the mind about which we can have 
correct or incorrect beliefs. Obtaining the object of some variable 
pro-attitude is not sufficient for meaning, on this view. Instead, 
there are certain inherently worthwhile or finally valuable 
conditions that confer meaning for anyone, neither merely because 
they are wanted, chosen, or believed to be meaningful, nor because 
they somehow are grounded in God.</p>

<p>

Morality and creativity are widely held instances of actions that
confer meaning on life, while trimming toenails and eating snow (and
the other counterexamples to subjectivism above) are not. Objectivism
is thought to be the best explanation for these respective kinds of
judgments: the former are actions that are meaningful regardless of
whether any arbitrary agent (whether it be an individual,her society,
or even God) judges them to be meaningful or seeks to engage in them,
while the latter actions simply lack significance and cannot obtain it
if someone believes them to have it or engages in them. To obtain
meaning in one's life, one ought to pursue the former actions and
avoid the latter ones. Of course, meta-ethical debates about the
nature of value are again relevant here.</p>

<p>

A “pure” objectivist thinks that being the object of a
person's mental states plays no role in making that person's life
meaningful. Relatively few objectivists are pure, so construed. That
is, a large majority of them believe that a life is more meaningful
not merely because of objective factors, but also in part because of
subjective ones such as cognition, affection, and emotion. Most
commonly held is the hybrid view captured by Susan Wolf's pithy
slogan: “Meaning arises when subjective attraction meets
objective attractiveness” (Wolf 1997a, 211; see also Hepburn
1965; Kekes 1986, 2000; Wiggins 1988; Wolf 1997b, 2002, 2010; Dworkin
2000, ch.  6; Raz 2001, ch. 1; Schmidtz 2001; Starkey 2006; Mintoff
2008). This theory implies that no meaning accrues to one's life if
one believes in, is satisfied by, or cares about a project that is not
worthwhile, or if one takes up a worthwhile project but fails to judge
it important, be satisfied by it, care about it or otherwise identify
with it. Different versions of this theory will have different
accounts of the appropriate mental states and of worthwhileness.</p>

<p>

Pure objectivists deny that subjective attraction plays any
constitutive role in conferring meaning on life. For instance,
utilitarians with respect to meaning (as opposed to morality) are pure
objectivists, for they claim that certain actions confer meaning on
life regardless of the agent's reactions to them.  On this view, the
more one benefits others, the more meaningful one's life, regardless
of whether one enjoys benefiting them, believes they should be aided,
etc. (Singer 1993, ch. 12, 1995, chs. 10–11; Singer 1996,
ch. 4). Midway between pure objectivism and the hybrid theory is the
view that having certain propositional attitudes toward finally good
activities would enhance the meaning of life without being necessary
for it (Audi 2005, 344). For instance, might a Mother Teresa who is
bored by her substantial charity work have a significant existence
because of it, even if she would have an even more significant
existence if she were excited by it?</p>

<p>

There have been several attempts to theoretically capture what all
objectively attractive, inherently worthwhile, or finally valuable
conditions have in common insofar as they bear on meaning. Some
believe that they can all be captured as actions that are creative
(Taylor 1987), while others maintain that they are exhibit rightness
or virtue and perhaps also involve reward proportionate to morality
(Kant 1791, pt. 2; cf. Pogge 1997). Most objectivists, however, deem
these respective aesthetic and ethical theories to be too narrow, even
if living a moral life is necessary for a meaningful one (Landau
2011). It seems to most in the field not only that creativity and
morality are independent sources of meaning, but also that there are
sources in addition to these two. For just a few examples, consider
making an intellectual discovery, rearing children with love, playing
music, and developing superior athletic ability.</p>

<p>

So, in the literature one finds a variety of principles that aim to 
capture all these and other (apparent) objective grounds of meaning. 
One can read the perfectionist tradition as proffering objective 
theories of what a significant existence is, even if their proponents
do not frequently use contemporary terminology to express this. 
Consider Aristotle's account of the good life for a human being as 
one that fulfills its natural purpose <em>qua</em> rational, Marx's 
vision of a distinctly human history characterized by less alienation
and more autonomy, culture, and community, and Nietzsche's ideal of a
being with a superlative degree of power, creativity, and complexity.</p>

<p>

More recently, some have maintained that objectively meaningful
conditions are just those that involve: transcending the limits of the
self to connect with organic unity (Nozick 1981, ch. 6, 1989,
chs. 15–16); realizing human excellence in oneself (Bond 1983,
chs. 6, 8); maximally promoting non-hedonist goods such as friendship,
beauty, and knowledge (Railton 1984); exercising or promoting rational
nature in exceptional ways (Hurka 1993; Smith 1997, 179–221;
Gewirth 1998, ch. 5); substantially improving the quality of life of
people and animals (Singer 1993, ch. 12, 1995, chs. 10–11;
Singer 1996, ch. 4); overcoming challenges that one recognizes to be
important at one's stage of history (Dworkin 2000, ch. 6);
constituting rewarding experiences in the life of the agent or the
lives of others the agent affects (Audi 2005); making progress toward
ends that in principle can never be completely realized because one's
knowledge of them changes as one approaches them (Levy 2005);
realizing goals that are transcendent for being long-lasting in
duration and broad in scope (Mintoff 2008); or contouring intelligence
toward fundamental conditions of human life (Metz 2013).</p>

<p>

One major test of these theories is whether they capture all
experiences, states, relationships, and actions that intuitively make
life meaningful. The more counterexamples of apparently meaningful
conditions that a principle entails lack meaning, the less justified
the principle. There is as yet no convergence in the field on any one
principle or even cluster as accounting for commonsensical judgments
about meaning to an adequate, convincing degree. Indeed, some believe
the search for such a principle to be pointless (Wolf 1997b,
12–13; Kekes 2000; Schmidtz 2001). Are these pluralists correct,
or does the field have a good chance of discovering a single, basic
property that grounds all the particular ways to acquire meaning in
life?</p>

<p>

Another important way to criticize these theories is more
comprehensive: for all that has been said so far, the objective
theories are aggregative or additive, objectionably reducing life to a
“container” of meaningful conditions (Brännmark 2003,
330). As with the growth of “organic unity” views in the
context of debates about intrinsic value, it is becoming common to
think that life as a whole (or at least long stretches of it) can
substantially affect its meaning apart from the amount of meaning in
its parts.</p>

<p> 

For instance, a life that has lots of 
beneficent and otherwise intuitively meaning-conferring conditions 
but that is also extremely repetitive (à la the movie 
<em>Groundhog Day</em>) is less than maximally meaningful (Taylor
1987). Furthermore, a life that not only avoids repetition but also
ends with a substantial amount of meaningful parts seems to have more
meaning overall than one that has the same amount of meaningful parts
but ends with few or none of them (Kamm 2003, 210–14). And a
life in which its meaningless parts cause its meaningful parts to come
about through a process of personal growth seems meaningful in virtue
of this causal pattern or being a “good life-story”
(Velleman 1991; Fischer 2005).</p>

<p>

Extreme versions of holism are also present in the literature. For
example, some maintain that the only bearer of final value is life as
a whole, which entails that there are strictly speaking no parts or
segments of a life that can be meaningful in themselves (Tabensky
2003; Levinson 2004). For another example, some accept that both parts
of a life and a life as a whole can be independent bearers of meaning,
but maintain that the latter has something like a lexical priority
over the former when it comes to what to pursue or otherwise to prize
(Blumenfeld 2009).</p>

<p>

What are the ultimate bearers of meaning? What are all the
fundamentally different ways (if any) that holism can affect meaning?
Are they all a function of narrativity, life-stories, and artistic
self-expression (as per Kauppinen 2012), or are there holistic facets
of life's meaning that are not a matter of such literary concepts? How
much importance should they be accorded by an agent seeking meaning in
her life?</p>

<h2><a name="Nih">4. Nihilism</a></h2>

<p>

So far, I have addressed theoretical accounts that have been naturally
understood to be about what confers meaning on life, which obviously
assumes that some lives are in fact meaningful. However, there are
nihilistic perspectives that question this assumption. According to
nihilism (or pessimism), what would make a life meaningful either
cannot obtain or as a matter of fact simply never does.</p>

<p>

One straightforward rationale for nihilism is the combination of 
supernaturalism about what makes life meaningful and atheism about 
whether God exists. If you believe that God or a soul is necessary 
for meaning in life, and if you believe that neither exists, then you
are a nihilist, someone who denies that life has meaning. Albert 
Camus is famous for expressing this kind of perspective, suggesting 
that the lack of an afterlife and of a rational, divinely ordered 
universe undercuts the possibility of meaning (Camus 1955; cf. 
<em>Ecclesiastes</em>).</p>

<p>

Interestingly, the most common rationales for nihilism these days do
not appeal to supernaturalism. The idea shared among many contemporary
nihilists is that there is something inherent to the human condition
that prevents meaning from arising, even granting that God exists. For
instance, some nihilists make the Schopenhauerian claim that our lives
lack meaning because we are invariably dissatisfied; either we have
not yet obtained what we seek, or we have obtained it and are bored
(Martin 1993). Critics tend to reply that at least a number of human
lives do have the requisite amount of satisfaction required for
meaning, supposing that some is (Blackburn 2001, 74–77).</p>

<p>

Other nihilists claim that life would be meaningless if there were no
invariant moral rules that could be fully justified—the world
would be nonsensical if, in (allegedly) Dostoyevskian terms,
“everything were permitted”—and that such rules
cannot exist for persons who can always reasonably question a given
claim (Murphy 1982, ch. 1). While a number of philosophers agree that
a universally binding and warranted morality is necessary for meaning
in life (Kant 1791; Tännsjö 1988; Jacquette 2001, ch. 1;
Cottingham 2003, 2005, ch. 3), some do not (Margolis 1990; Ellin 1995,
325–27). Furthermore, contemporary rationalist and realist work
in meta-ethics has led many to believe that such a moral system
exists.</p>

<p>

In the past 10 years, some interesting new defences of nihilism have
arisen that merit careful consideration. According to one rationale,
for our lives to matter, we must in a position to add value to the
world, which we are not since the value of the world is already
infinite (Smith 2003). The key premises for this view are that every
bit of space-time (or at least the stars in the physical universe)
have some positive value, that these values can be added up, and that
space is infinite. If the physical world at present contains an
infinite degree of value, nothing we do can make a difference in terms
of meaning, for infinity plus any amount of value must be
infinity.</p>

<p>

One way to question this argument is to suggest that even if one
cannot add to the value of the universe, meaning plausibly obtains
merely by being the <em>source</em> of value. Consider that one does
not merely want one's child to be reared with love, but wants to be
the one who rears one's child with love. And this desire remains even
knowing that others would have reared one's child with love in one's
absence, so that one's actions are not increasing the goodness of the
state of the universe relative to what it would have had without
them. Similar remarks might apply to cases of meaning more generally
(for additional, and technical, discussion of whether an infinite
universe entails nihilism, see Almeida 2010; Vohánka and
Vohánková n.d.).</p>

<p>

Another fresh argument for nihilism is forthcoming from certain
defenses of anti-natalism, the view that it is immoral to bring new
people into existence because doing so would be a harm to them. There
are now a variety of rationales for anti-natalism, but most relevant
to debates about whether life is meaningful is probably the following
argument from David Benatar (2006, 18–59). According to him, the bads
of existing (e.g., pains) are real disadvantages relative to not
existing, while the goods of existing (pleasures) are not real
advantages relative to not existing, since there is in the latter
state no one to be deprived of them. If indeed the state of not
existing is no worse than that of experiencing the benefits of
existence, then, since existing invariably brings harm in its wake,
existing is always a net harm compared to not existing. Although this
argument is about goods such as pleasures in the first instance, it
seems generalizable to non-experiential goods, including that of
meaning in life.</p>

<p> 

The criticisms of Benatar that promise to cut most deep are those that
question his rationale for the above judgments of good and bad. He
maintains that these appraisals best explain, e.g., why it would be
wrong for one to create someone whom one knows would suffer a
torturous existence, and why it would not be wrong for one not to
create someone whom one knows would enjoy a wonderful existence. The
former would be wrong and the latter would not be wrong, for Benatar,
because no pain in non-existence is better than pain in existence, and
because no pleasure in non-existence is no worse than pleasure in
existence. Critics usually grant the judgments of wrongness, but
provide explanations of them that do not invoke Benatar's judgments of
good and bad that apparently lead to anti-natalism (e.g., Boonin 2012;
Weinberg 2012).</p>

<p>

This survey closes by discussing the most well-known rationale for
nihilism, namely, Thomas Nagel's (1986) invocation of the external
standpoint that purportedly reveals our lives to be unimportant (see
also Hanfling 1987, 22–24; Benatar 2006, 60–92;
cf. Dworkin 2000, ch. 6). According to Nagel, we are capable of
comprehending the world from a variety of standpoints that are either
internal or external. The most internal perspective would be a
particular human being's desire at a given instant, with a somewhat
less internal perspective being one's interests over a life-time, and
an even less internal perspective being the interests of one's family
or community. In contrast, the most external perspective, an
encompassing standpoint utterly independent of one's particularity,
would be, to use Henry Sidgwick's phrase, the “point of view of
the universe,” that is, the standpoint that considers the
interests of all sentient beings at all times and in all places. When
one takes up this most external standpoint and views one's
finite—and even downright puny—impact on the world, little
of one's life appears to matter. What one does in a certain society on
Earth over an approximately 75 years just does not amount to much,
when considering the billions of years and likely trillions of beings
that are a part of space-time.</p>

<p>

Very few accept the authority of the (most) external standpoint (Ellin
1995, 316–17; Blackburn 2001, 79–80; Schmidtz 2001) or the
implications that Nagel believes it has for the meaning of our lives
(Quinn 2000, 65–66; Singer 1993, 333–34; Wolf 1997b,
19–21). However, the field could use much more discussion of
this rationale, given its persistence in human thought. It is
plausible to think, with Nagel, that part of what it is to be a person
is to be able to take up an external standpoint. However, what
precisely is a standpoint? Must we invariably adopt one standpoint or
the other, or is it possible not to take one up at all? Is there a
reliable way to ascertain which standpoint is normatively more
authoritative than others? These and the other questions posed in this
survey still lack conclusive answers, another respect in which the
field of life's meaning is tantalizingly open for substantial
contributions.</p>
