<p>

Friedrich Nietzsche (1844–1900) was a German philosopher of the late
19th century who challenged the foundations of Christianity and
traditional morality. He was interested in the enhancement of
individual and cultural health, and believed in life, creativity,
power, and down-to-earth realities, rather than those
situated in a world beyond. Central to his philosophy is the idea of
“life-affirmation,” which involves an honest questioning of
all doctrines that drain life’s expansive energies, however socially
prevalent those views might be. Often referred to as one of the first
existentialist philosophers along with Søren Kierkegaard
(1813–1855), Nietzsche’s revitalizing philosophy has inspired leading
figures in all walks of cultural life, including dancers, poets,
novelists, painters, psychologists, philosophers, sociologists and
social revolutionaries.</p>

<h2 id="Life1844">1. Life: 1844–1900</h2>

<p>

In the small German village of Röcken bei Lützen, located in
a rural farmland area southwest of Leipzig, Friedrich Wilhelm
Nietzsche was born at approximately 10:00 a.m. on October 15,
1844. The date coincided with the 49th birthday of the Prussian King,
Friedrich Wilhelm IV, after whom Nietzsche was named, and who had been
responsible for Nietzsche’s father’s appointment as
Röcken’s town minister.</p>

<p>

Nietzsche’s uncle and grandfathers were also Lutheran ministers, and
his paternal grandfather, Friedrich August Ludwig Nietzsche
(1756–1826), was further distinguished as a Protestant scholar, one of
whose books (1796) affirmed the “everlasting survival of
Christianity.” Nietzsche’s grandparents on both sides were from
the Province of Saxony, with his paternal grandfather, paternal
grandmother (Erdmuthe Dorothea Krause, 1778–1856), maternal grandfather
(David Ernst Ohler, 1787–1859) and maternal grandmother (Johanna
Elisabeth Wilhelmine Hahn, 1794–1876) having been born respectively in
the small towns of Bibra (just south of Jena), Reichenbach (southeast
of Jena), Zeitz (between Jena and Leipzig), and Wehlitz (just northwest
of Leipzig).</p>

<p>

When Nietzsche was nearly 5 years old, his father, Karl Ludwig
Nietzsche (1813–1849) died from a brain ailment (July 30, 1849) and the
death of Nietzsche’s two-year-old brother, Ludwig Joseph, traumatically
followed six months later (January 4, 1850). Having been living only
yards away from Röcken’s church in the house reserved for the
pastor and his family, the Nietzsche family left their home soon after
Karl Ludwig’s death. They moved to nearby Naumburg an der Saale, where
Nietzsche (called “Fritz” by his family) lived with his
mother, Franziska (1826–1897), his grandmother, Erdmuthe, his father’s
two sisters, Auguste and Rosalie (d. 1855 and 1867, respectively), and
his younger sister, Therese Elisabeth Alexandra (1846–1935).</p>

<p>

From the ages of 14 to 19 (1858–1864), Nietzsche attended a
first-rate boarding school, Schulpforta, located about 4km from his
home in Naumburg, where he prepared for university studies. The
school’s rigid educational atmosphere was reflected in its long
history as a former Cistercian monastery (1137–1540), with
buildings that included a 12th century Romanesque chapel and a 13th
century Gothic church. At Schulpforta—a school whose alumni
included the German Idealist philosopher, Johann Gottlieb Fichte
(1762–1814) and the philologist, Ulrich von
Wilamowitz-Möllendorff (1848–1931)—Nietzsche met his
lifelong friend, Paul Deussen (1845–1919), who was confirmed at
Nietzsche’s side in 1861, and who was to become an Orientalist,
historian of philosophy, and in 1911, the founder of the Schopenhauer
Society. During his summers in Naumburg, Nietzsche led a small music
and literature club named “Germania,” and became
acquainted with Richard Wagner’s music through the club’s
subscription to the <em>Zeitschrift für Musik.</em> The teenage
Nietzsche also read the German romantic writings of Friedrich
Hölderlin and Jean-Paul Richter, along with David Strauss’s
controversial and demythologizing <em>Life of Jesus Critically
Examined</em> (<em>Das Leben Jesu kritisch bearbeitet</em>, 1848).</p>

<p>

After graduating from Schulpforta, Nietzsche entered the University
of Bonn in 1864 as a theology and philology student, and his interests
soon gravitated more exclusively towards philology—a discipline
which then centered upon the interpretation of classical and biblical
texts. As a student of philology, Nietzsche attended lectures by Otto
Jahn (1813–1869) and Friedrich Wilhelm Ritschl (1806–1876). Jahn was a
biographer of Mozart who had studied at the University of Berlin under
Karl Lachmann (1793–1851)—a philologist known both for his
studies of the Roman philosopher, Lucretius (ca. 99–55 BCE), and for
having developed the genealogical, or stemmatic, method in textual
recension; Ritschl was a classics scholar whose work centered on the
Roman comic poet, Plautus (254–184 BCE).</p>

<p>

Inspired by Ritschl, and following him to the University of Leipzig
in 1865—an institution located closer to Nietzsche’s hometown
of Naumburg—Nietzsche quickly established his own academic
reputation through his published essays on two 6th century BCE poets,
Theognis and Simonides, as well as on Aristotle. In Leipzig, he
developed a close friendship with Erwin Rohde (1845–1898), a fellow
philology student and future philologist, with whom he would correspond
extensively in later years. Momentous for Nietzsche in 1865 was his
accidental discovery of Arthur Schopenhauer’s <em>The World as Will and
Representation</em> (1818) in a local bookstore. He was then 21.
Schopenhauer’s atheistic and turbulent vision of the world, in
conjunction with his high praise of music as an art form, captured
Nietzsche’s imagination, and the extent to which the “cadaverous
perfume” of Schopenhauer’s world-view continued to permeate
Nietzsche’s mature thought remains a matter of scholarly debate. After
discovering Schopenhauer, Nietzsche read F.A. Lange’s newly-published
<em>History of Materialism and Critique of its Present
Significance</em> (1866)—a work that criticizes materialist
theories from the standpoint of Kant’s critique of metaphysics, and
that attracted Nietzsche’s interest for its view that metaphysical
speculation is an expression of poetic illusion.</p>

<p>

In 1867, as he approached the age of 23, Nietzsche entered his
required military service and was assigned to an equestrian field
artillery regiment close to Naumburg, during which time he lived at
home with his mother. While attempting to leap-mount into the saddle,
he suffered a serious chest injury and was put on sick leave after his
chest wound refused to heal. He returned shortly thereafter to the
University of Leipzig, and in November of 1868, met the composer
Richard Wagner (1813–1883) at the home of Hermann Brockhaus
(1806–1877), an Orientalist who was married to Wagner’s sister,
Ottilie. Brockhaus was himself a specialist in Sanskrit and Persian
whose publications included (1850) an edition of the <em>Vendidad
Sade</em>—a text of the Zoroastrian religion, whose prophet was
Zarathustra (Zoroaster).</p>

<p>
Wagner and Nietzsche shared an enthusiasm for Schopenhauer, and
Nietzsche—who had been composing piano, choral and orchestral
music since he was a teenager—admired Wagner for his musical
genius, magnetic personality and cultural influence. Wagner was the
same age Nietzsche’s father would have been, and he had also
attended the University of Leipzig many years before. The
Nietzsche-Wagner relationship was quasi-familial and sometimes-stormy,
and it affected Nietzsche deeply.  Early on, he could write (in 1869)
that his friendship with Wagner was the “greatest
achievement” [<em>die größte Errungenschaft</em>] of
his life, and he was still energetically engaged in appraising and
pondering Wagner’s cultural significance twenty years later at
the end of his writing life.  But Nietzsche broke with Wagner
personally and intellectually in the late 1870s, and his assessments
became increasingly negative (and more and more explicit) as time went
on.  Nevertheless, even after their break, Nietzsche was still
reminiscing wistfully in 1882 about how his days with Wagner had been
the best of his life.  During the months surrounding Nietzsche’s
initial meeting with Wagner, Ritschl recommended Nietzsche for a
position on the classical philology faculty at the University of
Basel. The Swiss university offered Nietzsche the professorial
position, and he began teaching there in May, 1869, at the age of 24.
</p>
 

<p>

At Basel, Nietzsche’s satisfaction with his life among his philology
colleagues was limited, and he established closer intellectual ties to
the historians Franz Overbeck (1837–1905) and Jacob Burkhardt
(1818–1897), whose lectures he attended. Overbeck—who roomed
for five years in the same house as Nietzsche—became
Nietzsche’s close and enduring friend, exchanging many letters with him
over the years, and rushing to Nietzsche’s assistance in Turin
immediately after his devastating collapse in 1889. Nietzsche also
cultivated his friendship with Richard Wagner and visited him often at
his Swiss home in Tribschen, a small town near Lucerne. Never in
outstanding health, further complications arose from Nietzsche’s
August-October 1870 service as a 25-year-old hospital attendant during
the Franco-Prussian War (1870–71), where he participated in the siege
of Metz. He witnessed the traumatic effects of battle, took close care
of wounded soldiers, and contracted diphtheria and dysentery.</p>

<p>

Nietzsche’s enthusiasm for Schopenhauer, his studies in classical
philology, his inspiration from Wagner, his reading of Lange, his
interests in health, his professional need to prove himself as a young
academic, and his frustration with the contemporary German culture, all
coalesced in his first book—<em>The Birth of Tragedy</em>
(1872)—which was published in January 1872 when Nietzsche was
27. Wagner showered the book with praise, but a vitriolic,
painfully-memorable and yet authoritative critical reaction by Ulrich
von Wilamowitz-Möllendorff—who later became one of Germany’s leading philologists—immediately
dampened the book’s reception, not to mention Nietzsche’s class
enrollments in Basel.</p>

<p>

Wilamowitz-Möllendorff came from an aristocratic family
of distant Polish descent and knew Nietzsche as a student at Schulpforta. In his critique, he referred to Nietzsche as a disgrace to
Schulpforta, and said that in light of the latter’s prophetic,
soothsaying, exaggerated and historically uninformed style of writing,
Nietzsche should instead “gather tigers and panthers about his knees,
but not the youth of Germany.” It is intriguing that in <em>Thus Spoke
Zarathustra</em>, written thirteen years later, Nietzsche invokes the
comparable imagery of a lion nuzzling warmly at the knees of
Zarathustra in the book’s concluding and inspirational scene, as if to
acknowledge that his proper audience is, indeed, not a set of
university professors.</p>

<p>

As Nietzsche continued his residence in Switzerland between 1872 and
1879, he often visited Wagner at his new (1872) home in Bayreuth,
Germany. In 1873, he met Paul Rée (1849–1901), who, while living
in close company with Nietzsche in Sorrento during the autumn of 1876,
would write <em>On the Origin of Moral Feelings</em> (1877). During
this time, Nietzsche completed a series of four studies on contemporary
German culture—the <em>Unfashionable Observations</em>
(1873–76)—which focus respectively upon (1) the historian of
religion and culture critic, David Strauss, (2) issues concerning the
social value of historiography, (3) Arthur Schopenhauer and (4) Richard
Wagner, both as heroic inspirations for new cultural standards.</p>

<p>

Near the end of his university career, Nietzsche completed
<em>Human, All-Too-Human</em> (1878)—a book that marks a
turning point in his philosophical style and that, while reinforcing
his friendship with Rée, also ends his friendship with the
anti-Semitic Wagner, who comes under attack in a thinly-disguised
characterization of “the artist.” Despite the damage done
by the unflattering review of <em>The Birth of Tragedy</em>, Nietzsche
remained respected in his professorial position in Basel, but his
deteriorating health, which led to migraine headaches, eyesight
problems and vomiting, necessitated his resignation from the university
in June, 1879, at age 34. At this point, he had been a university
professor for ten years, and had just less than another ten years of
productive intellectual life remaining.</p>

<p>

From 1880 until his collapse in January 1889, Nietzsche led a
wandering, gypsy-like existence as a stateless person (having given up
his German citizenship, and not having acquired Swiss citizenship),
circling almost annually between his mother’s house in Naumburg and
various French, Swiss, German and Italian cities. His travels took him
through the Mediterranean seaside city of Nice (during the winters),
the Swiss alpine village of Sils-Maria (during the summers, located
near the present-day ski resort of St. Moritz), Leipzig (where he had
attended university, and had been hoping to resume his teaching career
in 1883), Turin, Genoa, Recoaro, Messina, Rapallo, Florence, Venice,
and Rome, never residing in any place longer than several months at a
time.</p>

<p>

On a visit to Rome in 1882, Nietzsche, now at age thirty-seven, met
Lou von Salomé (1861–1937), a 21 year old Russian woman
who was studying philosophy and theology in Zurich. He quickly fell in
love with her. Declining to develop her relationship with
Nietzsche on a romantic level, Nietzsche’s friendship
with her and Paul Rée took a turn for the worse, for Salomé and Rée left Nietzsche and moved to Berlin. In
the years to follow, Salomé would become an associate of
Sigmund Freud, and would write with psychological insight of her
association with Nietzsche.  Salomé also shows some real insight into Nietzsche’s works, and was one of the first to propose the division of Nietzsche’s writings into early, middle, and late periods.</p>
  
<p>

These nomadic years were the occasion of Nietzsche’s main works,
among which are <em>Daybreak</em> (1881), <em>The Gay Science</em>
(1882/1887), <em>Thus Spoke Zarathustra</em> (1883–85), <em>Beyond Good
and Evil</em> (1886), and <em>On the Genealogy of Morals</em> (1887).
Nietzsche’s final active year, 1888, saw the completion of <em>The Case
of Wagner</em> (May-August 1888), <em>Twilight of the Idols</em>
(August-September 1888), <em>The Antichrist</em> (September 1888),
<em>Ecce Homo</em> (October-November 1888) and <em>Nietzsche Contra
Wagner</em> (December 1888).</p>

<p>

On the morning of January 3, 1889, while in Turin, Nietzsche
experienced a mental breakdown which left him an invalid for the rest
of his life. Coincidentally, on virtually the same date, viz., January
4, his little brother, Joseph, had died many years before. Nietzsche,
upon witnessing a horse being whipped by a coachman at the Piazza Carlo
Alberto—although this episode with the horse could be 
anecdotal—threw his arms around the horse’s neck and collapsed in the
plaza, never to return to full sanity.</p>

<p>

Some argue that Nietzsche was afflicted with a syphilitic infection
(this was the original diagnosis of the doctors in Basel and Jena)
contracted either while he was a student or while he was serving as a
hospital attendant during the Franco-Prussian War; some claim that his
use of chloral hydrate, a drug which he had been using as a sedative,
undermined his already-weakened nervous system; some speculate that
Nietzsche’s collapse was due to a brain disease he inherited from his
father; some maintain that a mental illness gradually drove him insane;
some maintain that he suffered from a slow-growing, frontal cranial
base tumor; some maintain that he suffered from CADASIL syndrome, a
hereditary stroke disorder; some maintain that Nietzsche suffered from a tumor on the surface of the brain growing behind his right eye. The exact cause of Nietzsche’s incapacitation remains unclear. That he had an extraordinarily sensitive nervous constitution and took an assortment of medications is
well-documented as a more general fact. To complicate matters of
interpretation, Nietzsche states in a letter from April 1888 that he
never had any symptoms of a mental disorder.</p>

<p>

During his creative years, Nietzsche struggled to bring his writings
into print and never doubted that his books would have a lasting
cultural effect. He did not live long enough to experience his
world-historical influence, but he had a brief glimpse of his growing
intellectual importance in discovering that he was the subject of 1888
lectures given by Georg Brandes (Georg Morris Cohen) at the University
of Copenhagen, to whom he directed the above April 1888 correspondence,
and from whom he received a recommendation to read Kierkegaard’s works.
Nietzsche’s collapse, however, followed soon thereafter.</p>

<p>

After a brief hospitalization in Basel, he spent 1889 in a
sanatorium in Jena at the Binswanger Clinic, and in March 1890 his
mother took him back home to Naumburg, where he lived under her care
for the next seven years in the house he knew as a youngster. After his
mother’s death in 1897, his sister Elisabeth—having returned
home from Paraguay in 1893, where she had been working since 1886 with
her husband Bernhard Förster to establish an Aryan, anti-Semitic
German colony called “New Germany” (“Nueva
Germania”)—assumed responsibility for Nietzsche’s
welfare. In an effort to promote her brother’s philosophy, she rented
the “Villa Silberblick,” a large house in Weimar, and moved
both Nietzsche and his collected manuscripts to the residence. This
became the new home of the Nietzsche Archives (which had been located
at the family home for the three years preceding), where Elisabeth
received visitors who wanted to observe the now-incapacitated
philosopher.</p>

<p>

On August 25, 1900, Nietzsche died in the villa as he approached his
56th year, apparently of pneumonia in combination with a stroke. His
body was then transported to the family gravesite directly beside the
church in Röcken bei Lützen, where his mother and sister now
also rest. The Villa Silberblick was eventually turned into a museum,
and since 1950, Nietzsche’s manuscripts have been located in Weimar at
the <em>Goethe- und Schiller-Archiv</em></p>

<h2 id="EarlWrit1872">2. Early Writings: 1872–1876</h2>

<p>

Nietzsche’s first book was published in 1872 and was entitled
<em>The Birth of Tragedy, Out of the Spirit of Music</em> (<em>Die
Geburt der Tragödie aus dem Geiste der Musik</em>). Overall, it sets forth a more energetic alternative to the late
18th/early 19th century understanding of Greek culture—an
understanding largely inspired by Johann Winckelmann’s <em>History of
Ancient Art</em> (1764)—which, grounded on the aesthetics of
classical sculpture, hailed ancient Greece as the epitome of noble
simplicity, calm grandeur, clear blue skies, and rational serenity. In
1886, Nietzsche’s book was reissued with a revised title, <em>The Birth
of Tragedy, Or: Hellenism and Pessimism</em> (<em>Die Geburt der
Tragödie, Oder: Griechentum und Pessimismus</em>), along with a
lucid and revealing prefatory essay—“An Attempt at
Self-Criticism”—which expresses Nietzsche’s own critical
reflections on the book, looking back fourteen years. Although he remained proud of the work, Nietzsche also describes it as questionable, strange and almost inaccessible, filled with Kantian
and Schopenhauerian formulas that were inherently at odds with the new
valuations he was trying to express.</p>

<p>

Having by this time absorbed the Schopenhauerian view that non-rational forces reside at
the foundation of all creativity and of reality itself, and that these forces are artistically best conveyed in music, Nietzsche identifies a
strongly instinctual, wild, amoral, “Dionysian” energy
within pre-Socratic Greek culture as an essentially creative and
healthy force, locating its prime expression in the tragic chorus, and constituting the very life of the tragedy. Surveying the history of Western culture since the time
of the Greeks, Nietzsche laments over how this Dionysian, creative
energy had been submerged and weakened as it became overshadowed by the
“Apollonian” forces of logical order and stiff sobriety. He
concludes that European culture since the time of Socrates has remained
one-sidedly Apollonian, repressed, scientific, and relatively unhealthy.</p>

<p>

As a means towards a cultural rebirth, Nietzsche advocates in contemporary life, the resurrection
and fuller release of Dionysian artistic energies—those which
he associates with primordial creativity, joy in existence and ultimate
truth. The seeds of this liberating rebirth Nietzsche perceives in the German music of his time (viz., Bach, Beethoven and
especially Wagner), and the concluding part of <em>The Birth of
Tragedy</em>, in effect, adulates the emerging German artistic, tragic
spirit as the potential savior of European culture. As one of his early
books, <em>The Birth of Tragedy</em> has a strong Schopenhauerian flavor, and scholars disagree about the extent to which
Nietzsche departs from Schopenhauer in this work and in
later works.</p>

<p>

Some regard Nietzsche’s 1873 unpublished essay, “On Truth and
Lies in a Nonmoral Sense” (“<em>Über Wahrheit und
Lüge im außermoralischen Sinn</em>”) as a keystone in
his thought; some believe that it is a peripheral, conflicted and
non-representative fragment in his writings. In this essay, Nietzsche
rejects the idea of universal constants, and claims, presumably as a
truth, that what we call “truth” is only “a mobile
army of metaphors, metonyms, and anthropomorphisms.” His view at
this time is that arbitrariness prevails within human experience:
concepts originate via the transformation of nerve stimuli into images,
and “truth” is nothing more than the invention of fixed
conventions for practical purposes, especially those of repose,
security and consistency. Nietzsche regards our “knowledge” as human, all-too-human, mostly a matter of self-deception that issues from a deep-seated exercise of metaphorical thought. Viewing our existence from a vast and
sobering distance, Nietzsche further notes that there was an eternity
before human beings came into existence, and believes that after
humanity dies out, nothing significant will have changed in the great
scheme of things.</p>

<p>

Between 1873 and 1876, Nietzsche wrote the <em>Unfashionable
Observations</em> (<em>Unzeitgemässe Betrachtungen</em>, also translated as <em>Untimely Meditations</em> or <em>Thoughts Out of Season</em>). These
are four (of a projected, but never completed, thirteen) studies
concerned with the quality of European, and especially German, culture
during Nietzsche’s time. They are unfashionable and nonconformist (or
“untimely,” or “unmodern,” or “out of place”) insofar as Nietzsche
regarded his standpoint as culture-critic to be in tension with the
self-congratulatory spirit of the times. The four studies were:
<em>David Strauss, the Confessor and the Writer</em> (<em>David
Strauss, der Bekenner und der Schriftsteller</em>, 1873); <em>On the
Uses and Disadvantages of History for Life</em> (<em>Vom Nutzen und
Nachteil der Historie für das Leben</em>, 1874); <em>Schopenhauer
as Educator</em> (<em>Schopenhauer als Erzieher</em>, 1874);
<em>Richard Wagner in Bayreuth</em> (1876).</p>

<p>

The first of these attacks David Strauss, whose popular six-edition
book, <em>The Old and the New Faith: A Confession</em> (1871)
encapsulated for Nietzsche the general cultural atmosphere in Germany.
Responding to Strauss’s advocacy of a “new faith” grounded
upon a scientifically-determined universal mechanism—one,
however, lubricated by the optimistic, “soothing oil” of
historical progress—Nietzsche criticizes Strauss’s view as a
vulgar and dismal sign of cultural degeneracy. Nietzsche’s friend,
Overbeck, in his contemporaneous writings, also adopted a critical
attitude towards Strauss. The second “untimely meditation”
surveys alternative ways to write history, and discusses how these ways
could contribute to a society’s health. Here Nietzsche claims that the
principle of “life” is a more pressing and higher concern
than that of “knowledge,” and that the quest for knowledge
should serve the interests of life. This parallels how, in <em>The
Birth of Tragedy</em>, Nietzsche had looked at art through the perspective
of life.</p>

<p> 
The third and fourth studies—on Schopenhauer and Wagner,
respectively—address how these two thinkers, as paradigms of
philosophic and artistic genius, hold the potential to inspire a
stronger, healthier and livelier German culture. Nietzsche states here
that we all have a duty to help nature complete its goal of producing
the highest examples of the human being—these will be the
“new redeemers”—which he recognizes in superb
instances of the philosopher, the artist and the saint
(“Schopenhauer as Educator,” Section 5).  These
celebratory studies on Schopenhauer and Wagner reveal how, as a
recurring feature of Nietzsche’s thought, he presents us with some
higher type of character—he offers different models of heroic
characters as the years go by—as an ideal towards which he
would have his best readers aspire.</p>

<h2 id="MiddPeriWrit1878">3. Middle-Period Writings: 1878–1882</h2>

<p>

Nietzsche completed <em>Human, All-Too-Human</em> in 1878,
supplementing this with a second part in 1879, <em>Mixed Opinions and
Maxims</em> (<em>Vermischte Meinungen und Sprüche</em>), and a
third part in 1880, <em>The Wanderer and his Shadow</em> (<em>Der
Wanderer und sein Schatten</em>). The three parts were published
together in 1886 as <em>Human All-Too-Human, A Book for Free
Spirits</em> (<em>Menschliches, Allzumenschliches, Ein Buch für
freie Geister</em>). Reluctant to construct a philosophical
“system,” and sensitive to the importance of style in
philosophic writing, Nietzsche composed these works as a series of
several hundred short passages and aphorisms—concise condensations of his assorted insights—whose typical length ranges from a line or
two to a page or two. Here, he often reflects upon cultural and
psychological phenomena by connecting them to individuals’ organic and
physiological constitutions. The idea of power (for which he would
later become known) sporadically appears as an explanatory principle,
but Nietzsche tends at this time to invoke hedonistic considerations of
pleasure and pain in his explanations of cultural and psychological
phenomena. Given his harsh criticisms of hedonism and
utilitarianism in later works (e.g., <em>Thus Spoke Zarathustra</em>,
re: “the Last Man”), <em>Human All-Too-Human</em> appears to many
readers as an uncharacteristic work, more science- than art-inspired in
its approach to health, where Nietzsche was struggling to break free of
Wagner’s spell, and which, presupposing a fundamentally hedonistic moral psychology, does not fully embody the
pain-and-power-centered approach that he later developed.</p>

<p>

In <em>Daybreak: Reflections on Moral Prejudices</em>
(<em>Morgenröte. Gedanken über die moralischen
Vorurteile</em>, 1881), Nietzsche continues writing in his aphoristic
style, but he marks a new beginning by accentuating as opposed to
pleasure, the importance of the “feeling of power” in his
understanding of human, and especially of so-called “moral”
behavior. Always having been interested in the nature of health, his
emerging references to power stem from his earlier efforts to discover
the secret of the ancient Greeks’ outstanding health, which he had
regarded as the effects of how “<em>agon</em>” (i.e.,
competition, one-upmanship, or contest, as conceived in his 1872 essay,
“Homer’s Contest”) permeated their cultural attitudes. In
this respect, <em>Daybreak</em> contains the seeds of Nietzsche’s
doctrine of the “will to power”—a doctrine that
appears explicitly for the first time two years later in <em>Thus Spoke
Zarathustra</em> (1883–85). <em>Daybreak</em> is also one of
Nietzsche’s clearest, intellectually calmest, and most intimate,
volumes, providing many social-psychological insights in conjunction
with some of his first sustained critical reflections on the cultural
relativity at the basis of Christian moral evaluations. In this 
book—as he remarks retrospectively in <em>Ecce Homo</em> 
(1888)—Nietzsche begins his “crusade [<em>Feldzug</em>] against morality.”</p>

<p>

In a more well-known aphoristic work, <em>The Gay Science</em>
(<em>Die fröhliche Wissenschaft</em>, 1882)—whose title
was inspired by the troubadour songs of southern-French Provence
(1100–1300)—Nietzsche sets forth some of the existential ideas
for which he became famous, namely, the proclamation that “God is
dead” and the doctrine of eternal recurrence—a doctrine
that attends to how people of different levels of health are likely to
react to the prospect of being reborn, over and over again, to replay
life’s experience exactly as before in every pleasurable and painful
sequence of detail. Nietzsche’s atheism—his account of
“God’s murder” (section 125)—expresses in a literary manner, his philosophical condemnation of all absolute perspectives and values. His atheism also
aims to redirect people’s attention to their inherent freedom, the
presently-existing world, and away from escapist, pain-relieving,
heavenly otherworlds.</p>

<p>

To a similar end, Nietzsche’s doctrine of eternal recurrence
(sections 285 and 341) serves to draw attention away from all worlds
other than the one in which we presently live, since eternal recurrence
precludes the possibility of any final escape from the present world.
The doctrine also functions as a measure for judging someone’s overall
psychological strength and mental health, since Nietzsche believed that
the doctrine of eternal recurrence was the hardest world-view to
affirm. There are some differences of scholarly opinion concerning
whether Nietzsche primarily intends this doctrine to describe a serious
metaphysical theory, or whether he is offering merely one way to
interpret the world among many others, which if adopted therapeutically
as a psychologically healthy myth, can help us become stronger.</p>

<p>

In 1887, <em>The Gay Science</em> was reissued with an important
preface, an additional fifth Book, and an appendix of songs,
reminiscent of the troubadours.</p>

<h2 id="LatePeriWrit1883">4. Later-Period Writings: 1883–1887</h2>

<p>

<em>Thus Spoke Zarathustra, A Book for All and None</em> (<em>Also
Sprach Zarathustra, Ein Buch für Alle und Keinen</em>, 1883–85),
is one of Nietzsche’s most famous works, and Nietzsche regarded it as
among his most significant. It is a manifesto of personal
self-overcoming, and a guidebook for others towards the same
revitalizing end. Thirty years after its initial publication, 150,000
copies of the work were printed by the German government and issued as
inspirational reading, along with the Bible, to the young soldiers
during WWI. Though <em>Thus Spoke Zarathustra</em> is antagonistic to
the Judeo-Christian world-view, its poetic and prophetic style relies
upon many, often inverted, Old and New Testament allusions. Nietzsche
also filled the work with nature metaphors, almost in the spirit of
pre-Socratic naturalist philosophy, which invoke animals, earth, air,
fire, water, celestial bodies, plants, all in the service of describing
the spiritual development of Zarathustra, a solitary, reflective,
exceedingly strong-willed, sage-like, laughing and dancing voice of
heroic self-mastery who, accompanied by a proud, sharp-eyed eagle and a
wise snake, envisions a mode of psychologically healthier being beyond
the common human condition. Nietzsche refers to this higher mode of
being as “superhuman” (<em>übermenschlich</em>), and
associates the doctrine of eternal recurrence—a doctrine for
only the healthiest who can love life in its entirety—with this
spiritual standpoint, in relation to which all-too-often downhearted,
all-too-commonly-human attitudes stand as a mere bridge to be crossed
and overcome.</p>

<p>

Within Nietzsche’s corpus, <em>Thus Spoke Zarathustra</em> has a
controversial place, owing mainly to its peculiar literary style.
Nietzsche speaks in parables and short narratives populated by
fictional characters—“the hunchback,” “the ugliest man,” “the
soothsayer,” “the saint,” “the tightrope walker,” “the jester,” and
“the Last Man,” to name a few—leaving their philosophical import open to a variety of interpretations. One of Nietzsche’s most
well-known and morally troubling figures—the 
superhuman—also appears substantially only in this work, rendering it questionable
to some interpreters whether this ideal of supreme human health is indeed central to Nietzsche’s thought as a whole. There is also some interpretive uncertainty about whether the work, which was written across the span of three years, properly ends triumphantly at the conclusion of the Third Part, thus situating the psychologically
complex Fourth Part as a question-raising supplement, or whether the
book’s narrative moves smoothly and progressively across the entire
four parts.</p>

<p>

<em>Beyond Good and Evil, Prelude to a Philosophy of the Future</em>
(<em>Jenseits von Gut und Böse. Vorspiel einer Philosophie der
Zukunft</em>, 1886) is arguably a rethinking of <em>Human,
All-too-Human</em>, since their respective tables of contents and
sequence of themes loosely correspond to one another. In <em>Beyond
Good and Evil</em>, Nietzsche identifies imagination, self-assertion,
danger, originality and the “creation of values” as
qualities of genuine philosophers, as opposed to mere scholars engaged in positive research in the sciences and humanities, or the dusty classification of philosophical outlooks. Nietzsche takes aim at some of the world’s great philosophers, who ground their outlooks wholeheartedly upon concepts such as “self-consciousness,” “free
will,” and “either/or” bipolar thinking.</p>

<p>

Nietzsche alternatively philosophizes from the perspective of life
located beyond good and evil, and challenges the entrenched moral idea
that exploitation, domination, injury to the weak, destruction and
appropriation are universally objectionable behaviors. Above all, he
believes that living things aim to discharge their strength and express
their “will to power”—a pouring-out of expansive
energy as if one were like a perpetually-shining sun that, quite
naturally, can entail danger, pain, lies, deception and masks. Here,
“will” is not an inner emptiness, lack, feeling of deficiency, or
constant drive for satisfaction, but is a fountain of
constantly-swelling energy, or power.</p>

<p>

As he views things from the perspective of life, Nietzsche further
denies that there is a universal morality applicable indiscriminately
to all human beings, and instead designates a series of moralities in
an order of rank that ascends from the plebeian to the noble: some
moralities are more suitable for subordinate roles; some are more
appropriate for dominating and leading social roles. What counts as a
preferable and legitimate action depends upon the kind of person one
is. The deciding factor is whether one is weaker, sicker and on the
decline, or whether one is healthier, more powerful and overflowing
with life.</p>

<p>

<em>On the Genealogy of Morals, A Polemic</em> (<em>Zur Genealogie
der Moral, Eine Streitschrift</em>, 1887) is composed of three
sustained essays that advance the critique of Christianity expressed in
<em>Beyond Good and Evil</em>. The first essay continues the discussion
of master morality versus servant morality, and maintains that the
traditional ideals set forth as holy and morally good within Christian
morality are products of self-deception, since they were forged in the
bad air of revenge, resentment, hatred, impotence, and cowardice. In
this essay, as well as the next, Nietzsche’s controversial references
to the “blond beast” in connection with master morality
also appear. In the second essay, Nietzsche continues with an account
of how feelings of guilt, or the “bad conscience,” arise
merely as a consequence of an unhealthy Christian morality that turns
an evil eye towards our natural inclinations. He also discusses how
punishment, conceived as the infliction of pain upon someone in
proportion to their offense, is likely to have been grounded in the
contractual economic relationship between creditor and debtor, i.e., in
business relationships. In the third essay, Nietzsche focusses upon the
truth-oriented ascetic ideals that underlie and inform prevailing
styles of art, religion and philosophy, and he offers a particularly
scathing critique of the priesthood: the priests are allegedly a group
of weak people who shepherd even weaker people as a way to experience
power for themselves. The third essay also contains one of Nietzsche’s
clearest expressions of “perspectivism” (section 
12)—the idea that there is no absolute, “God’s eye”
standpoint from which one can survey everything that is.</p>

<p>

<em>On the Genealogy of Morals</em> is Nietzsche’s “polemic,” i.e.,
attack, against the assumptions and methods (which, incidentally, are
still popular) characteristic of works such as Paul Rée’s
<em>The Origin of the Moral Sensations</em> (1877). Inspired by
utilitarianism and Darwinism, Rée offers a naturalistic account
of our moral values, especially altruism, but by Nietzsche’s lights,
does not question the value of the moral values themselves. In the
<em>Genealogy</em>, Nietzsche offers a competing account of the origin
of moral values, aiming to reveal their life-negating foundations and
functions.</p>

<p>

Nietzsche ultimately advocates valuations that issue from a
self-confident, self-reinforcing, self-governing, creative and
commanding attitude, as opposed to those that issue from reactive
attitudes that determine values more mechanically and subordinatingly to those who are inherently more powerful. For Nietzsche,
those who prefer to think in terms of “good vs. bad” exemplify the
former, leading and superior mentality, and those who think in terms of
“good vs. evil,” exemplify the latter, inferior and subservient
mentality. From the standpoint of a leader, in the appropriate circumstances it is good to be able to inflict pain and instil fear among those who are led, and bad not to be able to do so.  From the standpoint of those who are led, the infliction of pain and instillation of fear upon subordinates does not appear typically to be good at all, but rather evil.</p>

<h2 id="FinaWrit1888">5. Final Writings of 1888</h2>

<p>

<em>The Case of Wagner, A Musician’s Problem</em> (<em>Der Fall
Wagner, Ein Musikanten-Problem</em>, May-August 1888), contrasts
sharply with Nietzsche’s laudatory portrayal of Wagner in <em>The
Birth of Tragedy</em> (1872), and compares well with his 1873 meditation on
David Strauss in its unbridled attack on a popular cultural figure. In
<em>The Case of Wagner</em>, Nietzsche “declares war” upon
Richard Wagner, whose music is characterized as the epitome of modern
cultural achievement, but also crucially as sick and decadent. The work
is a brilliant display of Nietzsche’s talents as a music critic, and
includes memorable ridicule of Wagner’s theatrical style, reflections
on redemption via art, a “physiology of art,” and discussion of the
virtues associated, respectively, with ascending and descending life
energies. As the therapeutic inversion and antithesis of Wagner’s
debilitatingly serious music, Nietzsche refers us to Georges Bizet
(1838–1875) whose music he finds cheerful, revitalizing, redeeming and
light-hearted. Wagner himself had some years earlier (1850) condemned
Felix Mendelssohn (1809–1847) for having confounded the public’s taste
in music. Nietzsche, writing almost thirty years later, here accuses
Wagner of having done the same.</p>

<p>

The title, <em>Twilight of the Idols, or How One Philosophizes with
a Hammer</em> (<em>Götzen-Dämmerung, oder Wie man mit dem
Hammer philosophiert</em>, August-September 1888), word-plays upon
Wagner’s opera, <em>The Twilight of the Gods</em> (<em>Die
Götterdämmerung</em>). Nietzsche reiterates and elaborates
some of the criticisms of Socrates, Plato, Kant and Christianity found
in earlier works, criticizes the then-contemporary German culture as
being unsophisticated and too-full of beer, and shoots some
disapproving arrows at key French, British, and Italian cultural
figures such as Rousseau, Hugo, Sand, Michelet, Zola, Renan, Carlyle,
Mill, Eliot, Darwin, and Dante. In contrast to these alleged
representatives of cultural decadence, Nietzsche applauds Caesar,
Napoleon, Goethe, Dostoevski, Thucydides and the Sophists as healthier
and stronger types. The phrase “to philosophize with a
hammer” primarily signifies a way to test idols by tapping on
them lightly; one “sounds them out” to determine whether
they are hollow, or intact, etc., as physician would use a percussion
hammer upon the abdomen as a diagnostic instrument.</p>

<p>

In <em>The Antichrist, Curse on Christianity</em> (<em>Der
Antichrist. Fluch auf das Christentum</em>, September 1888 [published
1895]), Nietzsche expresses his disgust over the way noble values in
Roman Society were corrupted by the rise of Christianity, and he
discusses specific aspects and personages in Christian 
culture—the Gospels, Paul, the martyrs, priests, the crusades—with a
view towards showing that Christianity is a religion for weak and
unhealthy people, whose general historical effect has been to undermine
the healthy qualities of the more noble cultures. <em>The
Antichrist</em> was initially conceived of as the first part of a
projected four-part work for which Nietzsche had in mind the title,
<em>Revaluation of All Values</em> (the second part was to be entitled,
“The Free Spirit”). As in most of his 1888 works, Nietzsche criticizes,
either implicitly or explicitly, the anti-Semitic writers of his day. In
this particular study, one of his main targets is the French,
anti-Semitic, Christian historian, Ernest Renan (1823–1892), who was
known for works such as <em>The Life of Jesus</em> (1863) and
<em>History of the Origins of Christianity</em> (1866–1881), the fourth
book of which was entitled <em>The Antichrist</em> (1873). Some
interpret Nietzsche’s title for his book as meaning, “the
Antichristian.” It should be noted that in an 1883 letter to his
friend, Peter Gast [Johann Heinrich Köselitz], Nietzsche does
describe himself self-entertainingly as “the Antichrist,” and also more
seriously as “the most terrible opponent of Christianity.”</p>

<p>

Nietzsche describes himself as “a follower of the philosopher
Dionysus” in <em>Ecce Homo, How One Becomes What One Is</em>
(<em>Ecce Homo, Wie man wird, was man ist</em>, October-November 
1888)—a book in which he examines retrospectively his entire corpus,
work by work, offering critical remarks, details of how the works were
inspired, and explanatory observations regarding their philosophical
contents. He begins this fateful intellectual autobiography—he
was to lose his mind little more than a month later—with three
eyebrow-raising sections entitled, “Why I Am So Wise,”
“Why I Am So Clever,” and “Why I Write Such Good
Books.” Nietzsche claims to be wise as a consequence of his acute
aesthetic sensitivity to nuances of health and sickness in people’s
attitudes and characters; he claims to be clever because he knows how
to choose the right nutrition, climate, residence and recreation for
himself; he claims to write such good books because they allegedly
adventurously open up, at least for a very select group of readers, a
new series of noble and delicate experiences. After examining each of
his published works, Nietzsche concludes <em>Ecce Homo</em> with the
section, “Why I Am a Destiny.” He claims that he is a
destiny because he regards his anti-moral truths as having the
annihilating power of intellectual dynamite; he expects them to topple
the morality born of sickness which he perceives to have been reigning
within Western culture for the last two thousand years. In this way, he
expresses his hope that Dionysus, the god of life’s exuberance, would
replace Jesus, the god of the heavenly otherworld, as the premier
cultural standard for future millennia.</p>

<p>

Although <em>Ecce Homo</em> stands historically as Nietzsche’s final
autobiographical statement, if we consider that—although the
plans were in flux—Nietzsche was embarking on a new work, at
one point to be entitled, <em>Revaluation of All Values</em>, his 1888
autobiographical excursion can be appreciated as a kind of
house-cleaning and summing-up of where he had intellectually arrived at
that point. Rather than being a final self-definition, it can be seen
as yet another among Nietzsche’s several efforts over the years to
clear the way for a freer intellectual development or metamorphosis. In
this respect, it compares to <em>Thus Spoke Zarathustra</em>, Book IV,
which appears to be Nietzsche’s squarely facing, almost as a kind of
exorcism, the variety of inner characters that constituted his
personality. Along the same lines, <em>Ecce Homo</em> recalls the
interval between <em>Human-All-too-Human</em> and <em>Daybreak</em>,
when Nietzsche plunged to a very low point in his health, coming close
to death, and then dramatically recuperated.</p>

<p>

<em>Nietzsche Contra Wagner, Out of the Files of a Psychologist</em>
(<em>Nietzsche contra Wagner, Aktenstücke eines Psychologen</em>,
December 1888) is a short, but classic, selection of passages Nietzsche
extracted from his 1878–1887 published works. Many concern Wagner, but
the excerpts serve mostly as a foil for Nietzsche to express his own
views against Wagner’s. In this self-portrait, completed only a month
before his collapse, Nietzsche characterizes his own anti-Christian
sentiments, and contemplates how even the greatest people usually
undergo significant corruption. In Wagner’s case, Nietzsche claims that
the corrupting force was Christianity. One cannot help remembering here
how, using the same kind of rationale, Wagner claimed that Felix
Mendelssohn’s corrupting force was Judaism. At the same time, Nietzsche
describes how he truly admired some of Wagner’s music for its profound
expressions of loneliness and suffering—expressions which
Nietzsche admitted were psychologically impossible for he himself to
articulate.</p>

<p>

The writings of Nietzsche’s final active year are peppered with some
wild phrasings, but they remain lucid and philosophically penetrating
on the whole. Given the utter loss of Nietzsche’s intellectual
capacities upon his collapse, this prior lucidity is puzzling. The
abruptness of his breakdown in combination with the lucidity of his
final writings has fed speculation that rather than suffering from a
slowly progressive mental disease, Nietzsche had a physical condition
(e.g., a brain tumor) whose silent growth eventually reached a critical
mass that caused his mental composure to snap.</p>

<h2 id="NietUnpuNote">6. Nietzsche’s Unpublished Notebooks</h2>

<p>

Nietzsche’s unpublished writings often reveal his more tentative and
speculative ideas. This material is surrounded by controversy, since
some of it conflicts with views he expresses in his published works.
Disagreement regarding Nietzsche’s notebooks, also known as his
<em>Nachlass</em>, centers around the degree of interpretive priority
which ought to be given to the unpublished versus the published
writings. One popular approach in the tradition of classical
scholarly interpretation is to maintain that Nietzsche’s published
works express his more considered and polished views, and that these
should take precedence over the unpublished manuscripts when conflicts
arise; a second attitude, given voice by Martin Heidegger (who lectured
on Nietzsche in Nazi Germany, 1936–1940), and broadly consistent with a
psychoanalytic approach as well, is to regard what Nietzsche published
as representative of what he decided was publicly presentable, and what
he kept privately to himself in unpublished form as containing his more
authentic views; a third, more comprehensive, interpretive style tries
to grasp all of Nietzsche’s texts together in an effort to form the
most coherent interpretation of Nietzsche’s thought, judging the
priority of published versus unpublished works on a thematic, or
case-by-case basis; a fourth position influenced by the French
deconstructionist perspective maintains that any rigid prioritizing
between published and private works is impossible, since all of the
texts embody a comparable multidimensionality of meaning.</p>

<p>

In his unpublished manuscripts, Nietzsche sometimes elaborates the
topics found in the published works, such as his early 1870s
notebooks, where there is important material concerning his theory of
knowledge. In the 1880s notebooks—those from which his sister
collected together a large selection after his death under the
title, <em>The Will to Power: Attempt at a Revaluation of all
Values</em>—Nietzsche sometimes adopts a more metaphysical
orientation towards the doctrines of Eternal Recurrence and the Will
to Power, speculating upon their structure, implications, and
intellectual strength as interpretations of reality
itself. Side-by-side with these speculations, and complicating efforts
towards developing an interpretation which is both comprehensive and
coherent, Nietzsche’s 1880s notebooks also repeatedly state that
“there are no facts, only interpretations.”</p>

<h2 id="NietInflUpon20thCentThou">7. Nietzsche’s Influence Upon 20th Century Thought</h2>

<p>

Nietzsche’s thought extended a deep influence during the 20th
century, especially in Continental Europe. In English-speaking
countries, his positive reception has been less resonant. During the
last decade of Nietzsche’s life and the first decade of the 20th
century, his thought was particularly attractive to avant-garde artists
who saw themselves on the periphery of established social fashion and
practice. Here, Nietzsche’s advocacy of new, healthy beginnings, and of
creative artistry in general stood forth. His tendency to seek
explanations for commonly-accepted values and outlooks in the
less-elevated realms of sheer animal instinct was also crucial to
Sigmund Freud’s development of psychoanalysis. Later, during the
1930s, aspects of Nietzsche’s thought were espoused by the Nazis and
Italian Fascists, partly due to the encouragement of Elisabeth
Förster-Nietzsche through her associations with Adolf Hitler and
Benito Mussolini. It was possible for the Nazi interpreters to
assemble, quite selectively, various passages from Nietzsche’s writings
whose juxtaposition appeared to justify war, aggression and domination
for the sake of nationalistic and racial self-glorification.</p>

<p>

Until the 1960s in France, Nietzsche appealed mainly to writers and
artists, since the academic philosophical climate was dominated by
G.W.F. Hegel’s, Edmund Husserl’s and Martin Heidegger’s thought, along
with the structuralist movement of the 1950s. Nietzsche became
especially influential in French philosophical circles during the
1960s–1980s, when his “God is dead” declaration, his
perspectivism, and his emphasis upon power as the real motivator and
explanation for people’s actions revealed new ways to challenge
established authority and launch effective social critique. In the
English-speaking world, Nietzsche’s unfortunate association with the
Nazis kept him from serious philosophical consideration until the
1950s and 60s, when landmark works such as Walter Kaufmann’s,
<em>Nietzsche: Philosopher, Psychologist, Antichrist</em> (1950) and
Arthur C. Danto’s, <em>Nietzsche as Philosopher</em> (1965), paved the
way for a more open-minded discussion.</p>

<p>

Specific 20th century figures who were influenced, either quite
substantially, or in a significant part, by Nietzsche include painters,
dancers, musicians, playwrights, poets, novelists, psychologists,
sociologists, literary theorists, historians, and philosophers: Alfred
Adler, Georges Bataille, Martin Buber, Albert Camus, E.M. Cioran,
Jacques Derrida, Gilles Deleuze, Isadora Duncan, Michel Foucault,
Sigmund Freud, Stefan George, André Gide, Hermann Hesse, Carl
Jung, Martin Heidegger, Gustav Mahler, André Malraux, Thomas
Mann, H.L. Mencken, Rainer Maria Rilke, Jean-Paul Sartre, Max Scheler,
Giovanni Segantini, George Bernard Shaw, Lev Shestov, Georg Simmel,
Oswald Spengler, Richard Strauss, Paul Tillich, Ferdinand Tönnies,
Mary Wigman, William Butler Yeats and Stefan Zweig.</p>

<p>

That Nietzsche was able to write so prolifically and profoundly for
years, while remaining in a condition of ill-health and often intense
physical pain, is a testament to his spectacular mental capacities and
willpower. Lesser people under the same physical pressures might not
have had the inclination to pick up a pen, let alone think and record
thoughts which—created in the midst of striving for healthy
self-overcoming—would have the power to influence an entire
century.</p>
