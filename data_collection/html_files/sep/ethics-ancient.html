While moral theory does not invent morality, or even reflection on
it, it does try to bring systematic thinking to bear on the phenomenon.
Ancient moral theory, however, does not attempt to be a comprehensive
account of all the phenomena that fall under the heading of morality.
Rather, assuming piecemeal opinions and practices, it tries to capture
its underlying essence. It is the nature of such an enterprise to
evaluate and criticize some of these opinions and practices but that is
not its primary goal. Ancient moral theory tries to provide a
reflective account of an essential human activity so one can grasp what
is of fundamental importance in pursuing it. In historical order, the
theories to be considered in this article are those of Socrates as
presented in certain dialogues of Plato; Plato in the
<em>Republic</em>; Aristotle; the Cynics; Cyrenaic hedonism; Epicurus;
the Stoics; and Pyrrhonian skepticism.</p>

<h2><a name="1">1. Introduction</a></h2>

<p>

In their moral theories, the ancient philosophers depended on
several important notions. These include virtue and the virtues,
happiness (<em>eudaimonia</em>), and the soul. We can begin with
virtue.</p>

<p>

Virtue is a general term that translates the Greek word
<em>aretê</em>. Sometimes <em>aretê</em> is also translated
as excellence. Many objects, natural or artificial, have their
particular <em>aretê</em> or kind of excellence. There is the
excellence of a horse and the excellence of a knife. Then, of course,
there is human excellence. Conceptions of human excellence include such
disparate figures as the Homeric warrior chieftain and the Athenian
statesman of the period of its imperial expansion. Plato's character
Meno sums up one important strain of thought when he says that
excellence for a man is managing the business of the city so that he
benefits his friends, harms his enemies, and comes to no harm himself
(<em>Meno</em> 71e). From this description we can see that some
versions of human excellence have a problematic relation to the moral
virtues.</p>

<p>

In the ancient world, courage, moderation, and justice were prime
species of moral virtue. A virtue is a settled disposition to act in a
certain way; justice, for instance, is the settled disposition to act,
let's say, so that each one receives their due. This settled
disposition includes a practical knowledge about how to bring it about,
in each situation, that each receives their due. It also includes a
strong positive attitude toward bringing it about that each receives
their due. Just people, then, are not ones who occasionally act justly,
or even who regularly act justly but do so out of some other motive;
rather they are people who reliably act that way because they place a
positive, high intrinsic value on rendering to each their due and they
are good at it. Courage is a settled disposition that allows one to act
reliably to pursue right ends in fearful situations, because one values
so acting intrinsically. Moderation is the virtue that deals similarly
with one's appetites and emotions.</p>

<p>

Human excellence can be conceived in ways that do not include the
moral virtues. For instance, someone thought of as excellent for
benefiting friends and harming enemies can be cruel, arbitrary,
rapacious, and ravenous of appetite. Most ancient philosophers,
however, argue that human excellence must include the moral virtues and
that the excellent human will be, above all, courageous, moderate, and
just. This argument depends on making a link between the moral virtues
and happiness. While most ancient philosophers hold that happiness is
the proper goal or end of human life, the notion is both simple and
complicated, as Aristotle points out. It seems simple to say everyone
wants to be happy; it is complicated to say what happiness is. We can
approach the problem by discussing, first, the relation of happiness to
human excellence and, then, the relation of human excellence to the
moral virtues.</p>

<p>

It is significant that synonyms for <em>eudaimonia</em> are living
well and doing well. These phrases imply certain activities associated
with human living. Ancient philosophers argued that whatever activities
constitute human living — e.g., those associated with fear
— one can engage in those activities in a mediocre or even a poor
way. One can feel fear and react to dangerous situations sometimes
appropriately and sometimes inappropriately; or one might always act
shamefully and dishonorably. However, to carry out the activities that
constitute human living well over a whole lifetime, or long stretches
of it, is living well or doing well. At this point the relation of
happiness to human excellence should be clear. Human excellence is the
psychological basis for carrying out the activities of a human life
well; to that extent human excellence is also happiness. While the
unhappy person deals with a vital and dynamic emotion like fear in an
inept way, the happy person handles fear skillfully, and thereby
exhibits human excellence.</p>

<p>

So described, human excellence is general and covers many activities
of a human life. However, one can see how human excellence might at
least include the moral virtues. The moral virtue relevant to fear, for
instance, is courage. Courage is a reliable disposition to react to
fear in an appropriate way. What counts as appropriate entails
harnessing fear for good or honorable ends. Such ends are not confined
to one's own welfare but include, e.g., the welfare of one's city. In
this way, moral virtues become the kind of human excellence that is
other-regarding. The moral virtues, then, are excellent qualities of
character — intrinsically valuable for the one who has them; but
they are also valuable for others. In rough outline, we can see one
important way ancient moral theory tries to link happiness to moral
virtue by way of human excellence. Happiness derives from human
excellence; human excellence includes the moral virtues, which are
implicitly or explicitly other-regarding.</p>

<p>

Since happiness plays such a vital role in ancient moral theory, we
should note the difference between the Greek word <em>eudaimonia</em>
and its usual translation as ‘happiness’. Although its
usage varies, most often the English word ‘happiness’
refers to a feeling. For example, we say, “You can tell he feels
happy right now, from the way he looks and how he is behaving.”
The feeling is described as one of contentment or satisfaction, perhaps
with the way one's life as a whole is going. While some think there is
a distinction between feeling happy and feeling content, still
happiness is a good and pleasant feeling. However,
‘happiness’ has a secondary sense that does not focus on
feelings but rather on activities. For instance, one might say,
“It was a happy time in my life; my work was going well.”
The speaker need not be referring to the feelings he or she was
experiencing but just to the fact that some important activity was
going well. Of course, if their work is going well, they might feel
contentment. But in speaking of their happiness, they might just as
well be referring to their absorption in some successful activity. For
ancient philosophers <em>eudaimonia</em> is closer to the secondary
sense of our own term. Happiness means not so much feeling a certain
way, or feeling a certain way about how one's life as a whole is going,
but rather carrying out certain activities or functioning in a certain
way.</p>

<p>

In this way, then, ancient philosophers typically justify moral
virtue. Being courageous, just, and moderate is valuable for the
virtuous person because these virtues are inextricably linked with
happiness. Everyone wants to be happy, so anyone who realizes the link
between virtue and happiness will also want to be virtuous. This
argument depends on two central ideas. First, human excellence is a
good of the soul — not a material or bodily good such as wealth
or political power. Another way to put this idea is to say happiness is
not something external, like wealth or political power, but an
internal, psychological good. The second central idea is that the most
important good of the soul is moral virtue. By being virtuous one
enjoys a psychological state whose value outweighs whatever other kinds
of goods one might have by being vicious.</p>

<p>

Finally, a few words about the soul are in order since, typically,
philosophers argue that virtue is a good of the soul. In some ways,
this claim is found in many traditions. Many thinkers argue that being
moral does not necessarily provide physical beauty, health, or
prosperity. Rather, as something good, virtue must be understood as
belonging to the soul; it is a psychological good. However, in order to
explain virtue as a good of the soul, one does not have to hold that
the soul is immortal. While Plato, for example, holds that the soul is
immortal and that its virtue is a good that transcends death, his
argument for virtue as a psychological good does not depend on the
immortality of the soul. He argues that virtue is a psychological good
in this life. To live a mortal human life with this good is in itself
happiness.</p>

<p>

This position that links happiness and virtue is called eudaimonism
— a word based on the principal Greek word for happiness,
<em>eudaimonia</em>. By eudaimonism, we will mean one of several
theses: (a) virtue, together with its active exercise, is identical
with happiness; (b) virtue, together with its activities, is the most
important and dominant constituent of happiness; (c) virtue is the only
means to happiness. However, one must be cautious not to conclude that
ancient theories in general attempt to construe the value of virtue
simply as a means to achieving happiness. Each theory, as we shall see,
has its own approach to the nature of the link between virtue and
happiness. It would not be advisable to see ancient theories as
concerned with such contemporary issues as whether moral discourse
— i.e., discourse about what one ought to do — can or
should be reduced to non-moral discourse — i.e., to discourse
about what is good for one.</p>

<p>

These reflections on virtue can provide an occasion for contrasting
ancient moral theory and modern. One way to put the contrast is to say
that ancient moral theory is <em>agent-centered</em> while modern moral
theory is <em>action-centered</em>. To say that it is action-centered
means that, as a theory of morality, it explains morality, to begin
with, in terms of actions and their circumstances, and the ways in
which actions are moral or immoral. We can roughly divide modern
thinkers into two groups. Those who judge the morality of an action on
the basis of its known or expected consequences are consequentialist;
those who judge the morality of an action on the basis of its
conformity to certain kinds of laws, prohibitions, or positive
commandments are deontologists. The former include, e.g., those
utilitarians who say an action is moral if it provides the greatest
good for the greatest number. Deontologists say an action is moral if
it conforms to a moral principle, e.g., the obligation to tell the
truth. While these thinkers are not uninterested in the moral
disposition to produce such actions, or in what disposition is required
if they are to show any moral worth in the persons who do them, their
focus is on actions, their consequences, and the rules or other
principles to which they conform. The result of these ways of
approaching morality is that moral assessment falls on actions. This
focus explains, for instance, contemporary fascination with such
questions of casuistry as, e.g., the conditions under which an action
like abortion is morally permitted or immoral.</p>

<p>

By contrast, ancient moral theory explains morality in terms that
focus on the moral agent. These thinkers are interested in what
constitutes, e.g., a just person. They are concerned about the state of
mind and character, the set of values, the attitudes to oneself and to
others, and the conception of one's own place in the common life of a
community that belong to just persons simply insofar as they are just.
A modern might object that this way of proceeding is backwards. Just
actions are logically prior to just persons and must be specifiable in
advance of any account of what it is to be a just person. Of course,
the ancients had a rough idea of what just actions were; and this rough
idea certainly contributed to the notion of a just person, and his
motivation and system of values. Still, the notion of a just person is
not exhausted by an account of the consequences of just actions, or any
principle for determining which actions are and which are not just. For
the ancients, the just person is compared to a craftsman, e.g., a
physician. Acting as a physician is not simply a collection of
medically effective actions. It is knowing when such actions are
appropriate, among other things; and this kind of knowledge is not
always definable. To understand what being a physician means one must
turn to the physician's judgment and even motivation. These are
manifested in particular actions but are not reducible to those
actions. In the same way, what constitutes a just person is not
exhausted by the actions he or she does nor, for that matter, by any
catalogue of possible just actions. Rather, being a just person entails
qualities of character proper to the just person, in the light of which
they decide what actions justice requires of them.</p>

<h2><a name="2">2. Socrates</a></h2>

<p>

In this section we confine ourselves to the character Socrates in
Plato's dialogues, and indeed to only certain ones of the dialogues in
which a Socrates character plays a role. In those dialogues in which he
plays a major role, Socrates varies considerably between two extremes.
On the one hand, there is the Socrates who claims to know nothing about
virtue and confines himself to asking other characters questions; this
Socrates is found in the <em>Apology</em> and in certain dialogues most
of which end inconclusively. These dialogues, e.g., <em>Charmides</em>,
<em>Laches</em>, <em>Crito</em>, <em>Euthydemus</em>, and
<em>Euthyphro</em>, are called aporetic. On the other hand, in other
dialogues we find a Socrates who expounds positive teachings about
virtue; this Socrates usually asks questions only to elicit agreement.
These dialogues are didactic, and conclusive in tone, e.g.,
<em>Republic, Phaedo, Phaedrus,</em> and <em>Philebus</em>. However,
these distinctions between kinds of dialogues and kinds of Socratic
characters are not exclusive; there are dialogues that mix the aporetic
and conclusive styles, e.g., <em>Protagoras, Meno</em>, and
<em>Gorgias</em>. In observing these distinctions, we refer only to the
characteristic style of the dialogue and leave aside controversies
about the relative dates of composition of the dialogues. (See
the entry on
 <a href="../plato/">Plato</a>,
 especially the section on
 <a href="../plato/index.html#Soc">Socrates</a>
 and the section on
 <a href="../plato/index.html#HisSocEarMidLatDia">the historical Socrates</a>.)</p>

<p>

The significance of this distinction among dialogues is that one can
isolate a strain of moral teaching in the aporetic and mixed dialogues.
In spite of their inconclusive nature, in the aporetic dialogues the
character Socrates maintains principles about morality that he seems to
take to be fundamental. In the mixed dialogues we find similar
teaching. This strain is distinct enough from the accounts of morality
in the more didactic dialogues that it has been called Socratic, as
opposed to Platonic, and associated with the historical personage's own
views. In what follows we limit ourselves to this
“Socratic” moral teaching — without taking a position
about the relation of “Socratic” moral teaching to that of
the historical Socrates. For our purposes it is sufficient to point out
a distinction between kinds of moral teaching in the dialogues. We will
focus on the aporetic dialogues as well as the mixed dialogues
<em>Protagoras</em>, <em>Gorgias</em>, and <em>Meno</em>.</p>

<p>

The first feature of Socratic teaching is its heroic quality. In the
<em>Apology</em>, Socrates says that a man worth anything at all does
not reckon whether his course of action endangers his life or threatens
death. He looks only at one thing — whether what he does is just
or not, the work of a good or of a bad man (28b-c). Said in the context
of his trial, this statement is both about himself and a fundamental
claim of his moral teaching. Socrates puts moral considerations above
all others. If we think of justice as, roughly, the way we treat
others, the just actions to which he refers cover a wide range. It is
unjust to rob temples, betray friends, steal, break oaths, commit
adultery, and mistreat parents (<em>Rep</em> 443a-b). A similarly
strong statement about wrong-doing is found in the <em>Crito</em>,
where the question is whether Socrates should save his life by escaping
from the jail in Athens and aborting the sentence of death. Socrates
says that whether he should escape or not must be governed only by
whether it is just or unjust to do so (48d). Obviously, by posing
wrong-doing against losing one's life, Socrates means to emphasize that
nothing outweighs in positive value the disvalue of doing unjust
actions. In such passages, then, Socrates seems to be a moral hero,
willing to sacrifice his very life rather than commit an injustice, and
to recommend such heroism to others.</p>

<p>

However, this heroism also includes an important element of
self-regard. In the passage from the <em>Apology</em> just quoted
Socrates goes on to describe his approach to the citizens of Athens. He
chides them for being absorbed in the acquisition of wealth,
reputation, and honor while they do not take care for nor think about
wisdom, truth, and how to make their souls better (<em>Ap</em>. 29d-e).
As he develops this idea it becomes clear that the perfection of the
soul, making it better, means acquiring and having moral virtue. Rather
than heaping up riches and honor, Athenians should seek to perfect
their souls in virtue. From this exhortation we can conclude that for
Socrates psychological good outweighs material good and that virtue is
a psychological good of the first importance. The <em>Crito</em> gives
another perspective on psychological good. Socrates says (as something
obvious to everyone) that life is not worth living if that which is
harmed by disease and benefited by health — i.e., the body
— is ruined. But likewise, he adds, life is not worth living if
that which is harmed by wrong-doing (<em>to adikon</em>) and benefited
by the right — <em>sc</em>. the soul — is ruined (47e-48a).
We can understand this claim in positive terms. Virtue is the chief
psychological good; wrong-doing destroys virtue. So Socrates' strong
commitment to virtue reflects his belief in its value for the soul, as
well as the importance of the soul's condition for the quality of our
lives.</p>

<p>

A second feature of Socratic teaching is its intellectualism. In the
<em>Meno</em> (78a-b), Socrates argues that no one knowingly desires
what is bad (<em>to kakon</em>). His argument shows that by
‘bad’ he means things that are harmful to the subject,
i.e., the one who would desire these things. In the <em>Protagoras</em>
(358c-d) he makes a similar point when he says that it is not in human
nature for someone to wish to go after what he thinks is bad in place
of the good. Even if we understand good and bad here (as Socrates seems
to intend) to be what is good for the subject and what is bad and
harmful for the subject, the claim is still paradoxical. It seems to be
obvious that humans sometimes desire to have (and wish to go after)
what they know will be harmful. People can all too easily desire and go
after the chocolate that they know is bad for them. Socrates, however,
seems to think that we wish for or desire only what we take to be good
for us. Once one recognizes (i.e., really knows and fully appreciates)
that the chocolate is not good in this way, one will cease to desire
it. There is no residual desire for, e.g., pleasure, that might compete
with the desire for what is good. This position is called
intellectualism because it implies that what ultimately motivates any
action is some cognitive state: if you know what is good you will do
it, and if you do an action, and it is bad, that was because you
thought somehow that it was good. All error in such choices is due to
ignorance.</p>

<p>

Socratic intellectualism has two significant consequences. One is
that virtue (which guarantees good action) is knowledge and the other
is that virtue is sufficient for happiness. Both are elaborated in the
<em>Euthydemus</em>. While most of this dialogue is given over to
Euthydemus' and Dionysiodorus' eristic display, there are two Socratic
interludes. In the first of these — in a passage that has a
parallel in <em>Meno</em> (88a ff) — Socrates helps the young
Cleinias to see that wisdom is a kind of knowledge that infallibly
brings happiness. He uses an analogy with craft
(<em>technê</em>); a carpenter must not only have but know how to
use his tools and materials to be successful (<em>Euthyd</em>. 280b-d).
In turn, someone may have such goods as health, wealth, good birth, and
beauty, as well as the virtues of justice, moderation, courage, and
wisdom (279a-c). Wisdom is the most important, however, because it is a
kind of knowledge, like carpentry, about how to use the other assets so
that they are beneficial (281b-c). Moreover, all of these other
so-called goods are useless — in fact, even harmful —
without wisdom, because without it one will misuse any of the other
assets one may possess, so as to act not well but badly. Wisdom is the
only unconditional good (281d-e). Socrates' argument leaves it
ambiguous whether wisdom (taken together with its exercise) is
identical with happiness or whether it is the dominant and essential
component of happiness (282a-b).</p>

<p>

In this account, the focus is on a kind of knowledge as the active
ingredient in happiness. The other parts of the account are certain
assets that seem as passive in relation to wisdom as wood and tools are
to the carpenter. Further, since there seems to be no opposition to the
work of reason in the soul, Socrates' account seems a bit naive. In
fact, the neglect of the complexities of moral psychology goes hand in
hand with Socratic intellectualism.</p>

<h2><a name="3">3. Plato</a></h2>

<p>

A significant step, then, is taken in Plato's dialogues when the
character Socrates begins to suppose that the soul has desires that are
not always for what is good. Then the complexities of moral psychology
become an important issue in the account of virtue. That development is
found in Plato's mature moral theory.</p>

<p>

It all begins with the challenge to the very notion of morality,
understood along traditional lines, mounted by Callicles in the second
half of the <em>Gorgias</em> and by Thrasymachus in <em>Republic</em> I.
Callicles thinks that moral convention is designed by the numerous weak
people to intimidate the few strong ones, to keep the latter from
taking what they could if they would only use their strength. No truly
strong person should be taken in by such conventions (<em>Gorg.</em>
482e ff). Thrasymachus argues that justice is the advantage of the more
powerful; he holds that justice is a social practice set up by the
powerful, i.e., rulers who require their subjects through that practice
to act against their own individual and group self-interest
(<em>Rep</em>. 338d ff). No sensible person should, and no
strong-willed person would, accept rules of justice as having any
legitimate authority over them. In answer to the latter challenge, in
<em>Republic</em> II, Glaucon and Adeimantus repeatedly urge Socrates
to show what value justice has in itself, apart from its rewards and
reputation. They gloss the intrinsic value of justice as what value it
has in the soul (358b-c), what it does to the soul simply and
immediately by its presence therein. Before giving what will be a new
account of the soul, Socrates introduces his famous comparison between
the soul and the city. As he develops his account of the city, however,
it becomes clear that Socrates is talking about an ideal city, which he
proceeds to construct in his discussion.</p>

<p>

This city has three classes (<em>genê</em>) of citizens.  The
rulers are characterized by their knowledge about and devotion to the
welfare of the city.  The auxiliaries are the warrior class that helps
the rulers. These two are collectively the guardians of the city
(413c-414b; 428c-d). Finally, there are the farmers, artisans, and
merchants — in general those concerned with the production of
material goods necessary for daily life (369b-371e). The importance of
this structure is that it allows Socrates to define virtues of the
city by relations among its parts.  These virtues are justice, wisdom,
courage, and moderation.  For instance, justice in the city is each
one performing that function for which he is suited by nature and not
doing the work that belongs to others (433a-b). One's function, in
turn, is determined by the class to which he belongs.  So rulers
should rule and not amass wealth — the function of the farmers,
artisans, and merchants; if the rulers turn from ruling to
money-making they are unjust.</p>

<p>

To complete the analogy, Socrates gives an account of the soul. He
argues that it has three parts, each corresponding to one of the
classes in the city.  At this point, we should note the difficulty of
talking about parts of the soul.  In the text, we do not find a word
that easily corresponds to the English ‘part.’  Sometimes Socrates
uses ‘form’ (<em>eidos</em>) and ‘kind’ (<em>genê</em>)
(435b-c), other times a periphrasis such as ‘that in the soul that
calculates’ (439d-e).  This warning should keep one from thinking of
the soul as a committee of independent agents.  Perhaps the least
misleading way of thinking about the parts is as functions.  Reason is
the function of calculating, especially about what is good for the
soul.  The appetites for food, drink, and sex are like the producing
class — they are necessary for bodily existence (439c-e). These
two parts are familiar to the modern reader, who will recognize the
psychological capacity for reasoning and calculating, on the one hand,
and the bodily desires, on the other.  Less familiar is the part of
the soul that corresponds to the auxiliaries, the military class. This
is the spirited part (<em>thymos</em> or <em>thymoeides</em>).
Associated with the heart, it is an aggressive drive concerned with
honor.  The spirited part is manifested as anger with those who attack
one's honor.  Perhaps more importantly, it is manifested as anger with
oneself when failing to do what one knows he should do
(439e-440d).</p>

<p>

The primary importance of this account is that it is a moral
psychology, an account of the soul which serves as a basis for
explaining the virtues.  Socrates' account also introduces the idea
that there is conflict in the soul.  For instance, the appetites can
lead one toward pleasure which reason recognizes is not good for the
whole soul. In cases of conflict, Socrates says the spirited part
sides with reason against appetite.  Here we see in rough outline the
chief characters in a well-known moral drama.  Reason knows what is
good both for oneself and in the treatment of others. The appetites,
short-sighted and self-centered, pull in the opposite direction.  The
spirited part is the principle that sides with reason and enforces its
decrees.</p>

<p>

While the opposition between reason and appetite establishes their
distinctness, it has another, more profound consequence.  Most
commentators read this section of the argument as implying that reason
looks out for what is good for the soul while appetite seeks food,
drink, and sex, heedless of their benefit for the soul (437d ff).
Appetite is not corrupt or evil; it is just indifferent to the soul's
welfare.  This subdivision of the soul addresses one of the central
paradoxes of Socratic intellectualism.  Common experience seems to
contradict the claim that if one knows what is good he will do it;
there seem to be obvious instances where someone does what she, in
some sense, knows is not good.  By introducing non-rational elements
in the soul, the argument in the <em>Republic</em> also introduces the
possibility of doing what one holds not to be good, moved, for
instance, by appetite.  This potential gives rise to a separate strain
of thinking about virtue.  While, for Socratic intellectualism, virtue
just is knowledge, in the aftermath of the argument for subdividing
the soul, virtue comes to have two aspects.  The first is to acquire
the knowledge which is the basis of virtue; the second is to instill
in the appetites and emotions--which cannot grasp the knowledge--a
docility so that they react in a compliant way to what reason knows to
be the best thing to do.  Thus,the non-rational parts of the soul
acquire reliable habits on which the moral virtues depend.</p>

<p>Given the complexity of the differences among the parts, we can now understand how their relations to one another define virtue in the soul.  Virtue reduces the potential for conflict to harmony. The master virtue, justice, is each part doing its function and not
interfering with that of another (441d-e; 443d). Since the function of
reason is to exercise forethought for the whole soul, it should rule.
The appetites, which seek only their immediate satisfaction, should
not rule. A soul ruled by appetites is the very picture of
psychological injustice. Still, to fulfill its function of ruling,
reason needs wisdom, the knowledge of what is beneficial for each of
the parts of the soul and for the whole (442c). Moderation is a
harmony among the parts based on agreement that reason should
rule. Courage is the spirited part carrying out the decrees of reason
about what is to be feared (442b-d). Any attentive reader of the
dialogues must feel that Socrates has now given an answer to the
questions that started many of the aporetic dialogues. At this point,
we have the fully developed moral psychology that allows the
definition of the moral virtues. They fall into place around the
tripartite structure of the soul.</p>

<p>

One might object, however, that all Socrates has accomplished is to
define justice and the other virtues as they operate <em>within</em>
the soul. While each part treats the others justly, so to speak, it is
not clear what justice among the parts of someone's soul has to do with
that person treating other people justly. Socrates at first addresses
this issue rather brusquely, saying that someone with a just soul would
not embezzle funds, rob temples, steal, betray friends, break oaths,
commit adultery, neglect parents, nor ignore the gods. The reason for
this is that each part in the soul does its own function in the matter
of ruling and being ruled (443a-b). Socrates does not explain this
connection between psychic harmony and moral virtue. However, if we
assume that injustice is based in overweening appetite or unbridled
anger, then one can see the connection between restrained appetites,
well-governed anger and treating others justly. The man whose sexual
appetite is not governed by reason, e.g., would commit the injustice of
adultery.</p>

<p>

This approach to the virtues by way of moral psychology, in fact,
proves to be remarkably durable in ancient moral theory. In one way or
another, the various schools attempt to explain the virtues in terms of
the soul, although there are, of course, variations in the accounts.
Indeed, we can treat the theory of the <em>Republic</em> as one such
variation. While the account in <em>Republic</em> IV has affinities
with that of Aristotle in <em>Nicomachean</em> <em>Ethics</em>, for
instance, further developments in <em>Republic</em> V-VII make Plato's
overall account altogether unique. It is in these books that the theory
of forms makes its appearance. So peculiar to Plato that anyone else
subscribing to it is called a Platonist, the theory of forms has a
dramatic impact on his moral theory.</p>

<p>

In <em>Republic</em> V, Socrates returns to the issue of political
rule by asking what change in actual cities would bring the ideal city
closer to realization. The famous answer is that philosophers should
rule as kings (473d). Trying to make the scandalous, even ridiculous,
answer more palatable, Socrates immediately begins to explain what he
means by philosophers. They are the ones who can distinguish between
the many beautiful things and the one beautiful itself. The beautiful
itself, the good itself, and the just itself are what he calls forms.
The ability to understand such forms defines the philosopher (476a-c).
Fully elaborated, this extraordinary theory holds that there is a set
of unchanging and unambiguous entities, collectively referred to as
being. These are known directly by reason in a way that is separate
from the use of sensory perception. The objects of sensory perception
are collectively referred to as becoming since they are changing and
ambiguous (508d). This infallible grasp means that one knows what
goodness is, what beauty is, and what justice is. Because only
philosophers have this knowledge — an infallible grasp of
goodness, beauty, and justice — they and only they are fit to be
rulers in the city.</p>

<p>

While moral theory occupies a significant portion of
the <em>Republic</em>, Socrates does not say a lot about its relation
to the epistemology and metaphysics of the central books.  For
instance, one might have expected the account to show how, e.g.,
reason might use knowledge of the forms to govern the other parts of
the soul.  Indeed, in Book VI, Socrates does say that the philosopher
will imitate in his own soul the order and harmony of the forms out of
admiration (500c-d). Since imitation is the heart of the account of
moral education in Books II-III, the idea that one might imitate forms
is intriguing; but it is not developed. Moreover, both virtue in the
soul and contemplating the forms are parts of happiness for the
philosopher (517c-d; 580b-c). So, we should expect an attempt to show
how the two can be integrated. On this second issue, Socrates has more
to say.</p>

<p>

Toward the end of Book IX, Socrates conducts a three-part contest to
show the philosophical, or aristocratic, man is the happiest. In the
second of these contests, he claims that each part of the soul has its
peculiar desire and corresponding pleasure.  Reason, for instance,
desires to learn; satisfying that desire is a pleasure distinct from
the pleasure, e.g., of eating (580d-e). One can now see that the
functions of each of the parts has a new, affective dimension. Then,
in the last of the contests, Socrates makes an ontological distinction
between true pleasure of the soul and less true pleasure of the
body. The former is the pleasure of knowing being, i.e., the forms,
and the latter is the pleasure of filling bodily appetite. The less
true pleasure also give rise to illusions and phantoms of pleasure;
these illusions and phantoms recall the images and shadows in the
allegory of the cave (583b-586c). Clearly, then, distinctions from the
metaphysics and epistemology of the central books are being translated
into distinctions among pleasures. Pleasures of reason are associated
with the world of being while those of the bodily appetites with the
world of becoming. This difference calls for a modification of the
definitions of the virtues from Book IV. For instance, justice in the
soul is modified so that reason pursues the true pleasure of knowing
and the appetites the less true pleasures of the body.  Appetite
commits injustice if it pursues pleasure not proper to it, i.e., if it
pursues bodily pleasures as though they were true pleasures
(586d-587a). The result is an account of virtue which discriminates
among pleasures, as any virtue ethics should; but the criterion of
discrimination reflects the distinction between being and
becoming. Rational pleasures are more real than bodily pleasures,
although bodily pleasures are not negligible. Happiness, then,
integrates the virtue of managing bodily appetites and pleasures in
the world of becoming with the pleasures of learning in the world of
being — but definitely gives greater weight to the latter.</p>

<p>

As with other ancient theories, this account of virtue can be called
eudaimonist. Plato's theory is best represented as holding that virtue,
together with its active exercise, is the most important and the
dominant constituent of happiness (580b-c). One might object that
eudaimonist theories reduce morality to self-interest. We should recall
however that <em>eudaimonia</em> in this theory does not refer
primarily to a feeling. In the <em>Republic</em>, it refers to a state
of the soul, and the active life to which it leads, whose value is
multifaceted. The order and harmony of the soul is, of course, good for
the soul because it provides what is good for each of the parts and the
whole, and so makes the parts function well, for the benefit of each
and of the whole person. In this way, the soul has the best internal
economy, so to speak. Still, we should not overlook the ways in which
order and harmony in the soul are paired with order and harmony in the
city. They are both modeled on the forms. As a consequence, virtue in
the soul is not a private concern oddly joined to the public function
of ruling. Rather, the philosopher who imitates forms in ruling her
soul is equally motivated to imitate forms in ruling the city. So,
insofar as virtue consists in imitating the forms, it is also a state
of the soul best expressed by exercising rule in the city — or at
least in the ideal city. <em>Eudaimonia</em>, then, includes looking
after the welfare of others.</p>

<p>

Indeed, the very nature of Plato's account of virtue and happiness
leaves some aspects of the link between the two unclear. While virtue
is the dominant factor in happiness, we still cannot tell whether for
Plato one can have a reason for being, e.g., courageous that does not
depend directly on happiness. Plato, even though he has forged a strong
link between virtue and happiness, has not addressed such contemporary
issues. In his account, it is still possible that one might be
courageous just for its own sake while at the same time believing
courage is also reliably linked to happiness. In the <em>Republic</em>,
Socrates tries to answer the question what value justice has by itself
in the soul; it does not follow that he is trying to convince Glaucon
and Adeimantus that the value of justice is exhausted by its connection
to one's own happiness.</p>

<h2><a name="4">4. Aristotle</a></h2>

<p>

The moral theory of Aristotle, like that of Plato, focuses on
virtue, recommending the virtuous way of life by its relation to
happiness. His most important ethical work, <em>Nicomachean
Ethics</em>, devotes the first book to a preliminary account of
happiness, which is then completed in the last chapters of the final
book, Book X. This account ties happiness to excellent activity of the
soul. In subsequent books, excellent activity of the soul is tied to
the moral virtues and to the virtue of “practical wisdom”
— excellence in thinking and deciding about how to behave. This
approach to moral theory depends on a moral psychology that shares a
number of affinities with Plato's. However, while for Plato the theory
of forms has a role in justifying virtue, Aristotle notoriously rejects
that theory. Aristotle grounds his account of virtue in his theory
about the soul — a topic to which he devotes a separate treatise,
<em>de Anima</em>.</p>

<p>

Aristotle opens the first book of the <em>Nicomachean Ethics</em> by
positing some one supreme good as the aim of human actions,
investigations, and crafts (1094a). Identifying this good as happiness,
he immediately notes the variations in the notion (1095a15–25). Some
think the happy life is the life of enjoyment; the more refined think
it is the life of political activity; others think it is the life of
study or theoretical contemplation (1095b10–20). The object of the life
of enjoyment is bodily pleasure; that of political activity is honor or
even virtue. The object of the life of study is philosophical or
scientific understanding. Arguing that the end of human life must be
the most complete, he concludes that happiness is the most complete
end. Whereas pleasure, honor, virtue, and understanding are
choice-worthy in themselves, they are also chosen for the sake of
happiness. Happiness is not chosen for the sake of anything else
(1097a25–1097b5). Of course, the way he puts this relation between
happiness and the other choice-worthy ends leaves it open whether they
are means to or constituents of happiness.</p>

<p>

Next, Aristotle turns to his own account of happiness, the summit of
Book I. The account depends on an analogy with the notion of function
or characteristic activity or work (<em>ergon</em>). A flutist has a
function or work, i.e., playing the flute. The key idea for Aristotle
is that the good of flute players (as such) is found in their
functioning as a flutist. By analogy, if there is a human function, the
good for a human is found in this function (1097b20–30). Aristotle then
turns to the human soul. He argues that, in fact, there is a human
function, to be found in the human soul's characteristic activity,
i.e., reason (1098a1–20). Then, without explanation, he makes the claim
that reason has two importantly distinct aspects, one that has reason
directly and in itself and one that obeys (or can obey) reason. The
part that has reason in itself, e.g., deliberates about decisions, both
for the short term and the long. The part that obeys reason is that
aspect of the soul, such as the appetites, that functions in a human
being under the influence of reason. The appetites can fail to obey
reason; but they at least have the capacity to obey (as, for example,
such automatic functions as nutritive and metabolic ones do not).</p>

<p>

Aristotle then argues that since the function of a human is to
exercise the soul's activities according to reason, the function of a
good human is to exercise well and finely the soul's activities
according to reason. Given the two aspects of reason that Aristotle has
distinguished, one can see that both can be well or badly done. On the
one hand, one can reason well or badly — about what to do within
the next five minutes, twenty-four hours, or ten years. On the other,
actions motivated by appetites can be well or badly done, and likewise
having an appetite at all can sometimes not be a well done, but a badly
done, activity of the soul. Acting on the desire for a drink from the
wine cooler at a banquet is not always a good idea, nor is having such
a desire. According to Aristotle, the good human being has a soul in
which these functions are consistently done well. Thus, good persons
reason well about plans, short term or long; and when they satisfy
their appetites, and even when they <em>have</em> appetites, it is in
conformity with reason. Returning to the question of happiness,
Aristotle says the good for a human is to live the way the good human
lives, that is, to live with one's life aimed at and structured by the
same thing that the good human being aims at in his or her life. So,
his account of happiness, i.e., the highest good for a human, is
virtuous or excellent activity of the soul. But he has not identified
this virtuous activity with that of the moral virtues, at this point.
In fact, he says if there are many kinds of excellence, then human good
is found in the active exercise of the highest. He is careful to point
out that happiness is not just the ability to function well in this
way; it is the activity itself. Moreover, this activity must be carried
out for a complete life. One swallow does not make a spring.</p>

<p>

Although the reference here to parts or aspects of the soul is
cursory, it is influenced by Aristotle's theories in the <em>de
Anima</em>. Fundamental to the human soul and to all living things,
including plants, is nutrition and growth (415a20 ff). Next is
sensation and locomotion; these functions are characteristic of animals
(416b30 ff). Aristotle associates appetite and desire with this part of
the soul (414b1–5). Thus we have a rough sketch of animal life:
animals, moved by appetite for food, go toward the objects of desire,
which are discerned by sensation. To these functions is added thought
in the case of humans. Thought is both speculative and practical (427a
15–20). The bulk of the <em>de Anima</em> is devoted to explaining the
nutritive, sensory, and rational functions; Aristotle considers desire
and appetite as the source of movement in other animals (432a15 ff),
and these plus reason as its source in humans. In <em>Nicomachean
Ethics</em> he focuses on the role that appetite and desire, together
with reason, play in the moral drama of human life.</p>

<p>

In chapter 8 of Book I, Aristotle explicitly identifies human good
with psychological good. Dividing goods into external goods, those of
the body, and those of the soul, he states that his account of
happiness agrees with those who hold it is a good of the soul. In fact,
in this account, happiness is closely related to traditionally
conceived psychological goods such as pleasure and moral virtue,
although the nature of the relation has yet to be shown (1098b10–30).
Still, in Book I Aristotle is laying the foundation in his moral
psychology for showing the link between the moral virtues and
happiness. In Book II he completes this foundation when he turns to the
question of which condition of the soul is to be identified with
(moral) virtue, or virtue of character.</p>

<p>

In II. 5, he says that conditions of the soul are either feelings
(<em>pathê</em>), capacities for feeling (<em>dynameis</em>) or
dispositions (<em>hexeis</em>). Feelings are such things as appetite,
anger, fear and generally those conditions that are accompanied by
pleasure and pain. Capacities are, for example, the simple capacity to
have these feelings. Finally, disposition is that condition of the soul
whereby we are well or badly off with respect to feelings. For
instance, people are badly disposed with respect to anger who typically
get angry violently or who typically get angry weakly (1105b20–30).
Virtue, as a condition of the soul, will be one of these three. After
arguing that virtue is neither feeling nor capacity, Aristotle turns to
what it means to be well or badly off with respect to feelings. He says
that in everything that is continuous and divisible it is possible to
take more, less, or an equal amount (1106a25). This remark is puzzling
until we realize that he is actually talking about feelings. Feelings
are continuous and divisible; so one can take more, less, or an equal
amount of them. Presumably, when it comes to feeling anger, e.g., one
can feel too much, not very much, or a balanced amount. Aristotle
thinks that what counts as too much, not very much, or a balanced
amount can vary to some extent from individual to individual. At this
point he is ready to come back to moral virtue for it is concerned with
feelings and actions (to which feelings give rise), in which one can
have excess, deficiency, or the mean. To have a feeling like anger at
the right time, on the right occasion, towards the right people, for
the right purpose and in the right manner is to feel the right amount,
the mean between extremes of excess and deficiency; this is the mark of
moral virtue (1106a15–20). Finally, virtue is not a question only of
feelings since there is a mean between extremes of action. Presumably,
Aristotle means that the appropriate feeling — the mean between
the extremes in each situation — gives rise to the appropriate
action.</p>

<p>

At last Aristotle is ready to discuss particular moral virtues.
Beginning with courage, he mentions here two feelings, fear and
confidence. An excessive disposition to confidence is rashness and an
excessive disposition to fear and a deficiency in confidence is
cowardice. When it comes to certain bodily pleasures and pains, the
mean is moderation. While the excess is profligacy, deficiency in
respect of pleasures almost never occurs. Aristotle gives a fuller
account of both of these virtues in Book III; however, the basic idea
remains. The virtue in each case is a mean between two extremes, the
extremes being vices. Virtue, then, is a reliable disposition whereby
one reacts in relevant situations with the appropriate feeling —
neither excessive nor deficient — and acts in the appropriate way
— neither excessively nor deficiently.</p>

<p>

Now we can discern the link between morality and happiness. While
happiness itself is excellent or virtuous activity of the soul, moral
virtue is a disposition to achieve the mean between two extremes in
feeling and in action. The missing link is that achieving the mean is
also excellent activity of the soul. Activity that expresses the
virtue of courage, for example, is also the best kind of activity when
it comes to the emotion of fear. Activity that expresses the virtue of
moderation is also excellent activity when it comes to the bodily
appetites. In this way, then, the happy person is also the virtuous
person. However, in Book I Aristotle has already pointed out the
problem of bodily and external goods in relation to happiness. Even if
happiness is virtuous activity of the soul, in some cases these goods
are needed to be virtuous — for example, one must have money to
be generous. In fact, the lack of good birth, good children, and
beauty can mar one's happiness for the happy person does not appear to
be one who is altogether ugly, low born, solitary, or childless, and
even less so if he has friends and children who are bad, or good
friends and children who then die (1099a30–1099b10). Aristotle is
raising a problem that he does not attempt to solve in this
passage. Even if happiness is virtuous activity of the soul, it does
not confer immunity to the vicissitudes of life.</p>

<p>

Aristotle's moral psychology has further implications for his
account of happiness. In Book I, chapter 7, he said that human good is
virtuous activity of the soul but was indefinite about the virtues. In
most of the <em>Nicomachean Ethics</em> he talks about the moral
virtues, leaving the impression that virtuous activity is the same as
activity associated with moral virtues. In Book X, however, Aristotle
revisits the issue of virtuous activity. If happiness, he says, is
activity in accordance with virtue, it will be activity in accordance
with the highest. The highest virtue belongs to the best part of the
soul, i.e., the intellect (<em>nous</em>) or the part that governs in
the soul and contemplates the fine and godly, being itself the divine
part of the soul or that which is closest to the divine
(1177a10–20).</p>

<p>

Up to this point, Aristotle has apparently been talking about the man
of political action. Active in the life of the city, this person
exercises courage, moderation, liberality, and justice in the public
arena. Now, instead of the life of an effective and successful
citizen, Aristotle is holding up the life of study and contemplation
as the one that achieves happiness — that is, the highest human
good, the activity of the highest virtue. He even suggests that the
life of contemplation is secure against the need for external goods
(1177a30).  Indeed, at first he portrays these two lives as so
opposite that they seem incompatible. One can express the
incompatibility as between an inclusive conception of happiness and a
dominant conception. In the former, happiness is the active exercise
of all the virtues, moral and intellectual. In the latter, the
exercise of intellectual virtues is the sum-total of happiness; and
the other virtues have only instrumental value in making contemplation
possible.</p>

<p>

In the end, however, he palliates the differences, leaving the
possibility for some way to harmonize the two (1178a30). The
differences between the two lives are rooted in the different aspects
of the soul. Moral virtues belong to the appetites and desires of the
sensory soul — the part obviously associated with the active
political life, when its activities are brought under the guidance and
control of excellent practical thought and judgment.  The
“highest” virtues, those belonging to the scientific or
philosophical intellect, belong to theoretical reason. To concentrate
on these activities one must be appropriately disengaged from active
political life. While the latter description leads Aristotle to
portray as possible a kind of human life that partakes of divine
detachment (1178b5 ff), finally human life is an indissolvable
composite of intellect, reason, sensation, desires, and appetites. For
Aristotle, strictly speaking, happiness simply <em>is</em> the
exercise of the highest virtues, those of theoretical reason and
understanding. But even persons pursuing those activities as their
highest good, and making them central to their lives, will need to
remain connected to daily life, and even to political affairs in the
community in which they live. Hence, they will possess and exercise
the moral virtues and those of practical thought, as well as those
other, higher, virtues, throughout their lives. Finally, integration
of the moral virtues into happiness is achieved if they are not just
instrumental means to happiness but a part of human happiness, while
contemplation remains the most important component.</p>

<p>

Like Plato, Aristotle is a eudaimonist in that he argues that virtue
(including in some way the moral virtues of courage, justice and the
rest) is the dominant and most important component of happiness.
However, he is not claiming that the only reason to be morally virtuous
is that moral virtue is a constituent of happiness. He says that we
seek to have virtue and virtuous action for itself as well
(<em>Nicomachean Ethics</em>, 1097b 1–10); not to do so is to fail even
to <em>be</em> virtuous. In this regard, it is like pleasure, which is
also a constituent of the happy life. Like pleasure, virtue is sought
for its own sake. Still, as a constituent of happiness, virtuous action
is grounded in the highest end for a human being. Thus, Aristotle bases
his account of virtue and happiness in his theory about human nature.
If happiness is excellent activity of the soul, the latter is
understood in relation to the human function. He assumes that if one
understands what the human function is one can understand what it is
for that function to be done excellently (1098a5–15). This sort of
argument has been criticized because it moves from a premise about what
humans are to a conclusion about how they ought to be. Such criticism
reflects the modern claim that there is a fact-value distinction. One
defense of Aristotle's argument holds that his account of human nature
is meant both to be objective and to offer the basis for an
understanding of excellence. The difference, then, between modern moral
theory and ancient is over what counts as an objective account of human
nature. Finally, as we will see, the idea that virtue is the perfection
of human nature becomes an important idea for the Stoics.</p>

<h2><a name="5">5. Cynics</a></h2>

<p>

Although the Cynics had an impact on moral thinking in Athens after
the death of Socrates, it is through later, and highly controversial,
reports of their deeds and sayings — rather than their writings
— that we know of them. Diogenes the Cynic, the central figure,
is famous for living in a wine jar (Diogenes Laertius [= DL] VI 23) and
going about with a lantern looking for ‘a man’ —
i.e., someone not corrupted (DL VI 41). He claimed to set courage over
against fortune, nature against convention, and reason against passion
(DL VI 38). Of this trio of opposites, the most characteristic for
understanding the Cynics is nature against convention. Diogenes taught
that a life according to nature was better than one that conformed to
convention. First of all, natural life is simpler. Diogenes ate, slept,
or conversed wherever it suited him and carried his food around with
him (DL VI 22). When he saw a child drinking out of its hand, he threw
away his cup, saying that a child had bested him in frugality (DL VI
37). He said the life of humans had been made easy by the gods but that
humans had lost sight of this through seeking after honeyed cakes,
perfumes, and similar things (DL VI 44). With sufficient training the
life according to nature is the happy life (DL VI 71).</p>

<p>

Accordingly Diogenes became famous for behavior that flouted
convention (DL VI 69). Still, he thought that the simple life not only
freed one from unnecessary concerns but was essential to virtue.
Although he says nothing specific about the virtues, he does commend
training for virtuous behavior (DL VI 70). His frugality certainly
bespeaks self-control. He condemned love of money, praised good men,
and held love to be the occupation of the idle (DL VI 50–51).</p>

<p>

Besides his contempt for convention, what is most noteworthy about
Diogenes as a moral teacher is his emphasis on detachment from those
things most people consider good. In this emphasis, Diogenes seems to
have intensified a tendency found in Socrates. Certainly Socrates
could be heedless of convention and careless about providing for his
bodily needs. To Plato, however, Diogenes seemed to be Socrates gone
mad (DL VI 54). Still, in Diogenes' attitude, we can see at least the
beginning of the idea that the end of life is a psychological state
marked by detachment. Counseling the simple and uncomplicated
satisfaction of one's natural instincts and desires, Diogenes urges
detachment from those things held out by convention to be good. While
he is not so explicit, others develop the theme of detachment into the
notion of tranquility. The Stoics and Epicureans hold that happiness
depends on detachment from vulnerable or difficult to obtain bodily
and external goods and consists in a psychological state more under
one's own direct control.  In this way, happiness becomes associated
(for the Epicureans) with tranquility (<em>ataraxia</em>). Finally, in
Skepticism, suspension of judgment is a kind of epistemic detachment
that provides tranquility.  So in Diogenes we find the beginnings of
an idea that will become central to later ancient moral theory.</p>

<h2><a name="6">6. Cyrenaics</a></h2>

<p>

The first of the Cyrenaic school was Aristippus, who came from
Cyrene, a Greek city on the north African coast. The account of his
teachings, in Diogenes Laertius, can seem sometimes inconsistent.
Nevertheless, Aristippus is interesting because, as a thorough
hedonist, he is something of a foil for Epicurus. First of all,
pleasure is the end or the goal of life — what everyone should
seek in life. However, the pleasure that is the end is not pleasure in
general, or pleasure over the long term, but immediate, particular
pleasures. Thus the end varies situation by situation, action by
action. The end is not happiness because happiness is the sum of
particular pleasures (DL II 87–88). Accumulating the pleasures that
produce happiness is tiresome (DL II 90). Particular pleasures are ones
that are close-by or sure. Moreover, Aristippus said that pleasures do
not differ from one another, that one pleasure is not more pleasant
than another. This sort of thinking would encourage one to choose a
readily available pleasure rather than wait for a “better”
one in the future. This conclusion is reinforced by other parts of his
teaching. His school says that bodily pleasures are much better than
mental pleasures. While this claim would seem to contradict the idea
that pleasures do not differ, it does show preference for the
immediately or easily available pleasures of bodily gratification over,
e.g., the mental pleasure of a self-aware just person. In fact,
Aristippus' school holds that pleasure is good even if it comes from
the most unseemly things (DL II 88). Aristippus, then, seems to have
raised improvidence to the level of a principle.</p>

<p>

Still, it is possible that the position is more than an elaborate
justification for short-sighted pleasure-seeking. Cyrenaics taught that
a wise man (<em>sophos</em>) (one who always pursues immediate
gratification) will in general live more pleasantly than a foolish man.
That prudence or wisdom (<em>phronêsis</em>) is good, not in
itself but in its consequences, suggests that some balance, perhaps
even regarding others, is required in choosing pleasures (DL II 91).
The Cyrenaic attitude to punishment seems to be an example of prudence.
They hold that nothing is just, fine, or base by nature but only by
convention and custom; still a good man will do nothing out of line
through fear of punishment (DL II 93). Finally, they hold that
friendship is based in self-interest (DL II 91). These aspects of
Cyrenaic teaching suggest they are egoist hedonists. If so, there are
grounds for taking the interest of others into account as long as doing
so is based on what best provides an individual pleasure.</p>

<p>

Nevertheless, Aristippus' school holds that the end of life is a
psychological good, pleasure. Still, it is particular pleasures not the
accumulation of these that is the end. As a consequence, their moral
theory contrasts sharply with others in antiquity. If we take the
claims about the wise man, prudence, and friendship to be references to
virtue, then Aristippus' school denies that virtue is indispensable for
achieving the end or goal of life. While they hold that virtue is good
insofar as it leads to the end, they seem prepared to dispense with
virtue in circumstances where it proves ineffective. Even if they held
virtue in more esteem, the Cyrenaics would nonetheless not be
eudaimonists since they deny that happiness is the end of life.</p>

<h2><a name="7">7. Epicurus</a></h2>

<p>

Epicurean moral theory is the most prominent hedonistic theory in
the ancient world. While Epicurus holds that pleasure is the sole
intrinsic good and pain is what is intrinsically bad for humans, he is
also very careful about defining these two. Aware of the Cyrenaics who
hold that pleasures, moral and immoral, are the end or goal of all
action, Epicurus presents a sustained argument that pleasure, correctly
understood, will coincide with virtue.</p>

<p>

In the <em>Letter to Menoeceus</em>, Epicurus begins by making a
distinction among desires. Some desires are empty or groundless and
others are natural; the natural are further subdivided into the merely
natural and the necessary. Finally, the necessary are those necessary
for happiness, those necessary for the body's freedom from distress,
and those necessary for life itself (<em>Letter to Menoeceus</em> 127).
A helpful scholiast (cf. <em>Principal Doctrines</em> XXIX) gives us
some examples; necessary desires are ones that bring relief from
unavoidable pain, such as drinking when thirsty — if we don't
drink when we need replenishment, we will just get thirstier and
thirstier, a painful experience. The natural but not necessary are the
ones that vary pleasure but are not <em>needed</em> in order to
motivate us to remove or ward off pain, such as the desire for
expensive food: we do not need to want, or to eat, expensive food in
order to ward off the pain of prolonged hunger. Finally, the groundless
desires are for such things as crowns and statues bestowed as civic
honors — these are things that when desired at all are desired
with intense and harmful cravings. Keeping these distinctions in mind
is a great help in one's life because it shows us what we need to aim
for. The aim of the blessed life is the body's health and the soul's
freedom from disturbance (<em>ataraxia</em>) (128).</p>

<p>

After this austere introduction, Epicurus makes the bold claim that
pleasure is the beginning and end of the blessed life. Then he makes an
important qualification. Just because pleasure is the good, Epicureans
do not seek every pleasure. Some lead to greater pain. Just so, they do
not avoid all pains; some lead to greater pleasures (128–29). Such a
position sounds, of course, like common-sense hedonism. If one's aim is
to have as much pleasure as possible over the long term, it makes sense
to avoid some smaller pleasures that will be followed by larger pains.
If one wants, for example, to have as much pleasure from drinking wine
as possible, then it would make sense to exercise some judgment about
how much to drink on an occasion since the next morning's hangover will
be very unpleasant, and might keep one from having wine the next day.
However, his distinction among groundless, natural, and necessary
desires should make us suspicious that Epicurus is no common-sense
hedonist. The aim of life is not maximizing pleasures in the way the
above example suggests. Rather, real pleasure, the aim of life, is what
we experience through freedom from pain and distress. So it is not the
pains of the hangover or the possible loss of further bouts of wine
drinking that should restrain my drinking on this occasion. Rather one
should be aiming at the pleasure given by freedom from bodily pain and
mental distress (131–32).</p>

<p>

In order to understand the importance of freedom from pain and from
distress, we need to grasp the distinction between kinetic pleasures
and katastematic, or what are, following Cicero, misleadingly called
“static” ones. Kinetic pleasures are associated with
replenishment and may or may not be associated with pain. One can
experience kinetic pleasure when, e.g., drinking when thirsty; in
these cases, pleasure increases, presumably with the diminution of the
pain of thirst.  Again, one can experience kinetic pleasure when,
e.g., drinking though not thirsty; in these cases the pleasure of
drinking cannot be increased but only varied — <em> sc </em>.,
by drinking different sorts of liquid (XVIII). While kinetic pleasure
can be associated with the pain of desire, katastematic pleasure is
defined by freedom from pain and distress. Still, the distinction is
not straightforward and has been interpreted in different ways. In one
way, ‘pleasure’ primarily means kinetic pleasure; katastematic
pleasure is just kinetic pleasure that is free from pain and
distress. In another way, ‘pleasure’ has different senses. While
kinetic pleasure is primarily, e.g., the pleasure <em> of </em>
drinking when thirsty, katastematic pleasure is being pleased <em>
about </em> or enjoying a state of affairs. Once the pain of desire is
satisfied and mental distress quieted, the state of freedom is
katastematic pleasure — a positive rather than a neutral
state. We can understand it as the enjoyment of one's natural
constitution (the Greek here transliterated means “to do with
one's natural constitution”) when one is not distracted by
bodily pain or mental distress. Finally, Epicurus not only thinks of
this state as a positive one but its pleasure as the preferred state
of pleasure. </p>

<p>

At this point, we can see that Epicurus has so refined the account
of pleasure and pain that he is able to tie them to virtue. In the
<em>Letter to Menoeceus</em>, he claims, as a truth for which he does
not argue, that virtue and pleasure are inseparable and that living a
prudent, honorable, and just life is the necessary and sufficient
means to the pleasure that is the end of life (132). An example of
what he might mean is found in <em>Principal Doctrines</em>, where
Epicurus holds that justice is a contract among humans to avoid
suffering harm from one another. Then he argues that injustice is not
bad <em>per se</em> but is bad because of the fear that arises from
the expectation that one will be punished for his misdeeds. He
reinforces this claim by arguing that it is impossible for someone who
violates the compact to be confident that he will escape detection
(XXXIV-V). He thereby grounds justice, understood as the rules
governing human intercourse, in his moral psychology, i.e., the need
to avoid distress.</p>

<p>

Epicurus, like his predecessors in the ancient moral tradition,
identified the good as something psychological. However, instead of,
for example, the complex Aristotelian notion of excellent activity of
the soul, Epicurus settled on the fairly obvious psychological good of
pleasure. Of course, Aristotle argues that excellent activity of the
soul is intrinsically pleasurable (<em>Nicomachean Ethics</em>
1099a5).  Still, in his account pleasure seems something like a
dividend of excellent activity (1175b30). By contrast, for Epicurus
pleasure itself is the end of life. However, since Epicureans hold
freedom from pain (<em>aponia</em>) and distress (<em>ataraxia</em>)
gives the preferable pleasure, they emphasize tranquility
(<em>ataraxia</em>) as the end of life. In order to achieve freedom
from pain and distress, Epicureans prefer the simple pleasures
(130–31). Modern utilitarians, for whom freedom from pain and distress
is not paramount, would include a broader palate of
pleasures. Nevertheless, Epicurus does not forbid luxurious pleasures
— as long as they are fortuitous and not sought.</p>

<p>

Epicurus' doctrine can be considered eudaimonist. While Plato and
Aristotle maintain that virtue is constitutive of happiness, Epicurus
holds that virtue is the only means to achieve happiness, where
happiness is understood as a continuous experience of the pleasure
that comes from freedom from pain and from mental distress. Thus, he
is a eudaimonist in that he holds virtue is indispensable to
happiness; but he does not identify virtuous activity, in whole or in
part, with happiness. Finally, Epicurus is usually interpreted to have
held a version of psychological hedonism — i.e., everything we
do is done for the sake of pleasure — rather than ethical
hedonism — i.e., we ought to do everything for the sake of
pleasure. However, <em>Principal Doctrine</em> XXV suggests the latter
position; and when in the <em>Letter to Menoeceus</em> he says that
“we” do everything in order not to be in pain or in fear,
he might mean to be referring to “we” Epicureans. Still,
once all disturbance of the soul is dispelled, he says, one is no
longer in need nor is there any other good that could be added
(128). Since absence of pain and disturbance is a kind of pleasure,
Epicurus could be taken, as he usually has been, to be arguing that
whatever we do is done for the sake of pleasure. In this account, that
aspect of human nature on which virtue is based is fairly
straightforward. The account is certainly less complex than, e.g.,
Aristotle's. In turn, Epicurus seems to have argued in such a way as
to make pleasure the only reason for being virtuous. If psychological
hedonism is true, then when one realizes the necessary link between
virtue and pleasure, one has all the reason one needs to be virtuous
and the only reason one can have.</p>

<h2><a name="8">8. Stoics</a></h2>

<p>

The Stoics are well known for their teaching that the good is to be
identified with virtue. By ‘virtue’ they mean such moral
virtues as justice, moderation, and courage. So all that is required
for happiness (i.e., the secure possession of the good, of what is
needed to make one's life a thoroughly good one) — and the only
thing — is to lead a morally virtuous life. In this teaching the
Stoics are addressing the problem of bodily and external goods raised by
Aristotle. Their solution takes the radical course of dismissing such
alleged goods from the account of happiness because they are not
necessary for virtue, and are not, in fact, in any way good at all.</p>

<p>

They argue that health, pleasure, beauty, strength, wealth, good reputation,
and noble birth are neither good nor bad. Since they can be used well
or badly and the good is invariably good, these assets are not good.
The virtues, however, are good (DL VII 102–103), since they are
perfections of our rationality, and only rationally perfected thoughts
and decisions can possibly have the features of harmony and order in which
goodness itself consists. Since possessing and exercising virtue is
happiness, happiness does not include such things as health, pleasure,
and wealth. Still, the Stoics do not dismiss these assets altogether
since they still have some sort of value. These things are indifferent
to happiness in that they do not add to one's virtue nor detract from
it, and so they do not add to or take away from one's possession of the
good. One is not more virtuous because healthy nor less virtuous
because ill. But being healthy generally conforms with nature's plans
for the lives of animals and plants, so it is preferable to be healthy,
and one should try to preserve and maintain one's health. Health is,
then, the kind of value they call a preferred indifferent; but it is
not in any way a good, and it makes no contribution to the quality of
one's life as a good or a bad one, happy or miserable.</p>

<p>

In order to understand the Stoic claims about the relation of virtue
to happiness, we can begin with virtue. Chrysippus says that virtue is
a craft (<em>technê</em>) having to do with the things of life
(<em>Stoicorum Veterum Fragmenta</em>[=SVF] II 909). In other texts, we
learn that the things of life include impulse (<em>hormê</em>).
Each animal has an impulse for self-preservation; it has an awareness
of its constitution and strives to preserve its integrity. There is
also a natural impulse to care for offspring. Humans, then, are
naturally inclined toward preserving life, health, and children. But
then grown-up humans also do these things under the guidance of reason;
reason in the adult human case is the craftsman of impulse (DL VII
85–6). This latter phrase is significant because it implies that just
following natural impulse is not enough. In fact, it is not even
possible for an adult human, whose nature is such as to do everything
they do <em>by</em> reason, even to follow the sort of natural impulses
that animals and immature humans do in their actions. In order to lead
a virtuous life, reason must shape our impulses and guide their
expression in action.</p>

<p>

Impulse is the key to understanding the relation between virtue and
happiness. An impulse is a propositional attitude that by itself leads
to action, e.g., ‘I should eat this bread now.’ However, impulses do
not come from a separate, non-rational part of the soul. Stoics deny
there are any non-rational desires of appetite capable of impelling
action. The soul, insofar as it provides motivations and is the cause
of our actions, consists of the commanding faculty
(<em>hêgemonikon</em>) which is also reason (SVF III 378). We
can distinguish correct impulses into those which treat virtue as the
only good and those which treat things indifferent as indifferent.  By
contrast, emotions or passions (<em> pathê</em>) are incorrect
impulses that treat what is indifferent as good. However, they do not
come from a non-rational part of the soul but are false judgments
about the good. Emotions, such as desire, fear, pleasure, and pain,
embody such erroneous judgments. For instance, the desire for health
is the impulse that embodies the false judgment that health is good,
instead of a preferred indifferent (SVF 3.391, 393, 394). The sage
— someone perfected in virtue — would have no emotions in
this sense, no feelings that carried him beyond reason's true
assessment. He would, however, experience feelings attuned to
reason, <em> eupatheiai </em> —literally good emotions or
feelings. For instance, he would feel joy over his virtue, but not
pleasure — the latter being an emotion that treats the actual
possession of an indifferent as a good. </p>

<p>

Knowledge, then, about what is good, bad, and indifferent is the heart
of virtue. Courage, e.g., is simply knowledge of what is to be
endured: the impulse to endure or not, and the <em>only</em> impulse
that is needed by courage, then follows automatically, as a product or
aspect of that knowledge. This tight unity in the soul is the basis
for the Stoic teaching about the unity of the virtues. Zeno (the
founder of the school) defines wisdom (<em>phronêsis</em>), or
rather practical <em>knowledge</em>, in matters requiring distribution
as justice, in matters requiring choice as moderation, and in matters
requiring endurance as courage (Plutarch <em>On Moral Virtue</em>
440E-441D). Practical knowledge, then, is a single, comprehensive
knowledge of what is good and bad in each of these kinds of
circumstance.</p>

<p>

Attending to this identification of virtue and practical knowledge
is a good way to understand the central Stoic teaching that virtue is
living in agreement with nature (SVF III16). Nature includes not only
what produces natural impulses but also the rest of the government of
the cosmos, the natural world. The universe is governed by right reason
that pervades everything and directs (causes) the way it functions
— with the exception of the only rational animals there are, the
adult human beings: their actions are caused by their <em>own</em>
individual decisions. Nature is even identified with Zeus, who is said
to be the director of the administration of all that has being (DL VII
87-9). Since reason governs the universe for the good, everything happens
of necessity and for the overall good. Virtue, then, includes
understanding both one's individual nature as a human being and the way
nature arranges the whole universe. This understanding is the basis for
living in agreement with the government of the universe, i.e., with
nature, by making one's decisions and actions be such as to agree with
Zeus's or nature's own plans, so far as one can understand what those
are.</p>

<p>It is in this context that we can best understand the Stoic
teaching about indifferents, such as health and wealth.  An
individual's health is vulnerable to being lost if right reason that
governs the universe requires it for the good of the whole.  If
happiness depended on having these assets and avoiding their
opposites, then, in these cases, happiness would be impossible.
However, if virtue is living in agreement with nature's government of
the universe and if virtue is the only good, one's happiness is not
vulnerable to being lost.  If one understands that the good of the
whole dictates that in a particular case one's health must be
sacrificed, then one recognizes that his happiness does not require
health.  We should not, however, see this recognition as tantamount to
renunciation.  If the Stoic notion of happiness has any relation at
all to the ordinary sense, renunciation cannot be a part of it.
Rather, the Stoic view of living in accordance with nature should
imply not only understanding the way right reason rules the universe
but agreeing with it.  We can best appreciate the notion that virtue
is the good, then, if we take virtue as both acknowledging that the
universe is well governed and adopting the point of view, so to speak,
of the government (DL VII 87-9).</p>

<p>
A refinement of the Stoic approach to indifferents gives us a way of
understanding what living in agreement with nature might look like.
After all, such things as health and wealth cannot just be dismissed
since they are something like the raw material of virtue.  It is in
pursuing and using them that one exercises virtue, for instance.  In
the attempt to integrate preferred indifferents into the pursuit of
the good, Stoics used an analogy with archery (<em>On Ends</em>
III.22).  Since he aims to hit the target, the archer does everything
in his power to hit the target.  Trying everything in his power
reflects the idea that such factors as a gust of wind--chance
happenings that cannot be controlled or foreseen--can intervene and
keep him from achieving the goal.  To account for the factors, it is
claimed that the goal of the archer is really trying everything in his
power to attain the end.  The analogy with the art of living focuses
on this shift from the goal of hitting the target to the goal of
trying everything in one's power to hit the target (<em>On Ends</em>
V.17-20).  It is the art of trying everything in one's power to attain
such preferred indifferents as health and wealth.  However, if right
reason, which governs the universe, decides that one will not have
either, then the sage follows right reason.  At this point the analogy
with archery breaks down since, for the sage, trying everything in
one's power does not mean striving until one fails; rather, it means
seeking preferred indifferents guided by right reason.  By this
reasoning, one should see that virtue and happiness are not identified
with achieving heath and wealth but with the way one seeks them.
Finally, the art of living is best compared to such skills as acting
and dancing (<em>On Ends</em> V. 24-5).</p>

<p>

The Stoics are extreme eudaimonists compared to Plato or Aristotle.
While Plato clearly associates virtue and happiness, he never squarely
faces the issue whether happiness may require other goods, e.g., wealth
and health. Aristotle holds happiness to be virtuous activity of the
soul; but he raises — without solving — the problem of bodily and 
external goods and happiness. For these two, virtue, together with its
active exercise, is the dominant and most important component of
happiness, while Stoics simply identify virtue and the good, and so
make it the only thing needed for a happy life. Still, Stoics do not
reduce happiness to virtue, as though ‘happiness’ is just a
name for being perfectly just, courageous, and moderate. Rather they
have independent ways of describing happiness. Following Zeno, all the
Stoics say it is a good flow of life. Seneca says the happy life is
peacefulness and constant tranquility. However, we should keep in mind
that, while they do not reduce happiness to virtue, their account of
happiness is not that of the common person. So in recommending virtue
because it secures happiness the Stoics are relying on happiness in a
special, although not idiosyncratic, sense. In fact, their idea of
happiness shares an important feature with the Epicurean, which puts a
premium on tranquil pleasures. In Stoicism as well, deliverance from
the vicissitudes of fate leads to a notion of happiness that emphasizes
tranquility. And, as we shall see, tranquility is a value for the
Skeptics.</p>

<p>

Clearly, the Stoic account of virtue and happiness depends on their
theory about human nature. For Aristotle, virtue is perfection of the
human function and the Stoics follow in this line of thinking. While
their notion of virtue builds on their notion of the underlying human
nature, their account of the perfection of human nature is more complex
than Aristotle's. It includes accommodation to the nature of the
universe. Virtue is the perfection of human nature that makes it
harmonious with the workings of fate, i.e. with Zeus's overall plan,
regarded as the ineluctable cause of what happens in the world at
large.</p>

<h2><a name="9">9. Pyrrhonian Skeptics</a></h2>

<p>

Pyrrho, a murky figure, contemporary with Epicurus and Zeno the
Stoic, left no writings. In the late, anecdotal tradition he is
credited with introducing suspension of judgment (DL IX 61). He became
the eponymous hero for the founding of Pyrrhonian skepticism in the
first century B.C. (See entry on
 <a href="../pyrrho/"><em>Pyrrho</em></a>.)
 Because for every argument
there is an opposing argument, Pyrrhonian Skeptics expressed no
determinate opinions (DL IX 74). This attitude would seem to lead to a
kind of epistemic paralysis. The Skeptics reply that they do not
abolish, e.g., relying on sight. They do not say that it is unreliable
and they do not refuse, personally, ever to rely on it. Rather, they
have the impression that there is no reason why we are entitled to rely
on it, in a given case or in general, even if we go ahead and rely on
it anyhow (DL IX 103). For example, if one has the visual impression
of a tower, that appearance is not in dispute. What it seems one cannot
know is whether the tower is as it appears to be. For Skeptics, claiming that
the tower is as it appears to be is a dogmatic statement about the explanation
of the appearance. One can never have a warrant for such statements.</p>

<p>

Such views have an obvious impact on practical and moral issues.
First of all, the Skeptics argue that, so far as we have been given
any good reason by philosophers to believe, there is nothing good or
bad by nature. Their argument is that what is good by nature would be
recognized by everyone; but not everyone agrees about what is good by
nature. For instance, Epicurus holds that pleasure is good by nature
but Antisthenes holds that it is not (DL IX 101). However, the Skeptic
would not dogmatically hold that nothing is good by nature but rather
would suspend judgment about what is good by nature. The subtlety of
suspension of judgment is illustrated by two traditions about the life
of Pyrrho. In one, Pyrrho himself did not avoid anything, whether it
was wagons, precipices, or dogs. It would appear that, suspending
judgment about whether being hit by a wagon was naturally good or bad,
Pyrrho might walk into its path, or not bother to get out of the way.
His less skeptical friends kept him alive — presumably by
guiding him away from busy roads, vicious dogs, and deep
gorges. Another tradition, however, says that he only theorized about
suspension of judgments, and took action to preserve himself and
otherwise lead a normal life, but doing so without any judgments as to
natural good and bad. Living providently, he reached ninety years of
age (DL IX 62).</p>

<p>

In any event, Pyrrho's suspension of judgment led to a certain
detachment. Not knowing what was good or bad by nature, he was
indifferent where dogmatists would be unhappy or at least anxious. For
instance, he performed household chores usually done by women (DL IX
63–66). Thus Pyrrho's skepticism detached him from the dogmatic
judgments of a culture in which a man's performing women's work was
considered demeaning. In turn, his skepticism and suspension of
judgment led to freedom from disturbance (<em>ataraxia</em>) (DL IX
68). It is significant that this psychological state, so important for
Epicureans as part of the end of life, should play a key role in
Pyrrhonian skepticism at its beginning with Pyrrho, but certainly in
its development with Sextus Empiricus.</p>

<p>

While suspension of judgment in moral matters brings freedom from
disturbance, it does not lead to immoral behavior — anymore than
it leads to the foolhardy behavior of the first tradition about
Pyrrho's life. Their type of skepticism about what is good or bad by
nature allowed Pyrrhonists to choose and avoid things according to
habit and custom (DL IX 108).  Sextus generalizes the Skeptic teaching
about appearances to cover the whole area of practical activity. He
says the rules of everyday conduct are divided into four parts: (1)
the guidance from nature, (2) compulsion that comes from bodily states
like hunger and thirst, (3) traditional laws and customs about pious
and good living, (4) the teachings of the crafts (Sextus
Empiricus, <em>Outlines of Pyrrhonism</em>, I 21–24). The Skeptic is
guided by all of these as by appearance, and thus undogmatically. For
instance, he would follow the traditional laws about pious and good
living, accepting these laws as the way things appear to him to be in
matters of piety and goodness but claiming no knowledge.</p>

<p>

Sextus says that the end of life is freedom from disturbance in
matters of belief, plus moderate states in matters of compulsion.
Suspension of judgment provides the former in that one is not disturbed
about which of two opposing claims is true, when (as always seems to
happen) one cannot rationally decide between them. Matters of
compulsion cover such things as bodily needs for food, drink, and
warmth. While the Skeptic undeniably suffers when hungry, thirsty, or
cold, he achieves a moderate state with respect to these sufferings
when compared to the person who both suffers them and believes they are
naturally bad. The Skeptic's suspension of judgment about whether his
suffering is naturally bad gives him a certain detachment from the
suffering (I 25–30).</p>

<p>

As a consequence, the Skeptic conception of the end of life is
similar in some ways to Epicurean and Stoic beliefs. For Epicureans the
end is freedom from pain and distress; the Stoic identification of
virtue and the good promises freedom from disturbance. While Pyrrho and
Sextus hold freedom from disturbance to be the end of life, they differ
from the former over the means to freedom from disturbance. The
Epicureans, for example, hold that virtue is the infallible means to
freedom from disturbance. By contrast, Sextus does not have a lot to
say in a positive vein about virtue, although he does recommend
following traditional laws about piety and goodness. Rather, for
Skeptics it is an epistemic attitude, not virtue, that leads to the
desired state. Moreover, while Sextus talks about the end of life, the
word for happiness is conspicuously absent from his account. The
omission may not be significant since in the philosophical tradition
happiness is generally understood to be the end of life. In any event,
since they say so little about virtue, they could not be called
eudaimonists even if one allows that freedom from disturbance fills the
same role as happiness does in eudaimonism. Following moral conventions
might be a means to or even a constituent of freedom from disturbance;
but in this regard it is no different from any other activity.
Following moral conventions has a role in freedom from disturbance only
if it is done with the appropriate epistemic attitude.</p>
