<h1>Hermann Cohen</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Thu Jul 15, 2010; substantive revision Thu Sep 17, 2015</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>

Hermann Cohen, more than any other single figure, is responsible for
founding the orthodox neo-Kantianism that dominated academic
philosophy in Germany from the 1870s until the end of the First World
War.  Earlier German philosophers finding inspiration in Kant tended
either towards speculative, metaphysical idealism, or sought to
address philosophical questions with the resources of the empirical
sciences, especially psychology. In contrast, Cohen's seminal
interpretation of Kant offered a vision of philosophy that decisively
maintained its independence from empirical psychology, without at the
same time simply lapsing back into uncritical metaphysics. Cohen
brought these attitudes to bear on a wide range of topics, writing
systematically about epistemology, philosophy of science, ethics, law,
political theory, and aesthetics. His anti-psychologism became a
defining commitment not only of the Marburg School of neo-Kantianism,
founded by Cohen himself, but of orthodox neo-Kantianism more
generally. Indeed, that commitment ultimately defined the
philosophical context from which, in the early twentieth century, both
phenomenology and logical positivism emerged.</p>

<p>

No less significant than his influence on academic philosophy, Cohen
was his generation's preeminent German-Jewish public intellectual and
religious philosopher. His philosophical ethics and political
theory provided the foundation for a non-Marxist, Kantian democratic
socialism that informed his more popular and topical writings. He
argued publicly for universal suffrage and for the rights of workers to
organize democratically-constituted collectives. He also saw deep
points of connection between ethics and religion, and developed a view
of Judaism as a profoundly ethical system of belief and practice.
He argued that monotheism was the historical source of the idea of
universal ethical laws, and thus that Judaism offered the world its
first model of a universalist morality. This view of Judaism's
ethical significance ultimately informed Cohen's public defense of the
Jews' place in Germany not only against anti-Semitic attacks, but also
against the arguments of early twentieth-century Zionists.
However, Cohen's influence on Jewish thought extends far beyond debates
within Imperial Germany: his late religious writings inspired a broad
renewal in twentieth-century Jewish ethics and philosophy of
religion.</p>

<h2><a name="LifWor">1. Life and Works</a></h2>

<p>

Born in 1842 in Coswig, Germany, Cohen was raised in a devout
family. His father was a synagogue cantor, and Cohen left
<em>Gymnasium</em> in order to attend a rabbinical seminary in
Breslau, Poland. But he decided against becoming a rabbi, and enrolled
in university first in Breslau and then in Berlin, where he attended
classes taught by a leading light in the history of philosophy, the
Aristotelian scholar and metaphysician Adolf Trendelenburg. He
received his doctorate from the University of Halle, after which,
encouraged by H. Steinthal, he
studied <em>Völkerpsychologie</em>, an anthropological
investigation of the origins of cultural products such as art and
literature. It was in a journal of
<em>Völkerpsychologie</em> and linguistics that he published his
first major work of Kant interpretation, an intervention in
Trendelenburg's and Kuno Fischer's debate about Kant's Transcendental
Aesthetic (see §2 below). That essay also marked a decisive turn
in Cohen's philosophical orientation, and after two years in which he
wrote on both Kant's pre-critical philosophy and the <em>Critique of
Pure Reason</em>, he was appointed lecturer at the University of
Marburg. Three years later, he was promoted to full Professor, a rank
that was at that time in Germany almost never granted to unconverted
Jews in philosophy departments. It was no coincidence that Cohen's
appointment and subsequent promotion took place during Bismark's
anti-Catholic <em>Kulturkampf</em>, a brief period of relatively
liberal attitudes toward Jews. But following Heinrich von Treitschke's
notorious 1879 anti-Semitic attack on German-Jewish writers and
intellectuals, Cohen was compelled to enter the public debate about
the Jews' place in Imperial Germany. His “Declaration on the
Jewish Question” appeared in 1880, and questions of
German-Jewish identity would occupy him throughout his career
(Schwarzschild 1979; and especially Wiedebach 1997, Pts. 4–5). He remained at
Marburg for almost four decades. After retiring from Marburg in 1912, Cohen
returned to Berlin in order to teach at a rabbinical seminary, the Academy of
Jewish Sciences. He spent four years there, writing principally about
religious problems, until his death in 1918.</p>

<p>

Cohen's period of philosophical productivity spanned the duration of
the German empire, from the late 1860s until 1918. We can distinguish
three periods in his writing (van der Linden 1988, 205–6;
Bonaunet 2004: 22ff). The first, early period is characterized by
Cohen's attempts to develop his own views as commentaries on
Kant. During this period, he wrote <em>Kant's Theory of
Experience</em>, <em>Kant's Foundations of Ethics</em>, and <em>Kant's
Foundations of Aesthetics</em>. The second period marks Cohen's mature
philosophical work, which took the form of his multi-volume <em>System
of Philosophy</em>. In the <em>System</em>, Cohen explicitly abandoned
central Kantian doctrines, and presented his views systematically, and
as his own, rather than offering them as interpretations of
Kant. The <em>System</em> included <em>The Logic of Pure
Knowledge</em>, <em>The Ethics of Pure Will</em>, and <em>The
Aesthetics of Pure Feeling</em>. (He planned, but never wrote, a
fourth part of the <em>System</em> on the psychology of
“cultural consciousness.” This fourth part was to provide
the systematic foundation for the other three parts of
the <em>System</em> [Adelmann 1968].) Finally, although Cohen had been
interested in religious questions throughout his career, in the last
years of his life they were his overwhelming concern. It was during
this period that he wrote his <em>Religion of Reason Out of the
Sources of Judaism</em>.</p>

<p>

However, while Cohen's interests and views evolved over the course of
his career, his philosophy from all three periods nevertheless
exhibits points of deep continuity. All of Cohen's major works share a
profoundly historical orientation. A concern with the history of
philosophy dominates his writing, and he was convinced of history's
continuing significance for philosophy in the present.  But he was
also concerned with the histories of those subjects he took to be
philosophy's topics, including science, ethics, and religion. This
concern for history permeates his thought so completely that even in
his systematic works, he prefers to introduce concepts and theories
not by defining them straightforwardly, but by rehearsing major
episodes in the history of their development.  This
historically-oriented method was a model for what later philosophers
called <em>Problemgeschichte</em> – that is, the history of the
origin, development, and evolution of philosophical problems. In
stands in contrast to historical surveys of candidate solutions to
problems the philosopher conceives as fixed, unchanging, and
unresponsive to a broader philosophical context. (In Cohen's hands,
this historical orientation contributes in no small part to other
aspects of his writing that none of his readers can fail to notice:
its obscurity, repetition, and sometimes unnecessary length.)</p>

<p>

Cohen himself came to think that one commitment above all else unified
his philosophy, from his earliest interpretation of Kant to his
mature <em>System of Philosophy</em>. It was his commitment to a
philosophical method he claimed was Kant's, and that Cohen and his
students called the “transcendental method.” What follows
is a sketch of that method in Cohen's philosophy: how it emerged from
his interpretation of Kant; how he sought to apply that method in
epistemology and philosophy of science, as well as in ethics,
political theory, and aesthetics; and finally, how he sought to
articulate a view of religion as a necessary counterpart to philosophy
done according to that method.</p>

<h2><a name="IntKan">2. The Interpretation of Kant</a></h2>

<p>

Throughout his writings on epistemology and philosophy of science,
Cohen was committed to two ideas: first, that a priori laws of human
knowledge determine what counts as an object for us; and second, that
philosophy investigates knowledge according to what Cohen would
eventually, in his mature writings, call the “transcendental
method” (Edel 1988). His early interpretation of Kant reveals
both of these commitments in nascent form. It also reveals a problem
that would occupy him throughout his later writings on epistemology
and philosophy of science: the problem of explaining the origin of the
a priori laws in human knowledge.</p>

<p>

In 1871 Cohen published a long essay, “On the Controversy between
Trendelenburg and Kuno Fischer,” and a book, the first edition of
<em>Kant's Theory of Experience</em>. They were both defenses of Kant
against objections that Cohen thought badly misunderstood his views on
objectivity and the a priori. Cohen was responding to an
interpretation of Kant in the 1860s commonly held by figures of the
Back-to-Kant movement such as Hermann von Helmholtz and Cohen's own
senior colleague at Marburg, F.A. Lange, as well as by non-Kantian
philosophers such as Adolf Trendelenburg. Very roughly, these figures
thought that Kant held (or that Kantian philosophers ought to hold)
that the character of human knowledge is determined by both objective
and subjective factors. On one hand, there are objects that exist
independently of the subject's mind. These objects affect the
subject's mind, and in so doing contribute the objective element to
the subject's representations. On the other hand, there are structures
in the subject's mind—say, the forms of human intuition, space
and time. Because these structures are in the subject's mind and thus
don't come from experience, they are a priori. Further, these a priori
structures organize the subject's representations and thereby
contribute a subjective, mind-dependent element to them. But since on
this interpretation of Kant the a priori is subjective, an explanation
of knowledge's objectivity must appeal not to it, but to the objects
that exist independently of the mind.</p>

<p>

Cohen thought this interpretation of Kant was wrong, and he thought
that influential objections to Kant depended on it. Cohen was
especially concerned with Trendelenburg's well-known “neglected
alternative” objection to Kant's claim that space and time are
nothing but the forms of intuition. But Cohen was also concerned with
J.F. Herbart's (and in Cohen's own time, Helmholtz's) contention that
Kant thought spatial representations were innate. Since Cohen thought
both Trendelenburg's and Herbart's objections depended on a
misinterpretation of Kant, he thought those objections failed. He
responded to them by defending an alternative account of the relation
between objectivity and the Kantian a priori (Köhnke 1991,
175–8; Patton 2005). (See Biagioli 2014 for a broadly
sympathetic account of Cohen's criticism of Helmholtz in particular;
Hyder 2013 offers a defense of Helmholtz on geometry against Cohen's
criticisms of him.)</p>

<p>

Thus <em>Kant's Theory of Experience</em> is above all an
attempt to articulate and defend Cohen's alternative interpretation of
Kant's a priori. On that interpretation, Kant's aim in the
<em>Critique of Pure Reason</em> is to show how a priori laws of human
thought explain the character of our experience of objects. For
Cohen, because these a priori laws are necessary, they are
objective. So Kant's explanation of objective experience appeals
to them, and not to the effects of any alleged mind-independent
objects.</p>

<p>

Cohen argues that there are three different “levels” or
“degrees” of Kant's a priori. He claims that the first of
these is inessential for Kant's philosophy, and consists in the
apparently permanent “metaphysical” structures we can
discover in our own thought by means of introspection. The second
level of the a priori consists in the forms of sensibility and the
understanding, that is, space, time, and the categories. But the
necessity of these forms ultimately derives from the necessity of the
third level of the a priori, because the forms of sensibility and
understanding are “scientific abstractions” (Cohen 1987
[1871b], 83–84) from that third level.  The third level is thus
the most important of the three levels.  Cohen argues that a priori
laws in this most important, third sense consist in the “formal
conditions of the possibility of experience.” Or, as he also
sometimes puts it, the a priori in this third sense consists in laws
that are “constitutive of” of the possibility of
experience. For Cohen, these necessary, a priori laws define what an
object of experience <em>is</em> for us.  (Klaus Christian Köhnke
identifies this point in Cohen as the source of the central Marburg
School doctrine that a priori laws “generate” objects of
possible experience [Köhnke 1991, 178–84].)</p>

<p>

Cohen has a striking view of what a priori laws of the third level
actually consist in, and of the possible experience they are
constitutive of. Although he would emphasize this striking view more
in later writings it is nevertheless explicit in the first edition of
his <em>Kant's Theory of Experience</em>. He did not think the third
level of the a priori consists in cognitive structures in the
subject's mind, structures we could discover by doing physiology (as,
for example Helmholtz and Lange thought) or by introspection (as, for
example, J.F. Fries and, in Cohen's own time, Jürgen Bona Meyer
thought) (de Schmidt 1976: Ch. 2.3). Rather, he insisted that these a
priori laws were the principles of mathematics and the fundamental
laws of pure natural science, that is, mechanics.  Further, these
principles and laws are constitutive of the possibility of experience
in a very specific and, Cohen insists, Kantian sense of
“experience”: for Cohen, experience consists in the
theories furnished by the mathematically precise science of nature,
considered as if laid out “in printed books” (Cohen 1877,
27). That is, on Cohen's interpretation, Kant's a priori has nothing
at all to do with the cognitive activity of the knower. Rather, it
consists in the laws of mathematically precise natural science
considered independently of – as if free-floating from –
the mind of any particular knower.</p>

<p>

Cohen's interpretation of Kant is thus robustly anti-psychologistic:
he thinks any consideration of how the human mind operates to produce
representations is completely irrelevant to a philosophical theory of
knowledge. In fact, some commentators have argued that Cohen offers
the first genuinely anti-psychologistic interpretation of
Kant's <em>Critique of Pure Reason</em> (Hatfield 1990, 110; Anderson
2005, 298; and Beiser 2015, 466; see Beiser especially for an account
of how the young Cohen arrived at his
anti-psychologism). (Nevertheless, there is a case to be made that
Otto Liebmann had an anti-psychologistic interpretation of Kant before
Cohen [see Edgar 2015, 116-117; contrast Beiser 2015, 299-302].)
Despite the robustness of Cohen's anti-psychologism, it is not always
easy to locate in his writings.  On almost every page of <em>Kant's
Theory of Experience</em> (and later, <em>The Logic of Pure
Knowledge</em>) Cohen helps himself to the language of transcendental
idealism and transcendental psychology, giving the impression of an
active, conscious mind, with faculties of sensibility and
understanding that produce the subject's experience of objects. But,
Cohen insists, this language is actually anti-psychologistic:
understood properly, the Kantian's talk of cognitive faculties really
refers to the methods of mathematically precise natural science. Thus
the “faculty” of sensibility is really just the methods by
which the mathematician constructs spatial magnitudes, and the
“faculty” of understanding is really just the most basic
set of concepts the physicist uses to represent physical objects
(Cohen 1885, 586ff.) Kantian theory of knowledge thus turns out to be
the philosophical investigation of the methods natural science uses to
represent objects.</p>

<h2><a name="TraMet">3. The Transcendental Method</a></h2>

<p>

So Cohen takes the theories of mathematical natural science to be
“experience.” And he takes the fundamental concepts and
laws of those theories to be the a priori laws that constitute
experience's possibility. Why?</p>

<p>

For Cohen, these distinctive views are consequences of his
interpretation of Kant's philosophical method. Cohen and his students,
Paul Natorp and Ernst Cassirer, would take this philosophical method
to be the defining characteristic of Cohen's Kantianism, rather than
any of Kant's particular arguments or doctrines (Cassirer 2005 [1912],
115; Natorp 1912, 194-5). As Cohen himself puts it, “[p]hilsophy
is not ‘doctrine’, but critique” (Cohen 1885, 577),
and it is above all the Kantian philosophical method that
distinguishes Cohen's philosophy from pre-critical philosophy.</p>

<p>

We can see Cohen's view of philosophical method in its nascent form
emerge from his interpretation of Kant's Analytic of Principles and
the <em>Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics</em>. However, Cohen
would articulate the method clearly only much later, in his mature
writing. Only later would Cohen (and his students) call it the
“transcendental method.”</p>

<p>

According to Cohen, for Kant mathematical natural science is the
starting-point of philosophical investigation. It is the
explanandum that Kantian philosophy seeks to explain. It is then
up to philosophy to identify and articulate the a priori laws in that
experience that are responsible for making it objective. If it is less than
obvious that this is Kant's method in the <em>Critique of Pure
Reason</em>, Cohen insists, it is at least clear in the
<em>Prolegomena</em>. There, Kant is explicit that he begins by
assuming that mathematical natural science provides us with genuine
objective knowledge, and that it contains synthetic a priori
principles; Kant is likewise explicit that his task is to identify the
necessary conditions of those principles' possibility, and that doing
so will explain the objectivity of mathematical natural science.
(Kant is also explicit that this method, which in the
<em>Prolegomena</em> he calls the ‘analytic method,’ is
not the method he uses in the <em>Critique of Pure Reason</em>, nor
would it be suitable for the full project of
the <em>Critique</em>. Cohen seems cheerfully undaunted by this
textual anomaly.)</p>

<p>

Taking Kant's method in the <em>Prolegomena</em> as his guide, Cohen
claims that the method of Kantian philosophy is this. He thinks
philosophy takes the theories of mathematical natural science as its
starting point. It begins, as he puts it, with the “fact of
mathematical natural science” (Cohen 1883,
119–120). Although Cohen does not emphasize it in the first
edition of <em>Kant's Theory of Experience</em>, he thinks (and it is
consistent with his views) that this “fact of science”
changes as science progresses. On the transcendental method, the
philosopher takes the best physical theories of the day as her
starting point, and thus the “fact of science” will be
different for philosophers in different periods of the history of
science.</p>

<p>

Further, Cohen identifies the a priori of his third level, the laws
of mathematical natural science, with the synthetic a priori principles
Kant thinks mathematical natural science contains. Cohen says of
these synthetic a priori principles that they are “that which is
present” in experience (Cohen 1987 [1871b], 206). So philosophy
seeks to explain the possibility of experience by identifying and
articulating the a priori laws “present” in it. As Cohen would
later put it, experience, conceived as the evolving doctrines of
mathematical natural science, is “given as a task”
[<em>aufgegeben</em>] to philosophy: while experience is given with
synthetic a priori principles already contained in it, it is the task
of philosophy to identify and articulate those principles, and in so
doing to explain how they make objective experience possible.</p>

<p> 

It can be difficult to see how this method allows for any
philosophically critical evaluation of theories in the history of
science – a kind of evaluation Cohen never shies away from. On
the transcendental method, philosophy does not seek philosophical
grounds for casting doubt on or rejecting mathematical or scientific
theories. Rather, it starts by taking those theories and their
objectivity for granted. It starts with them as <em>facts</em>, as
explananda in need of philosophical explanation. But Cohen often
criticizes and rejects theories he does not like, and does so for
philosophical reasons. This is especially clear in the historical
sections of his 1883 <em>Principle of the Infinitesimal Method and its
History</em>, where Cohen uses apparently philosophical principles to
criticize and reject various efforts in the history of mathematics to
define, for example, limits and infinitesimals. But Cohen's criticisms
do not violate the transcendental method. The principles that serve as
the basis for his criticisms emerge from a philosophical investigation
of theories given in the history of science. They are thus principles
that turn out to be required for the philosophical explanation of
those theories and their objectivity.</p>

<p>

Cohen's student and colleague at Marburg, Natorp, would emphasize a
major advantage of the transcendental method for Cohen (Natorp 1912,
196–7). This method allows Cohen to avoid what he and his
students took to be the two major errors of other post-Kantian
philosophy.  First, because Cohen sought to explain the possibility of
experience by appeal to a priori laws in it, he avoided the
physiologically-oriented psychologism of Helmholtz and Lange, among
others. But second, the transcendental method anchors Kantian
philosophy to mathematical natural science as its starting point. This
anchor prevents philosophy from taking off on the speculative,
metaphysical flights of fancy that, in the minds of many Kantian
philosophers in the 1860s and 1870s, decisively undermined the
Idealist <em>Naturphilosophie</em> of the first half of the nineteenth
century. For Cohen and his students, the transcendental method thus
makes possible a philosophy that is properly scientific, without
absorbing it completely into physiology and psychology.</p>

<h2><a name="CriIde">4. A Period of Transition</a></h2>

<p>

Cohen's 1883 <em>The Principle of the Infinitesimal Method and its
History</em> and the second, 1885 edition of <em>Kant's Theory of
Experience</em> reveal the considerable extent to which he modified and
deepened his epistemology and philosophy of science over the course of
the 1870s and early 1880s. In one move that marks his increasing
clarity about his own views, he abandons the term “theory of knowledge”
[<em>Erkenntnistheorie</em>] as irredeemably psychologistic, since it
was too closely associated with psychologically-oriented projects such
as Helmholtz's. Instead, he proposes to call the project of his
theoretical philosophy “critique of knowledge”
[<em>Erkenntniskritik</em>].</p>

<p>

Beyond merely terminological changes, in <em>The Principle of the
Infinitesimal Method</em> and the second edition of <em>Kant's Theory
of Experience</em>, Cohen offers a better developed and more clearly
articulated account of the substance of his epistemological view.  He
calls the view “critical idealism.” The view is a form of
idealism, because Cohen still maintains that a priori laws contained
within scientific theories make it possible for those theories to
represent objects. But the idealism is “critical” because
it is Kantian – that is, for Cohen, because it is committed
above all to the transcendental method.</p>

<p>

Cohen's increased clarity about critical idealism emerged in part from
work on the history of philosophy he did in the 1870s and early
1880s. He presents his view of that history in both <em>The Principle
of the Infinitesimal Method</em> and a long introduction he added to
the second edition of <em>Kant's Theory of Experience</em>. As Cohen
sees it, Plato and Leibniz play roles in the development of critical
idealism that are second only to Kant's. Like Kant, both sought to
understand mathematics as paradigms of knowledge in general.  Further,
as Cohen argued in his 1878 essay “Plato's Doctrine of Ideas and
Mathematics,” Plato anticipated Kant in maintaining that the
objects of our thought are explained by appeal to “ideas”
(which Cohen, employing his characteristic form of philosophical
charity, identified with Kantian a priori laws) (Edel 1988, Ch. 4). In
contrast with this Platonic-rationalist antecedent to critical
idealism, Cohen argues, stands an Aristotelian-empiricist
tradition. Members of this uncritical tradition believe, in one way or
another, that we must explain the objects of our thought by appeal to
objects that exist independently of the mind.</p>

<p>

At the same time, Cohen's willingness to reject certain Kantian
doctrines reveals the extent to which his critical idealism was a
commitment only to what he took to be Kant's philosophical method. For
example, in one of the many sections he added to the second edition
of <em>Kant's Theory of Experience</em>, Cohen argues that the proper
way to understand the notion of the thing-in-itself is not (as Kant
seems to suggest) as an object that exists independently of the
subject's representations, somehow affecting the subject and thereby
giving rise to her sensations.  Rather, Cohen argues that we must
think of the thing-in-itself as the totality of all experience, taken
as an object of thought (Cohen 1885, 503ff). Since it is the totality
of all experience, rather than merely the experience we happen to have
at our particular point in the history of science, the thing-in-itself
is the ideal that science and critical philosophy aim at.</p>

<p>

<em>The Principle of the Infinitesimal Method</em> is perhaps most
significant for how it presents a detailed illustration of what the
critique of knowledge done according to the transcendental method
looks like. The book is a philosophically critical history of the
development of calculus. In it, Cohen aims to establish the validity
of calculus' foundational concepts – concepts such
as <em>limit</em> and <em>infinitesimal</em> – in the face of
philosophical objections against them. He also aims to establish a
connection between the concept of infinitesimals and natural science's
capacity to represent reality. In fact, these two aims are
connected. For Cohen, the concept of an infinitesimal magnitude is
valid for use in calculus, because it is a necessary condition of the
possibility of natural science's representation of real objects
(Richardson 2006).</p>

<p>

Cohen sees this connection between infinitesimals and reality in the
section of the <em>Critique of Pure Reason</em> that Kant called the
Anticipations of Perception. In the Anticipations, Kant introduces the
idea of magnitudes that can vary continuously from a finite magnitude
to zero. He calls these continuously variable magnitudes <em>intensive
magnitudes</em>. Kant argues that there is an important connection
between continuously variable magnitudes, sensation, and
reality. While Cohen thinks Kant's concern with sensation is a
mistake, he thinks the connection between continuously variable
magnitudes – that is, infinitesimals – and reality is
exactly right. The connection is this. For Cohen, mathematical natural
science can represent real objects only if it represents them as
having unique identity conditions. Those identity conditions are
defined by unique locations in space and time. But, Cohen insists, the
mathematical units that natural science uses to represent space and
time must themselves be defined by appeal to infinitesimal
magnitudes.</p>

<p>

That final claim – that the mathematical units of space and time
must be defined by appeal to infinitesimals – follows for Cohen
from the principle of continuity. This is the Leibnizian principle
that Cohen glosses as “there are no jumps in
consciousness” (Cohen 1883, §42), which for him means that
mathematical and scientific theories must represent objects as
continuous. That the principle of continuity serves this function for
mathematical natural science is, for Cohen, a fact of science revealed
by his historical investigation of the development of calculus.</p>

<h2><a name="ConGenOri">5. Pure Thinking, Generation, and Origin</a></h2>

<p>

However, Cohen would not remain satisfied with his account of
calculus' foundational concepts and their significance for a
philosophical theory of knowledge. His final major work in
epistemology was the 1902
<em>Logic of Pure Knowledge</em>, the first part of his projected
<em>System of Philosophy</em>. In that book, Cohen claims that there
is an important connection between the concepts of infinitesimals and
infinities, and something he now calls “pure thinking.”
For Cohen, thinking is <em>pure</em> just in case it is independent of
any and all influences that are external to thought or reason. Nothing
is <em>given</em> to pure thinking – not the data of sensible
intuition, not the activity of a Fichtean I, not the Absolute. Cohen
claims that the infinitesimal calculus is the paradigmatic example of
“the triumph of pure thinking” (Cohen 1902, 35). But more
than that, he thinks an analysis of the infinite is precisely what
first raises the philosophical question of pure thinking – that
is, the question of how pure thinking functions to let mathematical
natural science represent objects (Cohen 1902, 35).</p>

<p>

The concept of pure thinking, and the closely related concepts
of <em>generation</em> and <em>origin</em>, are central to Cohen's
project in the <em>Logic</em>. All three concepts have to do with the
principles that, on Cohen's view, define what an object is for
mathematical natural scientific theories. In <em>Kant's Theory of
Experience</em>, Cohen had been content to identify and exhibit
synthetic a priori principles as “present” in
experience. But now in the <em>Logic</em>, he is concerned with the
question of those principles' foundation – that is, with their
“origin.” His answer to that question is staunchly
idealist. Cohen now argues that pure thinking <em>generates</em> those
principles from itself. Or in his preferred idiom, pure thinking is
“generation.”</p>

<p>

For Cohen, pure thinking generates the pure principles of knowledge
through judgment – the epistemic structure that, he thinks
(following Kant), relates different concepts to one
another. Consequently, in the <em>Logic</em> Cohen aims above all to
articulate the twelve different types of foundational judgments that,
he thinks, make it possible for mathematical natural scientific
theories to represent objects. To be sure, Cohen's twelve types of
judgment partly reflect the section of the first <em>Critique</em>
that Kant called the table of the functions of judgment. But Cohen
does not merely reproduce Kant's doctrine. Perhaps most significantly,
Cohen abandons Kant's account of the three possible
“qualities” of judgment and replaces it with his own
account of the judgments of origin, identity, and contradiction. For
Cohen, these judgments express the most foundational moments in the
origin of pure thinking. Moreover, he develops his accounts of them at
least partly from reflection on the concepts of the infinite,
infinitesimals, and continuity. This should hardly be surprising,
given his claim that pure thinking's function in knowledge is first
revealed by an analysis of the infinite.</p>

<p>

While the structure of Cohen's <em>Logic</em> at least partly reflects
Kant's table of the functions of judgment, Cohen is also pains to
emphasize another way he thinks his views break decisively with
Kant's. In the <em>Logic</em>, Cohen rejects Kant's view that (in
human knowledge) there is a faculty of sensible intuition that is
independent of the faculty of understanding. In effect, Cohen now
decisively rejects Kant's claim that sensible intuition is the
capacity that immediately relates <em>objects</em> to the knower (Kant
1998 [1781/1787], A19/B33). For, on Cohen's view, mathematical natural
science can represent objects only in virtue of judgments that express
principles of pure thinking. In the absence of pure thinking, Cohen
maintains, there can be no representation of objects. On this view,
since a philosophical account of knowledge does not appeal to an
independent faculty of sensible intuition, Cohen insists that the
project he had previously called the “critique of
knowledge” now becomes the “logic of pure
knowledge.” (Cohen's view in the <em>Logic</em> appears somewhat
similar to so-called “conceptualist” interpretations of
Kant in the contemporary Kant literature. [For example, Longuenesse
1998, Ch. 8 and Friedman 2012.] So how radically one thinks
Cohen's <em>Logic</em> breaks with Kant will depend on one's views of
the conceptualist interpretation of Kant. I leave it as an open
question how much Cohen's views in the <em>Logic</em> differ from the
conceptualist interpretation of Kant.)</p>

<p>

Cohen never gave up the view that the concepts of the infinite,
infinitesimals, and continuity were central to a philosophical account
of pure thinking and knowledge. Yet his account of those mathematical
concepts was never convincing to mathematicians and philosophers of
mathematics in the analytic tradition. Gottlob Frege complained that
Cohen's views in the <em>Principle of the Infinitesimal Method</em>
were too unclear to be intelligible (Frege 1984 [1885]). Bertrand
Russell objected that Cohen failed to understand that mathematicians
now had a formal treatment of continuity and limits that freed them of
any commitment to infinitesimals (Russell 1903, Ch. 41). Even
Cassirer, Cohen's own student, abandoned Cohen's account of
infinitesimals, likely in response to Russell's
objections. Consequently, Cassirer also abandoned many of the details
of Cohen's theory of knowledge in the <em>Logic</em>. </p>

<h2><a name="EthJurLawHumAct">6. Ethics, Jurisprudence, and the Laws of Human Action</a></h2>

<p>

Cohen thought the transcendental method must be used in ethics, no
less than in epistemology and philosophy of science. He thus
sought to extend its application beyond a treatment of the laws of
nature to the laws of human action. He ultimately argued that the
result of this application was a Kantian ethical justification for
democratic socialism.</p>

<p>

Cohen's first attempt to apply the transcendental method to ethics
was his <em>Kant's Foundations of Ethics</em>, which first appeared in
1877. In it, he is motivated by a dissatisfaction that Kant could
not provide a transcendental deduction of the moral law the way he had
for the categories in the first <em>Critique</em> (Cohen 1877,
179). In the first <em>Critique</em>, Kant had argued that the
categories are justified, because they are necessary conditions for the
possibility of experience. But in the <em>Critique of Practical
Reason</em>, he argued that the moral law cannot be justified as a
necessary condition of experience, because we can experience ourselves
only as beings whose actions have natural causes, and cannot experience
ourselves as free moral agents. Thus, Kant insisted, the moral
law must be the sole “fact of reason”—a fact that has no, but needs
no, justification beyond the force with which it impresses itself on us
(Kant 1999 [1788], 5:31, 5:47–8). Cohen thinks this was an
inadequate justification of the moral law. He attempts to show
that an improved justification results from transcendental reflection
on the idea of a pure will, that is, the idea of a will that is not
conditioned by any antecedent causes and is therefore free. With
Kant, he argues that such a will is possible only on the condition that
the moral law applies to it. But unlike Kant, he does not assert
the actuality of a pure, free will. Rather, he argues that
freedom of the will is itself a regulative ideal, an end at which we
aim our actions (Cohen 1877, 199–201ff.).</p>

<p>

However, Cohen did not remain satisfied with this account of the
foundations of the moral law, nor with his early view of how the
transcendental method applies in the domain of ethics. In his
1904 <em>Ethics of Pure Will</em>, the second part of his <em>System of
Philosophy</em>, he offers a significantly revised account of
both. Here, Cohen's account is shaped by two commitments.
First, he asserts that the subject matter of ethics is humanity, that
is, human moral agency (Cohen 1902, 3). He thinks the aim of
ethics is to construct a normative theory of the human moral agent and
its will. Second, unlike in his earlier <em>Kant's Foundations of
Ethics</em>, Cohen now takes seriously the requirement that the
transcendental method begins with a fact of science. For Cohen,
just as epistemology and philosophy of science must begin by accepting
the theories of pure natural science as given, ethics according to the
transcendental method must begin with a science of humanity.</p>

<p>

Cohen canvasses three possibilities for such a science of
humanity. Ethics might start with a Fichtean “science” of the
subject. But Cohen rejects this possibility as a lapse back into
pre-critical speculation (Cohen 1902, 13ff.). Alternatively,
ethics might start with naturalistic human sciences such as
psychology. But, Cohen objects, making these sciences the
starting point for ethical reflection would violate Kant's insistence
that ethics distinguishes between normative and non-normative
considerations, between what Cohen calls Being and the Ought (Cohen
1902, 9ff.).</p>

<p>

Thus Cohen argues that ethics begins with the science of
jurisprudence, that is, the science that investigates law and human
beings considered precisely as agents whose actions are bound by law's
normative constraints (Cohen 1902, 66ff.). Cohen does not have in
mind a jurisprudence that is concerned only with positive law.
Rather, the transcendental method in ethics begins with <em>pure</em>
jurisprudence, which investigates the very concept of law and its
essential features such as universality. Pure jurisprudence is
thus the science of universal laws of human action. (Pure
jurisprudence in this sense was one topic of German legal theory around
the turn of the twentieth century. Rudolf Stammler's 1902 <em>The
Theory of Justice</em> is representative.) For Cohen, this
evolving body of pure legal doctrine constitutes a fact of
science. Ethics according to the transcendental method accepts it
as given. Then, by reflecting on this evolving body of legal
doctrine, ethics seeks to construct a theory of the human being as a
moral agent (Schwarzschild 1975).</p>

<p>

Pure jurisprudence guides ethics in constructing a theory of
humanity by overcoming a problem that, Cohen thinks, any theory of
humanity faces. He claims the concept of humanity has a tension
contained in it: a human being is at once an individual and a member of
various pluralities, such as religious communities or economic
collectives (Cohen 1902, 3ff). Further, the wills of pluralities
of individuals do not necessarily cohere: individuals do not
necessarily will things that are consistent with what other individuals
will, or with what the community as a whole wills. But, Cohen
suggests, without an account of what an individual may will
consistently with the wills of others, we have no coherent account of
the moral agent as both an individual and a member of a
plurality. Thus any theory of humanity requires an account of how
to reconcile individuals' wills within a plurality. As Cohen puts
it, individuals' wills must be unified into a totality. Or, in
somewhat less opaque language, we must understand how the universal
laws of an ideal state can reconcile the wills of individuals and
pluralities (Wiedebach 1997, Pt. 3). Finally, according to Cohen,
if we want to think systematically about what those universal laws are,
we must start by reflecting on the evolving body of legal doctrine
provided by pure jurisprudence—the science of universal laws.</p>

<p>

Cohen's emphasis on the universal character of ethical laws is clearly
Kantian in spirit, and he certainly intends the universal laws of an
ideal state to be the laws people must give to themselves in Kant's
realm of ends. But still, it is not obvious how exactly to
characterize the relation of Cohen's ethics to Kant's. On one
plausible reading of Kant, a general theory of the moral will was the
basis for his theory of law in the Doctrine of Right. But on Cohen's
view of how to apply the transcendental method to ethics, ethics
begins with a theory of law from pure jurisprudence and then, by
reflecting on pure law, it seeks to construct a general theory of the
moral agent and its will. Thus Cohen's account of the foundations of
ethics might differ fundamentally from Kant's—indeed, it might
turn Kant's account on its head.</p>

<h2><a name="KanFouDemSocAes">7. The Kantian Foundations of Democratic Socialism, Aesthetics</a></h2>

<p>

However, while a doctrine of pure, universal laws makes possible a
coherent theory of the concept of humanity, Cohen thinks the laws of
any actual state will fall short of pure law's ideal form. He
maintains that states, in the course of their development through
history, tend to amend their laws so as to better approximate the
ideal laws. Cohen does not argue from some antecedent philosophical
theory of human nature that history is somehow compelled to exhibit
this progress (Cohen 1902, 37). Rather, he simply accepts it as a
datum of history: philosophy can no more deny this progress than it
can deny progress in the history of physics and mathematics. At the
same time, Cohen's optimism was tempered by an awareness of
injustice in the non-ideal world: moral progress must be unending,
precisely because no actual state will ever realize the ideal
completely (Schwarzschild 1979, 139–40). There is, in Cohen's
terms, an unbridgeable gap between Being and the Ought.</p>

<p>

As Cohen saw it, political progress was, and ought to be, moving
towards democratic socialism. The laws of an undemocratic state
cannot genuinely reconcile the wills of individuals and pluralities of
individuals, even if the state has the power to control their
behavior. So, Cohen argued in his 1904 essay “The General, Equal,
and Direct Right Vote,” any state whose laws make the wills of
individuals and pluralities cohere must be one with universal suffrage
(van der Linden 1988, 215). He thus opposed Wilhelmine Germany's
system of tiered suffrage, under which lower-class men from some
regions voted only in national elections and women did not vote at
all.</p>

<p>

Moreover, Cohen argued that, as states amend their laws to better
approximate ideal laws, legal frameworks should emerge to govern the
economic activity of democratically-constituted pluralities of
people. In other words, he thought that an ideal state would
allow democratic workers' collectives to own the means of
production. In his <em>Ethics of Pure Will</em> as well as his
1896 “Postscript” to F.A. Lange's <em>History of
Materialism</em>, Cohen argues that this socialism follows
straightforwardly from a proper understanding of Kant's categorical
imperative (Cohen 1902, 320). For Cohen, not treating people
merely as a means entails not exploiting their labor (Holzhey 2005,
26). Along with Lange, Cohen thus advocated a socialism with
Kantian, rather than Marxist, foundations. (The 1890 repeal of
Bismark's Anti-Socialist Laws would have offered him some evidence that
Germany was moving towards that democratic socialist ideal.)
Cohen's Kantian socialism was an important influence on socialist
political leaders such as Eduard Bernstein, a social democratic member
of the <em>Reichstag</em> (Gay 1970).</p>

<p>

Politics was not the only sphere in which Cohen thought philosophy
must engage with culture. In the third part of his <em>System of
Philosophy</em>, the <em>Aesthetics of Pure Feeling</em> (1912), he
argued that critical philosophy could not leave art without a
philosophical foundation (Cohen 1982 [1912], 1.4).  In his aesthetics,
Cohen sought to avoid Schelling and Hegel's view that art is an
expression of ideas that can be distilled from it and expressed in
purely conceptual terms. Likewise, Cohen rejected Helmholtz's
physiological approach to aesthetics, exemplified by his physiological
and experimental investigation of tone-perception in music. However,
in Cohen's theory of knowledge and ethics, he had avoided these
approaches by adhering to the transcendental method—that is, by
starting with a “fact” of (natural or juridical) science
and then articulating the a priori, universal laws that constitute
that science's object. But for Cohen, there is no “science of
art.” Thus for Cohen, a philosophical aesthetics must begin with
only the “fact” that art is central to culture (Poma 1997,
Ch. 7; Guyer 2008).</p>

<p>

From this starting point, Cohen develops an account of “pure
feeling.” Pure feeling cannot be the consciousness of the
objects of natural science or the moral consciousness of ethical
ideals. But these two domains of objects – the world as it is
and the world as it ought to be – are the only possible objects
we can be conscious of. Thus, Cohen argues, pure feeling must be the
consciousness <em>that we are conscious</em>. That is, it is our basic
level of consciousness of the fact that we can be conscious of both
the objects of natural science and of ethical ideals (Guyer
2008). Further, Cohen characterizes that basic level of consciousness
as “lawfulness” (<em>Gesetzlichkeit</em>) (Cohen 1982
[1912], 1.68ff; cf.  de Launay 2005). According to Cohen, this
lawfulness of pure feeling is what produces the object of aesthetic
judgment.</p>

<p>

Apart from systematic philosophical considerations, Cohen's
aesthetics is of interest for the light it promises to shed on his
philosophy of religion. Cohen came to believe that concepts
central to philosophy of religion should be articulated by
interpreting historical scriptural texts, including prayers and
biblical poetry and prose (Kepnes 2007, Ch. 2) (see §9
below). Thus recent commentators have used Cohen's account of
lyric poetry in the <em>Aesthetics of Pure Feeling</em> to help make
sense of his account of an individual's love for God (Poma 2000), as
well as his conception of compassion (Wiedebach 2002).</p>


<h2><a name="PhiRel">8. Philosophy of Religion and the Correlation between the Individual and God</a></h2>

<p>

Cohen retired from Marburg in 1912, in order to teach at the Academy
of Jewish Sciences, a rabbinical seminary in Berlin, where he remained
until his death. In 1908 he had written his <em>Ethics of
Maimonides</em>, and after 1912 he worked above all else on religious
philosophy, writing <em>The Concept of Religion in the System of
Philosophy</em> (1915) and his monumental <em>Religion of Reason Out
of the Sources of Judaism</em>, which appeared in 1919, after his
death. The
<em>Religion's</em> significance is difficult to overstate: it has
been called “the single most consequential work of Judaic
thought in the period of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries”
(Dietrich 2000). In it, Cohen articulates a conception of a
“religion of reason,” and argues that fundamental concepts
of Judaism, as they are revealed in historical Jewish texts, were the
original sources of that religion of reason.</p>

<p>

Cohen initially faces a problem in defining the relation of religion
to systematic philosophy (Holzhey 2000). In both the <em>Concept
of Religion</em> and the <em>Religion of Reason</em>, he identifies the
two central concepts of religion as humanity and God (Cohen 1972
[1919], 11ff.) But he had already offered philosophical accounts
of those concepts in his ethics. For Cohen, ethics is the theory
precisely of humanity. But also, in his <em>Ethics of Pure
Will</em>, Cohen defined God as the conjunction of two ideas: the
concept of ideal ethical laws unifying all humanity into a harmonious
realm of ends, and the faith that, at the end of history, this ideal
would be realized. Thus Cohen's ethics seem to offer complete,
systematic accounts of both of religion's central concepts.
Consequently, Cohen appears to face a dilemma: religion has a
distinctive role to play in philosophy just in case his philosophical
ethics offered only incomplete accounts of humanity and God. But
this is unacceptable to Cohen.</p>

<p>

Cohen must thus offer an account of the distinctiveness of religion
in relation to systematic philosophy, and do so in a way that does not
entail the incompleteness of his ethics. The crux of his account
of religion's distinctiveness seems to be the vaguely Tolstoyan
assumption that insofar as individuals are moral, they are alike, but
that every individual is immoral in his or her own way. In the
<em>Religion</em>, Cohen claims that systematic philosophical ethics
is concerned with individuals only insofar as they are members of
pluralities or humanity as a whole—that is, only insofar as they
are bound by ethical laws. But this is not the only way to conceive of
individuals. We can also recognize an individual's particular moral
failings, and we can recognize the particular ways an individual
suffers because of those failings (Zank 2000). When we recognize an
individual this way, Cohen says (appropriating Feuerbach's vocabulary)
we recognize the individual as a “Thou,” rather than
merely as a “He,” a generic representative of humanity. On
Cohen's account, it thus turns out that systematic philosophical
ethics does not address certain pervasive features of our lived moral
experience: our varied, multiple, and particular moral failings, as
well the suffering they bring us (Bonaunet 2005, 49ff.). This is not,
he thinks, a criticism of ethics for being incomplete. It is only the
recognition of what ethics is, and is not, concerned with.</p>

<p>

Religion, however, is concerned precisely with the individual's
particular moral failings (Zank 1996 and 2000). While we can recognize
another individual as a “Thou,” and so assess her
particular moral failings, Cohen thinks the most important person to
recognize as a “Thou” is ourselves. As he puts it, we
discover the “I” only by means of the “Thou.”
That is, we recognize our moral selves by recognizing our own
particular moral failings. As he puts it, “[i]n myself, I have
to study sin, and through sin I must learn to know myself”
(Cohen 1972 [1919], 22). Without first discovering our own particular
moral failings, we could not strive for moral improvement. But for
Cohen, this process of moral improvement is inherently
religious. Prayer gives us the strength to overcome our hypocrisy and
self-deceit. And only when we do that can we confess, that is,
acknowledge our own moral failings. This in turn makes it possible for
us to atone, that is, to strive to realize our ethical ideals in ways
that respond appropriately to our particular failings (Horwitz 2000;
Zank 2000). Thus, for Cohen, knowledge of our own moral selves is the
“deepest ground” of religion: “[t]he discovery of
humanity through sin is the source from which every religious
development flows” (Cohen 1972 [1919], 20).</p>

<p>

By striving for moral improvement, the individual relates herself to
her ethical ideals. But since for Cohen our concept of ideal ethical
laws just is our idea of God (or at least a component of our idea of
God), an individual's striving for moral improvement relates her to
God. In Cohen's terms, striving for moral improvement establishes a
“correlation” between the individual and God. This
correlation is a profoundly personal relationship: since the
individual confesses and atones for her own particular sins, she
relates herself to God in a way that is similarly particular to
her. In relating herself to God, Cohen thinks, the individual thereby
constitutes herself as a unique moral and religious self, and God
becomes her “guide on the long road from sin to virtue”
(Cohen 1919, 20).</p>

<p>

Thus Cohen maintains that there is a distinctive role in philosophy
for a religion of reason: its distinctive concern is precisely with
the particularities of individual humans' lived moral experience, and
their attempts to overcome their various and different moral failings
as they strive to realize ideal ethical laws.</p>

<p>

Nevertheless, almost since before Cohen's ink was dry, there have been
significant disagreements about the proper interpretation of Cohen's
account of the relation between religion and his systematic
philosophy, and of his account of the individual's relation to
God.</p>

<p>

Perhaps the most influential reaction to Cohen's was his friend Franz
Rosenzweig's. Rosenzweig argued that Cohen's concern in
the <em>Religion</em> with the concrete individual, expressed in the
idea of the individual's “correlation” with God,
constituted a decisive break from the <em>Ethics of Pure Will</em>'s
concern with universal laws of human action (Rosenzweig 1924), and
thus that Cohen's views in the <em>Religion</em> were importantly
discontinuous with his views in his systematic ethics. (This, even
despite Cohen's claims to the contrary.) More recently, Robert
Erlewine (2010) has offered a different account of how
Cohen's <em>Religion</em> might break decisively with his systematic
ethics. Cohen's ethics are concerned with how pluralities of different
wills are unified into law-governed totalities (cf §6 above). In
his <em>Ethics of Pure Will,</em> Cohen argues that different wills
are so unified in the ideal state. But, Erlewine argues, Cohen defends
a different view in his <em>Ethics of Maimonides</em> and
his <em>Religion</em>. For Cohen in those works, on Erlewine's
account, different wills are unified in the law-governed community of
the religious, and specifically Jewish, congregation.</p>

<p>

In contrast, others have defended the consistency of Cohen's views,
arguing that the <em>Religion</em> completes the systematic ethical
project he had started in his <em>Ethics of Pure Will</em>. Cohen's
ethics is concerned with the constitution of the will, that is, the
moral self. But this moral self is an ideal, and thus it is only in
the <em>Religion</em> that Cohen takes up the question of the human
self as a concrete individual. Consequently, Schwarzschild (1975)
argues that Cohen's account of the concrete individual in
the <em>Religion</em> completes the theory of moral selfhood begun in
the <em>Ethics of Pure Will</em>. Alternatively, Poma (1988) argues
that the religious idea of God, since it is the idea not only of
universal ethical ideals, but of humanity's progress towards those
ideals, provides a connection between the descriptive and normative
aspects of Cohen's philosophy.</p>

<p>

However, if Cohen's philosophy of religion <em>completes</em> the
project of his systematic ethics, it is difficult to see how to avoid
the implication that Cohen's systematic ethics were, considered on
their own, incomplete – a claim Cohen himself was at pains to
deny.</p>

<p>

Thus a third interpretation seeks to avoid both the claim that
Cohen's <em>Religion</em> is a decisive “break” with his
systematic ethics and the claim that his religion
“completes” those ethics. Michael Zank (1996 and
especially 2000) has emphasized that Cohen did not intend his
philosophy of religion as part of the <em>System of Philosophy</em>,
but nor can the philosophy of religion be in any sense a
“break” from the <em>Ethics of Pure Will</em> in
his <em>System</em>, since he started working on both projects at
roughly the same time around the turn of the century. Cohen's
systematic philosophy and his philosophy of religion thus stand as
complements to each other: whereas one conceives the human as an ideal
agent constituted by universal ethical laws, the other treats the
human as a concrete individual, constituted by the particularities of
his own moral failings and attempts to atone for them.</p>

<h2><a name="MonProMes">9. Monotheism and Prophetic Messianism</a></h2>

<p>

Cohen's second aim in the <em>Religion</em> is to show that Judaism
has what he calls a special “methodological” significance
for philosophy of religion, because it is the original historical
source of a religion of reason (Cohen 1972 [1919], 8). Judaism has
this special status because it was, Cohen contends, the original
monotheistic religion, and only monotheistic religions can be
religions of reason. The polytheism of the ancient world posited
different gods for different peoples in different places. But, Cohen
argues, since reason is a “universal human power” that
belongs to all humanity (Cohen 1972 [1919], 7–8), a religion of
reason cannot recognize different gods for different people, but must
recognize a single, unique God for all humanity. Since the idea of
such a God first emerged in history with Judaism, it is the original
source of a religion of reason. Consequently, the investigation of a
religion of reason must recover that religion's source by interpreting
the historical scriptures and liturgical practices of Judaism (Kepnes
2007, Ch. 2).</p>

<p>

According to Cohen, monotheism, and so too Judaism, was the historical
source of the idea that all humanity could be unified by a single set
of ethical laws. As Cohen sees it, God is the set of ideal ethical
laws. To assert that there is only one God for all of humanity is thus
to assert a universal ethical ideal, one on which individuals see all
people as “fellow humans,” and not as “others”
who can be excluded from the moral community (Cohen 1972 [1919],
14ff). Later religious scholars such as Wendell Dietrich would call
this doctrine “ethical monotheism” (Cf. Dietrich 1986 and
Theodore and Hadley 2001). Cohen thinks that because monotheism has
an ethical dimension, it culminates in—its highest form
is—a view he calls prophetic messianism. For Cohen, messianism
just is “the dominion of the good on earth.” It is the
view that the Messiah's coming consists in nothing but the ultimate
end of injustice (Cohen 1972 [1919], 21). Prophetic messianism is thus
an expression of faith that humanity is making progress towards
realizing ideal ethical laws.</p>

<p>

Cohen's conception of the essentially ethical nature of Judaism had
important consequences for his view of Judaism's relation to other
religions, as well as his views of Zionism and the Jews' place in
Wilhelmine Germany. Because Cohen thought the ethical nature of
Judaism was expressed by its monotheism, he believed that at least some
forms of Christianity had the same ethical nature. While for
Cohen Judaism was the original religion of reason, liberal
Protestantism expresses universal ethical ideals and is a religion of
reason as well. (He thought Catholicism failed to express properly
universal ideals. He seems not to have considered Islam.) At
the same time, because for Cohen Judaism ultimately aims at an ethical
ideal that includes all humanity, he rejected the nationalism he saw in
non-liberal forms of Judaism and was a vocal critic of Zionism.
In a public exchange with Martin Buber, Cohen argued that Jews had an
obligation to remain in their countries of birth, so that their
religious communities could serve as exemplars for the rest of humanity
of communities unified by ethical laws. He died in 1919, before
the increasing virulence of antisemitism in Germany could make him
reconsider this argument.</p>

<h2><a name="CohInf">10. Cohen's Influence</a></h2>

<p>

The range of Cohen's influence is wide. Few figures are as
important for Jewish ethics and philosophy of religion in the twentieth
century, and in the last four decades religious scholars have devoted
considerable attention to understanding Cohen's significance as a
religious thinker and public intellectual. More recently,
historians of philosophy in the analytic tradition have begun to
appreciate the importance of Cohen's neo-Kantianism as a source not
only of influential interpretations of Kant, but of the topics and
methods characteristic of philosophy of science in the twentieth
century.</p>

<p>

In Jewish religious thought, Cohen's influence is highly visible,
and substantive doctrines he developed in the <em>Ethics of Pure
Will</em> and the <em>Religion of Reason Out of the Sources of
Judaism</em> are still topics of debate. Martin Buber's 1923
<em>I and Thou</em> was explicitly indebted to, and a response to,
Cohen's <em>Religion</em>. Inspired by Cohen (see §8 above),
Buber elaborated an account of a relationship between the
“I” and the “Thou.” Like Cohen, for Buber this
relation is the central part of how an individual establishes a
profoundly personal relationship with God. Also like Cohen, Buber
thinks establishing that relationship with God is essential to
strengthening the ethical bonds in one's community. But unlike Cohen,
Buber thought the I-Thou relationship was essentially beyond
language's ability to express—a view strikingly at odds with
Cohen's rationalist philosophical tendencies.</p>

<p>

More recently, religious ethicists have been interested in Cohen's
view that monotheism expresses a universalist morality, and that it
expressed for the first time in history the idea that all humanity
must be subject to the same ethical laws. The religious scholar
Wendell Dietrich (Dietrich 1986) identifies this view as
“ethical monotheism,” and sees Cohen as the first in a
trajectory of religious philosophers who argue that the concept of a
unique God is necessary for—or whose essential content is
revealed to us as (Gibbs 2001)—ethical laws and the freedom to
live according to them. Avi Bernstein-Nahar (1998 and 2006) argues
that Cohen's ethics, and perhaps his ethical monotheism in particular,
provide the intellectual basis for a Jewish identity that can be
shared by various Jewish communities that might otherwise have little
in common. On this view, Cohen's ethics thus have a central role to
play in Jewish education.</p>

<p>

Cohen's influence on Anglo-American analytic philosophy is less
visible. Perhaps the only area of Anglo-American philosophy where a
substantive doctrine of Cohen's is still respected is Kant
interpretation. Before Cohen's <em>Kant's Theory of Experience</em>,
interpretations of Kant were overwhelmingly—some have claimed
exclusively—psychologistic in one way or another (see §2
above). Some of those interpretations attributed to Kant a form of
idealistic transcendental psychology, what Hegel called
“subjective idealism.” Others attributed to Kant some form
of empirical psychologism. But Cohen denies that Kant is interested in
how the mind—either the transcendental mind or the empirical
mind—operates to synthesize the knower's representations. For
Cohen, Kant is interested in knowledge considered as if laid out
“in printed books” (Cohen 1877, 27).</p>

<p>

Cohen is thus at the head of a tradition of anti-psychologistic
interpretations of Kant that includes Kant scholars such as Peter
Strawson and, more recently, Henry Allison. It would overstate
Cohen's influence to suggest that he directly inspired, say, Strawson's
interpretation of Kant. But the anti-psychologistic philosophical
environment in which Strawson produced his Kant interpretation owed a
great deal to Cohen's influence. (Cf. Edel 1993 for a discussion
of Cohen's anti-psychologism in relation to the tradition of analytic
philosophy to which Strawson belongs.) Further, as
English-language Kant interpretation became more sophisticated over the
second half of the twentieth century and engaged more seriously with
existing German literature, historians of philosophy like Allison found
themselves at home in a much longer German tradition of
anti-psychologistic Kant interpretation going back directly to
Cohen. That anti-psychologistic tradition dominated
Anglo-American Kant interpretation for the latter decades of the
twentieth century and is still the majority view today.</p>

<p>

However, it would be a mistake to limit a survey of Cohen's influence
on contemporary analytic philosophy to the doctrines of his that are
still alive today. Arguably his most profound influence on analytic
philosophy has not been to give us particular philosophical doctrines,
but to contribute to the basic shape, the basic orientation of an
entire major subdiscipline of philosophy. Nowhere is this more evident
than in history and philosophy of science (cf. Patton 2005).</p>

<p>

Recent history of philosophy of science has become increasingly aware
of neo-Kantianism's influence on philosophy of science in the
twentieth century. It is thus worth taking seriously Cohen's role in
shaping twentieth-century philosophy of science. His commitment to the
transcendental method lead him to a view of epistemology, and
theoretical philosophy more generally, as essentially a
philosophically critical account of the historical development of
concepts in the mathematically-precise natural sciences. This view of
a historically-oriented philosophy of science is nowhere more clear in
Cohen's work than in his <em>Principle of the Infinitesimal
Method</em>. There are two significant points about the view he
expresses there. First, for Cohen, the theory of knowledge begins by
accepting a body of existing science, and then gives a philosophical
reconstruction of important concepts and developments in that
science's history. Second, Cohen thinks the principal topic of the
theory of knowledge is mathematically-precise natural
science—paradigmatically mathematics and physics (Richardson
2006).  Cohen's disciple, Ernst Cassirer, would carry out this program
in, among other writings, three books on the history and philosophy of
physics.</p>

<p>

But philosophers far beyond the Marburg School were influenced by
Cohen's insistence that the philosophical reconstruction of scientific
theories is the principal method of the theory of knowledge, and that
its principal topic is mathematically-precise natural science.
Logical positivist philosophy of science took up aspects of Cohen's
project, including its central concern with mathematics and
physics. Like Cohen, positivists also thought philosophy should
accept existing bodies of science as a starting point, and should seek
to reconstruct that science's theories and methods, even though they
thought modern logic was the proper tool for carrying out their
reconstructions. Recent scholarship on logical positivism, and
especially on Rudolf Carnap, has emphasized its intellectual debts to
Marburg School neo-Kantianism. (Cf. Friedman 1999 and 2000;
Richardson 1998 and especially 2006.) Conversely, a French
tradition of philosophy of science emphasized a different aspect of
Cohen's project. The neo-Kantian Emile Meyerson, and his
intellectual heirs, Alexandre Koyré and ultimately Thomas Kuhn,
emphasized a more deeply historical reconstruction of scientific
theories and methods. Finally, more recent philosophy of science
has seen a turn back to views even more explicitly inspired by Marburg
School doctrines: most prominently, Michael Friedman has defended the
view that in reconstructing scientific theories, philosophy should seek
to articulate the “constitutively a priori” principles in those
theories—that is, principles that are constitutive of the
possibility of experience in precisely Cohen's sense (Friedman
2001). More generally, although twentieth-century history and
philosophy of science did not always take seriously Cohen's
substantive doctrines, it was nevertheless affected profoundly by his
vision of philosophy as the reconstruction of historical developments
in mathematically-precise natural science.</p>
