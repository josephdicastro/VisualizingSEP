<h1>Leibniz’s Philosophy of Mind</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Mon Sep 22, 1997; substantive revision Mon Nov 11, 2013</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>

In a more popular view, Leibniz's place in the history of the
philosophy of mind is best secured by his pre-established harmony,
that is, roughly, by the thesis that there is no mind-body interaction
strictly speaking, but only a non-causal relationship of harmony,
parallelism, or correspondence between mind and body. Certainly, the
pre-established harmony is important for a proper understanding of
Leibniz's philosophy of mind, but there is much more to be considered
as well, and even in connection with the pre-established harmony, the
more popular view needs to be refined, particularly insofar as it
suggests that Leibniz accepts a roughly Cartesian, albeit
non-interactionist dualism, which he does not. In fact, Leibniz is
justly famous for his critiques, not only of materialism, but also of
such a dualism. (Whether Leibniz accepts, throughout his maturity, the
idealistic view that all substances are simple unextended substances
or monads is an important interpretive issue that has been discussed
widely in recent years. We shall not try to resolve the issue
here. (See Garber 2009 for comprehensive treatment.) In short, Leibniz
made important contributions to a number of classical topics of the
philosophy of mind, including materialism, dualism, idealism and
mind-body interaction.</p>

<p>

But Leibniz has much to say about the philosophy of mind that goes
well beyond these traditionally important topics. Perhaps surprisingly,
his system sometimes contains ideas of relevance even to contemporary
discussions in the cognitive sciences. More generally, he discusses in
depth the nature of perception and thought (conscious and unconscious),
and of human motivation and striving (or, as he would say, appetition).
We will take up such topics in what follows.</p>

<h2><a name="MatTho">1. Matter and Thought</a></h2>

<p>

For present purposes, we may think of materialism as the view that
everything that exists is material, or physical, with this view closely
allied to another, namely, that mental states and processes are either
identical to, or realized by, physical states and processes. Leibniz
remained opposed to materialism throughout his career, particularly as
it figured in the writings of Epicurus and Hobbes. The realms of the
mental and the physical, for Leibniz, form two distinct
realms—but not in a way conducive to dualism, or the view that
there exists both thinking substance, and extended substance. By
opposing both materialism and dualism, Leibniz carved himself an
interesting place in the history of views concerning the relationship
between thought and matter.</p>

<p>

Most of Leibniz's arguments against materialism are directly aimed
at the thesis that perception and consciousness can be given mechanical
(i.e. physical) explanations. His position is that perception and
consciousness cannot <em>possibly</em> be explained mechanically, and,
hence, could not be physical processes. His most famous argument
against the possibility of materialism is found in section 17 of the
<em>Monadology</em> (1714):</p>

<blockquote>One is obliged to admit that <em>perception</em> and what
depends upon it is <em>inexplicable on mechanical principles</em>, that
is, by figures and motions. In imagining that there is a machine whose
construction would enable it to think, to sense, and to have
perception, one could conceive it enlarged while retaining the same
proportions, so that one could enter into it, just like into a
windmill. Supposing this, one should, when visiting within it, find
only parts pushing one another, and never anything by which to explain
a perception. Thus it is in the simple substance, and not in the
composite or in the machine, that one must look for
perception.</blockquote>

<p>

Leibniz's argument seems to be this: the visitor of the machine,
upon entering it, would observe nothing but the properties of the
parts, and the relations they bear to one another. But no explanation
of perception, or consciousness, can possibly be deduced from this
conglomerate. No matter how complex the inner workings of this machine,
nothing about them reveals that what is being observed are the inner
workings of a conscious being. Hence, materialism must be false, for
there is no possible way that the purely mechanical principles of
materialism can account for the phenomena of consciousness.</p>

<p>

In other writings, Leibniz suggests exactly what characteristic it
is of perception and consciousness that the mechanical principles of
materialism cannot account for. The following passages, the first from
the <em>New System of Nature</em> (1695), the second from the <em>Reply
to Bayle</em> (1702), are revealing in this regard:</p>

<blockquote>Furthermore, by means of the soul or form, there is a true
unity which corresponds to what is called the <em>I</em> in us; such a
thing could not occur in artificial machines, nor in the simple mass of
matter, however organized it may be. 

<p>

But in addition to the general principles which establish the monads
of which compound things are merely the results, internal experience
refutes the Epicurean [i.e. materialist] doctrine. This experience is
the consciousness which is in us of this <em>I</em> which apperceives
things which occur in the body. This perception cannot be explained by
figures and movements.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>

Leibniz's point is that whatever is the subject of perception and
consciousness must be truly one, a single “I” properly
regarded as <em>one</em> conscious being. An aggregate of matter is not
truly one and so cannot be regarded as a single <em>I</em>, capable of
being the subject of a unified mental life. This interpretation fits
nicely with Lebniz's oft-repeated definition of perception as
“the representation in the simple of the compound, or of that
which is outside” (<em>Principles of Nature and Grace,</em> sec.2
(1714)). More explicitly, in a letter to Antoine Arnauld of 9 October
1687, Leibniz wrote that “in natural perception and sensation, it
is enough for what is divisible and material and dispersed into many
entities to be expressed or represented in a single indivisible entity
or in a substance which is endowed with genuine unity.” If
perception (and hence, consciousness) essentially involves a
representation of a variety of content in a simple, indivisible
“I,” then we may construct Leibniz's argument against
materialism as follows: Materialism holds that matter can explain (is
identical with, can give rise to) perception. A perception is a state
whereby a variety of content is represented in a true unity. Thus,
whatever is not a true unity cannot give rise to perception. Whatever
is divisible is not a true unity. Matter is infinitely divisible.
Hence, matter cannot form a true unity. Hence, matter cannot explain
(be identical with, give rise to) perception. If matter cannot explain
(be identical to, give rise to) perception, then materialism is false.
Hence, materialism is false.</p>

<p>

Leibniz rejected materialism on the grounds that it could not, in
principle, ever capture the “true unity” of perceptual
consciousness, that characteristic of the self which can simultaneously
unify a manifoldness of perceptual content. If this is Leibniz's
argument, it is of some historical interest that it bears striking
resemblances to contemporary objections to certain materialist theories
of mind. Many contemporary philosophers have objected to some versions
of materialism on the basis of thought experiments like Leibniz's:
experiments designed to show that qualia and consciousness are bound to
elude certain materialist conceptions of the mind (cf. Searle 1980;
Nagel 1974; McGinn 1989; Jackson 1982).</p>

<p>

Leibniz's rejection of materialist conceptions of the mind was
coupled with a strong opposition to dualistic views concerning the
relationship between mind and body, particularly the substance dualism
that figured in the philosophy of Descartes and his followers.
According to this dualism, the world fundamentally consists of two
disparate substances: extended material substance (body) and unextended
thinking substance (mind). This bifurcation, of course, carries no
burden of holding that the operations of the mental are realized by the
operations of the physical. But despite his claim that consciousness
and perception cannot be realized by, nor reduced to, the mechanical
operations of matter, Leibniz found the alternative of postulating two
distinct kinds of substance equally implausible.</p>

<p>

Leibniz's opposition to Cartesian dualism stems not from a rejection
of unextended substance, but from his denial of the existence of
genuine extended material substance. To begin with, Leibniz held the
Scholastic thesis that “being” and “one” are
equivalent. He writes to Arnauld: “To be brief, I hold as
axiomatic the identical proposition which varies only in emphasis: that
what is not truly <em>one</em> being is not truly one <em>being</em>
either” (30 April 1687). For Leibniz, in order for something to
count as a real being—a substance—it must be “truly
one,” or an entity endowed with genuine unity. And, as we saw
above, in order for something to be a genuine unity, it must be a
simple, indivisible entity. “Substantial unity,” he writes,
“requires a complete, indivisible and naturally indestructible
entity” (to Arnauld, 28 November 1686). But matter is extended,
and thus, Leibniz believes, infinitely divisible. Hence, there is no
such thing, for Leibniz, as material substance.</p>

<p>

There is a positive thesis which goes hand-in-hand with Leibniz's
negative thesis against material substance, and which helps to explain
further his rejection of material substance. It is summarized in the
following passage from a letter to Arnauld of 30 April 1687:</p>

<blockquote>I believe that <em>where there are only beings through
aggregation, there will not even be real beings</em>. For every being
through aggregation presupposes beings endowed with a true unity,
because it obtains its reality from nowhere but that of its
constituents, so that it will have no reality at all if each
constituent being is still an entity through aggregation; or else, one
must yet seek another basis to its reality, which in this way, if one
must constantly go on searching, can never be found…. If there
are aggregates of substances, there must also be genuine substances
from which all the aggregates result. One must therefore necessarily
arrive either at mathematical points from which certain authors make up
extension, or at Epicurus' and M. Cordemoy's atoms (which you, like me,
dismiss), or else one must acknowledge that no reality can be found in
bodies, or finally one must recognize certain substances in them that
possess a true unity.</blockquote>

<p>

According to Leibniz, bodies (qua material) are aggregates, and an
aggregate, of course, is not a substance on account of its lack of
unity. The claim in the above passage is that whatever being, or
reality, an aggregate has derives from the being and reality of its
constituents. Thus, Leibniz thinks that if a body is to have any
reality at all, if it is to be more than a mere “phenomenon,
lacking all reality as would a coherent dream,” then it must
ultimately be composed of things which are real beings. Atoms, he
claims, are unfit for this role, because they are themselves extended
beings, and for Leibniz, divisibility is of the essence of extension.
That is, those who believe in indivisible atoms make matter
“divisible in one place, indivisible in another” (<em>On
Nature Itself</em> (1698)), but “we cannot explain why bodies of
a definite smallness [i.e. atoms] should not be further
divisible” (<em>Primary Truths</em> (1686)). Every extended mass,
for Leibniz, is composed of extended parts, and so even if we could
conceive of an atom as composed of parts which cannot be physically
divided, “an invincible attachment of one part to another would
not at all destroy the diversity of these parts” (<em>New System
of Nature,</em> (1695)), or it would not at all overcome the fact that
it is an aggregate composed of parts, and not truly one being.
Likewise, mathematical points, “even an infinity of points
gathered into one, will not make extension,” (to Des Bosses, 30
April 1709) and so cannot be understood as the constituents of extended
bodies. Hence, Leibniz opts for the last of the above quoted
alternatives: the constituents of bodies are “certain substances
… that possess a true unity.” These substances are
partless, unextended, and indivisible, and therefore real beings in
Leibniz's sense. Indeed, in several writings, Leibniz invites us to
conceive of these substances on the model of our notion of souls. These
simple substances are the only things which suffice for grounding the
reality of bodies. To be sure, substances, Leibniz tells us, do not
constitute a body as parts of the body, but as the “first
elements,” or “primitive unities,” of the body. As he
sometimes puts it, bodies “result from” these constitutive
unities. That is, bodies just are aggregates of substances which
<em>appear to us</em> as extended corporeal phenomena, though they are
“well-founded” phenomena; they have their foundation in
real beings.</p>

<p>

In short, Leibniz stands in a special position with respect to the
history of views concerning thought and its relationship to matter. He
rejects the materialist position that thought and consciousness can be
captured by purely mechanical principles. But he also rejects the
dualist position that the universe must therefore be bifurcated into
two different kinds of substance, thinking substance, and material
substance. Rather, it is his view that the world consists solely of one
<em>type</em> of substance, though there are infinitely many substances
of that type. These substances are partless, unextended entities, some
of which are endowed with thought and consciousness, and others of
which found the phenomenality of the corporeal world. The sum of these
views secures Leibniz a distinctive position in the history of the
philosophy of mind.</p>

<h2><a name="DenMinBodIntAssPreEstHar">2. Denial of Mind-Body Interaction, Assertion of Pre-established Harmony</a></h2>

<p>

A central philosophical issue of the seventeenth century concerned
the apparent causal relations which hold between the mind and the body.
In most seventeenth-century settings this issue was discussed within
the context of substance dualism, the view that mind and body are
different kinds of substance. For Leibniz, this is a particularly
interesting issue in that he remained fundamentally opposed to dualism.
But although Leibniz held that there is only one type of substance in
the world, and thus that mind and body are ultimately composed of the
same kind of substance (a version of monism), he also held that mind
and body are metaphysically distinct. There are a variety of
interpretations of what this metaphysical distinctness consists in for
Leibniz, but on any plausible interpretation it is safe to assume (as
Leibniz seems to have done) that for any person <em>P</em>,
<em>P</em>‘s mind is a distinct substance (a soul) from <em>P</em>‘s
body. With this assumption in hand, we may formulate the central issue
in the form of a question: how is it that certain mental states and
events are coordinated with certain bodily states and events, and
vice-versa? There were various attempts to answer this question in
Leibniz's time period. For Descartes, the answer was mind-body
interactionism: the mind can causally influence the body, and (most
commentators have held) vice-versa. For Malebranche, the answer was
that neither created minds nor bodies can enter into causal relations
because God is the only causally efficient being in the universe. God
causes certain bodily states and events on the occasion of certain
mental states and events, and vice-versa. Leibniz found Descartes'
answer unintelligible (cf. <em>Theodicy,</em> sec. 60), and
Malebranche's excessive because miraculous (cf. Letter to Arnauld, 14
July 1686).</p>

<p>

Leibniz's account of mind-body causation was in terms of his famous
doctrine of the <em>preestablished harmony</em>. According to the
latter, (1) no state of a created substance has as a real cause some
state of another created substance (i.e. a denial of inter-substantial
causality); (2) every non-initial, non-miraculous, state of a created
substance has as a real cause some previous state of that very
substance (i.e. an affirmation of intra-substantial causality); and (3)
each created substance is programmed at creation such that all its
natural states and actions are carried out in conformity with all the
natural states and actions of every other created substance.</p>

<p>

Formulating (1) through (3) in the language of minds and bodies,
Leibniz held that no mental state has as a real cause some state of
another created mind or body, and no bodily state has as a real cause
some state of another created mind or body. Further, every non-initial,
non-miraculous, mental state of a substance has as a real cause some
previous state of that mind, and every non-initial, non-miraculous,
bodily state has as a real cause some previous state of that body.
Finally, created minds and bodies are programmed at creation such that
all their natural states and actions are carried out in mutual
coordination.</p>

<p>

According to Leibniz, what <em>appear</em> to be real causal
relations between mind and body are, in metaphysical reality, the
mutual conformity or coordination of mind and body—in accordance
with (3)—with no interaction or divine intervention involved. For
example, suppose that Smith is pricked with a pin (call this bodily
state <em>Sb</em>) and pain ensues (call this mental state
<em>Sm</em>), a case of apparent body to mind causation. Leibniz would
say that in such a case some state of Smith's mind (soul) prior to
<em>Sm</em> was the real cause of <em>Sm,</em> and <em>Sb</em> was not
a causal factor in the obtaining of <em>Sm</em>. Suppose now that Smith
has a desire to raise his arm (call this mental state <em>Sm</em>), and
the raising of his arm ensues (call this bodily state <em>Sb</em>), a
case of apparent mind to body causation. Leibniz would say that in such
a case some state of Smith's body prior to <em>Sb</em> was the real
cause of <em>Sb</em> and <em>Sm</em> was not a causal factor in the
obtaining of <em>Sb</em>. So although substances do not causally
interact, their states accommodate one another as if there were causal
interaction among substances.</p>

<p>

It should be noted, however, that Leibniz did think that there was a
sense in which one could say that mental events influence bodily
events, and vice-versa. He wrote to Antoine Arnauld that although
“one particular substance has no physical influence on another
… nevertheless, one is quite right to say that my will is the
cause of this movement of my arm …; for the one expresses
distinctly what the other expresses more confusedly, and one must
ascribe the action to the substance whose expression is more
distinct” (28 November 1686 (draft)). In this passage, Leibniz
sets forth what he takes the metaphysical reality of apparent
inter-substantial causation to amount to. We begin with the thesis that
every created substance perceives the entire universe, though only a
portion of it is perceived distinctly, most of it being perceived
unconsciously, and, hence, confusedly. Now consider two created
substances, <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> (<em>x</em> not identical to
<em>y</em>), where some state of <em>x</em> is said to be the cause of
some state of <em>y</em>. Leibniz's analysis is this: when the causal
state of affairs occurred, the relevant perceptions of substance
<em>x</em> became more distinct, while the relevant perceptions of
substance <em>y</em> became more confused. Insofar as the relevant
perceptions of <em>x</em> become increasingly distinct, it is
“causally” active; insofar as the relevant perceptions of
substance <em>y</em> become increasingly confused, it is passive. In
general, causation is to be understood as an increase in distinctness
on the part of the causally active substance, and an increase in
confusedness on the part of the passively effected substance. Again,
each substance is programmed at creation to be active/passive at the
relevant moment, with no occurrence of real substantial
interaction.</p>

<p>

It is difficult to say exactly why Leibniz denied inter-substantial
causation. Some of the things he tells us, in both private and public
writings, seem unsatisfactory. For example,
in <em>Primary Truths</em> (1686?), we are given this:</p>

<blockquote>Strictly speaking, one can say that <em>no created
substance exerts a metaphysical action or influx on any other
thing</em>. For, not to mention the fact that one cannot explain how
something can pass from one thing into the substance of another, we
have already shown that from the notion of each and every thing follows
all of its future states. What we call causes are only concurrent
requisites, in metaphysical rigor.</blockquote>

<p>

Leibniz's first reason for denying inter-substantial causation, that
“one cannot explain how something can pass from one thing into the
substance of another,” is a clear reference to the <em>influx
theory</em> of causation. Leibniz found this theory inconsistent with
his conception of substance. Influx theory could only explain causal
relations between entities with parts, according to Leibniz. It is
through these parts that “something can pass from one thing into
… another.” But Leibnizian substances do not have parts in the
requisite sense. (For more on influx theory, see O'Neil 1993.) Leibniz
also gives a reason tied to his complete concept theory of substance,
according to which “the nature of an individual substance or of
a complete being is to have a notion so complete that it is sufficient
to contain and to allow us to deduce from it all the predicates of the
subject to which this notion is attributed” (<em>Discourse on
Metaphysics</em>, sec. 8). But there are, it seems, at least two
problems with this explanation. First, Leibniz moves rather quickly
from a conceptual explanation of substance in terms of the complete
concept theory, to the conclusion that this consideration is
sufficient to explain the activity of concrete substances. Second,
even if conceptual considerations about substances were sufficient to
explain their apparent causal activity, it does not seem to follow
that substances do not interact—unless one is assuming that
causal overdetermination is not a genuine possibility. Leibniz seems
to be assuming just that, but without argument. </p>

<p>

Sometimes Leibniz gives a more familiar line of reasoning. At
<em>Monadology</em> 7, we read this:</p>

<blockquote>There is no way of explaining how a monad can be altered or
changed internally by some other creature, since one cannot transpose
anything in it, nor can one conceive of any internal motion that can be
excited, directed, augmented, or diminished within it, as can be done
in composites, where there can be change among the parts. The monads
have no windows through which something can enter or leave. Accidents
cannot be detached, nor can they go about outside of substances, as the
sensible species of the Scholastics once did. Thus, neither substance
nor accident can enter a monad from without.</blockquote>

<p>

He seems to think that causal interaction between two beings
requires the transmission or transposition of the parts of those
beings. But substances are simple unextended entities which contain no
parts. Thus, there is no way to explain how one substance could
influence another. Unfortunately, however, this line of reasoning would
seem to also rule out one case of inter-substantial causation which
Leibniz allows, viz., God's causal action on finite simple
substances.</p>

<h2><a name="LanMin">3. Language and Mind</a></h2>

<p>

Some scholars have suggested that Leibniz should be regarded as one
of the first thinkers to envision something like the idea of artificial
intelligence (cf. Churchland 1984; Pratt 1987). Whether or not he
should be regarded as such, it is clear that Leibniz, like contemporary
cognitive scientists, saw an intimate connection between the form and
content of language, and the operations of the mind. Indeed, according
to his own testimony in the <em>New Essays</em>, he “really
believe[s] that languages are the best mirror of the human mind, and
that a precise analysis of the signification of words would tell us
more than anything else about the operations of the
understanding” (bk.III, ch.7, sec.6 (RB, 333)). This view of
Leibniz's led him to formulate a plan for a “universal
language,” an artificial language composed of symbols, which
would stand for concepts or ideas, and logical rules for their valid
manipulation. He believed that such a language would perfectly mirror
the processes of intelligible human reasoning. It is this plan that has
led some to believe that Leibniz came close to anticipating artificial
intelligence. At any rate, Leibniz's writings about this project
(which, it should be noted, he never got the chance to actualize)
reveal significant insights into his understanding of the nature of
human reasoning. This understanding, it turns out, is not that
different from contemporary conceptions of the mind, as many of his
discussions bear considerable relevance to discussions in the cognitive
sciences.</p>

<p>

According to Leibniz, natural language, despite its powerful
resources for communication, often makes reasoning obscure since it is
an imperfect mirror of intelligible thoughts. As a result, it is often
difficult to reason with the apparatus of natural language,
“since it is full of innumerable equivocations” (<em>On the
Universal Science: Characteristic</em> (undated); G VII, 205 (S, 18)).
Perhaps this is because of his view that the terms of natural language
stand for complex, or derivative, concepts—concepts which are
composed of, and reducible to, simpler concepts. With this
“combinatorial” view of concepts in hand, Leibniz notices
“that all human ideas can be resolved into a few as their
primitives” (<em>On the Universal Science: Characteristic</em>; G
VII, 205 (S, 18)). We could then assign symbols, or
“characters,” to these primitive concepts from which we
could form characters for derivative concepts by means of combinations
of the symbols. As a result, Leibniz tells us, “it would be
possible to find correct definitions and values and, hence, also the
properties which are demonstrably implied in the definitions”
(<em>On the Universal Science: Characteristic</em>; G VII, 205 (S,
19)). The totality of these symbols would form a “universal
characteristic,” an ideal language in which all human concepts
would be perfectly represented, and their constitutive nature perfectly
transparent. Now it is true that Leibniz eventually came to doubt
“whether any concept of this [primitive] kind appears distinctly
to men, namely, in such a way that they know they have it”
(<em>An Introduction to a Secret Encyclopedia</em> (1679?); C, 513 (MP,
7)). But it is also clear that he did not see this skepticism
concerning our ability to reach the primitive concepts as much of a
barrier to the project of a universal language. He writes in <em>The
Art of Discovery</em> (1685) that “there are certain primitive
terms which can be posited, if not absolutely, at least relatively to
us” (C, 176 (W, 51)). The suggestion seems to be that even if we
cannot provide a catalog of absolutely primitive concepts, we can
nevertheless construct a characteristic based on concepts which cannot
be further resolved by humans.</p>

<p>

In addition to the resolution of concepts, and their symbolic
assignments, Leibniz envisages the formulation of logical rules for the
universal characteristic. He claims that “it is plain that men
make use in reasoning of several axioms which are not yet quite
certain” (<em>The Method of Certitude and the Art of
Discovery</em> (undated); G VII, 183 (W, 49)). Yet with the explicit
formulation of these rules for the logical manipulation of the
symbols—rules which humans use in reasoning—we would be in
possession of a universal language which would mirror the relations
between the concepts used in human reasoning. Indeed, the universal
characteristic was intended by Leibniz as an instrument for the
effective calculation of truths. Like formal logic systems, it would be
a language capable of representing valid reasoning patterns by means of
the use of symbols. Unlike formal logic systems, however, the universal
language would also express the content of human reasoning in addition
to its formal structure. In Leibniz's mind, “this language will
be the greatest instrument of reason,” for “when there are
disputes among persons, we can simply say: Let us calculate, without
further ado, and see who is right” (<em>The Art of Discovery</em>
(1685); C, 176 (W, 51)).</p>

<p>

Judging from Leibniz's plans for a universal language, it is clear
that Leibniz had a specific view about the nature of human cognitive
processes, particularly about the nature of human reasoning. According
to this view, cognition is essentially symbolic: it takes place in a
system of representations which possesses language-like structure.
Indeed, it was Leibniz's view that “all human reasoning uses
certain signs or characters,” (<em>On the Universal Science:
Characteristic</em>; G VII, 204 (S, 17)) and “if there were no
characters, we could neither think of anything distinctly nor reason
about it” (<em>Dialogue</em> (1677); G VII, 191 (A&amp;G, 271)).
Add to this conception Leibniz's view that human cognitive processes
follow determinable axioms of logic, and the picture that emerges is
one according to which the mind operates, at least when it comes to
intelligible reasoning, by following implicit algorithmic procedures.
Regardless of whether or not Leibniz should be seen as the grandfather
of artificial intelligence, he did conceive of human cognition in
essentially computational terms. In fact, as early as 1666, remarking
favorably on Hobbes' writings, Leibniz wrote: “Thomas Hobbes,
everywhere a profound examiner of principles, rightly stated that
everything done by our mind is a <em>computation</em>” (<em>On
the Art of Combinations</em> (1666); G IV, 64 (P, 3)).</p>

<h2><a name="PerApp">4. Perception and Appetition</a></h2>

<p>

What do we find in the human mind? Representations on the one hand,
and tendencies, inclinations, or strivings on the other, according to
Leibniz. Or, to put this in Leibniz's more customary terminology, what
is found within us is perception and appetition. For human minds count
for Leibniz as simple substances, and, as he says in a letter to De
Volder, “it may be said that there is nothing in the world except
simple substances, and, in them, perception and appetite.” (30
June 1704)</p>

<p>

Perception has already been discussed briefly above. But it will be
advisable to consider also a definition from a letter to Des Bosses
(and echoed in many other passages), in which Leibniz discusses
perception as the representation or “expression” of
“the many in the one” (letter to Des Bosses, 11 July 1706).
We shall return to this definition below. Appetitions are explained as
“tendencies from one perception to another” (<em>Principles
of Nature and Grace,</em> sec.2 (1714)). Thus, we represent the world
in our perceptions, and these representations are linked with an
internal principle of activity and change (<em>Monadology</em>, sec.15
(1714)) which, in its expression in appetitions, urges us ever onward
in the constantly changing flow of mental life. More technically
explained, the principle of action, that is, the primitive force which
is our essence, expresses itself in momentary derivative forces
involving two aspects: on the one hand, there is a representative
aspect (perception), by which that the many without are expressed
within the one, the simple substance; on the other, there is a
dynamical aspect, a tendency or striving towards new perceptions, which
inclines us to change our representative state, to move towards new
perceptions. (See Carlin 2004.)</p>

<p>

It should not be inferred that this appetitive tendency to change is
entirely mechanistic, entirely governed by efficient causation only.
For in Leibniz's view, value and final causes are not excluded from the
action of the mind, the change of mental states. As he says in section
13 of the <em>Discourse on Metaphysics</em> (1686), just as “God
will always do the best, … a man shall always do … that
which appears to him to be the best.” Appearance, of course, has
to do with perception; doing, with appetition. So this principle of
human action applies directly, as one would expect, to the two key
factors of monadic interior life, only with the role of value, or an
end in view, now more clearly in focus. This is why Leibniz says that,
at the level of bodies (that is, for Leibniz, at the level of
well-founded phenomena), all occurs according to the laws of efficient
causes; whereas with respect to perceptions and appetites (or at least
with some of these—interpretations differ here) all occurs
according to the laws of final causes. But there is no clash here,
given the harmony of the kingdom of nature and the kingdom of grace in
Leibniz's system, the harmony of final and efficient causes.</p>

<p>

To be sure, at an ultimate level, the only actions of substances
<em>are</em> changes of perceptions. Thus, at the ultimate level, the
appetitions are not so much the tendencies impelling a person towards
voluntary motions of the human body (although at the level of
well-founded phenomena this may indeed be the case) but rather
tendencies arising out of present perceptions (present appearances)
towards new perceptions. This explains why Leibniz defines appetitions
in the initially surprising way noted above, as “tendencies from
one perception to <em>another</em>”—another
<em>perception</em>, that is.</p>

<p>

The last two paragraphs have helped to clarify appetition. It is
time to return to perception. In Leibniz's definition (the expression
of the many in the one) the two key terms are ‘expression’
and ‘one’. Both of them bear considerable weight in
Leibniz's metaphysics. Representation or expression (Leibniz uses the
two terms interchangeably) has its own definition: “One thing
expresses another … when there is a constant and regulated
relation between what can be said of the one and of the other”
(letter to Arnauld, 9 October 1687). Examples, in addition to
perception, include a map expressing or representing a geographical
region and an algebraic equation representing or expressing a geometric
figure, such as a circle or an ellipse.</p>

<p>

With respect to oneness, Leibniz famously claims a connection with
being. He says, “I hold this identical proposition,
differentiated only by the emphasis, to be an axiom, namely, <em>that
what is not truly</em> one <em>being is not truly one</em> being
<em>either</em>” (letter to Arnauld, 30 April 1687). For Leibniz,
what truly is is substance, so it is not surprising that at one point
he clarifies his definition of perception by saying that perception is
“the expression of many things in one, <em>or in simple
substance</em>” (<em>A New Method of Learning and Teaching
Jurisprudence</em>, revision notes of 1697–1700).</p>

<p>

Finally, it should be recalled that for Leibniz there are quite
distinct levels of perception among created substances. Some of these
will be taken up in more detail in the following section, but the basic
point for now is that the three major levels, from the lowest to the
highest, are bare perception (without special distinctness or memory),
sensation (with heightened distinctness and memory), and thought (with
distinctness, memory, and reflection). These are distinctive of the
three levels of monads, respectively, the bare monads, souls, and
spirits. Only the last of these may properly be said to have reason.
Only the last of these is strictly a mind in the Leibnizian
classification.</p>

<h2><a name="AppDesUnc">5. Apperception, Desire and the Unconscious</a></h2>

<p>

One of the better-known terms of Leibniz's philosophy, and of his
philosophy of mind, is apperception. A famous definition is presented
in section 4 of the <em>Principles of Nature and of Grace</em> (1714),
where Leibniz says that apperception is “<em>consciousness</em>,
or the reflective knowledge of this internal state.” He adds that
this is “something not given to all souls, nor at all times to a
given soul.”</p>

<p>

Despite being well known, Leibniz's concept of apperception is not
necessarily well understood. In particular, the place of apperception
in the three-fold classifications given just above—of three kinds
of perceptions and of simple substances—is not agreed upon,
despite the fact that this would seem to be of considerable importance.
A common understanding is that for Leibniz apperception is distinctive
of spirits, and is not present in even the highest of animals beneath
humans. While there is evidence that Leibniz at least sometimes adopts
this position, there is also evidence that he sometimes endorses the
view that (at least some) beasts also apperceive. Since we may assume
that at a minimum apperception involves consciousness (though not
necessarily certain higher forms of consciousness, e.g.,
self-consciousness, or reflective consciousness, in one sense or
another), this leads to some uncertainty as to whether Leibniz assigns
consciousness to beasts, that is, whether he does or does not agree
with the famous Cartesian principle that beasts are not conscious, but
only material automata.</p>

<p>

There are at least three specific lines of evidence for apperception
in beasts. The first is that Leibniz sometimes uses very similar
definitions and examples when talking about the contrast between, on
the one hand, apperceptions and <em>petites</em> perceptions
(perceptions which are not apperceived), and, on the other, sensation
and bare perceptions. This suggests, though it does not demonstrate,
that Leibniz is identifying apperception and sensation, not
apperception and rational thought. The second line of evidence is that
he often appears to take the side of the common man against Descartes'
position on beasts, for example, when he says,</p>

<blockquote>It will be difficult to rid mankind of this opinion which
has been held always and everywhere and which is universal if any
opinion deserves that term, namely, that beasts have feelings (letter
to Arnauld, 9 October 1687).</blockquote>

<p>

Finally, there are passages, notably in the <em>New Essays concerning
Human Understanding</em> (1704), in which Leibniz quite simply ascribes
apperception, directly or indirectly, to beasts, as, for example, when
he discusses the case of a wild boar that has only a bare perception of
a human until the human shouts at it, at which point the boar
apperceives the person (“<em>s'apperçoit d'une
personne</em>”)and begins a charge (Bk.II ch.21, sec.5; A vi VI
173). </p>

<p>

Without trying to proceed further with this issue here, we can see
that whichever of these views is ultimately adopted, it remains the
case that Leibniz's theory of perception involves something very
distinctive in an age dominated by Descartes' theory of ideas, the
thesis that there are some perceptions of which we are not conscious,
the much-discussed <em>petites</em> perceptions. Although Leibniz was
not the first to propose such an idea (Aquinas, for example, had a
similar view), and although the view in his hands did not have the
explosive quality that it did in the hands of Freud, the thesis remains
an intriguing and important part of his philosophy of mind. Indeed, the
Preface of the <em>New Essays concerning Human Understanding</em>
contains as strong a statement as one is likely to find about the
centrality of this view in a particular metaphysical system. Among
other things, Leibniz makes it very clear that it is not just lower
simple substances that have such unconscious perceptions but also human
minds.</p>

<p>

Having raised the issue of unconscious perceptions, we should
consider also the question of unconscious appetitions. This is
infrequently discussed, but the question should not be overlooked.
Since appetitions are tendencies or strivings, ones which profoundly
influence human actions, it is of distinct human relevance whether or
not an individual human is conscious of all of these strivings.
Certainly, some have taken the possibility of urges of which we are not
conscious as highly important for the proper understanding of
individual humans, and indeed of the human condition generally.</p>

<p>

There is evidence, notably from the <em>New Essays</em>, that
Leibniz did indeed draw a parallel between perceptions and appetitions
with respect to consciousness. Although he did not always explain the
distinction between conscious and unconscious appetitions with care and
uniformity, it seems clear that he committed himself to appetitions of
which we are not conscious, or which we do not apperceive, just as he
had committed himself to perceptions which are not apperceived.
Consider the following two statements in combination: “desires
and tendencies which are apperceived are often called volitions”
(<em>New Essays</em>, Bk.II, ch.21, sec.39); and, “There are also
efforts that result from insensible perceptions which one does not
apperceive, and these I prefer to call <em>appetitions</em> rather than
volitions (although there are also apperceptible appetitions)”
(<em>New Essays</em>, Bk.2, ch.21, sec.5).</p>

<p>

In short, and perhaps oversimplifying to a certain extent, we can
say that in the Leibnizian realm of mind there are indeed only
perceptions and appetitions, but in these there is a fundamental divide
between the realm of consciousness and unconsciousness. In the former,
there are apperceptions and desires, the perceptions and appetitions of
which we are conscious. In the latter, there are perceptions and
appetitions of which we are not conscious. That does not mean, however,
that this latter realm is unimportant in our mental lives. As Leibniz
says, “insensible perceptions are as important to [the science of
minds, souls, and soul-like substances] as insensible corpuscles are to
natural science, and it is just as unreasonable to reject the one as
the other on the pretext that they are beyond the reach of our
senses.” ((<em>New Essays</em>, Preface) He would have said the
same, no doubt, about inapperceptible appetitions.</p>
