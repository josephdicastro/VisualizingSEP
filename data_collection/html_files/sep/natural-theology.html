<h1>Natural Theology and Natural Religion</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Mon Jul 6, 2015</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>The term “natural religion” is sometimes taken to refer
to a pantheistic doctrine according to which <em>nature</em> itself is
divine. “Natural theology”, by contrast, originally
referred to (and still sometimes refers 
 to)<sup>[<a href="notes.html#1" name="note-1">1</a>]</sup>
the project of arguing for the existence of God on the basis of
observed <em>natural facts</em>. </p>

<p>In contemporary philosophy, however, both “natural
religion” and “natural theology” typically refer to
the project of using the cognitive faculties that are
“natural” to human beings—reason, sense-perception,
introspection—to investigate religious or theological
matters. Natural religion or theology, on the present understanding,
is not limited to empirical inquiry into nature, and it is not wedded
to a pantheistic result. It does, however, avoid appeals to special
non-natural faculties (ESP, telepathy, mystical experience) or
supernatural sources of information (sacred texts, revealed theology,
creedal authorities, direct supernatural communication). In general,
natural religion or theology (hereafter “natural
theology”) aims to adhere to the same standards of rational
investigation as other philosophical and scientific enterprises, and
is subject to the same methods of evaluation and critique.</p>

<p>Philosophers and religious thinkers across almost every epoch and
tradition (Near Eastern, African, Asian, and European) have engaged
the project of natural theology, either as proponents or critics. The
question of whether natural theology is a viable project is at the
root of some of the deepest religious divisions: Shiite thinkers are
optimistic about reason’s ability to prove various theological
and ethical truths, for instance, while Sunnis are not; Roman Catholic
theologians typically think that reason can demonstrate the existence
of God, while many Protestant theologians do not. Unlike most of the
topics discussed in an encyclopedia of philosophy, this is one over
which wars have been fought and throats have been cut.</p>

<p>The most active discussions of natural theology in the West
occurred during the high medieval period (roughly 1100–1400
C.E.) and the early modern period (1600–1800 C.E.). The past few
decades have witnessed a revival of debate in the public sphere: there
are now institutes promoting “Intelligent Design Theory”,
popular apologetics courses, campus debates between believers and
agnostics, a “New Atheist” movement, Youtube debates
between pastors and atheistic apologists regarding new books in
natural theology (such as the one between Nathan Lewis and Bernie
Dehler on the Blackwell Companion to Natural 
 Theology),<sup>[<a href="notes.html#2" name="note-2">2</a>]</sup>
 and TED talks by famous atheists on resisting natural
religion (such as the one by Richard Dawkins in February 
2002).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#3" name="note-3">3</a>]</sup></p>

<p>Among professional philosophers (who aren’t typically part of
these more popular debates), arguments over our ability to justify
positive or negative answers to religious questions have become fairly
technical, often employing sophisticated logical techniques in an
effort to advance the discussion instead of retreading the same old
ground. The prestigious Gifford Lectures series hosted by a consortium
of Scottish universities, however, has tried to feature new but still
accessible work in natural theology for over 100 years (it too has a
 Youtube channel!)<sup>[<a href="notes.html#4" name="note-4">4</a>]</sup></p>

<p>In this article, we aim to avoid most the more recent complexities
but also explain their origins by focusing on some central
developments in the early modern period that helped to frame
contemporary natural theological debates.</p>

<h2><a id="ProCon">1. Prolegomenal Considerations</a></h2>

<p>Theologians often follow Kant’s example and address various
“prolegomena” or preliminary questions before trying to do
any substantive metaphysics. These include questions about the
semantics of religious speech and the ability that we do (or do not)
have to access religious truths.</p>

<h3><a id="RelLanCon">1.1 Religious Language and Concepts</a></h3>

<p>We will use the term “natural theologian” to refer to
someone who aims to use ordinary human cognitive faculties (reason,
sense-perception, introspection) to establish positive truths about
God. Such a person presupposes that sentences in human language (or at
least sentences in the language of human thought) can express some
theological truths, even if other such truths are beyond us.</p>

<p>Critics of natural theology sometimes challenge these semantic
presuppositions. They provide reasons to think that our thoughts,
concepts, or words are incapable of referring adequately to the
transcendent entities that play an important role in many religious
doctrines—entities such as Judaism’s YHWH,
Neo-Platonism’s One, Vedanta’s Brahman, Mormonism’s
Heavenly Father, and so on. The debate surrounding these issues is
often designated “the problem of religious language”, but
it is usually as much about human <em>concepts</em> as it is about
sentences in actual languages. </p>

<p>In the western tradition, there have been a few periods of
especially active discussion of this problem. The Neo-Platonic era was
one (see the discussion of negative theology in the entry on
 <a href="../plotinus/">Plotinus</a>), the high
medieval period (1100–1400 or so) was another, the Enlightenment
movement in 17<sup>th</sup>–18<sup>th</sup> century Europe
(especially the empiricist portion of it) was a third. More recent
discussions have involved both analytic and continental figures:
A.J. Ayer, Ludwig Wittgenstein, Martin Heidegger, Antony Flew, Norman
Malcolm, Emmanuel Levinas, and William P. Alston have each discussed,
in very different ways, the question of whether and how our language
might succeed in referring to transcendent entities.  Since the 1970s,
however, when analytic philosophers turned away from a focus on
language to a revival of metaphysics, the “problem of religious
language” has been less prominent.</p>

<h3><a id="RatAcc">1.2 Rational Access</a></h3>

<p>In addition to questions about what religious language refers to
and how (if at all) religious concepts <em>apply</em>, the natural
theologian faces another set of preliminary questions about our
ability to <em>generate sound arguments</em> about such entities or
facts. Our sense-perceptual and rational faculties are clearly limited
and fallible. There are presumably many facts about the natural
universe that we are incapable of understanding due to their
complexity or inaccessibility. So why should we think that our natural
faculties can deliver truths about even more remote or transcendent
entities? </p>

<p>A related question concerns whether natural theology exhausts the
domain of truths which we could even in principle have access.  Some
practitioners (call them <i>rationalists</i>) argue that only propositions
that can be justified by unaided human reason are candidates for
permissible belief. Others (call them <em>hybridists</em>) allow that
our natural faculties can take us a certain distance—to
knowledge of the basic nature and even existence of God, say—but
argue that we must ultimately appeal to <em>faith</em> when it comes
to more specific doctrines regarding the divine nature, acts, and
intentions. This is the canonical Roman Catholic position on faith and
reason developed in authors such as Augustine, Anselm, Aquinas, and
revived in the natural scientific context of the Renaissance by
Catalan scholar Raymond Sebond (1385–1436). Sebond’s Latin
work, <em>Theologia Naturalis</em> (1434–1436), became famous
when Michel de Montaigne translated it into French in 1569 and made it
the subject of the longest of his renowned <em>Essays</em>
(‘Apology for Raymond Sebond’), in 1580.</p>

<p>There are many kinds of hybridists: while they all think a turn to
faith is necessary at some point, some seek to establish little more
than the bare existence of God before turning to faith for greater
details. Others think it is possible to develop a more robust
understanding of God from within the bounds of reason and
sense-perception. Indeed, in recent years the so-called
“ramified natural theology” movement has sought to use our
natural faculties to demonstrate (or show to be highly probable)
robust doctrines that go well beyond bare theism—for example,
specifically Christian doctrines such as that of the Trinity, the
resurrection, or the historical authenticity of certain miracles or
biblical prophecies (Swinburne 2003; Newman et al. 2003; Gauch Jr.
2011; see <a href="#RamNatThe">section 4 below</a>). </p>

<p><em>Opponents</em> of natural religion or theology, by contrast,
deny that reason or our other ordinary capacities can justify
religious beliefs. Some of these opponents are <i>fideists</i> (e.g., on some readings,
Tertullian, Blaise Pascal, Pierre Bayle, J.G. Hamann, and Søren
Kierkegaard) who hold these same beliefs as articles of faith rather
than as teachings of reason (see the entry on 
  <a href="../fideism/">fideism</a>). 
Pascal, for instance, was a preeminent mathematician
with strong interests in natural theology, but ultimately concluded
(during what he called a “night of fire” in November 1654)
that unaided reason is more likely to lead us to the false god
“of philosophers and scholars” than to the true “God
of Abraham, God of Isaac, God of Jacob”. The 20<sup>th</sup>
century Reformed theologian Karl Barth opposed natural theology for
much the same reason, and made his opposition to Emil Brunner’s
version of the hybridist project clear in a book titled simply
“<em>Nein!</em>” (Barth 1934). In his Gifford Lectures,
contemporary theologian Stanley Hauerwas espouses a fideistic view in
the tradition of Pascal and Barth but claims (somewhat perversely)
that his project (which incorporates biblical texts and specifically
Christian doctrines) is one in “natural theology” all the
same (Hauerwas 2001: 15ff).</p>

<p>Other opponents of natural theology are <i>agnostics</i> who do not
find the fideist’s turn to faith appealing. They deny that our
natural faculties succeed in justifying any positive or negative
substantial (i.e., non-analytic) theistic beliefs, and consequently
suspend belief. Agnostics differ, however, as to whether unaided
reason <em>could</em> in principle but does <em>not in fact</em>
justify such beliefs (thus Bertrand Russell’s famous response to
a question about what he would say if he were to die and then confront
God on judgment day: “not enough evidence, God, not enough
evidence!”) or whether our unaided faculties are not even <em>in
principle</em> adequate to the task. </p>

<p>Still other opponents of natural theology are <i>atheists</i>.  Atheists
agree with fideists and agnostics that our natural faculties cannot
establish the existence of God or other religious entities. But
that’s because they think those faculties provide reasons to
believe that such entities do not exist at all (see the entry on
  <a href="../atheism-agnosticism/">atheism and agnosticism</a>). 
One such reason is the negative one that we cannot
produce any sound arguments for theistic claims. But atheists also
often maintain that there are positive reasons to believe that God
does not exist—the incoherence of the concept of God, for
instance, or the incompatibility of God’s existence and the
existence of horrendous suffering and evil (see the entry on
the problem of 
  <a href="../evil/">evil</a>).</p>

<p>There are many ways to approach a survey of natural theology.  Here
we have chosen to focus largely on the classic historical discussions,
and in particular on the debates in the Enlightenment
(17<sup>th</sup>–18<sup>th</sup> century) period.  We will
consider versions of the two basic kinds of positive argument in favor
of religious theses: <em>a priori</em> arguments and <em>a
posteriori</em> arguments. There are species of each of these.</p>

<h2><a id="PriArg">2. <em>A priori</em> arguments</a></h2>

<h3><a id="OntArg">2.1 Ontological arguments</a></h3>

<p><em>A priori</em> arguments are those that do not require an appeal
to particular sense-perceptual experiences in order to justify their
conclusions. <em>Immanuel Kant</em> gave the name
“ontological” to <em>a priori</em> arguments that aim to
prove the existence of an object from a concept or an idea of that
object (see the entry on 
 <a href="../ontological-arguments/">ontological arguments</a>). 
But the argument over whether such a strategy can
establish the existence of God began well before Kant’s
time.</p>

<h4><a id="SaiAnsCan103">2.1.1 Saint Anselm of Canterbury (1033–1109)</a></h4>

<p>An early and now-canonical formulation of the ontological argument
is found in the second book of St. Anselm’s <em>Proslogion</em>
(Anselm 1077–78). Anselm begins by characterizing God as the
“being than which none greater can be thought” and then
seeks to show that such a being does and indeed must exist. </p>

<p>Anselm’s argument can be reconstructed in various ways
(see the entry on <a href="../anselm/">Saint Anselm</a>), but here is
one:</p>

<ol>

<li>By “God” we understand something than which nothing
greater can be thought. [premise]</li>

<li>When we understand the term “God”, God is in the
understanding. [premise]</li>

<li>Therefore, something than which nothing greater can be thought is
in the understanding. [by (1) and (2)]</li>

<li>What is in the understanding <em>and</em> in reality is greater
than what is in the understanding alone. [premise]</li>

<li>Therefore, God exists in the understanding and in reality. [by (3)
and (4)]</li>
</ol>

<p>In support of (2), Anselm notes that</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[T]he fool has said in his heart that “There is no
God”. But when this same Fool hears me say “something than
which nothing greater can be thought”, he surely understands
what he hears; and what he understands exists in his understanding,
even if he does not understand that it exists [in reality]. (Anselm
81–2)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So according to Anselm, even the “foolish”
atheist <em>understands</em> the term “God” when he argues
that God does not exist. By this Anselm simply means that the atheist
has the idea of God, and thus has God “in his
understanding”.</p>

<p>(4) presupposes that things can exist in a number of different ways
or modes. One of those ways is as the object of an idea—i.e.,
existence “in the understanding”. Another way for it to
exist is “in reality”. (4) articulates a comparative value
judgment about these ways of existing: it is <em>greater</em> for
something to exist in <em>both</em> ways than it is to exist merely in
the first way. </p>

<p>In order to deduce (5) from (3) and (4), Anselm uses a <em>reductio
ad absurdum</em> argument:</p>

<blockquote><p>And surely that than which a greater cannot be
   thought cannot exist only in the understanding. For if it exists
   only in the understanding, it can be thought to exist in reality as
   well, which is greater. (Anselm 82)</p></blockquote>

<p> More explicitly:</p>


<ol type="a"> 
<li>Suppose a certain being, <em>B</em><sub>1</sub>, is conceived of
as God is in the proof, and <em>B</em><sub>1</sub> is in the
understanding alone. [supposition for <em>reductio</em>]</li>

<li>But we can conceive of another being, <em>B</em><sub>2</sub>, that
is exactly like <em>B</em><sub>1</sub>, except
that <em>B</em><sub>2</sub> exists in reality as well as in the
understanding.  [introspection]</li>

<li>Thus, <em>B</em><sub>2</sub> is greater
than <em>B</em><sub>1</sub>. [by (4)]</li>

<li>It is impossible to conceive of a being that is greater
than <em>B</em><sub>1</sub>.  [by (a) and (1)]</li>

<li>Contradiction. [by (c) and (d)]</li>

<li>Therefore, (a) is false: If <em>B</em><sub>1</sub> is conceived of
as God is in the proof, then <em>B</em><sub>1</sub> must exist in
reality as well as in the understanding.  [by (e)]</li>

<p>Philosophers and theologians have made numerous efforts to revive
or demolish Anselm’s argument over the centuries. The most
influential proponents include René Descartes, Gottfried
Leibniz, Charles Hartshorne, Norman Malcolm, Robert M. Adams, and
Alvin Plantinga. Its main detractors include Anselm’s
contemporaneous interlocutor—a monk named Gaunilo—as well
as Thomas Aquinas, Descartes’ correspondents Johannes Caterus,
Marin Mersenne, and Antoine Arnauld, Immanuel Kant, and, more
recently, David Lewis (1970), Peter van Inwagen (1977), and Graham
Oppy (1996, 2009). In what follows, a number of the relevant moves
in the early modern discussion will be considered, as well as some
contemporary developments of the 17<sup>th</sup> century modal
argument.</p>

<h4><a id="RenDes159">2.1.2 René Descartes (1596–1650)</a></h4>

<p>Descartes’ ontological argument, first presented in the Fifth
Meditation, aims to prove the existence of God from the idea of God
(Descartes 1641, cited below from the edition by Adam and Tannery
(1962–1976) and referred to as “AT”). Here is one
way to formulate the argument (compare Pereboom 1996, 2010; for
alternatives see the entry on
 <a href="../descartes-ontological/">Descartes’ Ontological Argument</a>):</p>

<ol>
<li>When I have an idea of an object, the object really has whatever
characteristics I clearly and distinctly understand it to have.
(premise)</li>

<li>I have an idea of God in which I clearly and distinctly understand
God to be the maximally perfect being. (premise)</li>

<li>Therefore, God has all perfections. [by (1) and (2)]</li>

<li>Everlasting existence is a perfection. (premise)</li>

<li>Therefore, God has everlasting existence. [by (3) and (4)]</li>

<li>Therefore, God exists. [by (5)] (AT 7.63–71)</li>
</ol>

<p>One prominent way of resisting this argument is to reduce it to
absurdity by appeal to “parity of reasoning”. Johannes
Caterus, for instance, objected to Descartes that by a precisely
parallel form of reasoning we could prove the real existence of the
object of an idea of an existent lion (AT 7.99). Gaunilo’s reply
to Anselm centuries earlier was similar: by parity of reasoning, one
can prove the existence in reality (and not just in the understanding)
of the maximally perfect island (Anselm 102).</p>

<p>The objection aims to show that, like the idea God, the idea of the
existent lion and the idea of the maximally perfect island include
existence, and thus the existence of these objects can be established
via an ontological argument. But the claim that the existence of
Caterus’s lion and Gaunilo’s island can be established in
this way is absurd, and thus the same holds for the theistic
ontological argument. Note that this parity argument via
a <em>reductio ad absurdum</em>, if successful, would show that the
ontological argument is unsound, but without indicating which premise
or which step in the reasoning is at fault.</p>

<p>A second objection, anticipated by Descartes in the Fifth
Meditation, is that truly predicating a property of something without
indicating any conditions or intentional contexts seems already to
presume that the thing exists. So if we say that “Obama is
President of the USA” is true, it follows that Obama exists. As
a result, “Pegasus is a winged horse” is strictly-speaking
false, though by using the intentional context “according to the
myth” we can say, truly, that “According to the myth,
Pegasus is a winged horse”. This suggests that premise (3) above
is in trouble: it may be that Descartes can legitimately claim only
something like “According to the idea of God, God has all
perfections”, or, equivalently, “If God exists, then God has
all perfections”. But then all that follows in step (6) is the
unspectacular conclusion that “According to the idea of God, God
exists”, or, equivalently, “If God exists, then God
exists”. </p>

<p>A third problem, raised in the Second Objections by Father Marin
Mersenne, is that the argument would be sound only if a maximally
perfect being is really possible (or, equivalently, only if there is a
genuine divine essence). But this, Mersenne complains, has not been
established (AT 7.127). (Side note: Gaunilo and Mersenne are good
examples of how devout theists might still take issue with certain
kinds of efforts to prove God’s existence.)</p>

<p>Descartes’ reply to these objections involves the notion of a
“true and immutable nature” (“TIN”) (AT
7.101ff.). Only some of our ideas are ideas of things that have
TINs. Moreover, TINs themselves exist in some way, although they need
not exist in concrete or empirical reality. Maybe they are abstract
objects, like numbers or sets (Descartes explicitly compares them to
Plato’s Forms). In any case, the kind of existence TINs have is
sufficient to undermine the second objection above: the divine
essence—God’s nature—is a <em>true</em> and
immutable nature, and thus we do not need to prefix anything like the
phrase “According to the idea of God” to premise (3).
Rather, we can clearly and distinctly perceive that God’s nature
is a TIN, and then say simply that “God has all
perfections”. And that would then make the inference to (6) a
valid one. </p>

<p>Descartes’ challenge then is to show that God’s nature
is a TIN and that the natures of an “existent lion” and
“the maximally perfect island” are not. In the Fifth
Meditation Descartes maintains that TINs are different from fictitious
ideas in that TINs are in some sense independent of the thought of
their conceivers. For example, the nature of a triangle is a TIN
because it contains properties that we don’t grasp when we first
form the idea of a triangle, and deducing these further properties is
a process “more like discovery than creation”. God’s
nature also has this feature—we obviously don’t grasp all
of the properties of the maximally perfect being when we first form an
idea of it. The problem, however, is that it is not clear how this
criterion would rule out the natures of a most perfect island or an
existent lion. </p>

<p>Later, Descartes (AT 7.83–4) characterizes a TIN as having a
unity such that it cannot be divided by the intellect. He thinks that
having this feature shows that is hasn’t been simply put
together by the intellect or imagination, and is thus a genuine
nature.  Accordingly, the idea of an existent lion does not correspond
to a TIN because I can coherently conceive of a lion that
doesn’t exist.  As for the maximally perfect island, I can
conceive of it having fewer coconut trees but one more mango tree, and
so on. But although Descartes does not seem to recognize this, it also
seems that I can conceive of an omnipotent being that is lacking
maximal benevolence. So by this standard it appears that the idea
of God also fails to correspond to a true and immutable nature. </p>

<p>To the third problem, concerning the real possibility of God,
Descartes replies that our clear and distinct ideas of
TINs—produced in us by reason—are reliable. Since we can
(supposedly) see clearly and distinctly that there is no contradiction
in our idea of God’s nature, the denial that God is possible is
on equal footing with the denial that the angles of a triangle are
equal to two right angles (AT 7.150–1).</p>

<h4><a id="GWLei164">2.1.3 Gottfried Leibniz (1646–1716)</a></h4>

<p>Leibniz takes on several difficulties for Descartes’
ontological argument (in, e.g., Leibniz 1676 [1969]: 167–8; 1677
[1969]: 177–80; 1684 [1969]: 292–3; 1692 [1969]: 386; 1678
[1989]: 237–39; 1699 [1989]: 287–88; Adams 1994:
135–56). These can be grouped as follows:</p>

<ol type="A">
<li>that the claim that the essence of a most perfect being includes
its existence—that existence is a perfection—hasn’t
been substantiated;</li>

<li>that all this argument can establish is the conditional “If
an object of the concept of God exists, then God exists”;
and</li>

<li>that the real possibility of a most perfect being cannot be
demonstrated</li>
</ol>

<p>In several places Leibniz addresses (A) by arguing that by
“God” we understand a necessary being, and from this it
just follows that the essence of God involves existence. In this way
we supposedly avoid altogether the premise that existence is a
perfection. (One wonders, however, whether the argument for including
“necessary existence” in the idea of God will need to rely
on the premise that necessary existence is a perfection.)</p>

<p>In some writings Leibniz bypasses problem (B) by presenting an
argument with a different conditional as its conclusion:</p>

<ol>
<li>If there is a divine essence, then the divine essence involves
necessary existence. [premise]</li>

<li>If God is a possible being, then there is a divine essence.
[premise]</li>

<li>If God is a possible being, then the divine essence involves
necessary existence. [by (1), (2)]</li>

<li>If God is a possible being, then God necessarily exists. [by
(3)]</li>

<li>Therefore, if God is a possible being, then God actually exists.
[by (4)]</li>
</ol>

<p>What has yet to be dealt with, clearly, is Mersenne’s problem
above—namely, (C), that the real possibility of a most perfect
being cannot be demonstrated. Leibniz offers several types of
arguments against this. One relies on the fact that <em>other</em>
things are clearly possible, together with the claim that only a
necessary being provides a satisfactory ground or explanation for the
possible existence of contingent beings. So on the assumption that
contingent beings possibly exist, it must be at least possible for a
necessary God to exist (for more on this kind of argument from
possibility, see section 2.3 below). </p>

<p>A second type of Leibnizean argument for God’s real
possibility returns to the thesis that God is the most perfect being,
and adds that perfections are positive and simple, unanalyzable
qualities. So, for example, consider any proposition of the form
“<em>A</em> and <em>B</em> are incompatible”,
where <em>A</em> and <em>B</em> are any two perfections. Two
properties are incompatible only if they are logically incompatible,
according to Leibniz. Thus “<em>A</em> and <em>B</em> are
incompatible” will be true only if one of these perfections
turns out to be the negation of the other (as in omniscient and
non-omniscient), or if their analyses reveal simpler properties, one
of which is a negation of another. But on the assumption that all the
divine perfections are positive, simple, and thus unanalyzable,
neither of these scenarios can obtain. Consequently, “<em>A</em>
and <em>B</em> are compatible” will always be true for any two
perfections, and thus a being with all perfections will be really
possible (Leibniz 1678 [1989]: 238–39; Adams 1994:
142–48). </p>

<p>A third Leibnizean response to Mersenne’s objection is that it is
rational to presume the real possibility of the things we can
conceive, at least until their impossibility has been
demonstrated.</p>

<h4><a id="ImmKan172">2.1.4 Immanuel Kant (1724–1804)</a></h4>

<p>Kant’s most famous criticism of the ontological argument is
encapsulated in his claim that “existence” (or
“exists”) is not a “real predicate” (Kant
1781/1787: A592/B619ff). Alternatively, “existence” is not
“a predicate that is added to the concept of the subject and
enlarges it” (A598/B626). Kant’s idea here is that since
“existence” is not a real predicate, existing cannot be
one of God’s necessary perfections. </p>

<p>One way to interpret the objection is as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>Suppose <em>A</em> and <em>B</em> are two entities, and <em>A</em>
is greater than <em>B</em> at <em>t</em><sub>1</sub>. [premise]</li>

<li>If <em>B</em> becomes as great as <em>A</em>
at <em>t</em><sub>2</sub>, then <em>B</em> changes. [by (1)]</li>

<li>For every entity <em>x</em>, if <em>x</em> changes, then:
<ol type="a">
<li>there is a time <em>t</em><sub>1</sub> at which <em>x</em> has (or
lacks) some property <em>P</em>, and</li>

<li>there is a later time <em>t</em><sub>2</sub> at which <em>x</em>
lacks (or has) <em>P</em> as a result of <em>x</em>’s acting or
being acted upon. [premise]</li>
</ol></li>

<li>For every entity <em>x</em>, if <em>x</em> comes into existence in
reality, conditions (3a) and (3b) are not satisfied. [premise]</li>

<li>Therefore, when an entity comes into existence in reality, it
doesn’t change. [by (3), (4)]</li>

<li>Therefore, <em>B</em> cannot become as great as <em>A</em> solely
in virtue of <em>B</em>’s coming into existence in reality. [by
(2), (5)]</li>

<li>Therefore, <em>A</em> cannot be greater than <em>B</em> solely in
virtue of existing in reality. [by (6)]</li>
</ol>

<p>(4) is the key premise in this formulation—does coming into
existence involve a genuine change? There is clearly a technical sense
in which saying that a concept applies to something does not enlarge
the concept or change our conception of the being it refers to. But it
might still remain open that a being that has all perfections but does
not exist is not as great as a being that has all perfections and also
exists.</p>

<p>Finally, Kant’s objection can perhaps be avoided altogether
by proposing that the perfection at issue is <em>necessary
existence</em>, and not mere existence. Adding <em>necessary
existence</em> to our concept of a being would presumably involve
changing it (and thus enlarging its concept). This is effectively a
modal version of the ontological argument (see <a href="#ConModVer">section
2.1.5</a>).</p>

<p>Kant’s most pressing criticism, in our view, goes back to the
issue raised by Mersenne: we cannot determine whether God (conceived
as having necessary existence or not) is really possible. Kant grants
to Leibniz that the notion of a most perfect being may not involve a
logical contradiction, but he argues that this is not enough to show
that it is really possible, for there are ways of being impossible
that do not involve logical contradictions (A602/B630). The
implication for the ontological argument is that we cannot know
whether it is really possible for the divine perfections to be jointly
exemplified even if we know that they involve no contradiction,</p>

<blockquote><p>for how can my reason presume to know how the
highest realities operate, what effects would arise from them, and
what sort of relation all these realities would have to each other?
(Kant 1830, 1015–16)</p></blockquote>

<h4><a id="ConModVer">2.1.5 Contemporary Modal Versions</a></h4>

<p>Versions of the ontological argument discussed by Leibniz and Kant
have been elaborated by Robert M. Adams (1971), Alvin Plantinga
(1979), Peter van
Inwagen (1977, 2009) and others. These versions employ contemporary
modal semantics and metaphysics to motivate the following two
assumptions:</p>

<dl>
<dt>(Assumption 1):</dt><dd> “It’s possible that God
exists” means “there is some possible world in which God
exists”.</dd>

<dt>(Assumption 2):</dt><dd>“God necessarily exists” means
“God exists in every possible world” (i.e., “there
is no possible world in which God doesn’t exist”).</dd>
</dl>

<p>The argument then proceeds as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>It’s possible that God exists. [premise]</li>

<li>Therefore, God exists in some possible world (call
it <em>w</em>*). [by (1), (Assumption 1)]</li>

<li>If God exists, then God necessarily exists. [by definition of
“God”]</li>

<li>Therefore, in <em>w</em>* God necessarily exists. [by (2),
(3)]</li>

<li>Therefore, in <em>w</em>* God is such that God exists in every
possible world [by (4), (Assumption 2)]</li>

<li>The actual world is one of the possible worlds [premise]</li>

<li>Therefore, in <em>w</em>* God is such that God exists in the
actual world [by (5), (6)]</li>

<li>Therefore, God exists in the actual world [by (7)]</li>
</ol>

<p>Critics have resisted numerous aspects of the argument (for
comprehensive discussion, see Oppy 1996). The inference to (7), for
instance, assumes that the actual world is possible <em>relative</em>
to <em>w</em>*. But that assumption is only legitimate on some models
of how modal talk works. Thus, the critic claims, it hasn’t been
shown that <em>w</em>* has the relation to the actual world that
licenses the conclusion that God actually exists.</p>

<p>The most significant disagreement, however, is again the one that
Mersenne raised against Descartes. How can the possibility claim in
(1) be justified? Adams (1994: ch.8) claims that we are rationally
permitted, in the absence of strong reasons to the contrary,
to <em>presume</em> the real possibility of most things, including
God. Others argue that no such presumption of possibility is
justified, especially regarding supersensible things.</p>

<h3><a id="ArgNecTru">2.2 The argument from necessary truths</a></h3>

<p>Leibniz’s argument for God’s existence from the
existence of the necessary truths crucially involves the premises that
all truths must be true in virtue of something distinct from them
(they need what contemporary metaphysicans sometimes call a
“truth-maker”). Since necessary truths would be true even
if there were no finite minds to think them, such truths cannot be
true in virtue of facts about human psychology. Against the Platonic
suggestion that they are true in virtue of Forms existing outside of
any mind whatsoever, Leibniz argues that some of the truths are about
abstract entities, which are not the kinds of things that could have
mind-independent existence. The only contender that remains, then, is
that these truths are true in virtue of the ideas in an infinite and
necessarily existent (divine) mind (Leibniz 1714 [1969]: 647; Adams
1994: 177ff.).</p>

<p>Leibniz’s argument stakes out one position on the grounding
of necessary truths, but there are many rival and contending views
that do not invoke the existence of a necessary, concrete divine
being. A Platonist might respond by claiming that it hasn’t been
shown that abstract entities do not have mind-independent existence,
while Humeans would argue that necessary truths are all analytic, and
that therefore only the structure of language or of our conceptual
scheme is required to ground their truth.</p>

<h3><a id="ArgPos">2.3 The argument from possibility</a></h3>

<p>A third sort of <em>a priori</em> proof argues from facts about the
mere possibility of something (or of some collection of things) to the
existence of a “ground of possibility” that somehow
explains them. An early version of such an argument can be found in
Augustine and the Neo-Platonic tradition, but the canonical
presentations of this sort of “possibility proof” are in
Leibniz’s <em>Monadology</em> (1714) and, much more elaborately,
in Kant’s book-length treatise called <em>The Only Possible
Basis for a Demonstration of the Existence of God</em> (1763). Note
that if the truths about what is possible are necessary truths, as
they indeed seem to be, then this might be a more specific version of
the argument from necessary truths (see <a href="#ArgNecTru">2.2</a>).</p>

<p>Kant’s version of the argument is based on the claim that
there are real possibilities that are not grounded in the principle of
non-contradiction, but that nevertheless must have a ground or
explanation (Kant 1763 [1902–], 2: 63ff). If they are not
grounded in the principle of non-contradiction, then they are not
grounded in God’s thinking them rather than their negation,
which is how Leibniz had proposed that all such possibilities are
grounded. Put the other way around, Kant thinks that
some <em>impossibilities</em> are grounded <em>not</em> in the law of
non-contradiction, but in a non-logical kind of “real
repugnance” between two or more of their properties. Kant
maintains, for instance, that it is impossible for a material being to
be conscious, even though no logical contradiction exists
between <em>material</em> and <em>conscious</em> (Kant 1763
[1902–], 2: 85–6). It follows that this impossibility is
not grounded in divine thought, for God can think any proposition that
does not involve a contradiction. So facts about some real
possibilities and real impossibilities can only be grounded in a
necessary being that somehow <em>exemplifies</em> (rather than merely
thinking) every combination of fundamental properties whose joint
exemplification is possible.  That being, of course, is supposed to be
God. (For discussion, see Fisher and Watkins 1998; Adams 2000;
Chignell 2009, 2012, 2014; Stang 2010; Abaci 2014; Yong 2014).</p>

<p>One way out of this argument is simply to claim that some real
possibilities are primitive or ungrounded. This appears to be an
option for Kant in his critical period insofar as he is no longer
committed to rationalist principles such as the Principle of
Sufficient Reason. Still, even in his critical period (i.e., after
1770 or so), Kant never repudiated the earlier proof—and
supposedly claimed in a lecture from the 1780s that it “can in
no way be refuted” (Kant 1830, 1034). This suggests that in his
critical period Kant still held that God’s existence is the only
available ground for real possibility, but that the explanatory point
may justify at most a kind of theoretical belief (<em>Glaube</em>)
rather than full demonstrative knowledge (see Chignell 2007).</p>

<h2><a id="PosArg">3. <em>A posteriori</em> Arguments</a></h2>

<h3><a id="ClaCosArg">3.1 The classical cosmological argument</a></h3>

<p>An <em>a posteriori</em> argument involves at least one premise
whose justification essentially appeals to some sort of empirical fact
or experience. The main demonstrative <em>a posteriori</em> argument
is what Kant dubbed “the cosmological argument”. It is
motivated by the familiar question “Why is there something
rather than nothing?” and goes from the empirical fact of the
existence of something (or of the cosmos as a whole, perhaps) to the
existence of a first cause or ground of that cosmos that is, at least
in part, not identical to that cosmos. Cosmological arguments of this
sort are found across almost every human philosophical tradition, and
find prominence in the West in the writings of Aristotle, numerous
medieval Islamic authors, Maimonides, Aquinas, Locke, Leibniz, Samuel
Clarke, and David Hume. Here again we will focus largely on the early
modern period.</p>

<p>Leibniz’s cosmological argument aims to demonstrate the
existence of God from the need to explain certain facts about the
actual world. For Leibniz the world is the collection of all the
actual <em>contingent</em> beings -- that is, all of the actual beings
whose existence is possible but not necessary (Leibniz 1714 [1969]:
646). </p>

<p>Leibniz’s cosmological argument overcomes an important hurdle
for earlier versions, such as the Kaläm cosmological argument
(Craig 2000), since
Leibniz’s does not assume or argue that the world has a
beginning in time (a claim that detractors might well dispute, but for
which some, such as Craig (2000), have argued). Suppose that in fact
the world has no beginning in time, and that each being in the world
has an explanation in some previously existing being(s).  Two 
demands for explanation might still arise: Why is there a world at all rather
than none? and: Why does this world exist and not some other world?
Neither explanation can be provided on the basis of entities within
the world (or within time). Leibniz’s conclusion is that there
must be a being that is not merely hypothetically,
but <em>absolutely</em> necessary, and whose own explanation is
contained within itself. This being is God. (A similar cosmological
argument is advanced around the same time by Samuel Clarke (1705), see
also the entry on
  <a href="../clarke/">Samuel Clarke</a>).</p>

<p>David Hume advances three objections to the type of cosmological
argument offered by Leibniz and Clarke (Hume 1779, Part IX,
and the entry <a href="../hume-religion/">Hume on religion</a>). The
first is that the notion of (absolutely) necessary existence is
problematic. Suppose that some being is absolutely
necessary—then its nonexistence should be absolutely
inconceivable. But, says Hume, for any being whose existence we can
conceive, we can also conceive its nonexistence, and thus there
isn’t a necessary being. Hume anticipates the objection that if
we truly understood the divine nature, we would be unable to conceive
God’s nonexistence. He replies that an analogous point can be
made about matter: for all we know, if we truly understood the nature
of matter, we would be unable to conceive its nonexistence. This would
show that the existence of matter is not contingent after all, and
that it does not require an external explanation. Thus the
cosmological argument cannot establish that God is the necessary being
who is responsible for the rest of the cosmos.</p>

<p>Hume’s second objection is that God cannot be the causal
explanation for the existence of a series of contingent beings that
has no temporal beginning, since any causal relation “implies a
priority in time and a beginning of existence” (Part IV). In
reply, it seems quite possible to conceive of a non-temporal causal
relation, and thus to conceive of God, from outside of time, causing a
series of contingent beings that has always existed. Indeed, this view
is common in the theological tradition. Similarly, Kant and various
contemporary metaphysicians think we can coherently conceive of a
relation of <em>simultaneous causation</em>. If this is right, then
even a God who is in time could ground the existence of a series of
contingent beings with no temporal beginning. </p>

<p>Hume’s third objection is that in a causal series of
contingent beings without a temporal beginning, each being will have a
causal explanation by virtue of its predecessors. Since there is no
first being, there will be a causal explanation for every contingent
being on the basis of previously existing contingent beings. However,
if each individual contingent being has a causal explanation, then the
entire causal series has an explanation. For wholes are nothing over
and above their parts:</p>

<blockquote><p>did I show you the particular causes of each
individual in a collection of twenty particles of matter, I should
think it very unreasonable should you afterwards ask me what was the
cause of the whole twenty. (Part IV) </p></blockquote>

<p>A reply to this last objection might be that even if one has
explained in this way the existence of each individual in the
contingent series, one still has not answered the two questions mentioned earlier: Why is
there a world at all rather than none? and: Why does this world exist
and not some other world? (for more discussion, see Rowe 1975; Pruss 2006).</p>

<p>Kant, too, objects to the cosmological argument, but mainly on the
grounds that it delivers an object that is inadequate to the classical
conception of God. Any effort to turn the ultimate ground into the
most perfect of all beings, Kant says, will have to smuggle in some
sort of ontological argument (see Pasternack 2001; Forgie 2003; Proops
2014; and the entry on
 <a href="../kant-religion/">Kant’s philosophy of religion</a>).</p>

<p>In general, objections to the cosmological argument (both
historical and contemporary) take one of the following forms:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>not every fact requires explanation, and the fact that the
cosmological arguer is pointing to is one of those;</li>

<li>each being in the cosmos has an explanation, but the cosmos as an
entire series does not require an <em>additional</em> explanation,
over and above the explanations of each member of the series;</li>

<li>the sort of explanation required to explain the empirical data
cited by the cosmological arguer does not amount to a supernatural
explanation (e.g., the Big Bang could suffice);</li>

<li>the sort of explanation required to explain the empirical data
cited by the cosmological arguer is not going to deliver anything as
august as the God of traditional religious doctrine but rather, in
Hume’s terms, a somewhat “mediocre deity”.</li>
</ol>

<h3><a id="TelDesArg">3.2 Teleological or design arguments</a></h3>

<p>The Greek word “telos” means “end” or
“purpose”. The <em>a posteriori</em> arguments in natural
theology that are referred to as “teleological” claim that
the natural world displays some sort of purposive or end-directed
design, and that this licenses the conclusion that the natural world
has some sort of very powerful and intelligent designer
(see the entry on 
<a href="../teleological-arguments/">teleological arguments for God’s existence</a>). 
Earlier authors dubbed this
sort of non-demonstrative, inductive argument a
“physico-theological” argument (see, e.g., William Derham
1713).  </p>

<p>Teleological arguments are often associated with William Paley
(1743–1805), although in fact this type of argument has a much
longer history (see Taliaferro 2005). The fact that Paley’s 1802
book was called <em>Natural Theology</em> is no doubt part of why
natural theology as a whole is sometimes equated with the <em>a
posteriori</em> investigations of nature for the purposes of
supporting religious theses. In Paley’s famous analogy, the
relationship between a watch and a watch-maker is taken to be
saliently similar to the relationship between the natural world and
its author. If we were to go walking upon the heath and stumble upon a
watch, a quick examination of its inner workings would reveal, with a
high probability, that “its several parts were framed and put
together for a purpose” by what must have been “an
intelligence” (1802: 1–6). Likewise with nature as a
whole.</p>

<p>A different kind of teleological argument is developed by George
Berkeley (1685–1753), for whom natural, physical objects do not
exist independently of minds, but consist solely in ideas. Given the
regularity, complexity, and involuntariness of our sensory ideas,
their source (Berkeley argues) must be an infinitely powerful,
benevolent mind that produces these ideas in us in a lawlike
fashion. God’s existence can also be demonstrated from the
harmony and beauty that the ideas of the world display (Berkeley 1710:
§146). Since according to Berkeley our ordinary experience is a
type of direct divine communication with us, our relationship with God
is in this respect especially intimate. Thus he frequently remarks,
quoting St. Paul, that “in God we live and move and have our
being” (<em>Acts</em> 17:28).</p>

<h4><a id="HumTelArg">3.2.1 Hume on the teleological argument</a></h4>

<p>Hume’s <em>Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion</em>
pre-date Paley, of course, but they feature an especially influential
and elegant critical discussion of teleological arguments (1779), a
discussion of which Paley was no doubt aware. Hume’s argument
can be formulated as follows (compare Pereboom 1996, 2010):</p>

<ol>
<li>Nature is a great machine, composed of lesser machines, all of
which exhibit order (especially adaptation of means to ends).
[premise]</li>

<li>Machines caused by human minds exhibit order (especially
adaptation of means to ends). [premise]</li>

<li>Nature resembles machines caused by human minds. [by (1),
(2)]</li>

<li>If effects resemble each other, their causes resemble each other
as well. [premise]</li>

<li>The cause of nature resembles human minds. [by (3), (4)]</li>

<li>Greater effects demand greater causes (causes adequate to the
effects). [premise] </li>

<li>Nature is much greater than machines caused by human minds.
[premise]</li>

<li>The cause of nature resembles but is much greater than human
minds. [by (5), (6), (7)]</li>

<li>The cause of nature is God. [by (8)]</li>

<li>Therefore, God exists. [by (9)]</li>
</ol>

<p>Hume’s objections to this argument include the claims that
the analogies on which it is dependent are not exact, and thus that
there are alternative explanations for order and apparent design in
the universe. One response to these objections is that the
teleological argument should be conceived as an argument to
the <em>best</em> explanation, on the model of many scientific
arguments. In that case the analogy need not be exact, but might still
show that a theistic explanation is best.  Indeed, even
Hume, or at least his character Philo, concedes</p>

<blockquote><p>that the works of nature bear a great analogy to
the productions of art is evident; and according to all the rules of
good reasoning, we ought to infer, if we argue at all concerning them,
that their causes have a proportional analogy. (Part XII)</p></blockquote>

<p> But Philo also affirms that we cannot infer any
important similarities between humans and the author of nature beyond
intelligence, and in particular we cannot infer some of the divine
attributes that are most important for sustaining traditional theistic
religion (Part V). Most significantly, given the evil that there is in
the universe, we cannot conclude that its designer has the moral
qualities traditional religion requires God to have (Part X). Thus,
again, we are left with a rather “mediocre deity”.</p>

<p>One of Hume’s neglected objections to the teleological
argument is that it generates an absurd infinite regress (Part IV). If
order and apparent design in the material universe are explained by
divine intelligence, what explains the order and apparent design that
give rise to intelligence in the divine mind? By dint of the reasoning
employed in the teleological argument, it would have to be a
super-divine intelligence. But what explains the order and apparent
design that give rise to super-divine intelligence? An absurd infinite
regress results, and to avoid it one might well suppose the material
world “contain[s] the principle of order within
itself”. </p>

<p>To this Hume has the theist Cleanthes reply that</p>

<blockquote><p>even in common life, if I assign a cause for any
event, is it any objection that I cannot assign the cause of that
cause, and answer every new question which may incessantly be started?</p></blockquote>

<p>In scientific theorizing it is no decisive objection against an
explanation that it contains entities that are themselves not
adequately explained. Crucial to the value of scientific explanations
is that they supply an explanatory <em>advance</em>, and we can
reasonably believe that a theory does so without our having in hand
adequate explanations for all of the entities it posits. </p>

<h4><a id="TelArgFinTun">3.2.2 The teleological argument from fine-tuning</a></h4>

<p>In recent decades, some natural theologians have developed an
inductive argument for the existence of God that appeals to the fact
that the values of various forces of nature appear to be
“fine-tuned” for the existence of intelligent
life. William Lane Craig (see e.g., Craig 1990, 2003) argues as
follows. The world is conditioned principally by the values of the
fundamental constants:</p>

<ul>
<li>a: the fine structure constant, or electromagnetic
interaction;</li>

<li>mn/me: proton to electron mass ratio; </li>

<li>aG: gravitation;</li>

<li>aw: the weak force; and</li>

<li>as: the strong force.</li>
</ul>

<p>When one imagines different values to these constants or forces,
one discovers that in fact the number of observable universes, that is
to say, universes capable of supporting intelligent life, is very
small.  Just a slight variation in any one of these values would
render life impossible. For example, if the strong force (<em>as</em>)
were increased as much as 1%, nuclear resonance levels would be so
altered that almost all carbon would be burned into oxygen; an
increase of 2% would preclude formation of protons out of quarks,
preventing the existence of atoms. Furthermore, weakening the strong
force by as much as 5% would unbind deuteron, which is essential to
stellar nucleosynthesis, leading to a universe composed only of
hydrogen. It has been estimated that the strong force must be within
0.8 and 1.2 its actual strength or all elements of atomic weight
greater than four would not have formed. Or again, if the weak force
had been appreciably stronger, then the Big Bang’s nuclear
burning would have proceeded past helium to iron, making
fusion-powered stars impossible. But if it had been much weaker, then
we should have had a universe entirely of helium. Or again, if
gravitation <em>aG</em> had been a little greater, all stars would
have been red dwarfs, which are too cold to support life-bearing
planets. If it had been a little smaller, the universe would have been
composed exclusively of blue giants, which burn too briefly for life
to develop. This gives us reason to believe that there is an
intelligent agent who fine-tuned the universe to precisely these
levels.</p>

<p>A number of opponents press the following objection:</p>

<ul class="sentag tag2em">

<li><span class="tag">(1)</span><span class="sen">We should not be
surprised that we do not observe features of the universe that are
incompatible with our own existence.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>This is the “anthropic principle”—the idea is
just that if the features of the universe were incompatible with our
existence, we would not be here to notice it. Thus it is not
surprising that we do not observe such features.</p>

<p>Craig replies by arguing that it does not follow from (1) that</p>
<ul class="sentag tag2em">
  <li><span class="tag">(2)</span><span class="sen">We should not be
  surprised that we do observe features of the universe that are
  compatible with our existence.</span></li>
  </ul>

<p>Here is his analogy. Suppose you are dragged before a firing squad
of 100 trained marksmen, all of them with rifles aimed at your heart,
to be executed. The command is given; you hear the deafening sound of
the guns. And you observe that you are still alive, that all of the
100 marksmen missed! Now while it is true that</p>
<ul class="sentag tag2em">
<li><span class="tag">(3)</span><span class="sen">You should not be
surprised that you do not observe that you are dead,</span></li>
</ul>

<p>it is equally true that</p>
<ul class="sentag tag2em">
  <li><span class="tag">(4)</span><span class="sen">You should be
  surprised that you do observe that you are alive.</span></li>
  </ul>
<p>Because the firing squad’s missing you altogether is
extremely improbable, the surprise expressed in (4) is wholly
appropriate, though you are not surprised that you do not observe that
you are dead, since if you were dead you could not observe
it. Similarly, while we should not be surprised that we do not observe
features of the universe which are incompatible with our existence, it
is nevertheless true that</p>
<ul class="sentag tag2em">
<li><span class="tag">(5)</span><span class="sen">We should be
surprised that we do observe features of the universe that are
compatible with our existence</span></li>
</ul>
<p>in view of the enormous improbability that the universe should
possess such features.</p>

<p>John Leslie (2002) proposes that the hypothesis of multiple
universes would provide the explanation demanded by (5) (although he
is also an advocate of a fine-tuning argument). Here is his analogy
(which involves guns again, oddly). You are alone at night in an
extremely dark forest when a gun is fired from far away and you are
hit. If you assume that there is no one out to get you, this would be
surprising. But now suppose that you were not in fact alone, but
instead part of a large crowd (which you do not see because it’s
so dark). In that case, Leslie suggests, you would be less surprised
at being shot, since it seems a least somewhat likely that a gunman
would be trying to shoot someone in the crowd. Leslie suggests that
this story supports the multiple universe explanation for the fact
that the values of the fundamental forces of the universe appear
fine-tuned for life.</p>

<p>Roger White (2000) argues that there is a problem with
Leslie’s account. While the multiple-universe hypothesis would
explain why <em>there is some universe or other that is fine-tuned for
life</em>, since it would raise the probability of that hypothesis, it
would not similarly explain why <em>this universe is fine-tuned for
life</em>. He contends that supposing that the gunman was firing at
random, being part of a large crowd explains—raises the
probability—<em>that</em> <em>someone or other is shot</em>, but
not <em>that you are shot</em>. By contrast, the hypothesis that the
gunman was aiming at you, as opposed to firing at random, does explain
in this way that you are shot. Similarly, the multiple universe
hypothesis explains in this way <em>that there is some universe or
other that is fine-tuned for life</em>, but not <em>that this universe
is fine-tuned for life</em>. By contrast, the hypothesis of a designer
does explain why—raises the probability—that this universe
is fine-tuned for life. White argues:</p>

<blockquote><p>Postulate as many other universes as you wish,
they do not make it any more likely that ours should be
life-permitting or that we should be here. So our good fortune to
exist in a life-permitting universe gives us no reason to suppose that
there are many universes. (White 2000: 274)</p></blockquote>

<h3><a id="ArgRelExp">3.3 Arguments from religious experience</a></h3>

<p>Arguments for the existence of God from a special kind of
experience are often called “arguments from religious
experience”. Some philosophers and theologians have argued that
our ordinary human cognitive faculties include what John Calvin called
a special “sense of divinity” that, when not impeded or
blocked, will deliver immediately justified beliefs about supernatural
entities (Plantinga 1981, 1984). Some such thinkers, then, might
construe an argument from religious experience as belonging to the
category of natural religion or natural theology. Others, however,
insist that “characteristic of the Continental Calvinist
tradition is a revulsion against arguments in favor of theism or
Christianity” (Wolterstorff 1984: 7; see also Sudduth 2009). In
any case, most authors who write about religious experience generally
construe it as caused by something other than our ordinary faculties
and their intersubjectively available objects, and thus do not think
of it as one of the topics of natural theology (see Alston 1991).</p>

<h2><a id="RamNatThe">4. “Ramified” Natural Theology</a></h2>

<p>Some supporters of natural religion or natural theology seek to use
our ordinary cognitive faculties to support theses that are more
robust and specific than those of generic or
“perfect-being” theism. This project has recently been
dubbed “ramified” natural theology by Richard Swinburne
(see Holder 2013). A few of these efforts involve <em>a priori</em>
argumentation: an ancient argument for the Trinity (found in St.
Augustine (<em>De Trinitate</em>, c. 399–419, Book IX), and
Richard of St. Victor (<em>De Trinitate</em>, c. 1162–1173,
III.1–25)) is that any supreme being would have to be a
supremely loving being, and any omnipotent supremely loving being
would ultimately have to emanate from itself something that is both
other and yet just as supreme and lovable as itself, and that a third
such person would be necessary as a kind of product of that love
between the first two. More recently, Marilyn McCord Adams’s
books on theodicy(Adams 2000, 2006) and Eleonore Stump’s Gifford
Lectures (Stump 2010) constitute an effort to consider the <em>a
priori</em> problem of evil from within the context of a ramified (and
thus in this case more robustly Christian) kind of natural
theology.</p>

<p>But most ramified natural theology is inductive in spirit: thus
John Locke (1695) famously argued for the “Reasonableness of
Christianity” using a broadly historical, probabilistic
approach. William Paley (1794) further developed this approach,
and much more recently the contemporary Lockean Richard Swinburne
argued for the conclusion that Bayesian-style reasoning justifies
belief in the resurrection of Jesus with a probability of 97%
(Swinburne 2003). Numerous other philosophers (and also many natural
scientists) appeal to historical and scientific data as well as
empirical and statistical principles of reasoning to support the
authenticity of various biblical claims, the probability of various
miracle stories, and so forth (see e.g., Olding 1990; Polkinghorne
2009; Gauch Jr. 2011). Note that this is a way of appealing to the
content of sacred texts and special revelation which is consistent
with the methods of natural theology: the prophetic or historical
claims of those texts are evaluated using public evidence and accepted
canons of inductive reasoning. Still, even such optimistic natural
theologians as Locke, Paley, Swinburne, and these others count as
hybridists insofar as they think that there are some important
doctrines about the divine or supernatural that cannot be justified by
our natural cognitive faculties. Thus even they will at some point be
willing (in Kant’s famous phrase) to “deny knowledge in
order to leave room for faith”.</p>
