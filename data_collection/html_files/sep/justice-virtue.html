<h1>Justice as a Virtue</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Fri Mar 8, 2002; substantive revision Thu Jan 21, 2016</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
The notion of justice as a virtue began in reference to a trait of
individuals, and to some extent remains so, even if today we often
conceive the justice of individuals as having some (grounding)
reference to social justice. But from the start, the focus on justice
as a virtue faced pressures to diffuse, in two different ways.</p>

<p>
First, “justice as a virtue” is ambiguous as between individual
and social applications. Rawls and others regard justice as “the
first virtue of social institutions” (1971, p. 3), but Rawls is not
the first to think of justice as a virtue of social institutions or
societies — Plato was there long before him. However, justice as
a virtue of societies, polities, and their institutions is addressed
 <a href="../justice-distributive/">elsewhere</a>,
 so the focus in this essay will be on justice as a virtue in
individuals. That said, individuals typically live as members of
political communities, so the societal dimension of justice as a
virtue will never be long out of view.</p>

<p>
Second, from the start the effort to analyze the <i>virtue</i> of
justice has led to attempts to formalize the <i>requirements</i> (or
norms) of justice, and at times the latter project has threatened to
swallow the first in ways that make thinking of a <i>virtue</i> of
justice gratuitous or otiose. We might be tempted to think that the
virtue of justice consists simply in compliance with the norms of
justice our theory specifies: a just person will be one who complies
with the norms of justice, whether those are narrowly interpersonal or
more broadly social or political in scope. In this way the virtue
becomes subsidiary to norms of justice independently specified. Doing
so threatens to lose the force that the notion of virtue had in the
earliest thinking about justice. </p>

<p>
A further complication is that even the idea of justice as a virtue of
individuals seems ambiguous in regard to scope. Plato in the
<i>Republic</i> treats justice as an overarching virtue of both
individuals and societies, so that almost every issue he (or we) would
regard as ethical comes in under the notion of justice. But in later
usages justice covers only part of individual morality, and we don't
readily think of someone as <i>unjust</i> if they lie or neglect their
children — other epithets more readily spring to mind.
Individual justice first and most readily regards moral issues having
to do with distributions of goods or property. It is, we say, unjust
for someone to steal from people or not to give them what he owes
them, and it is also unjust if someone called upon to distribute
something good (or bad or both) among members of a group uses an
arbitrary or unjustified basis for making the distribution. Discussion
of justice as an individual virtue often centers on questions,
therefore, about property and other distributable goods, though the
broader sense broached by Plato never entirely disappears. </p>

<h2><a id="His">1. History</a></h2>

<h3><a id="Anc">1.1 Ancient</a></h3>

<p>
Philosophical discussion of justice begins with Plato, who treats the
topic in a variety of dialogues, most substantially in
<i>Republic</i>. There Plato offers the first sustained discussion of
the nature of justice (<i>dikaiosune</i>) and its relation to
happiness, as a departure from three alternatives receiving varying
degrees of attention. First, there is a traditionalist conception of
justice (speaking the truth and paying your debts). Second, Plato has
Socrates rebut the Sophist conception of justice which built on a
distinction between nature (<i>phusis</i>) and convention
(<i>nomos</i>) As Plato has this conception articulated by
Thrasymachus in Book I, justice is simply the “advantage of the
stronger,” not tracking anything like the sort of value attributed
to it by traditionalists. Finally, Plato has Socrates confront a
conventionalist conception of justice that anticipates modern
contractarian views, in which justice — forbearing preying on
others in exchange for not being preyed on by them — is a
“second-best alternative,” not as good as being able to prey at
will upon others, but better than being the prey of others. These last
two challenges give rise to the central question of the book: to whose
advantage is justice? Would we really be better off being unjust if we
could get away with it? Plato’s negative answer to that question is
the project of the balance of the work.</p>

<p>
Plato’s method involves the provocative idea that justice in the
city (<i>polis</i>) is the same thing as justice in the individual,
just “writ large.” There are good reasons to worry about that
assumption (Williams 1973; Keyt 2006). But in Plato’s sociology of
the city, there are three classes engaged in a kind of division of
labor. There is a guardian class which rules, a class of
“auxiliaries” that provide the force behind the ruling, and the
class of merchants that produce to satisfy the needs and desires of
the city. Similarly, the psyche of the individual has three parts: a
reasoning part to rule, a “spirited” part to support the rule of
reason, and an appetitive part. Plato finds justice in the city to
consist in each part “having and doing its own,” and since the
smaller is just like the larger, justice in the individual consists in
each part of the psyche doing its own work. (This grounds the idea,
later enshrined by Justinian, that justice is “giving every man his
due;” Justinian I.i). Further, Plato argues, justice is a master
virtue in a sense, because in both the city and the psyche, if each
part is doing its own job, both city and psyche will also have wisdom,
courage, and moderation or self-discipline. This conception of justice
sustains the contrast with the conventionalist view advocated by the
Sophists. On the other hand, at least initially it leaves it an open
question whether the just individual refrains from such socially
proscribed actions as lying, killing, and stealing. Plato eventually
seeks to show that someone with a healthy, harmonious soul wouldn't
lie, kill, or steal, but it is not clear that argument succeeds, nor,
if it does, that that is the right understanding of why we ought not
to lie, kill, or steal (Sachs 1963, LeBar 2013, ch. XII).</p>

<p>
Plato gives a somewhat different treatment of justice in <i>Crito</i>,
in which Socrates’ eponymous friend attempts to persuade Socrates to
accept his (Crito’s) offer to bribe a way out of the death sentence
Socrates is waiting to have executed. Here Plato’s arguments first
associate the just life with the good life, thus the life Socrates has
most reason to live. And justice, he then argues, requires not only
not inflicting wrong or injury on others, even in response to wrongs
from them, but fulfilling one’s agreements, and — in
particular — abiding by one’s (tacit or explicit) agreement to
abide by the laws of the city unless one can persuade it to change
them. Of course, justice cannot require one to abide by laws that
require one to act unjustly, as Socrates’ own case (as characterized
in <i>Apology</i>) shows (Kraut 1984).</p>

<p>
Aristotle does not see the virtue of justice in quite the
comprehensive sense Plato does; he treats it as a virtue of character
(in the entirety of one of the ten books of the <i>Nicomachean
Ethics</i>, also common to the <i>Eudemian Ethics</i>), and as a
virtue of constitutions and political arrangements (in
<i>Politics</i>). The question naturally arises as to the relation
between these forms of justice. Aristotle seems to think they are
closely related, without being synonymous applications of the same
concept. As the latter is a conception of political justice, we will
focus here on the former. Justice as a personal virtue follows
Aristotle’s model for virtues of character, in which the virtue lies
as an intermediate or mean between vices of excess and defect
(<i>Nicomachean Ethics</i> V). While he grants that there is a
“general” sense of justice in which justice is coincident with
complete virtue, there is a “particular” sense in which it is
concerned with not overreaching (<i>pleonexia</i>). It is not clear,
however, exactly how Aristotle understands this arrangement, or the
nature of the vices of excess and defect which this particular justice
is to counteract. One very plausible reading has it that justice is
opposed to a desire for maldistribution of “goods of fortune” such
as money, fame, or honor (Williams 1980, Curzer 1995). On another it
is opposed to an insufficient attention to others’ rights (Foot
1988, p. 9). On still another it focuses on the goods of others, or
common goods (O’Connor 1988, Miller 1995).</p>

<p>
These issues remain open in part because Aristotle seems most
interested in establishing a conception of the formal <i>structure</i>
of justice, which seems to reflect a conception of desert. He
distinguishes within particular justice between justice in
distribution and justice in rectification. The former, he claims,
adheres to a kind of proportionality, in which what each deserves is
proportional to the relationship between the contributions. If A
contributes twice as much as B (of whatever the metric of merit is
relevant in some particular case), then A’s return ought also to be
twice B’s. This conception of distributive justice obviously lends
itself to “goods of fortune” — and to some goods, like
wealth, more obviously than others — but it need not in
principle be confined to such goods, although the examples Aristotle
provides suggest such applications. Similarly, justice in
rectification involves a sort of “arithmetical proportion.” If C
defrauds D by amount X, then justice requires depriving C of X and
restoring X to D, as a matter of reestablishing a kind of equality
between them. These structural devices are elegant and attractive, but
they leave open a number of questions. First, as indicated, to what
are we to suppose they apply? Second, in what way do they figure into
the nature of the person who is just in the particular sense? (That
is, how are they related to justice as a virtue?) Does a model of
particular justice as a virtue fit the general model of virtue as a
mean, and if so, what sort of mean is it? Aristotle seems torn between
a conception of justice as a virtue in his distinctive understanding
of what a virtue is — with a requirement that one have all the
virtues to have any (<i>Nicomachean Ethics</i>VI.13), and rooted in
the doctrine of the mean — and justice as having the form of a
formal normative structure, to which the virtue threatens to become
subsidiary. All this is to leave aside questions of the relation
between this particular sense of justice and political justice, and
the role of the virtue of justice in the individual as it contributes
to justice in the polis.</p>

<p>
Epicurus’ conception of the role of justice was more central to his
eudaimonism perhaps than its counterpart in Plato and Aristotle, but
that reflects in part his distinctive understanding of
<i>eudaimonia</i>, or happiness. For Epicurus this consisted in
<i>ataraxia</i> — tranquility, or freedom from disturbance.
Given that the good life is the life without disturbance, justice
plays a key instrumental role. One might, Epicurus thinks, withdraw
entirely from human society to avoid disturbance, but the alternative
is to live socially under terms which secure the avoidance of
disturbance. This is the structure of the ideal Epicurean community,
in which each forbears aggression (Armstrong 1997, Thrasher 2013).
Justice is a matter of keeping agreements generally, and in particular
the agreement not to harm or transgress social norms.</p>

<p>
In this way Epicurus offers a conception of the virtue of justice that
harmonizes both its personal and its political dimensions. The
personal virtue consists in the motivation to abide by a contract not
to aggress or harm others. The political virtue inheres in a polity in
which such norms regulate the conduct of its citizens, and these two
dimensions of justice as a virtue reinforce each other.</p>

<p>
The other great ethical tradition of antiquity (Stoicism) had
remarkably little to say about justice (Annas 1993, p. 311), so we
pass on to the modern period.</p>

<h3><a id="Mod">1.2 Modern</a></h3>

<p>
Both Plato and Aristotle were rationalists as regards both human
knowledge and moral reasons, and what they say about the virtue of
justice clearly reflects the commitment to rationalism. Much
subsequent thinking about justice (especially in the Middle Ages) was
influenced by Plato and Aristotle and likewise emphasized the role of
reason both in perceiving what is just and in allowing us to act
justly rather than to give in to contrary impulses or desires. Aquinas
for example largely defends Aristotle’s account of justice,
including Aristotle’s distinction between general and particular
justice, and similarly grounds justice in a kind of proportionality
among people.</p>

<p>
But to the extent Christian writers allied themselves with Plato and
Aristotle, they were downplaying another central element in Christian
thought and morality, the emphasis on agapic love. Such love seems to
be a matter of motivationally active feeling rather than of being
rational, and some writers on morality (eventually) allowed this side
of Christianity to have a major influence on what they had to say
about virtue.</p>

<p>
In particular, the “moral sentimentalists” Hutcheson and Hume
treated morality as grounded in something other than reason, and the
influence of Christian ideas and ideals of agapic love on Hutcheson
(at least) is well documented. For Hutcheson, universal (i.e.,
impartial) benevolence is the highest and best of human motives, but
we know this, not through reason, but through a moral sense (or
sensitivity). Also, according to Hutcheson, the individual virtue of
justice (ultimately) consists in being motivated by universal
benevolence, and he explicitly denies that benevolence can ever
conflict with true justice. </p>

<p>
Hume saw (or believed he saw), however, that individual justice at
least sometimes conflicts with what benevolence or even a simplistic
prudence would motivate us to do. He is as much a sentimentalist as
Hutcheson, believing that judgments about virtue and rightness depend
on our passions rather than on some form of reason (or on a distinct
moral sense). But he thinks that the sentimentalist owes us an account
of how a sense of justice that is sometimes opposed to benevolence,
sympathy, and apparent self-interest can nonetheless develop out of
such motives. Motives like benevolence, curiosity, sympathy, and
prudence Hume calls natural in the twofold sense that they exist apart
from social convention(s) and that they do not require explicitly
ethical thinking (or conscience) or in order to issue in action. But
the virtue of justice is not natural, but rather should be considered
“artificial,” according to Hume, because it depends for its
existence on human conventions and artifices and because the primary
motive to justice is a reflective recognition of its necessity for
social life (Hume 1751).</p>

<p>
Now Hume thinks of the individual virtue of justice quite narrowly as
comprising a certain kind of respect for (other people's) property.
The just person doesn't steal from others and returns what he has
borrowed (and Hume points out the similarity of this usage to the
Aristotelian notion that justice consists in everyone getting his due,
what he merits). But there are other artificial virtues, according to
Hume, among them fidelity (keeping one's promises), law-abidingness,
and (feminine) modesty or chastity. Hume thinks that it is difficult
to account for any one, or all, of these artificial virtues in (his
own) empiricist anti-rationalist terms, and there are at least two
reasons for this.</p>

<p>
One has to do with the inadequacy of natural motives like benevolence
or prudence for grounding the requirements of justice, given the
scarcity of the means of meeting our needs. In primitive or simple
societies, there may always be reasons of prudence to act justly with
respect to the property of others: violations of justice are always
likely to be detected by others and to lead to consequences one would
prefer to avoid. In such circumstances honesty (a term Hume tends to
use narrowly as synonymous with “justice”) really is the best
policy. Furthermore, within the narrow confines of a small group,
personal affection and benevolent concern for those one knows and
lives with may lead one to refrain from violations of their property.
But in a larger (and more advanced) society, things will be
different.</p>

<p>
In large-scale modern societies (of the sort Hume lived in) we may not
know our neighbors, much less all those people our actions might
affect, and the people whose property justice calls on us to respect
include a vast majority who don't know us either. Under conditions of
such relative anonymity and complexity, the identity of a thief may be
much more difficult to ascertain, and if one (knows one) can get away
with stealing on some occasions, then prudence is presumably incapable
of motivating a just refusal or unwillingness to steal. More
importantly, perhaps, the conditions of a modern society leave us
without strong ties of affection to many of the people we interact
with or may affect by our actions, and Hume thinks that normal
humanity or humane benevolence isn't a strong enough motive to get us
to refrain from a theft that would greatly benefit ourselves or our
families (those we do have strong affections toward). So if we refrain
from such theft, we cannot explain or justify such refraining by
reference to any actual natural motives.</p>

<p>
But of course we do (many of us) justly refrain from taking or
violating other people's property on occasions when natural motives as
such may seem incapable of explaining why we do, and Hume believes
(not uncommonsensically) that it is artificial motives or motivation
that explain why we do so. Someone who can get away with stealing and
who has stronger reasons/motives of affection to steal than not to
steal may nonetheless refrain from stealing because she thinks it
unjust or wrong to steal. A sense of duty or conscience is thus for
Hume absolutely essential to understanding the virtue and obligation
of justice/honesty.</p>

<p>
Moreover (and this is perhaps the most important point for Hume), even
if human beings were capable of the strong universal and impartial
benevolence that Hutcheson regarded as the cornerstone of moral
virtue, such benevolence would not in all instances suffice for us to
fulfill our intuitive obligations of justice. Justice and moral
obligation sometimes seem opposed to the dictates of (what would be
motivated by) universal benevolence, and Hume cites one's obligation
(of justice) to return what one owes to a “seditious bigot” as one
glaring instance of this point. Concern for the good of society or of
humanity would presumably dictate that one not return to the bigot
money or property he would use to subvert and corrupt society or the
state, but, according to Hume, we nonetheless think it obligatory to
return what we owe, and what gets us to do so, therefore, is a(n
artificial) sense of duty (or justice) rather than any (even
hypothetically imaginable) natural motive.</p>

<p>
It is possible to question this, and Bentham, for example, claimed
that his disagreement with Hume's view of our actual obligations in
such cases was what initially led him to utilitarianism. However, the
idea that we should return the money or property despite what
free-wheeling prudence or benevolence would lead us to do is
intuitively forceful, and Hume shows himself aware of the potential
clash here between benevolence and justice in a way that Hutcheson was
not. Moreover, we dwell at some length on Hume in part because the
question of whether justice can be understood entirely in terms of
natural motives is (as Hume rightly saw) absolutely crucial to
understanding the nature of justice as an individual (or, for that
matter, social) virtue.</p>

<p>
Now if we agree that the right and just thing to do in cases like that
of the seditious bigot is to return what one owes, then the importance
of artificial motives looms large. But this leaves Hume with a problem
(or a set of problems). Hume is an empiricist and an anti-rationalist
who emphasizes feeling or sentiment as the basis of morality. But if
natural motives can't explain the virtue of justice, then the
sentimentalist owes us an account of how the artificial motives can
develop to do the necessary work. Rationalists tend to think of the
sense of duty as a response of reason to certain moral facts or
relations, so if Hume is to maintain his sentimentalism, he needs
(among other things) to explain to us (in terms compatible with his
empiricist premises) how for example a sense of duty develops out of
(or can exist as a) feeling or feelingful motivation. And, as is well
known, Hume finds this extremely difficult to do.</p>

<p>
Hume seeks to explain moral judgment and a sense of duty or
conscientiousness based in such judgment in terms of the same
mechanisms of sympathy that operate within and through the natural
virtues. However, we tend to be more sympathetic with those near and
dear to us, and moral judgment seeks or presupposes some sort of
impartiality regarding those affected by or engaging in actions (it is
no more wrong for someone to kill a member of my family than for
someone to kill someone I don't know). So Hume argues that we in
various ways (try to) correct for personal (or temporal) bias when
making moral judgments and take, in particular, the view of a
sympathetic but impartial spectator in doing so. But this still can't
explain why we should in all conscience and justice return what we owe
to the seditious bigot: here the most extensive and impartial sympathy
would seem to dictate acting for the greatest happiness rather than
justly in Hume's terms. </p>

<p>
Matters are even more problematic for Hume's theory of justice and the
other artificial virtues because Hume makes it clear that he is (what
we would call) a virtue ethicist. He says that the moral status of an
action depends entirely on the goodness or badness of the motive that
lies behind it, so that, e. g., it is only because certain helpful
actions were intended to be helpful (were motivated by the natural
virtue of benevolence) that we morally approve of them or judge them
to be right and good. However, it is difficult to apply this
virtue-ethical assumption to the artificial virtues, because the good
motive operative in their instance is <i>the conscientious desire to
do one's duty or what is right or obligatory</i>. According to Hume,
if I return what I owe to the seditious bigot, my only just motive is
the desire to do what is right and obligatory, but, in that case, the
morally good motive that is supposed (according to Hume's virtue
ethics) to <i>explain</i> the rightness or goodness of returning what
I owe to the seditious bigot <i>already makes essential reference to
the rightness or goodness or obligatoriness of doing so</i>. As Hume
himself tells us, this seems to be arguing (explaining) in a circle,
and Hume makes the same point (perhaps even more forcefully) about
fidelity to promises. </p>

<p>
One way of trying to square this circle involves seeing Hume as
thinking of multiple levels at work in the explanation of actions
flowing from the artificial virtues (Sayre-McCord 1996). In the case
of justice, in particular, Hume believes that a kind of reflected
force of prudence motivates us. We see the advantages of the kind of
mutual constraint that figured in the contractarian story bruited by
Plato. Hume thinks we do not need a contract or any other formal
arrangement to begin to live with others in this way: like two oarsmen
in a boat, we naturally begin to coordinate. So the motive which
compels us to act this way is the familiar engine of self-interest.
But that cannot itself support the thought that such a disposition is
a virtue, for the reasons just given. It is only because of the great
advantages of such a disposition — its central role in making
possible and sustaining the utility of social life — that it is
praiseworthy in the way that virtues must be. So on this view, Hume
has devised a way to ground a disposition to abide by norms of justice
that can tap into the font of motivation available to the passions
surrounding self-interest. Not all commentators think this is an
adequate way out: if it is not, then Hume's attempt to justify or
explain justice as an individual virtue via empiricist sentimentalist
(associationist) mechanisms cannot succeed.</p>

<p>
Adam Smith, like Hume, has a general account of virtue built on
sentiment, in particular “a desire for a mutual sympathy of
sentiments.” His view of the virtue of justice is developed in
contrast with the virtue of beneficence. In Smith, even more clearly
than in Hume, one can see that the virtue consists in conformity to
“rules” or “laws” of justice that seem to exist antecedently
to the realization of the virtue itself, unlike ancient accounts.
Smith indicates that it merits resentment when absent, that it may be
“extorted by force,” and that in the main it requires forbearing
from harming others, such that often all it requires is that we sit
still and do nothing (Smith 1759, II.ii.I.5, 9). It is essential to
the subsistence of society, Smith tells us, but — in contrast to
Hume — is not reducible in its motivational basis to regard for
society. Instead, our just concern for “multitudes” is compounded
of our concern for individuals, which arises from
“fellow-feeling,” which is yet short of “love, esteem, and
affection.” </p>

<p>
In Kant we see the completion of the distinction between justice as a
virtue and justice as a norm to which a virtue may or may not
correspond. While Kant has a theory (or “doctrine”) of virtue, he
distinguishes that theory precisely against a counterpoised theory of
justice. The two are complementary elements in the “metaphysics of
morals.” Moreover, the doctrine of justice itself has two parts,
roughly corresponding to the distinction present since Plato’s work,
between the role of justice in the individual and the role of justice
in the state. Kant calls these “private right” and “public
right,” respectively. But right in either case is not how Kant at
least conceives of virtue; instead, it is a “condition” that can
obtain between the moral agents comprising a moral or legal community,
in virtue of their principles of choice in acting (Kant 1797). Little
remains here of the notion of justice as a virtue of individuals as it
began with the ancient Greeks. </p>

<h2><a id="SocPsyJus">2. Social Psychology and Justice</a></h2>

<p>
20th-century developmental psychology drew deeply on the Kantian
legacy. Piaget (1932/1948) treated moral development as principally
involving increasing cognitive sophistication. More particularly,
Piaget saw that sophistication as a matter of taking more and more
general or universal views of moral issues, and endorsed the Kantian
and rationalist idea that morality rests on and can be justified in
terms of considerations of justice. Piaget saw a “law of
evolution” in moral development, from an understanding of rules
(including moral rules) as being “heteronomous” impositions of
authority, to which one is objectively responsible, to a grounding in
mutual respect, accompanied by subjective responsibility to others
(Piaget 1932/1948, p. 225). This transition is fostered through social
interaction, and attention to norms of equality and reciprocity
replace those of mere obedience.</p>

<p>
Educational psychologist Lawrence Kohlberg was inspired by Piaget to
propose a conception of moral development that postulated six stages
of human moral development. In his earliest work, Kohlberg identified
the highest stage of such development with a concern for justice and
human rights based on universal principles. Concern for relationships
and for individual human well-being was embedded in a framework of
conformity to social norms, at lower stages of the process. Moreover,
he saw the ordering of the different stages in Piagetian fashion as
basically reflecting differences in rational understanding: those
whose moral thinking involved the invoking of universal principles of
justice and rights were thought to show a more advanced cognitive
development than those whose moral thought appeals primarily to the
importance of relationships and of human well-being or suffering. The
paradigm of moral development involves judgments that are
“reversible,” in the sense that each party to the issue can accept
the correct judgment by reversing his or her perspective and taking up
the viewpoint of the other (Kohlberg 1981). The sophisticated moral
reasoner will engage in a process of “moral musical chairs,”
taking up the positions of the parties to the conflict successively.
It is, on this version of Kohlberg’s thought, that formal feature of
the deliberative process that is characteristic of greatest moral
development. As his research and thought progressed, however, Kohlberg
increasingly acknowledged that these formal features were less
characteristic of overall moral development and thought than of the
deployment of specifically justice-based concepts. In fact, Kohlberg
was impressed by the work of Rawls, and thought that the nature of
Rawls' "original position of equality" exemplified the kind of
reversibility that is paradigmatic of the highest form of moral
thought (Kohlberg 1981, p. 204). However, his approach treats
utilitarianism as less cognitively advanced (more primitive) than
rationalist views like Kant's, and utilitarians (like R.M. Hare)
naturally called into question the objectivity and intellectual
fairness of Kohlberg's account. </p>

<p>
More significantly, perhaps, the evidence for Kohlberg's stage
sequence was drawn from studies of boys, and when one applies the
sequence to the study of young girls, it turns out that girls on
average end up at a less advanced stage of moral development than boys
do. In her 1982 book <i>In a Different Voice: Psychological Theory and
Women's Development</i>, Carol Gilligan responded to Kohlberg's views
by questioning whether a theory of moral development based solely on a
sample of males could reasonably be used to draw conclusions about the
inferior moral development of women. Gilligan argued that her own
studies of women's development indicated that the moral development of
girls and women proceeds and ends in a different fashion from that of
boys and men, but that that proves nothing about inferiority or
superiority: it is merely a fact of difference. In particular,
Gilligan claimed that women tend to think morally in terms of
connection to others (relationships) and in terms of caring about
(responsibility for) those with whom they are connected; men, by
contrast and in line with Kohlberg's studies, tend to think more in
terms of general principles of justice and of individual rights
against (or individual autonomy from) other people. But Jean Hampton,
among others, responded that Gilligan’s critique was itself a
distortion, and that concerns for justice and individual rights are as
significant for and in the moral lives of women as for men (Hampton
1993).</p>

<h2><a id="CarJus">3. Caring and Justice</a></h2>

<p>
Subsequently, many have questioned the empirical validity or accuracy
of the studies Gilligan relied upon, but others have pointed out that
the idea of a “different voice” need not be tied to specific
assumptions about differences between the sexes. The voice of justice
and principle arguably represents a different style of moral thinking
(and of an overall moral life) from that of caring for and connection
with others, and later writers (notably Nel Noddings, but also
Gilligan herself in later work) tried to elaborate what a morality
(moral life) based in caring would be like and also to show that such
a morality may be superior to that embodied in traditional thinking
about justice and rights and universal(izable) moral principles.</p>

<p>
The primary fulcrum for articulation of any ethic of care or caring
seems to lie in an ideal that stresses connection over separateness.
The Kantian emphasis on the autonomy of the moral person and the
Rawlsian or contractarian assumption of separate individuals coming
together to forge a social contract see us as essentially separate
from others, whereas an ideal of caring concern for others sees our
(initial) actual historical and personal connections with others as
the basis for a positive and caring response to such connection.
(However, an ethic of caring doesn't favor social conservatism in the
way much communitarian thought does: any social structure that shows
insufficient concern for one group or another can arguably be
criticized via the ideal of mutual caring.)</p>

<p>
In addition, an ethic of justice and rights — if removed from
the original context of justice as a virtue of individuals — may
tell us to regulate our actions or lives in accordance with certain
general moral principles (or explicitly moral insights), whereas the
ethic of care stresses the good of a concern for the welfare of others
that is <i>unmediated</i> by principles, rules, or judgments that tell
us that we ought to be concerned about their welfare. In an ethic of
care, therefore, caring is treated as a natural virtue in Hume's
sense, but this further highlights the way in which such an ethic
involves us in connection with, rather than separateness from, other
people. If we are concerned about others on the basis of a
conscientious desire to do our duty or adhere to certain moral
principles, then our concern for them is mediated by moral thinking,
and someone, therefore, who cares about the welfare of others without
having to rely on or be guided by explicit moral principles (or
thinking) is more connected with those others than someone who acts
only on the basis of such mediating principles (or thought). So the
ethic of care or caring stresses connection with others both in what
it says about the normative basis of morality and in what it says
about the ways in which moral goodness shows itself within a morally
good life.</p>

<p>
As indicated above, defenders of an ethic of care or caring have
increasingly come to view caring as grounding (offering a normative
basis for) morality as a whole. That means that ideas about justice
and rights either have no validity or can actually be reinterpreted
and given an arguably firmer justification in terms of (what we
originally regarded as the opposed notion of) caring. But it is
difficult to believe that morality can properly or plausibly be
confined to intimate relations of caring. For better or worse, we have
to learn to live together in larger social units, and we cannot be
intimate or even acquainted with every human being whose actions and
fate are morally significant for us. So an ethic of caring that seeks
to account for individual and social morality generally needs to say
something in its own voice about social and international justice and
about how given individuals can realize the virtue of justice.</p>

<p>
In answer to this more or less explicit challenge, some care ethicists
have highlighted potential analogies between the way a mother cares
for her children and the kinds of care a government, state, or society
can offer to its citizens or inhabitants (who presumably cannot
provide everything they need and want on their own). Others have noted
that the notion of caring doesn't have to be restricted to close
personal relationships and that one can intuitively speak of caring,
in humanitarian fashion, about people one doesn't know (except by
description). This then allows there to be obligations of caring both
toward near and dear and toward humanity more generally, though the
issue of how to balance these concerns becomes very important at that
point.</p>

<p>
But all these ways of developing and extending an ethic of care seem
united in stressing (what Hume calls) natural motives over artificial
ones. If someone who doesn't care about his family, or about human
beings in general, always fails to act helpfully toward others, he
exhibits a lack of caring, and an ethic of care regards acts which
display such morally deficient motivation as morally criticizable and
wrong. This is virtue ethical in Hume’s sense, as the criterion of
the rightness of an action has to do with the inner state or motive
that lies behind it. But by the same token individuals who demonstrate
the virtue of caring act in ways that show how much they care or are
concerned about others, in ways that demonstrate their emotional
connectedness with others; in particular such people don't have to
remind themselves of moral ideals and obligations in order to get
themselves to help those they care about. They help because they care,
not for some other abstract reason.</p>

<p>
Is this sort of natural virtue really adequate to those
moral/political concerns that transcend intimate personal
relationships? Hume and Smith didn't think so, and it is not obvious
on the face of it how an ethic of caring could handle such issues.
Still, Hume makes things difficult for natural virtue by conceiving
individual and social justice in highly conservative terms. According
to Hume we have a strict obligation of justice to allow people to keep
(most of) what they have earned through their own diligence and
ingenuity rather than (say) tax it away. Hume seems to assume the
empirical issues bearing on such obligations are settled, in a way
which forecloses moral critique. Arguably such justice should be
conceived in less austerely rigid and more humane terms than those
assumed and relied on by Hume.</p>

<p>
However, when it comes to the individual virtue of justice, Hume
himself supplies some of the means toward a (virtue-ethical) account
relying solely on natural virtue (and thus not subject to “Hume's
circle”). He points out that it is easier to bear not having (or
being given) something than to bear having something taken away from
one (thus anticipating what later psychologists have said about
“adaptation levels”). And this in and of itself gives someone who
is benevolent or caring about the well-being of others some reason (or
motive) not to steal or allow stealing from others. However, there is
also the fact that stealing (as opposed to merely allowing a theft to
occur) is a positive commission, and a natural virtues approach to
individual justice (vis-a-vis property) would certainly be helped
along, if the distinction (say) between commission and omission, or
between doing and allowing, could somehow be captured in
<i>non-artificial</i> or <i>natural sentimentalist</i> terms. This
seems a tall order, and in fact the suspicion or belief that something
more rational than sentiment can account for such distinctions (as, e.
g., in Kant's “formula of humanity”) may represent one of the
largest challenges a sentimentalist ethic of caring needs to face.
</p>

<p>
But a plausible response to this challenge comes from the way caring
about and for others is grounded in natural human empathy (Slote 2010,
ch. 1). Normal human caring isn't impartial (in the manner of
“universal benevolence”), because it is easier to empathize with
those near and dear to us, i. e., those with whom we share thoughts,
lives, roots, or familial (or ethnic or national) traditions. But
recent psychological studies of empathy and its relation to altruism
indicate that we also tend to empathize more with those whose problems
are immediate for us. We respond more to a child drowning right before
our eyes than to the plight of a child we don't see and whom we know
(only by description) to be in danger of dying of starvation in some
distant country; and, similarly, we respond more to the “clear and
present” danger faced by miners we hear are trapped underground than
to dangers we know will arise in some indefinite future. But if such
perceptual and temporal immediacy make such differences (respectively)
to empathic concern for others, arguably <i>causal</i> immediacy does
as well. The harm I could cause is more immediate for me than harm
that I might merely allow to occur. We naturally flinch from
(inflicting) the former more than from (allowing) the latter;
“naturally” here is appropriate because, as with cases of
perceptual or temporal immediacy, this is not a matter of being guided
by moral principles or strictures, but of responsiveness to non-moral
situational differences. If we are in this way more sensitive and
responsive to differences in the strength of our potential causal
relation to some harm or evil, then a moral sentimentalism that
restricts itself to natural virtues — grounded in caring —
may possess the resources to distinguish between commission and
omission, and it may be able to use that distinction (among other
things) to explain why stealing, promise-breaking, and killing are
worse than allowing others to do these things. This might well then
allow such an approach to account for the virtue of individual justice
more successfully than Hume's theory of artificial virtues can.</p>

<h2><a id="JusVirSoc">4. Justice as a Virtue of Societies</a></h2>

<p>
Such a conclusion has led many subsequent ethical thinkers to think
that justice cannot be based in sentiment but requires a more
intellectually constructive rational(ist) basis, and in recent times
this view of the matter seems to have been held, most influentially,
by John Rawls in <i>A Theory of Justice</i>. Rawls makes clear his
belief in the inadequacy of benevolence or sympathetic human sentiment
in formulating an adequate conception of social justice. He says in
particular that sentiment leaves unanswered or indeterminate various
important issues of justice that a good theory of justice ought to be
able to resolve.</p>

<p>
Rawls's positive view of justice is concerned primarily with the
justice of institutions or (what he calls) the “basic structure”
of society: justice as an individual virtue is derivative from justice
as a social virtue defined via certain principles of justice. The
principles, famously, are derived from an “original position” in
which (very roughly) rational contractors under a “veil of
ignorance” decide how they wish to commit themselves to being
governed in their actual lives. Rawls deliberately invokes Kantian
rationalism (or anti-sentimentalism) in explaining the intellectual or
theoretical motivation behind his construction, and the two principles
of justice that he argues would be agreed upon under the contractual
conditions he specifies represent a kind of egalitarian political
liberalism. Roughly, those principles stress (equality of) basic
liberties and opportunities for self-advancement over considerations
of social welfare, and the distribution of opportunities and goods in
society is then supposed to work to the advantage of all (especially
the worst-off members of society). He also says that the idea of what
people distributively deserve or merit is derivative from social
justice rather than (as with Aristotle and/or much common-sense
thinking) providing the basis for thinking about social justice.</p>

<p>
According to Rawls, individual justice is theoretically derivative
from social justice because the just individual is to be understood as
someone with an effective or “regulative” desire to comply with
the principles of justice. However, it is not merely social justice
that Rawls understands in (predominantly) rationalist fashion. When he
explains how individuals (within a just society) develop a sense
and/or the virtue of justice, he invokes the work of Piaget. Rawls
lays more stress than Piaget does on the role our affective nature
(sympathy and the desire for self-mastery) plays in the acquisition of
moral virtue. But, like Piaget, he stresses the need for a
<i>sufficiently general appreciation and rational understanding</i> of
social relations as the grounding basis of a sense of duty or of
justice and he explicitly classifies his account of moral development
as falling within the “rationalist tradition.” </p>

<h2><a id="RecDev">5. Recent Developments</a></h2>

<p>
While Rawls’ work has sparked an explosion of work in distributive
justice and social justice more generally, in recent years a variety
of strategies to return to a focus on justice as a personal virtue has
emerged. These strategies vary across both dimensions we have
considered, taking with various degrees of seriousness the connection
between institutional and personal forms of justice, and focusing on
the latter as a virtue, among (and like) other virtues.</p>

<p>
One such strategy is that of Jon Drydyk, who builds on the
“capability approach” to human welfare to make a case for a
capabilities-based account of the justice of individual agents, in
particular as against an “Aristotelian” approach that stresses
justice as a matter of response to merit. Acting justly involves
“striving to reduce and remove inequalities in people’s
capabilities to function in ways that are elemental” to a truly
human life (Drydyk 2012, pp. 31, 33). This is a “subsidiary”
virtue account, in that we begin with a prior conception of the
content of the requirements of justice, and conform the virtue to this
conception. However, Drydyk is emphasizing justice as a virtue of
individuals, rather than institutions or societies. Drydyk’s
strategy offers a counterpoint both to the Rawlsian way of thinking
about just societies and to the ancient Greek way of thinking about
justice as a virtue of individuals.</p>

<p>
John Hacker-Wright argues that what is needed to replace a
“legalistic” concern with moral status (as on modern liberal
conceptions of justice) is instead an ethic of virtue with a different
conception of the virtue of justice. Instead of a concern for the
resolution of claims in something like reciprocal, contractual
relations, Hacker-Wright’s conception of the virtue of justice is a
matter of sensitivity to “vulnerability of value” in things,
animate and otherwise. Thus, the threat of unjust — vicious
— wronging hangs not only over people who are sufficiently
cognitively impaired so as not to perceive insults, but also corpses,
animals, and even rare and valuable rock formations (p. 463). This
counts as a sense of justice in that, on Hacker-Wright’s view it is
not merely that we can act wrongly or viciously toward such entities,
but (following Midgley 1983) that they can be wronged by us by our
doing so. However, while Hacker-Wright claims that on a virtue ethic
“The character of the agent is recognized as ineliminable in picking
out facts as they figure in our moral deliberation,” this does not
strictly speaking seem to be true, as prior to virtue there is
<i>value</i> which it is up to the just or virtuous person to respond
with sensitivity (pp. 461, 463, 464).</p>

<p>
David Schmidtz and John Thrasher suggest rethinking the relationship
between social justice and individual justice (Schmidtz and Thrasher
2014). Turning Plato’s account of justice in <i>Republic</i> on its
head, they depict justice as a bridge between a virtue of the soul and
of the <i>polis</i>: because we are essentially social, we need
community, and justice is a matter of harmony with the community. On
their view this is (largely) a matter of compliance with rules and
institutions that enable people to live in harmony and flourish
together.</p>

<p>
An alternative proposal for thinking of the justice as a personal
virtue ties it intimately to the experiences we have as emotional
creatures. On this approach, instead of justice standing as distinct
from “natural virtues” motivated by passions (as on Hume’s
account), or needing to be replaced by sentimentally-driven attitudes
such as care or compassion, justice is to be seen as a virtue largely
<i>constituted</i> by emotion (Solomon 1994, Roberts 2010). The virtue
amounts to a stable disposition of character to respond in the
relevant ways to instances of injustice, perhaps consisting in those
occasions in which one does not receive his or her due, and on the
other hand to be disposed to a “will to give each his due”
(Roberts 2010, p. 38). For Roberts, this is a will to realize
“objective justice,” and as on other recent accounts, the virtue
(and the passion) are theoretically subsidiary to this primary notion
of “objective justice.”</p>

<p>
There are also recent ventures in the spirit of the ancient Greek
thinking about the individual virtue of justice. Rasmussen and Den Uyl
(2005) argue for two interpersonal senses of justice (pp. 160-63). One
is the familiar Aristotelian virtue. The second is a
“metanormative” principle governing the institutions and legal
frameworks in which individual agents (just and otherwise) live their
lives and exercise their practical agency. The second of these senses
of interpersonal justice does not draw its content from the exercise
of virtue, but rather makes a place for it. The former does depend on
virtue overall (including the exercise of practical wisdom) for its
demands, but these are construed broadly in the traditional way of
rendering to each his due. Bloomfield (2011) similarly suggests
extending the Aristotelian virtue of justice, but in an inward
direction, arguing that self-respect is necessary for happiness, and
treating oneself fairly requires treating oneself fairly, as one
treats others fairly, as a property of justice as individuals.</p>

<p>
Recent thinkers have grappled with the question of priority between
formal principle and virtue that vexed Aristotle, and offered
solutions that for the most part subordinate the virtue of justice to
the prior notion of the justice of distributions, as Aristotle himself
seems to have suggested. Bernard Williams claims explicitly that this
is so (Williams 1980, p. 197), as does David Wiggins, in an attempt to
bring a “pre-liberal,” Aristotelian conception of justice to bear
on modern liberal conceptions, a la Kant and Rawls (Wiggins 2004). To
do so, Wiggins distinguishes three senses of justice: (A) a matter of
outcomes or states of affairs in which each gets what is due; (B) a
disposition to promote justice (A); (C) a condition of the polis in
virtue of which (A) is realized. Wiggins claims that the proper
outcome of this collision of conceptions is one that recognizes a form
of <i>logical</i> priority of justice (A) over justice (B) (p. 489).
At the same time, against Williams he insists that the normative
demands of justice (A) are “comprehensible” only within the
perspective of a person with justice (B). And in fact he claims that a
necessary condition on acts and outcomes satisfying the norms of
justice (A) is that they be recognized to be so by those with the
virtue of justice (B). Wiggins’ thinking here is not transparent,
but perhaps the thought is that the logical point is purely formal:
someone with justice (B) must, in act or judging justly, be responding
to some norm which counts as justice (A). But, as <i>merely</i>
formal, that tells us nothing about the substantive content of that
norm. To get that, we have ineliminable need to refer to the judgment
of the person with justice (B). That marks a way perhaps of restoring
Aristotle’s focus on virtue in coming to understand the virtue of
justice. </p>

<p>
LeBar (2013, 2014) takes a similar tack in attempting to incorporate
Kantian and post-Kantian insights into just demands on the treatment
of others into an Aristotelian virtue framework. On his view, there is
no way to specify the contents of the demands of justice, or to spell
out its norms, independently of the wider possession and exercise of
the virtues, including the virtue of practical wisdom. At the same
time, what the virtuous and just person sees, in inhabiting a social
world with equals in moral standing, are the norms which have become
associated with the liberal conception: the standing to obligate
others and hold them accountable, for example.</p>

<h2><a id="Con">6. Conclusion</a></h2>

<p>
There are many different conceptions of the virtue of justice, and
only some of them are distinctively virtue ethical. Many non-virtual
ethical approaches put forward theories of virtue, and what
distinguishes them from virtue ethics is that the given theory of
virtue comes later in the order of explanation, rather than itself
serving as the basis for understanding (all of) morality. This is
especially the case with justice, where (as we have seen) it is
naturally tempting to account for the <i>norms</i> of justice first
and derive an account of the <i>virtue</i> in light of those norms.
The question of the priority of norms of justice or the virtue of
justice is likely to continue to generate exploration and debate, as
is the question of how our lives as social and political animals
contributes to understanding the virtue of justice. These vexed
questions have inspired a profusion of views and no doubt will
continue to do so. </p>
