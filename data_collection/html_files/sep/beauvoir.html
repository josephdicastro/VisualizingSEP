<h1>Simone de Beauvoir</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Tue Aug 17, 2004; substantive revision Tue Aug 21, 2018</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>There are some thinkers who are, from the very beginning,
unambiguously identified as philosophers (e.g., Plato). There are
others whose philosophical place is forever contested (e.g.,
Nietzsche); and there are those who have gradually won the right to be
admitted into the philosophical fold. Simone de Beauvoir is one of
these belatedly acknowledged philosophers. Identifying herself as an
author rather than as a philosopher and calling herself the midwife of
Sartre’s existential ethics rather than a thinker in her own right,
Beauvoir’s place in philosophy had to be won against her word. That
place is now uncontested. The international conference celebrating the
centennial of Beauvoir’s birth organized by Julia Kristeva is one of
the more visible signs of Beauvoir’s growing influence and status. Her
enduring contributions to the fields of ethics, politics,
existentialism, phenomenology and feminist theory and her significance
as an activist and public intellectual is now a matter of record.
Unlike her status as a philosopher, Simone de Beauvoir’s position as a
feminist theorist has never been in question. Controversial from the
beginning, <em>The Second Sex</em>’s critique of patriarchy continues
to challenge social, political and religious categories used to
justify women’s inferior status. Though readers of the English
translation of <em>The Second Sex</em> have never had trouble
understanding the feminist significance of its analysis of patriarchy,
they might be forgiven for missing its philosophical importance so
long as they had to rely on an arbitrarily abridged version of <em>The
Second Sex</em> that was questionably translated by a zoologist who
was deaf to the philosophical meanings and nuances of Beauvoir’s
French terms. The 2010 translation of <em>The Second Sex</em> changed
that. In addition to providing the full text, this translation’s
sensitivity to the philosophical valence of Beauvoir’s writing makes
it possible for her English readers to understand the
existential-phenomenological grounds of her feminist analysis of the
forces that subordinate women to men and designate her as the
Other.</p>

<h2><a name="RecBea">1. Recognizing Beauvoir</a></h2>

<p>Some have found Beauvoir’s exclusion from the domain of philosophy
more than a matter of taking Beauvoir at her word. They attribute it
to an exclusively systematic view of philosophy which, deaf to the
philosophical methodology of the metaphysical novel, ignored the ways
that Beauvoir embedded phenomenological-existential arguments in her
literary works. Between those who did not challenge Beauvoir’s
self-portrait, those who did not accept her understanding of the
relationship between literature and philosophy, and those who missed
the unique signature of her philosophical essays, Beauvoir the
philosopher remained a lady-in-waiting. </p>

<p>Some have argued that the belated admission of Beauvoir into the
ranks of philosophers is a matter of sexism on two counts. The first
concerns the fact that Beauvoir was a woman. Her philosophical
writings were read as echoes of Sartre rather than explored for their
own contributions because it was only “natural” to think
of a woman as a disciple of her male companion. The second concerns
the fact that she wrote about women. <em>The Second Sex</em>,
recognized as one of the hundred most important works of the twentieth
century, would not be counted as philosophy because it dealt with sex,
hardly a burning philosophical issue (so it was said). This
encyclopedia entry shows how much things have changed. Long overdue,
Beauvoir’s recognition as a philosopher is now secure. </p>

<h2><a name="SitBea">2. Situating Beauvoir</a></h2>

<p>Simone de Beauvoir was born on January 9, 1908. She died
seventy-eight years later, on April 14, 1986. At the time of her death
she was honored as a crucial figure in the struggle for women’s
rights, and as an eminent writer, having won the Prix Goncourt, the
prestigious French literary award, for her novel <em>The
Mandarins</em>. She was also famous for being the life-long companion
of Jean Paul Sartre. Active in the French intellectual scene all of
her life, and a central player in the philosophical debates of the
times both in her role as an author of philosophical essays, novels,
plays, memoirs, travel diaries and newspaper articles, and as an
editor of <em>Les Temps Modernes</em>, Beauvoir was not considered a
philosopher in her own right at the time of her death. </p>

<p>Beauvoir would have appreciated the fact that her current
philosophical status reflects our changed understanding of the domain
of philosophy and the changed situation of women, for it confirms her
idea of situated freedom—that our capacity for agency and
meaning-making, that whether or not we are identified as agents and
meaning-makers, is constrained, though never determined, by our
situation. She would also have appreciated the fact that while her
works were instrumental in effecting these changes, their lasting
effect is a tribute to the ways that others have taken up her
philosophical and feminist legacies; for one of her crucial
contributions to our ethical and political vocabularies is the concept
of the appeal—that the success of our projects depends on the
extent to which they are adopted by others</p>

<p>Beauvoir detailed her phenomenological and existential critique of
the philosophical <em>status quo</em> in her 1946 essay <em>Literature
and the Metaphysical Essay</em>, and her 1965 and 1966 essays <em>Que
Peut la Littérature?</em> And <em>Mon expérience
d’écrivain</em>. This critique, influenced by both Husserl and
Heidegger, focused on the significance of lived experience and on the
ways that the meanings of the world are revealed in language.
Heidegger turned to the language of poetry for this revelation.
Beauvoir, Camus and Sartre turned to the language of the novel and the
theater. They looked to Husserl to theorize their turn to these
discourses by insisting on grounding their theoretical analyses in the
concrete particulars of lived experience. They looked to Heidegger to
challenge the privileged position of abstract discourses. For
Beauvoir, however, the turn to literature carried ethical and
political as well as philosophical implications. It allowed her to
explore the limits of the appeal (the activity of calling on others to
take up one’s political projects); to portray the temptations of
violence; to enact her existential ethics of freedom, responsibility,
joy and generosity, and to examine the intimacies and complexities of
our relationships with others.</p>

<p>Beauvoir’s challenge to the philosophical tradition was part of the
existential-phenomenological project. Her challenge to the patriarchal
<em>status quo</em> was more dramatic. It was an event. Not at first,
however, for at its publication <em>The Second Sex</em> was regarded
more as an affront to sexual decency than a political indictment of
patriarchy or a phenomenological account of the meaning of
“woman”. The women who came to be known as second-wave
feminists understood what Beauvoir’s first readers missed. It was not
sexual decency that was being attacked but patriarchal indecency that
was on trial. <em>The Second Sex</em> expressed their sense of
injustice, focused their demands for social, political, and personal
change and alerted them to the connections between private practices
and public policies. <em>The Second Sex</em> remains a contentious
book. No longer considered sexually scandalous, its analysis of
patriarchy and its proposed antidotes to women’s domination are still
debated. What is not contested, however, is the fact that feminism as
we know it remains in its debt. </p>

<p>As <em>The Second Sex</em> became a catalyst for challenging
women’s situations, Beauvoir’s political and intellectual place was
also reset. With regard to feminism, she herself was responsible for
the change. After repeatedly refusing to align herself with the
feminist movement, Beauvoir declared herself a feminist in a 1972
interview in <em>Le Nouvel observateur</em> and joined other Marxist
feminists in founding the journal <em>Questions
féministes</em>. With regard to the philosophical field it took
the efforts of others to get her a seat at the table; for though
Beauvoir belatedly identified herself as a feminist, she never called
herself a philosopher. Her philosophical voice, she insisted, was
merely an elaboration of Sartre’s. Those denials coupled with the fact
of her life-long intimate relationship with Sartre positioned her in
the public and philosophical eye as his alter ego.
Decoupling Beauvoir from Sartre became the first priority of those
interested in establishing her independent philosophical credentials.
Sometimes the issue concerned Sartre’s originality: Were the ideas of
his <em>Being and Nothingness</em> stolen from Beauvoir’s <em>She Came
to Stay?</em> Sometimes they concerned matters of influence: What
happened in their discussions and critiques of each other’s work?
Eventually these arguments abated and scholars turned from exclusive
attention to the matter of Sartre’s influence to the more fruitful
question of influence in the broader sense. They began to trace the
ways that she, like her existential-phenomenological contemporaries,
took up and reconfigured their philosophical heritage to reflect their
shared methodology and unique insights. We now understand that to
fully appreciate the rich complexities of Beauvoir’s thought, we need
to attend to the fact that her graduate thesis was on Leibniz; that
her reading of Hegel was influenced by the interpretations of
Kojève; that she was introduced to Husserl and Heidegger by her
teacher Baruzi; that Marx and Descartes were familiar figures in her
philosophical vocabulary; and that Bergson was an early influence on
her thinking. </p>

<h2><a name="SheCamStaFreVio">3. <em>She Came to Stay</em>: Freedom and Violence</a></h2>

<p>Though Beauvoir’s first philosophical essay was <em>Pyrrhus and
Cinéas</em> (1944) many of her interpreters identify <em>She
Came to Stay</em> (1943) as her inaugural philosophical foray. It is a
clear example of what Beauvoir calls the metaphysical novel. The
letters between Sartre and Beauvoir and Beauvoir’s diaries of that
period (published in the 1980s), show that both Beauvoir and Sartre
were concerned with the question of the other, the issue of bad faith
and the dynamics of desire. They were also examining the relationship
and tensions between our singular existential status and the social
conditions within which our singularity is lived. <em>She Came to
Stay</em> is packed with philosophical reflections – reflections on our
relationship to time, to each other, to ourselves. These reflections
are never, however, presented in systematic arguments or brought to
closure. They are lived in the concrete, ambiguously triangulated
lives of Pierre, Xavière and Françoise. Opening with a
quote from Hegel, “Each conscience seeks the death of the
other”, and ending with Françoise’s murder of
Xavière, which Beauvoir narrates as an act in which
Françoise confronts her solitude and announces her freedom, the
novel does not necessarily confirm Hegel’s claim; for the point of the
murder was not to eliminate the other <em>per se</em> but to destroy a
particular other, Xavière, the other who threatened to leave
Françoise without the other she loved, Pierre. Existential
ambiguity trumps Hegelian clarity. The issues raised in this first
novel, however, the ambiguity regarding the responsibilities and
limits of freedom, the legitimacy of violence, the tension between our
experience of ourselves as simultaneously solitary and intertwined with
others, the temptations of bad faith and the examination of the
existentially faithful relationship to time will pervade Beauvoir’s
subsequent reflections.</p>

<h2><a name="PyrCinRadFreOth">4. <em>Pyrrhus and Cinéas</em>: Radical Freedom and the Other</a></h2>

<p><em>Pyrrhus and Cinéas</em>, published one year after
<em>She Came To Stay</em>, is Beauvoir’s first philosophical essay. It
addresses such fundamental ethical and political issues as: What are
the criteria of ethical action? How can I distinguish ethical from
unethical political projects? What are the principles of ethical
relationships? Can violence ever be justified? It examines these
questions from an existential-phenomenological perspective. Taking the
situation of the concrete existing individual as its point of
departure, it provides an analysis of the ways that as particular
subjects we are necessarily embedded in the world, and inescapably
related to others. Though not feminist in any identifiable sense,
<em>Pyrrhus and Cinéas</em> raises such compelling feminist
questions as: Under what conditions, if any, may I speak for/ in the
name of another?</p>

<p>After opening <em>Pyrrhus and Cinéas</em> with Plutarch’s
account of a conversation between Pyrrhus and Cineas, where the
justification of action is questioned, Beauvoir, finding the
recommendation to be passive inconsistent with the realities of human
nature and desire, asks three questions: What is the measure of a
person? What goals can one set for oneself? What hopes are permitted
to us? She then divides the text into two parts. Part one moves from
the ontological truth—that I am a finite freedom whose endings
are always and necessarily new beginnings—to the existential
questions: How can I desire to be what I am? How can I live my
finitude with passion? These existential questions lead to moral and
political ones: What actions express the truth and passion of our
condition? How can I act in such a way as to create the conditions
that sustain and support the humanity of human beings? Part I
concludes with the observation that: “A man alone in the world
would be paralyzed by … the vanity of all of his goals. But man
is not alone in the world” (<em>Pyrrhus and Cinéas</em>,
42). Beauvoir opens Part II with the properly ethical question: What
is my relation to the other? Here the analysis is dominated by the
problem created by Beauvoir’s insistence on the radical nature of
freedom. According to Beauvoir, the other, as free, is immune to my
power. Whatever I do—if as master I exploit slaves, or as
executioner I hang murderers—I cannot violate their inner
subjective freedom. Substituting the inner-outer difference for the
Cartesian mind-body distinction, Beauvoir argues that we can never
directly touch the freedom of others. Our relationships are either
superficial, engaging only the outer surface of each other’s being, or
mediated through our common commitment to a shared goal or value. As
free, I am saved from the dangers of intimacy and the threat of
dehumanization.</p>

<p>This line of argument would seem to lead either to benign Stoic
conclusions of mutual indifference, or to the finding that tyrants and
terrorists pose no threat to individual freedom. Beauvoir does not,
however, let it drift in these directions. Instead she uses the
inner-outer distinction and the idea that I need others to take up my
projects if they are to have a future, to introduce the ideas of the
appeal and risk. She develops the concept of freedom as transcendence
(the movement toward an open future and indeterminate possibilities)
to argue that we cannot be determined by the present. The essence of
freedom as transcendence aligns freedom with uncertainty and risk. To
be free is to be radically contingent. Though I find myself in a world
of value and meaning, these values and meanings were brought into the
world by others. I am free to reject, alter or endorse them for the
meaning of the world is determined by human choices. Whatever choice I
make, however, I cannot support it without the help of others. My
values will find a home in the world only if others embrace them; only
if I persuade others to make my values theirs. </p>

<p>As radically free I need the other. I need to be able to appeal to
others to join me in my projects. The knot of the ethical problem lies
here: How can I, a radically free being who is existentially severed
from all other human freedoms, transcend the isolations of freedom to
create a community of allies? Given the necessity of appealing to the
other’s freedom, under what conditions is such an appeal possible?</p>

<p>In answering these questions Beauvoir turns the inner-outer
distinction to her advantage as she develops the concept of situated
freedom. Though I can neither act for another nor directly influence
their freedom, I must, Beauvoir argues, accept responsibility for the
fact that my actions produce the conditions within which the other
acts. However irrelevant my conduct may be for the other’s inner
freedom, it concerns mine. I am, Beauvoir writes, “the
face” of the other’s misery. I am the facticity of their
situation (<em>Pyrrhus and Cinéas</em>, 58). Pursuing this
difference between my power to effect the other’s freedom and my
responsibility for their situation, and exploring the conditions under
which my appeal to the other can/will be heard, Beauvoir determines
that there are two conditions of the appeal. First, I must be allowed
to call to the other and must struggle against those who try to
silence me. Second, there must be others who can respond to my call.
The first condition may be purely political. The second is political
and material. Only equals, Beauvoir argues, can hear or respond to my
call. Only those who are not consumed by the struggle for survival,
only those who exist in the material conditions of freedom, health,
leisure and security can become my allies in the struggle against
injustice. The first rule of justice, therefore, is to work for a
world where the material and political conditions of the appeal are
secured.</p>

<p>Violence is not ruled out. Given that Beauvoir has argued that we
can never reach the other in the depths of their freedom, she cannot
call it evil. She does not, however, endorse it. Neither does she
envision a future without conflict. The fact that we are differently
situated and engage in the work of transcendence from different
historical, economic, sexed and racial positions ensures that some of
us will always be an obstacle to another’s freedom. We are, Beauvoir
writes, “condemned to violence” (<em>Pyrrhus and
Cinéas</em>, 77). As neither evil nor avoidable, violence, she
argues, is “the mark of a failure which nothing can
offset” (<em>Pyrrhus and Cinéas</em>, 77). It is the
tragedy of the human condition.</p>

<p>The argument of <em>Pyrrhus and Cinéas</em> ends on an
uneasy note. As ethical, we are obliged to work for the conditions of
material and political equality. In calling on others to take up our
projects and give these projects a future, we are precluded from
forcing others to become our allies. We are enjoined to appeal to
their freedom. Where persuasion fails, however, we are permitted the
recourse to violence. The ambiguity of our being as subjects for
ourselves and objects for others in the world is lived in this dilemma
of violence and justice. Becoming lucid about the meaning of freedom,
we learn to live our freedom by accepting its finitude and
contingency, its risks and its failures.</p>

<h2><a name="EthAmbBadFaiAppArt">5. <em>The Ethics of Ambiguity</em>: Bad Faith, the Appeal, the Artist</a></h2>

<p> It is impossible to know where Simone de Beauvoir’s thinking would
have gone had she been spared the cold, the hunger and the fear of
living in Nazi occupied Paris. What we do know is that coming face to
face with forces of injustice beyond her control, the questions of
evil and the Other took on new urgency. Beauvoir speaks of the war as
creating an existential rupture in time. She speaks of herself as
having undergone a conversion. She can no longer afford the luxury of
focusing on her own happiness and pleasure. The question of evil
becomes a pressing concern. One cannot refuse to take a stand. One is
either a collaborator or not. In writing <em>The Ethics of
Ambiguity</em>, Beauvoir takes her stand. She identifies herself as an
existentialist and identifies existentialism as the philosophy of our
(her) times because it is the only philosophy that takes the question
of evil seriously. It is the only philosophy prepared to counter
Dostoevsky’s claim that without God everything is permissible. That we
are alone in the world and that we exist without guarantees, are not,
however, the only truths of the human condition. There is also the
truth of our freedom and this truth, as detailed in <em>The Ethics of
Ambiguity</em>, entails a logic of reciprocity and responsibility that
contests the terrors of a world ruled only by the authority of
power.</p>

<p><em>The Ethics of Ambiguity</em>, published in 1947, reconsiders
the <em>Pyrrhus and Cinéas</em> idea of invulnerable freedom.
Dropping the distinction between the inner and outer domains of
freedom and deploying a unique understanding of consciousness as an
intentional activity, Beauvoir now finds that I can be alienated from
my freedom. Similar to <em>She Came To Stay</em>, which bears the
imprint of Hegel’s account of the fight to the death that sets the
stage for the master-slave dialectic, and <em>Pyrrhus and
Cinéas</em>, which works through the Cartesian implications of
our existential situation, <em>The Ethics of Ambiguity</em> redeploys
concepts of canonical philosophical figures. Here Beauvoir takes up
the phenomenologies of Husserl and Hegel to provide an analysis of
intersubjectivity that accepts the singularity of the existing
individual without allowing that singularity to justify an
epistemological solipsism, an existential isolationism or an ethical
egoism. The Hegel drawn on here is the Hegel who resolves the
inequalities of the master-slave relationship through the justice of
mutual recognition. The Husserl appealed to is the Husserl who
introduced Beauvoir to the thesis of intentionality.</p>

<p><em>The Ethics of Ambiguity</em> opens with an account of
intentionality which designates the meaning-disclosing, meaning-making
and meaning-desiring activities of consciousness as both insistent and
ambiguous—insistent in that they are spontaneous and
unstoppable; ambiguous in that they preclude any possibility of
self-unification or closure. Beauvoir describes the intentionality of
consciousness as operating in two ways. First there is the activity of
wanting to disclose the meaning of being. Second there is the activity
of bringing meaning to the world. In the first mode of activity
consciousness expresses its freedom to discover meaning. In the
second, it uses its freedom to become the author of the meaning of the
world. Beauvoir identifies each of these intentionalities with a mood:
the first with the mood of joy, the second with the dual moods of hope
and domination. Whether the second moment of intentionality becomes
the ground of projects of liberation or exploitation depends on
whether the mood of hope or domination prevails.</p>

<p>Describing consciousness as ambiguous, Beauvoir identifies our
ambiguity with the idea of failure. We can never fulfill our passion
for meaning in either of its intentional expressions; that is, we will
never succeed in fully revealing the meaning of the world, and never
become God, the author of the meaning of the world. These truths of
intentionality set the criteria of Beauvoir’s ethics. Finding that
ethical systems and absolutes, insofar as they claim to give final
answers to our ethical dilemmas and authoritarian justifications for
our actions, offer dangerous consolations for our failure to be the
absolute source of the world’s meaning or being, Beauvoir rejects
these systems of absolutes in favor of ethical projects that
acknowledge our limits and recognize the future as open. From this
perspective her ethics of ambiguity might be characterized as an
ethics of existential hope.</p>

<p>Beauvoir’s <em>Ethics of Ambiguity</em> is a secularism that
rejects the ideas of God and Humanity. Their apparent differences
conceal a common core: both claim to have identified an absolute
source for, and justifications of our beliefs and actions. They allow
us to evade responsibility for creating the conditions of our
existence and to flee the anxieties of ambiguity. Whether it is called
the age of the Messiah or the classless society, these appeals to a
utopian destiny encourage us to think in terms of ends which justify
means. They invite us to sacrifice the present for the future. They
are the stuff of inquisitions, imperialisms, gulags and Auschwitz.
Privileging the future over the present they pervert our relationship
to time, each other and ourselves. Insisting that the future is
undecided and that its form will be shaped by our present decisions
Beauvoir argues that it is only by insisting on the dignity of today’s
human beings that the dignity of those to come can be secured.</p>

<p>Beauvoir rejects the familiar charge against secularism made famous
by Dostoevsky’s Grand Inquisitor: “If God is dead everything is
permitted”. As she sees it, without God to pardon us for our
“sins” we are totally and inexcusably responsible for our
actions. Dostoevsky was mistaken. The problem of secularism is not
that of license, it is the problem of the “we”. Can
separate existing individuals be bound to each other? Can they forge
laws binding for all? <em>The Ethics of Ambiguity</em> insists that
they can. It does this by arguing that evil resides in the denial of
freedom (mine and others), that we are responsible for ensuring the
existence of the conditions of freedom (the material conditions of a
minimal standard of living and the political conditions of uncensored
discourse and association), and that I can neither affirm nor live my
freedom without also affirming the freedom of others.</p>

<p>Beauvoir’s argument for ethical freedom begins by noting a
fundamental fact of the human condition. We begin our lives as
children who are dependent on others and embedded in a world already
endowed with meaning. We are born into the condition that Beauvoir
calls the “serious world”. This is a world of ready made
values and established authorities. This is a world where obedience is
demanded. For children, this world is neither alienating nor stifling
for they are too young to assume the responsibilities of freedom. As
children who create imaginary worlds, we are in effect learning the
lessons of freedom – that we are creators of the meaning and value of
the world. Free to play, children develop their creative capacities
and their meaning-making abilities without, however, being held
accountable for the worlds they bring into being. Considering these
two dimensions of children’s lives, their imaginative freedom and
their freedom from responsibility, Beauvoir determines that the child
lives a metaphysically privileged existence. Children, she says,
experience the joys but not the anxieties of freedom. Beauvoir also,
however, describes children as mystified. By this she means that they
believe that the foundations of the world are secure and that their
place in the world is naturally given and unchangeable. Beauvoir marks
adolescence as the end of this idyllic era. It is the time of moral
decision. Emerging into the world of adults, we are now called upon to
renounce the serious world, to reject the mystification of childhood
and to take responsibility for our choices.</p>

<p>All of us pass through the age of adolescence; not all of us take
up its ethical demands. The fact of our initial dependency has moral
implications, for it predisposes us to the temptations of bad faith,
strategies by which we deny our existential freedom and our moral
responsibility. It sets our desire in the direction of a nostalgia for
those lost Halcyon days. Looking to return to the security of that
metaphysically privileged time, some of us evade the responsibilities
of freedom by choosing to remain children, that is, to submit to the
authority of others.</p>

<p>Beauvoir does not object to the mystification of childhood. She
acknowledges that parental authority is necessary for the child’s
survival. To treat adults as children, however, is immoral and evil.
To choose to remain a child is an act of bad faith. If we are
exploited, enslaved or terrorized, however, our submission to
authority of the other cannot be counted as an act of bad faith.
Absent these conditions, Beauvoir holds us accountable for our
response to the experience of freedom. We cannot use the anxieties of
freedom either as an excuse for our active participation in, or our
passive acceptance of the exploitation of others. Hiding behind the
authority of others or establishing ourselves as authorities over
others are culpable offenses. </p>

<p>Beauvoir portrays the complexity of the ways that we either avoid
or accept the responsibilities of freedom in the imaginary and
(sometimes) historical figures of the sub-man, the serious man, the
nihilist, the adventurer, the passionate man, the critical thinker and
the artist-writer. The point of delineating these human types is
several fold. It is a way of distinguishing between two kinds of
unethical positions. One, portrayed in the portraits of the sub-man
and the serious man, refuses to recognize the experience of freedom.
The other, depicted in the pictures of the nihilist, the adventurer
and the maniacally passionate man, misreads the meanings of freedom.
The ethical person, as portrayed by Beauvoir, is driven by passion.
Unlike the egoistic, maniacal passion of the tyrant, however, the
ethical passion of the artist-writer is defined by its
generosity – specifically the generosity of recognizing the other’s
singularity and protecting the other in their difference from becoming
an object of another’s will.</p>

<p>In describing the different ways that freedom is evaded or misused,
Beauvoir distinguishes ontological from ethical freedom. She shows us
that acknowledging our freedom is a necessary but not a sufficient
condition for ethical action. To meet the conditions of the ethical,
freedom must be used properly. It must, according to Beauvoir, embrace
the ties that bind me to others, and take up the appeal – an act whereby
I call on others, in their freedom, to join me in bringing certain
values, projects, conditions into being. Artists and writers embody
the ethical ideal in several respects. Their work expresses the
subjective passion that grounds the ethical life. They describe the
ways that the material and political complexities of our situations
can either alienate us from our freedom or open us to it. By
envisioning the future as open and contingent, artists and writers
challenge the mystifications that validate sacrificing the present for
the future. They establish the essential relationship between my
freedom and the freedom of others.</p>

<p><em>The Ethics of Ambiguity</em> does not avoid the question of
violence. Determining that violence is sometimes necessary, Beauvoir
uses the example of the young Nazi soldier to argue that to liberate
the oppressed we may have to destroy their oppressors. She distances
herself from the argument of <em>Pyrrhus and Cinéas</em>; now
she identifies violence as an assault on the other’s freedom (however
misused) and as such this violence marks our failure to respect the
“we” of our humanity. Thus, <em>The Ethics of
Ambiguity</em> provides an analysis of our existential-ethical
situation that joins a hard-headed realism (violence is an unavoidable
fact of our condition) with demanding requirements. It is unique,
however, in aligning this realism and these requirements with the
passion of generosity and a mood of joy. </p>

<h2><a name="SecSexWomOth">6. <em>The Second Sex</em>: Woman As Other</a></h2>

<p> In her memoir <em>The Force of Circumstance</em>, Beauvoir looks
back at <em>The Ethics of Ambiguity</em> and criticizes it for being
too abstract. She does not repudiate the arguments of her text, but
finds that it erred in trying to define morality independent of a
social context. <em>The Second Sex</em> may be read as correcting this
error – as reworking and materially situating the analyses of <em>The
Ethics of Ambiguity</em>. Imaginary caricatures will be replaced by
phenomenological descriptions of the situations of real women. </p>

<p>Where Beauvoir’s earlier works blurred the borders separating
philosophy and literature, her later writings disrupt the boundaries
between the personal, the political and the philosophical. Now,
Beauvoir takes herself, her situation, her embodiment and the
situations and embodiments of other women, as the subjects of her
philosophical reflections. Where <em>The Ethics of Ambiguity</em>
conjured up images of ethical and unethical figures to make its
arguments tangible, the analyses of <em>The Second Sex</em> are
materialized in Beauvoir’s experiences as a woman and in women’s lived
realities. Where <em>The Ethics of Ambiguity</em> speaks of
mystification in a general sense, <em>The Second Sex</em> speaks of
the specific ways that the natural and social sciences and the
European literary, social, political and religious traditions have
created a world where impossible and conflicting ideals of femininity
produce an ideology of women’s “natural” inferiority to
justify patriarchal domination. </p>

<p>Beauvoir’s self criticism suggests that her later works mark a
break with her earlier writings. We should, however, resist the
temptation to take this notion of discontinuity too far. Rather than
thinking in terms of breaks it is more fruitful to see <em>The Second
Sex</em> in terms of a more radical commitment to the phenomenological
insight that it is as embodied beings that we engage the world. Our
access to, awareness of, and possibilities for world engagement cannot
be considered absent a consideration of the body.</p>

<p>Before <em>The Second Sex</em>, the sexed/gendered body was not an
object of phenomenological investigation. Beauvoir changed that. Her
argument for sexual equality takes two directions. First, it exposes
the ways that masculine ideology exploits the sexual difference to
create systems of inequality. Second, it identifies the ways that
arguments for equality erase the sexual difference in order to
establish the masculine subject as the absolute human type. Here Plato
is her target. Plato, beginning with the premise that sex is an
accidental quality, concludes that women and men are equally qualified
to become members of the guardian class. The price of women’s
admission to this privileged class, however, is that they must train
and live like men. Thus the discriminatory sexual difference remains
in play. Only men or those who emulate them may rule. Beauvoir’s
argument for equality does not fall into this trap. She insists that
women and men treat each other as equals and that such treatment
requires that their sexual differences be validated. Equality is not a
synonym for sameness. </p>

<p><em>The Second Sex</em> argues against the either/or frame of the
woman question (either women and men are equal or they are different).
It argues for women’s equality, while insisting on the reality of the
sexual difference. Beauvoir finds it unjust and immoral to use the
sexual difference as an argument for women’s subordination. She finds
it un-phenomenological, however, to ignore it. As a phenomenologist
she is obliged to examine women’s unique experiences of their bodies
and to determine how these experiences are co-determined by what
phenomenology calls the everyday attitude (the common-sense
assumptions that we unreflectively bring to our experience). As a
feminist phenomenologist assessing the meanings of the lived female
body, Beauvoir explores the ways that cultural assumptions frame
women’s experience of their bodies and alienate them from their body’s
possibilities. For example, it is assumed that women are the weaker
sex. What, she directs us to ask, is the ground of this assumption?
What criteria of strength are used? Upper body power? Average body
size? Is there a reason not to consider longevity a sign of strength?
Using this criterion, would women still be considered the weaker sex?
A bit of reflection exposes the biases of the criteria used to support
the supposedly obvious fact of women’s weakness and transforms it from
an unassailable reality to an unreliable assumption. Once we begin
this questioning, it is not long before other so-called facts fall to
the side of “common sense” in the phenomenological sense.
</p>

<p>What is perhaps the most famous line of <em>The Second Sex</em>,
translated in 1952 as “One is not born but becomes a
woman” and in 2010 as “One is not born but becomes
woman”, is credited by many as alerting us to the sex-gender
distinction. Whether or not Beauvoir understood herself to be
inaugurating this distinction, whether or not she followed this
distinction to its logical/radical conclusions, or whether or not
radical conclusions are justified are currently matters of feminist
debate. What is not a matter of dispute is that <em>The Second
Sex</em> gave us the vocabulary for analyzing the social constructions
of femininity and a method for critiquing these constructions. By not
accepting the common sense idea that to be born with female genitalia
is to be born a woman this most famous line of <em>The Second Sex</em>
pursues the first rule of phenomenology: identify your assumptions,
treat them as prejudices and put them aside; do not bring them back
into play until and unless they have been validated by experience.</p>

<p>Taken within the context of its contemporary philosophical scene,
<em>The Second Sex</em> was a phenomenological analysis waiting to
happen. Whether or not it required a woman phenomenologist to discover
the effects of sex/gender on the lived body’s experience cannot be
said. That it was a woman who taught us to bracket the assumption that
the lived body’s sex/gender was accidental to its lived relations,
positions, engagements, etc. is a matter of history. What was a
phenomenological breakthrough became in <em>The Second Sex</em> a
liberatory tool: by attending to the ways that patriarchal structures
used the sexual difference to deprive women of their “can
do” bodies, Beauvoir made the case for declaring this
deprivation oppressive. Taken within the context of the feminist
movement, this declaration of oppression was an event. It opened the
way for the consciousness-raising that characterized second-wave
feminism; it validated women’s experiences of injustice. What from an
existential-phenomenological perspective, was a detailed analysis of
the lived body, and an ethical and political indictment of the ways
that patriarchy alienated women from their embodied capacities, was,
from a feminist perspective, an appeal that called on women to take up
the politics of liberation.</p>

<p>Several concepts are crucial to the argument of <em>The Second
Sex</em>. The concept of the Other is introduced early in the text and
drives the entire analysis. It has also become a critical concept in
theories that analyze the oppressions of colonized, enslaved and other
exploited people. Beauvoir will use it again in her last major work,
<em>The Coming of Age</em>, to structure her critique of the ways that
the elderly are “othered” by society.</p>

<p>Beauvoir bases her idea of the Other on Hegel’s account of the
master-slave dialectic. Instead of the terms “master” and
“slave”, however, she uses the terms “Subject”
and “Other”. The Subject is the absolute. The Other is the
inessential. Unlike Hegel who universalized this dialectic, Beauvoir
distinguishes the dialectic of exploitation between historically
constituted Subjects and Others from the exploitation that ensues when
the Subject is Man and the Other is Woman. In the first case those
marked as Other experience their oppression as a communal reality.
They see themselves as part of an oppressed group. Here, oppressed
Others may call on the resources of a common history and a shared
abusive situation to assert their subjectivity and demand recognition
and reciprocity.</p>

<p>The situation of women is comparable to the condition of the
Hegelian Other in that men, like the Hegelian Master, identify
themselves as the Subject, the absolute human type, and, measuring
women by this standard of the human, identify them as inferior.
Women’s so-called inadequacies are then used as justification for
seeing them as the Other and for treating them accordingly. Unlike the
Hegelian Other, however, women are unable to identify the origin of
their otherness. They cannot call on the bond of a shared history to
reestablish their lost status as Subjects. Further, dispersed among
the world of men, they identify themselves in terms of the differences
of their oppressors (e.g., as white or black women, as working-class
or middle-class women, as Muslim, Christian, Jewish, Buddhist or Hindu
women) rather than with each other. They lack the solidarity and
resources of the Hegelian Other for organizing themselves into a
“we” that demands recognition. Finally, their conflict
with men is ambiguous. According to Beauvoir, women and men exist in a
“primordial <em>Mitsein</em>”: there is a unique bond
between this Subject and its Other. In contesting their status as
inessential, women must discover their “we” and take
account of the <em>Mitsein.</em> Beauvoir uses the category of the
Inessential Other to designate the unique situation of women as the
ambiguous Other of men. Unlike the Other of the master-slave
dialectic, women are not positioned to rebel. As Inessential Others,
women’s routes to subjectivity and recognition cannot follow the
Hegelian script (<em>The Second Sex</em>, xix–xxii).</p>

<p> This attention to what Beauvoir, borrowing from Heidegger, calls a
“primordial <em>Mitsein</em>” may be why she does not
repeat her earlier argument that violence is sometimes necessary for
the pursuit of justice in <em>The Second Sex</em>. Often criticized as
one mark of Beauvoir’s heterosexism, this reference to the
<em>Mitsein</em> is not made in ignorance of lesbian sexuality and is
not a rejection of non-heterosexual sexualities. It is a recognition
of the present state of affairs where the heterosexual norm prevails.
If patriarchy is to be dismantled we will have to understand how
heteronormative sexuality serves it. We will have to denaturalize it.
To Beauvoir’s way of thinking, however, the institutional alienations
of heterosexuality ought not be confused with the erotics of
heterosexual desire. The realities of this desire and the bond of the
“primordial <em>Mitsein</em>” that it forges must be taken
into account: not only is it used to enforce women’s isolation and to
support their inability to identify a common history, it is also
responsible for the value and relationship that Beauvoir calls the
“bond”, a situation-specific articulation of the appeal
found in in <em>The Ethics of Ambiguity</em>.</p>

<p>A brief but packed sentence that appears early in the <em>The
Second Sex</em> alerts us to the ways that Beauvoir used existential
and Marxist categories to analyze the unique complexities of women’s
situation. It reads, </p>

<blockquote><p> Hence woman makes no claim
for herself as subject because she lacks the concrete means, because
she senses the necessary link connecting her to man without positing
its reciprocity, and because she often derives satisfaction from her
role as <em>the Other</em>. (p. 10)</p></blockquote>

<p> This statement needs to be read in the context of
Beauvoir’s ethical-political question, “How can a human being in
a woman’s situation attain fulfillment?”</p>

<p>Between the statement and the question we discover that the
ethical-political issue of fulfillment does not concern a
woman’s happiness. Happiness may be chosen or accepted in
exchange for the deprivations of freedom. Recalling the argument
of <em>The Ethics of Ambiguity</em> we know why. As Others, women are
returned to the metaphysically privileged world of the child. They
experience the happiness brought about by bad faith—a happiness
of not being responsible for themselves, of not having to make
consequential choices. From this existential perspective women may be
said to be complicitious in their subjugation. But this is not the
whole story.  If women are happy as the other, it may be because this
is the only avenue of happiness open to them given the material and
ideological realities of their situation. Beauvoir’s existential
charge of bad faith must be understood within her Marxist analysis of
the social, economic and cultural structures that frame women’s
lives. Though Beauvoir will not argue that these structures deprive
women of their freedom, neither will she ignore the situations that
make the exercise of that freedom extremely difficult. Her assertion
that woman feels a necessary bond with man regardless of a lack of
reciprocity, however, escapes existential and Marxist categories.  It
is crucial to Beauvoir’s analysis of women’s condition and
draws on the notion of the appeal developed in <em>The Ethics of
Ambiguity</em>. In making an appeal to others to join me in my pursuit
of justice I validate myself and my values. Given that my appeal must
be an appeal to the other in their freedom, I must allow for the fact
that the other may reject it. When this happens, I must (assuming that
the rejection is not a threat to the ground value of freedom)
recognize the other’s freedom and affirm the bond of humanity
that ties us to each other. In the case of women, Beauvoir notes, this
aspect of the appeal (the affirmation of the bond between us)
dominates. She does not approve of the way that women allow it to
eclipse the requirement that they be recognized as free subjects, but
she does alert us to the fact that recognition in itself is not the
full story of the ethical relationship. To demand recognition without
regard for the bond of humanity is unethical. It is the position of
the Subject as master.</p>

<p>Moving between the statement that women are pleased with their
alienated status as the Other and the question, “How can women
achieve human fulfillment?”, Beauvoir argues that women’s
exploitation is historical, and therefore amenable to change. As an
existential situation, however, women are responsible for changing it.
Liberation must be women’s work. It is not a matter of appealing to
men to give women their freedom, but a matter of women discovering
their solidarity, rejecting the bad faith temptations of happiness and
discovering the pleasures of freedom. Further, though Beauvoir alerts
us to the tensions and conflicts that this will create between men and
women, she does not envision a permanent war of the sexes. Here her
Hegelian-Marxist optimism prevails. Men will (ultimately) recognize
women as free subjects.</p>

<p>The last chapters of <em>The Second Sex</em>, “The
Independent Woman” and the “Conclusion”, speak of
the current (1947) status of women’s situation—what has changed
and what remains to be done. Without ignoring the importance of
women’s gaining the right to vote and without dismissing the necessity
of women attaining economic independence, Beauvoir finds these liberal
and Marxist solutions to women’s situation inadequate. They ignore the
effects of women’s socialization (the subject of volume two of <em>The
Second Sex</em>) and they are inattentive to the ways that the norm of
masculinity remains the standard of the human. The liberated woman
must free herself from two shackles: first, the idea that to be
independent she must be like men, and second, the socialization
through which she becomes feminized. The first alienates her from her
sexuality. The second makes her adverse to risking herself for her
ideas/ideals. Attentive to this current state of affairs, and to the
phenomenology of the body, Beauvoir sets two prerequisites for
liberation. First, women must be socialized to engage the world.
Second, they must be allowed to discover the unique ways that their
embodiment engages the world. In short, the myth of woman must be
dismantled. So long as it prevails, economic and political advances
will fall short of the goal of liberation. Speaking in reference to
sexual difference, Beauvoir notes that disabling the myth of woman is
not a recipe for an androgynous future. Given the realities of
embodiment, there will be sexual differences. Unlike today, however,
these differences will not be used to justify the difference between a
Subject and his inessential Other.</p>

<p>The goal of liberation, according to Beauvoir, is our mutual
recognition of each other as free and as other. She finds one
situation in which this mutual recognition (sometimes) exists today,
the intimate heterosexual erotic encounter. Speaking of this intimacy
she writes, “The dimension of the relation of the <em>other</em>
still exists; but the fact is that alterity has no longer a hostile
implication” (<em>The Second Sex</em>, 448). Why? Because lovers
experience themselves and each other ambiguously, that is as both
subjects and objects of erotic desire rather than as delineated
according to institutionalized positions of man and woman. In
Beauvoir’s words, “The erotic experience is one that most
poignantly discloses to human beings the ambiguity of the condition;
in it they are aware of themselves as flesh and as spirit, as the
other and as the subject” (<em>The Second Sex</em>, 449). The
concept of ambiguity, developed abstractly in <em>The Ethics of
Ambiguity</em>, is erotically embodied in <em>The Second Sex</em> and
is identified as a crucial piece of the prescription for transcending
the oppressions of patriarchy. This description of the liberating
possibilities of the erotic encounter is also one of those places
where Beauvoir reworks Merleau-Ponty’s phenomenology of embodiment.
For in drawing on Merleau-Ponty’s descriptions of the ways that we are
world-making and world-embedded subject-objects, she reveals the ways
that it is as subject-objects “for the world”, “to
the world”, and “in the world” that we are
passionately drawn to each other. </p>

<h2><a name="MusWeBurSadFreFle">7. “Must We Burn Sade?” Freedom and the Flesh</a></h2>

<p>We are a long way away from <em>Pyrrhus and Cinéas</em>,
where Beauvoir declared our freedom immune from assault. In that early
work, our freedom insulated us from the risks of intimacy. In <em>The
Second Sex</em>, avoiding these risks remains possible, but now this
avoidance is identified as a mark of our moral failure to live the
ambiguity of our condition. Beauvoir’s essay, “Must We Burn
Sade?” (1951, 1952), written in response to a request to write
an introduction to Sade’s <em>Justine</em>, details the effects
Beauvoir’s changed position on the relationship between freedom and
intimacy has on her ethical reflections. The central ethical question,
“the problem of the true relation between man and man”,
remains unchanged. Indeed what interests Beauvoir about Sade is that,
“[he] posed the problem of the <em>Other</em> in its most
extreme terms”. What has changed is Beauvoir’s understanding of
the drama of intersubjectivity. Marking this change, this essay also
marks a return to the question of the responsibility of the artist
raised in <em>The Ethics of Ambiguity</em>.</p>

<p>“Must we Burn Sade?” identifies the Marquis’s decision
to write as an existential project, an authentic ethics and a politics
of rebellion. Beauvoir credits Sade with uncovering the despotic
secrets of the patriarchal political machine. She is sympathetic to
his utopian appeal to freedom. She finds, however, that Sade perverted
the meaning of freedom. Thus Beauvoir identifies Sade as a great
moralist who endorsed an unsatisfactory ethics.</p>

<p>Sade is Beauvoir’s Janus-faced ally. She does not refute his claim
that cruelty establishes a relationship between the self and the
other. Sade is correct. Cruelty reveals us to each other in the
particularities and ambiguities of our conscious and fleshed
existence. The tyrant and victim, Beauvoir tells us, are a genuine
couple. They are united by the bonds of the flesh and freedom.</p>

<p>Sade is the epitome of maniacal passion dedicated to the project of
cruelty. Because he takes full responsibility for his choices, he must
be credited with choosing freedom and accepted as being authentically
ethical. This does not, however, make him either an ethical or moral
figure; for his choices destroy the intersubjective bonds of humanity.
Though his account of the power of cruelty provides a convincing
critique of our social, political and personal hypocrisies, it does
not critique the ways that cruelty is a perversion of freedom and an
exploitation of the vulnerability of the flesh. Thus his descriptions
of the powers of cruelty and the meaning of torture are incomplete and
inadequate. The case of the Marquis de Sade makes it clear that
authenticity, assuming responsibility for one’s choices, is a
necessary, but not sufficient, condition of an existential ethics of
freedom. </p>

<p>In the end, Beauvoir finds that Sade was misled (which does not
mean that he was innocent). He mistook power for freedom and
misunderstood the meanings of the erotic. In his fascination with the
conflict between consciousness and the flesh, Sade exposed the failure
of the sadistic enterprise; for in attempting to lose himself in the
pleasures of the flesh and in this way to experience both the
ambiguity of his being as consciousness made flesh (or flesh made
consciousness) and the reality of his being for and with others, Sade
substitutes the spectacle for the lived experience and accepts
counterfeit transactions of domination and assimilation/incorporation
for genuine relationships of reciprocity and gratuitous generosity. He
never reaches the other.</p>

<p>Centering his life in the erotic, Sade missed the truth of the
erotic. This truth, Beauvoir tells us, can only be found by those who
abandon themselves to the risks of emotional intoxication. Living this
intoxication we discover the ways that the body turned flesh dissolves
all arguments against the immediacy of our bonds with each other and
grounds an ethic of the appeal, risk and mutual vulnerability.</p>

<p>Between the early <em>Pyrrhus and Cinéas</em> and the later
“Must We Burn Sade?” we discern the impact of what might
be called Beauvoir’s phenomenological turn to the body. Once she
abandons the idea that our freedom, as absolutely internal, is immune
from an assault by the other, and accepts the radical vulnerability of
our lived embodiment, questions of violence and desire cannot be
severed from the question of our shared humanity or questions of
ethics and justice. In condemning Sade for his perversion of the
erotic, Beauvoir also faults him as an artist. Though she accuses him
of being a technically poor writer, the heart of her criticism is
ethical not aesthetic. Sade, according to Beauvoir, violated his
obligations as an author. Instead of revealing the world to us in its
promise and possibilities, and instead of appealing to us to work for
justice, he took refuge in the imaginary and developed metaphysical
justifications for suffering and cruelty. In the end, Beauvoir accuses
Sade of being the serious man described in her <em>Ethics of
Ambiguity</em>.</p>

<h2><a name="DjaBouConApp">8. <em>Djamila Boupacha</em>: The Concrete Appeal</a></h2>

<p>In 1962, Beauvoir and Gisile Halimi co-authored the story of
Djamila Boupacha, an Algerian girl accused of being a terrorist and
tortured by the French during the French-Algerian War. This book may
be read as an extension of Beauvoir’s critique of the Marquis de Sade.
Instead of fleeing from the horrors of the real into the safety of the
imaginary, Beauvoir takes up her responsibility as an author to expose
and confront realities that the state would rather hide. Her purpose
in writing is concrete and political. The book is both a protest and
an appeal. Countering Sade, Beauvoir and Halimi show that the truth of
torture lies in the unjustifiable politics of abusive power.

<h2><a name="AllMenMorVerEasDeaAdiFarSarFinPasBod">9. <em>All Men are Mortal</em>, <em>A Very Easy Death</em>, <em>Adieux: A Farewell to Sartre</em> : Finitude, Passion and the Body</a></h2>

<p>The ways that the phenomenological turn to the body becomes
increasingly important in Beauvoir’s work, and the ways that this turn
heightens Beauvoir’s sensitivity to the materialities of our situated
freedom and to the power of the category of the Other, may be traced
in Beauvoir’s attention to the question of human finitude. This
question is raised early in her 1946 novel, <em>All Men Are
Mortal</em>, the story of Fosca, a man who chooses to cheat death. His
desire for immortality, however, is driven by his desire to realize
the abstract ideal of humanism. Fosca does not embrace immortality to
escape the ambiguities of the flesh and embodiment. His decision is
motivated by his desire to save the world. He believes that time is
his enemy so long as his time is limited. He believes that with
sufficient time he can take the humanist a project, bring it to
closure and secure it from failure. </p>

<p>Fosca learns, however, that contrary to his initial belief, time
becomes his enemy when it stretches endlessly before him. It is not
time that he needs to secure his vision, but the commitment of others.
No amount of time can secure that. As immortal, Fosca confronts the
inevitability of failure that haunts humanity. Unlike mortals,
however, who, confronted with the constraints of time, take up their
failures with passion, Fosca becomes immobilized. Indifference to life
replaces the passion for life. In the end, he discovers the crucial
truth of ethical action from his many-generations-removed grandson,
Armand. Understanding that the future belongs to others who may or may
not take up his projects, Armand commits himself to the concrete
possibilities of the present. His passion is embodied in the appeal to
others, not in an abstract goal that, however just it might seem,
would deny future generations the right to determine their own
destiny. </p>

<p>In <em>All Men Are Mortal</em> the givenness of finitude and death
concerns our relationship to time. Eighteen years later, writing about
the dying and death of her mother in <em>A</em> <em>Very Easy
Death</em> (1964); six years after that, analyzing the situation of
the aged in <em>Coming of Age</em> (1970), and eleven years subsequent
to that, chronicling Sartre’s last days in <em>Adieux: A Farewell to
Sartre</em> (1981), it is not so much our relationship to time but
more a matter of our embodiment that concerns Beauvoir. In <em>A</em>
<em>Very Easy Death</em> and <em>Adieux</em>, Beauvoir assumes the
position of the phenomenological witness. The bodies of her mother and
Sartre are given to us in all their disturbing breakdowns and
deteriorations. Some have found these works cold, insensitive and even
cruel. They miss Beauvoir’s point. She is showing us who we are. The
“I can” body revealed by other phenomenologists as a
crucial mark of embodiment is the limited condition of the mature
healthy body. It is but one phase of the life of the body. In its
early days the body is still learning its “I can’s”. As we
age, the body begins losing them. It is one thing, as with the myth of
woman, to alienate an “I can” from its capacities. It is
quite another to refuse to attend to the full range of embodied life
and to assess the value of that life in terms of its I can
possibilities.</p>

<h2><a name="ComAgeOthAga">10. <em>The Coming of Age</em>: The Other Again</a></h2>

<p>We need to read <em>A</em> <em>Very Easy Death</em> and
<em>Adieux</em> within the context of the analyses of <em>The Coming
of Age</em> to fully appreciate Beauvoir’s role as witness. The
project of <em>The Coming of Age</em> is similar to that of <em>The
Second Sex</em>. Like <em>The Second Sex</em>, it focuses on a group
of people designated as Other; like <em>The Second Sex</em> it exposes
the mythical status of the “facts” about aging and the
aged; and like <em>The Second Sex</em> it indicts society for its
dehumanization of those it designates as Other. <em>The Coming of
Age</em> also emulates <em>The Second Sex</em> in its method and
scope. It trains a phenomenological lens on biological, psychological
and sociological factors in order to understand the phenomenon of
marginalized otherness. In many ways, however, <em>The Coming of
Age</em> corrects what Beauvoir sees as the flaw of <em>The Second
Sex</em>.</p>

<p>In reflecting on <em>The Second Sex</em>, Beauvoir says that were
she to write it again she would pay less attention to the abstract
issue of consciousness and more attention to the material conditions
of scarcity. Though it is impossible to say what a revised version of
<em>The Second Sex</em> would look like, <em>The Coming of Age</em>
gives us some idea of how it might read. There is no talk here of the
aged. Reminding us that old age is our universal destiny, Beauvoir
tells us that its lived meaning is specific to our historical, class
and cultural situations. Where <em>The Second Sex</em> identifies the
ways that the myth of woman hides the diversity of women and does not
seem to see that the single category of the inessential Other may not
capture the diverse meanings of women’s situations, <em>The Coming of
Age</em> keeps making the point that if we speak of old age as a
universal category we will miss the crucial differences among the aged
that the myths and images of aging hide.</p>

<p>Comparing the status of the aged to that of women as woman,
Beauvoir notes that both occupy the position of the Other and that as
Other both are subject to the powers of mythical, exploitive
biologies. Though <em>The Coming of Age</em> pays closer attention to
the diversity behind the unifying myths and works with a somewhat
different conception of otherness, it sounds remarkably similar to
<em>The Second Sex</em> as it traces the sources of the marginal
status of the aged. While <em>The Second Sex</em> accused patriarchy
of depriving women of their subject status by barring them from the
project and devaluating the fleshed experience of the erotic, <em>The
Coming of Age</em> argues that the non-subject status of the aged can
be traced to the fact that they are barred from their projects and
their erotic possibilities. “The old man”, Beauvoir
writes, “looks like a different species to others because unlike
active members of the community he is not engaged in a project”.
</p>

<p>Like <em>The Second Sex</em>, which attended to the givens of
biology without allowing them to determine the meaning of the subject,
<em>The Coming of Age</em> also gives biology its due. The lack of
engagement of the aged, Beauvoir notes, is in part imposed from
without and in part comes from within; for as we age, the body is
transformed from an instrument that engages the world into a hindrance
that makes our access to the world difficult. The point of <em>The
Coming of Age</em>, however, is that it is unjust to use these
difficulties to justify reducing the aged to the status of the Other.
<em>Adieux</em>’s witnessing makes this point clearly. However
diminished Sartre’s body became, it never severed him from his
projects. He could not have sustained his work by himself, but he was
in a situation where others refused to marginalize him. They did not
equate his diminished bodily capacities with a diminished humanity.
<em>The Coming of Age</em> argues that the situation of a privileged
Sartre ought to be our common destiny.</p>

<p>In a world which recognized the phenomenological truth of the body,
the existential truth of freedom, the Marxist truth of exploitation
and the human truth of the bond, the derogatory category of the Other
would be eradicated. Neither the aged nor women, nor anyone by virtue
of their race, class, ethnicity or religion would find themselves
rendered inessential. Beauvoir knows that it is too much to hope for
such a world. She understands the lures of domination and violence.
Throughout her career, however, she used philosophical and literary
tools to reveal the possibilities of such a world and appealed to us
to work for it.</p>
