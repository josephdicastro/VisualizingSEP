<h1>Race</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Wed May 28, 2008; substantive revision Wed Feb 17, 2016</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>

The concept of race has historically signified the division of
humanity into a small number of groups based upon five criteria: (1)
Races reflect some type of biological foundation, be it Aristotelian
essences or modern genes; (2) This biological foundation generates
discrete racial groupings, such that all and only all members of one
race share a set of biological characteristics that are not shared by
members of other races; (3) This biological foundation is inherited
from generation to generation, allowing observers to identify an
individual’s race through her ancestry or genealogy; (4)
Genealogical investigation should identify each race’s geographic
origin, typically in Africa, Europe, Asia, or North and South America;
and (5) This inherited racial biological foundation manifests itself
primarily in physical phenotypes, such as skin color, eye shape, hair
texture, and bone structure, and perhaps also behavioral phenotypes,
such as intelligence or delinquency.</p>

<p>

This historical concept of race has faced substantial scientific and
philosophical challenge, with some important thinkers denying both the
logical coherence of the concept and the very existence of races.
Others defend the concept of race, albeit with substantial changes to
the foundations of racial identity, which they depict as either
socially constructed or, if biologically grounded, neither discrete nor
essentialist, as the historical concept would have it.</p>

<p>

Both in the past and today, determining the boundaries of discrete
races has proven to be most vexing and has led to great variations in
the number of human races believed to be in existence. Thus, some
thinkers categorized humans into only four distinct races (typically
white or Caucasian, black or African, yellow or Asian, and red or
Native American), and downplayed any biological or phenotypical
distinctions within racial groups (such as those between Scandavians
and Spaniards within the white or Caucasian race). Other thinkers
classified humans into many more racial categories, for instance
arguing that those humans “indigenous” to Europe could be
distinguished into discrete Nordic, Alpine, and Mediterranean
races.</p>

<p>

The ambiguities and confusion associated with determining the
boundaries of racial categories have over time provoked a widespread
scholarly consensus that discrete or essentialist races are
socially constructed, not biologically real. However, significant
scholarly debate persists regarding whether reproductive isolation,
either during human evolution or through modern practices barring
miscegenation, may have generated sufficient genetic isolation as to
justify using the term race to signify the existence of non-discrete
human groups that share not only physical phenotypes but also clusters
of genetic material. In addition, scholarly debate exists concerning
the formation and character of socially constructed, discrete racial
categories. For instance, some scholars suggest that race is
inconceivable without racialized social hierarchies, while others argue
that egalitarian race relations are possible. Finally, substantial
controversy surrounds the moral status of racial identity and
solidarity and the justice and legitimacy of policies or institutions
aimed at undermining racial inequality.</p>

<p>

This entry focuses on contemporary scholarship regarding the
conceptual, ontological, epistemological, and normative questions
pertaining to race. Apart from an introductory section on the history
of the concept of race in the West and in Western philosophy, it does
not focus on authors such as Frederick Douglass, W.E.B. DuBois, or
Frantz Fanon, or movements, such as Negritude, Critical Race Theory,
Black Identity, Philosophy of Liberation, or Feminist Perspectives on
Race. Interested readers should consult the relevant entries in the
Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy for insight into these and other
topics important to the study of race in philosophy. </p>

<p>
In Section II, I will trace the historical origins and development of
the concept of race. Section III covers contemporary philosophical
debates over whether races actually exist. Thereafter, in section IV I
will examine the differences between race and ethnicity. Finally, in
Section V I will survey debates among moral, political and legal
philosophers over the validity of racial identity, racial solidarity,
and race-specific policies such as affirmative action and race-based
representation.</p>

<h2><a name="HisConRac">1. History of the Concept of Race</a></h2>

<p>

The dominant scholarly position is that the concept of race is a
modern phenomenon, at least in Europe and the Americas. However, there
is less agreement regarding whether <em>racism</em>, even absent a
developed race concept, may have existed in the ancient Greek and
Roman worlds. The influential work of classicist Frank Snowden (1970;
1983), who emphasized the lack of anti-black prejudice in the ancient
world, led many scholars of race to conclude that racism did not exist
in that epoch. However, later classicists have responded that
Snowden's work unnecessarily reduced all forms of racism to its
peculiarly American version based on skin color and others markers of
non-white identity. Thus, Benjamin Isaac (2004) and Denise McCoskey
(2012) contend that the ancient Greeks and Romans did hold
proto-racist views that applied to other groups which today might be
considered white. Isaac persuasively argues that these views must be
considered <em>proto-racist</em>: although they were formed without
the aid of a modern race concept grounded in ideas of deterministic
biology (2004, 5), they nevertheless resembled modern racism by
attributing “to groups of people common characteristics
considered to be unalterable because they are determined by external
factors or heredity” (2004, 38). More importantly, both Isaac
and McCoskey contend that ancient proto-racism influenced the
development of modern racism.</p>

<p>

Perhaps the first, unconscious stirrings of the concept of race arose
within the Iberian peninsula. Following the Moorish conquest of
Andalusia in the eighth century C.E., the Iberian Peninsula became the
site of the greatest intermingling between Jewish, Christian, and
Muslim believers. During and after their <em>reconquista</em>
(reconquest) of the Muslim principalities in the peninsula, the
Catholic Monarchs Isabel and Ferdinand sought to establish a uniformly
Christian state by expelling first the Jews (in 1492) and then the
Muslims (in 1502). But because large numbers of both groups converted
to Christianity to avoid expulsion (and before this to avoid
persecution), the monarchs distrusted the authenticity of these Jewish
and Muslim <em>conversos</em> (converts). So to ensure that only truly
faithful Christians remained within the realm, the grand inquisitor
Torquemada reformulated the Inquisition to inquire not just into
defendants’ religious faith and practices but into their lineage.
Only those who could demonstrate their ancestry to those Christians who
resisted the Moorish invasion were secure in their status in the realm.
Thus was born the idea of purity of blood (<em>limpieza de
sangre</em>), not fully the biological concept of race but perhaps the
first occidental use of blood heritage as a category of
religio-political membership (Bernasconi and Lott 2000, vii; Hannaford
1996, 122–126; Frederickson 2002, 31–35).</p>

<p>

The Iberian peninsula may also have witnessed the first stirrings of
anti-black and anti-Native-American racism. Since this region was the
first in Europe to utilize African slavery while gradually rejecting
the enslavement of fellow European Christians, Iberian Christians may
have come to associate blacks as physically and mentally suitable only
for menial labor. In this they were influenced by Arab slave merchants,
who assigned the worst tasks to their dark skinned slaves while
assigning more complex labor to light or tawny-skinned slaves
(Frederickson 2002, 29). The “discovery” of the New World
by Iberian explorers also brought European Christians into contact with
indigenous Americans for the first time. This resulted in the heated
debate in Valladolid in 1550 between Bartolomé Las Casas and
Gines de Sepúlveda over whether the Indians were by nature
inferior and thus worthy of enslavement and conquest. Whether due to
Las Casas’s victory over Sepúlveda, or due to the
hierarchical character of Spanish Catholicism which did not require the
dehumanization of other races in order to justify slavery, the Spanish
empire did avoid the racialization of its conquered peoples and African
slaves. Indeed, arguably it was the conflict between the Enlightenment
ideals of universal freedom and equality versus the fact of the
European enslavement of Africans and indigenous Americans that fostered
the development of the idea of race (Blum 2002, 111–112; Hannaford
1996, 149–150).</p>

<p>

While events in the Iberian peninsula may have provided the initial
stirrings of modern racial sentiments, the concept of race, with its
close links to ideas of deterministic biology, emerged with the rise
of modern natural philosophy and its concern with taxonomy (Smith
2015). The first important articulation of the race concept came with
the 1684 publication of “A New Division of the Earth” by
Francois Bernier (1625–1688) (Bernasconi and Lott 2000, viii;
Hannaford 1996, 191, 203).  Based on his travels through Egypt, India,
and Persia, this essay presented a division of humanity into
“four or five species or races of men in particular whose
difference is so remarkable that it may be properly made use of as the
foundation for a new division of the earth” (Bernasconi and Lott
2000, 1–2). First were the peoples inhabiting most of Europe and
North Africa, extending eastward through Persia, northern and central
India, and right up to parts of contemporary Indonesia. Despite their
differing skin tones, these peoples nevertheless shared common
physical characteristics, such as hair texture and bone structure. The
second race was constituted by the people of Africa south of the
Sahara desert, who notably possessed smooth black skin, thick noses
and lips, thin beards, and wooly hair.  The peoples inhabiting lands
from east Asia, through China, today’s central Asian states such
as Usbekistan, and westward into Siberia and eastern Russia
represented the third race, marked by their “truly white”
skin, broad shoulders, flat faces, flat noses, thin beards, and long,
thin eyes, while the short and squat Lapps of northern Scandanavia
constituted the fourth race. Bernier considered whether the indigenous
peoples of the Americas were a fifth race, but he ultimately assigned
them to the first (Bernasconi and Lott 2000, 2–3).</p>

<p>

But while Bernier initiated the use of the term “race” to
distinguish different groups of humans based on physical traits, his
failure to reflect on the relationship between racial division and the
human race in general mitigated the scientific rigor of his definition
(Bernasconi and Lott 2000, viii). Central to a scientific concept of
race would be a resolution of the question of monogenesis versus
polygenesis. Monogenesis adhered to the Biblical creation story in
asserting that all humans descended from a common ancestor, perhaps
Adam of the Book of Genesis; polygenesis, on the other had, asserted
that different human races descended from different ancestral roots.
Thus, the former position contended that all races are nevertheless
members of a common human species, whereas the latter saw races as
distinct species.</p>

<p>

David Hume’s position on the debate between polygenesis versus
monogenesis is the subject of some scholarly debate. The bone of
contention is his essay “Of National Characters,” where he
contends that differences among European nations are attributable not
to natural differences but to cultural and political influences. Amidst
this argument against crude naturalism, Hume inserts a footnote in the
1754 edition, wherein he writes: “I am apt to suspect <em>the
negroes and in general all the other species of men (for there are four
or five different kinds)</em> to be naturally inferior to whites. There
<em>never</em> was a civilized nation of any other complexion than
white, nor even any individual eminent either in action or
speculation” (Zack 2002, 15; emphasis added). Whereas even the
most barbarous white nations such as the Germans “have something
eminent about them,” the “uniform and constant
difference” in accomplishment between whites and non-whites could
not occur “if nature had not made an original distinction betwixt
these breeds of men” (Zack 2002, 15). Responding to criticism, he
softens this position in the 1776 edition, restricting his claims to
natural inferiority only to “negroes,” stating that
“<em>scarcely</em> ever was a civilized nation of that
complexion, not even of individual eminent in action or
speculation” (Zack 2002, 17; Hume 1776 [1987], 208; emphasis
added). Richard Popkin (1977) and Naomi Zack (2002, 13–18) contend that
the 1754 version of the essay assumes, without demonstration, an
original, polygenetic difference between white and non-white races.
Andrew Valls (2005, 132) denies that either version of the footnote
espouses polygenesis.</p>

<p>

 A
strong and clear defense of monogenesis was provided by Immanuel Kant
(1724–1804) in his essay “Of the Different Human Races,”
first published in 1775 and revised in 1777. Kant argued that all
humans descend from a common human “lineal root genus” in
Europe, which contained the biological “seeds” and
“dispositions” that can generate the distinct physical
traits of race when triggered by divergent environmental factors,
especially combinations of heat and humidity. This, combined with
patterns of migration, geographic isolation, and in-breeding, led to
the differentiation of four distinct, pure races: the “noble
blond” of northern Europe; the “copper red” of
America (and east Asia); the “black” of Senegambia in
Africa; and the “olive-yellow” of Asian-India. Once these
discrete racial groups were developed over many generations, further
climatic changes will not alter racial phenotypes (Bernasconi and Lott
2000, 8–22).</p>

<p>

Yet despite the distinction generated between different races,
Kant’s monogenetic account led him to maintain that the different
races were part of a common human species. As evidence, he adduced the
fact that individuals from different races were able to breed together,
and their offspring tended to exhibit blended physical traits inherited
from both parents. Not only did blending indicate that the parents were
part of a common species; it also indicated that they are of distinct
races. For the physical traits of parents of the same race are not
blended but often passed on exclusively: a blond white man and a
brunette white woman may have four blond children, without any blending
of this physical trait; whereas a black man and a white woman will bear
children who blend white and black traits (Bernasconi and Lott 2000,
9–10). Such inter-racial mixtures accounted for the existence of
liminal individuals, whose physical traits seem to lie between the
discrete boundaries of one of the four races; peoples who do not fit
neatly into one or another race are explained away as groups whose
seeds have not been fully triggered by the appropriate environmental
stimuli (Bernasconi and Lott 2000, 11).</p>

<p>

The “science” of race was furthered by the man sometimes
considered to be the father of modern anthropology, Johann Friedrich
Blumenbach (1752–1840). In his doctoral dissertation, “On the
Natural Variety of Mankind,” first published in 1775, Blumenbach
identified four “varieties” of mankind: the peoples of
Europe, Asia, Africa, and America. His essay was revised and
republished both in 1781, wherein he introduced a fifth variety of
mankind, that inhabiting the South Pacific islands, and in 1795,
wherein he first coined the term “Caucasian” to describe
the variety of people inhabiting Europe, West Asia, and Northern India.
This term reflected his claim that this variety originated in the
Caucuses mountains, in Georgia, justifying this etiology through
reference to the superior beauty of the Georgians. The 1795 version
also included the terms Mongolian to describe the non-Caucasian peoples
of Asia, Ethiopian to signify black Africans, American to denote the
indigenous peoples of the New World, and Malay to identify the South
Pacific Islanders (Bernasconi and Lott 2000, 27–33; Hannaford 1996,
207).</p>

<p>

While noting differences in skin tone, he based his varieties
upon the structures of the cranium, which supposedly gave his
distinctions a stronger scientific foundation than the more superficial
characteristic of color (Hannaford 1996, 206). In addition, he strongly
denied polygenetic accounts of racial difference, noting the ability of
members of different varieties to breed with each other, something that
humans were incapable of doing with other species. Indeed, he took
great pains to dismiss as spurious accounts of Africans mating with
apes or of monstrous creatures formed through the union of humans with
other animals (Hannaford 1996, 208–9). In final support of his more
scientific, monogenist approach, Blumenbach posited the internal,
biological force which generated racial difference, the “nisus
formativus,” which when triggered by specific environmental
stimuli generated the variations found within the varieties of humans
(Hannaford 1996, 212).</p>

<p>

Despite the strong monogenist arguments provided by Kant and
Blumenbach, polygenesis remained a viable intellectual strain within
race theory, particularly in the “American School of
Anthropology,” embodied by Louis Agassiz, Robins Gliddon, and
Josiah Clark Nott. Agassiz was born in Switzerland, received an M.D. in
Munich and later studied zoology, geology, and paleontology in various
German universities under the influence of Romantic scientific
theories. His orthodox Christian background initially imbued him with a
strong monogenist commitment, but upon visiting America and seeing an
African American for the first time, Agassiz experienced a type of
conversion experience, which led him to question whether these
remarkably different people could share the same blood as Europeans.
Eventually staying on and making his career in America, and continually
struck by the physical character of African Americans, Agassiz
officially announced his turn to polygenesis at the 1850 meeting of the
American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) in
Charleston, South Carolina. Nott, a South Carolina physician, attended
the same AAAS meeting and, along with Gliddon, joined Agassiz in the
promulgation of the American School’s defense of polygenesis
(Brace 2005, 93–103).</p>

<p>

Along with Agassiz, Nott was also influenced by the French romantic
race theorist Arthur de Gobineau (1816–1882), whose “Essay on the
Inequality of the Human Races” (1853–1855) Nott partially
translated into English and published for the American audience.
Although the Catholic Gobineau initially espoused monogenesis, he later
leaned towards polygenesis and ended up ambivalent on this issue
(Hannaford 1996, 268–269). Nevertheless, Gobineau lent credence to the
white racial supremacy that Nott supported (Brace 2005, 120–121).
Gobineau posited two impulses among humans, that of attraction and
repulsion. Civilization emerges when humans obey the law of attraction
and intermingle with peoples of different racial stocks. According the
Gobineau, the white race was created through such intermingling, which
allowed it alone to generate civilization, unlike the other races,
which were governed only by the law of repulsion. Once civilization is
established, however, further race mixing leads to the degeneration of the
race through a decline in the quality of its blood. Consequently, when
the white race conquers other black or yellow races, any further
intermingling will lead it to decline. Thus, Gobineau claimed that the
white race would never die so long as its blood remains composed of its
initial mixture of peoples. Notably, Nott strategically excised those
sections discussing the law of attraction when translating
Gobineau’s essay for an American audience (Bernasconi and Lott
2000, 45–51).</p>

<p>

Eventually, polygenesis declined through the intellectual success of
Charles Darwin’s theory of evolution (Brace 2005, 124). Darwin
himself weighed in on this debate in the chapter “On the Races of
Man” in his book <em>The Descent of Man</em> (1871), arguing that
as the theory of evolution gains wider acceptance, “the dispute
between the monogenists and the polygenists will die a silent and
unobserved death” (Bernasconi and Lott 2000, 68), with the former
winning out. The rest of the essay entertained both sides of the debate
regarding whether or not different races constitute different species
or sub-species of humans. Although Darwin did not explicitly take sides
in this debate, the preponderance of his argument gives little support
to the idea of races being different species. For instance, he noted
that couples from different races produce fertile offspring, and that
individuals from different races seem to share many mental
similarities. That said, while Darwinian evolution may have killed off
polygenesis and the related idea that the races constituted distinct
species, it hardly killed off race itself. Darwin himself did not think
natural selection would by itself generate racial distinctions, since
the physical traits associated with racial differences did not seem
sufficiently beneficial to favor their retention; he did, however,
leave open a role for sexual selection in the creation of races,
through repeated mating among individuals with similar traits
(Bernasconi and Lott 2000, 77–78). Consequently, later race thinkers
would replace polygenesis with natural selection and sexual selection
as scientific mechanisms whereby racial differentiation could slowly,
unintentionally, but nevertheless inevitably proceed (Hannaford 1996,
273).</p>

<p>

Sexual selection became a central focus for race-thinking with the
introduction of the term “eugenics” in 1883 by Francis
Galton (1822–1911) in his essay “Inquiries into Human Faculty and
Development” (Hannaford 1996, 290). Focusing on physical as
opposed to “moral” qualities, Galton advocated selective
breeding to improve the “health, energy, ability, manliness, and
courteous disposition” of the human species in his later essay
“Eugenics: Its Definition, Scope, and Aims” (Bernasconi and
Lott 2000, 80). Following the same currents of “Social
Darwinism” that advocated the evolutionary improvement of the
human condition through active human intervention, Galton proposed
making eugenics not only an element in popular culture or “a new
religion” (Bernasconi and Lott 2000, 82) but even a policy
enforced by the American government. While positive eugenics, or the
enforced breeding of higher types, never became law, negative eugenics,
or the sterilization of the feebleminded or infirm, did become public
policy enforced by a number of American states and upheld by the United
States Supreme Court in an eight-to-one decision in <em>Buck v.
Bell</em> (274 U.S. 200, 1927). The widespread acceptance of negative
eugenics can be inferred by the fact that the Court Opinion justifying
the decision was authored by Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, a figure
usually associated with progressive and civil libertarian positions,
and whose doctrine of “clear and present danger” sought to
expand the protection of free speech.</p>

<p>

The apogee of post-Darwinian race-thinking was arguably reached in the
book <em>The Foundations of the Nineteenth Century</em> by Houston
Stewart Chamberlain (1855–1927), the son-in-law of German opera
composer Richard Wagner. Chamberlain argued in the evolutionary terms
of sexual selection that distinct races emerged through geographical
and historical conditions which create inbreeding among certain
individuals with similar traits (Hannaford 1996, 351). Moving from this
initial specification, Chamberlain then argued that the key strands of
western civilization—Christianity and ancient Greek philosophy and
art—emerged from the Aryan race. Jesus, for instance, was held
to be of Aryan stock, despite his Jewish religion, since the territory
of Galilee was populated by peoples descended from Aryan Phonecians as
well as by Semitic Jews. Similarly, Aristotle’s distinction
between Greeks and Barbarians was reinterpreted as a racial distinction
between Aryans and non-Aryans. These Greek and Christian strands became
united in Europe, particularly during the Reformation, which allowed
the highest, Teutonic strain of the Aryan race to be freed from
constraining Roman Catholic cultural fetters. But while Roman
institutions and practices may have constrained the Teutonic Germans,
their diametric opposite was the Jew, the highest manifestation of the
Semitic Race. The European religious tensions between Christian and Jew
were thus transformed into racial conflicts, for which conversion or
ecumenical tolerance would have no healing effect. Chamberlain’s
writings, not surprisingly, have come to be seen as some of the key
intellectual foundations for twentieth century German anti-Semitism, of
which Adolf Hitler was simply its most extreme manifestation.</p>

<p>

If Chamberlain’s writings served as intellectual fodder for
German racial prejudice, Madison Grant (1865–1937) provided similar
foundations for American race prejudice against Blacks and Native
Americans in his popular book <em>The Passing of the Great Race</em>
(1916). Rejecting political or educational means of ameliorating the
destitution of the subordinate racial groups in America, Grant instead
advocated strict segregation and the prohibition of miscegenation, or
the interbreeding of members of different races (Hannaford 1996, 358).
Like Galton, Grant had similar success in influencing American public
policy, both through the imposition of racist restrictions on
immigration at the federal level and through the enforcement of
anti-miscegenation laws in thirty states, until such prohibitions were
finally overturned by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Loving v.
Virginia</em> (388 U.S. 1 [1967]).</p>

<p>

If the apogee of biological race was reached in the early twentieth
century, its decline began at about the same time. While writers such
as Chamberlain and Grant popularized and politicized biological
conceptions of race hierarchy, academic anthropologists since
Blumenbach gave the concept of race its scientific validity. But
academic anthropology also provided the first challenge to biological
race in the person of Columbia University professor Franz Boas
(1858–1942), a German-born Jewish immigrant to the United States. Boas
challenged the fixed character of racial groups by taking on one of the
key fundaments to racial typology, cranium size. Boas showed that this
characteristic was profoundly affected by environmental factors, noting
that American-born members of various “racial” types, such
as Semitic Jews, tended to have larger crania than their European-born
parents, a result of differences in nourishment. From this he concluded
that claims about racially differential mental capacities could
similarly be reduced to such environmental factors. In so doing, Boas
undermined one measure of racial distinction, and although he did not
go so far as to reject entirely the concept of biological race itself,
he strongly influenced anthropologists to shift their focus from
putatively fixed biological characteristics to apparently mutable
cultural factors in order to understand differences among human groups
(Bernasconi and Lott 2000, 84–88; Brace 2005, 167–169; Cornell and
Hartmann 1998, 42–43).</p>

<p>

 A
stronger anthropological rejection of the biological conception of race
was leveled by Ashley Montagu (1905–1999). Drawing on insights from
modern, experimental genetics, Montagu forcefully argued that the
anthropological conception of race relied on grouping together various
perceptible physical characteristics, whereas the real building blocks
of evolution were genes, which dictated biological changes among
populations at a much finer level. The morphological traits associated
with race, thus, were gross aggregates of a variety of genetic changes,
some of which resulted in physically perceptible characteristics, many
others of which resulted in imperceptible changes. Moreover, since
genetic evolution can occur through both the mixture of different genes
and the mutation of the same gene over generations, the traits
associated with races cannot be attributed to discrete lines of genetic
descent, since the dark skin and curly hair of one individual may
result from genetic mixture while the same traits in another individual
may result from genetic mutation (Bernasconi and Lott 2000, 100–107).
Montagu’s efforts eventually resulted in the publication of an
official statement denying the biological foundations of race by the
United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization
(UNESCO) in 1950, although it would take until 1996 for the American
Association of Physical Anthropologists (AAPA) to publish a similar
document (Brace 2005, 239).</p>

<h2><a name="DoRacExiConPhiDeb">2. Do Races Exist? Contemporary Philosophical Debates</a></h2>

<p>

Ron Mallon (2004, 2006, 2007) provides a nice sketch of the
contemporary philosophical terrain regarding the status of the concept
of race, dividing it into three valid competing schools of thought
regarding the ontological status of race, along with the discarded
biological conception. <em>Racial naturalism</em> signifies the old,
biological conception of race, which depicts races as bearing
“biobehavioral essences: underlying natural (and perhaps genetic)
properties that (1) are heritable, biological features, (2) are shared
by all and only the members of a race, and (3) explain behavioral,
characterological, and cultural predispositions of individual persons
and racial groups” (2006, 528–529). While philosophers and
scientists have reached the consensus against racial naturalism,
philosophers nevertheless disagree on the possible ontological status
of a different conception of race. Mallon divides such disagreements
into three <em>metaphysical</em> camps (<em>racial skepticism</em>,
<em>racial constructivism</em>, and <em>racial population
naturalism</em>) and two <em>normative</em> camps
(<em>eliminativism</em> and <em>conservationism</em>).</p>

<p>

<em>Racial skepticism</em> holds that because racial naturalism is
false, races of any type do not exist. Racial skeptics, such as Anthony
Appiah (1995, 1996) and Naomi Zack (1993, 2002) contend that the term
race cannot refer to anything real in the world, since the one thing in
the world to which the term could uniquely refer—discrete,
essentialist, biological races—have been proven not to exist.
Zack (2002, 87–88) provides an accessible summary of the racial
skeptic’s argument against the biological foundations for race,
sequentially summarizing the scientific rejection of essences,
geography, phenotypes, post-Mendelian transmission genetics, and
genealogies as possible foundations for races. Aristotelian
<em>essences</em>, thought to ground the common characteristics of
distinct species, were correctly rejected by early modern philosophers.
If essences cannot even ground differences among species, then they
clearly cannot ground the differences among races, which even
nineteenth century racial science still understood as members of the
same species. Whereas folk theories rely on <em>geography</em> to
divide humanity into African, European, Asian, and Amerindian races,
contemporary population genetics reveal the vacuity of this foundation
for two reasons. First, geographically based environmental stimuli lead
to continuous physical adaptations in skin, hair and bone rather than
the discrete differences associated with race; and second, although
mitochondrial DNA mutations provide evidence of the geographical
origins of populations, these mutations do not correlate with the
physical traits associated with racial groups. Similarly,
<em>phenotypes</em> cannot ground folk theories of race: for instance,
differences in skin tone are gradual, not discrete; and blood-type
variations occur independently of the more visible phenotypes
associated with race, such as skin color and hair texture. Race cannot
be founded upon <em>transmission genetics</em>, since the genes
transmitted from one generation to the next lead to very specific
physical traits, not general racial characteristics shared by all
members of a putatively racial group. And finally, <em>genealogy</em>
cannot ground race, since clades (populations descended from a common
ancestor) may have common genetic characteristics, but these need not
correlate with the visible traits associated with races. Zack
concludes: “Essences, geography, phenotypes, genotypes, and
genealogy are the only known candidates for physical scientific bases
of race. Each fails. Therefore, there is no physical scientific basis
for the social racial taxonomy” (Zack 2002, 88).</p>

<p>

Racial skeptics like Appiah and Zack adopt normative racial
<em>eliminativism</em>, which recommends discarding the concept of race
entirely, according to the following argument. Because of its
historical genealogy, the term race can only refer to one or more
discrete groups of people who alone share biologically significant
genetic features. Such a monopoly on certain genetic features could
only emerge within a group that practices such a high level of
inbreeding that it is effectively genetically isolated. Such genetic
isolation might refer to the Amish in America (Appiah 1996, 73) or to
Irish Protestants (Zack 2002, 69), but they clearly cannot refer to
those groupings of people presently subsumed under American racial
census categories. Because the concept “race” can only
apply to groups not typically deemed races (Amish, Irish Protestants),
and because this concept cannot apply to groups typically deemed races
(African Americans, Whites, Asians, Native Americans), a mismatch
occurs between the concept and its typical referent. Thus, the concept
of race must be eliminated due to its logical incoherence (Mallon 2006,
526, 533).</p>

<p>

<em>Racial constructivism</em> refers to the argument that, even if
biological race is false, races have come into existence and continue
to exist through “human culture and human decisions”
(Mallon 2007, 94). Race constructivists accept the skeptics’
dismissal of biological race but argue that the term still meaningfully
refers to the widespread grouping of individuals into certain
categories by society, indeed often by the very members of such racial
ascriptions. Normatively, race constructivists argue that since society
labels people according to racial categories, and since such labeling
often leads to race-based differences in resources, opportunities, and
well-being, the concept of race must be conserved, in order to
facilitate race-based social movements or policies, such as affirmative
action, that compensate for socially constructed but socially relevant
racial differences. While sharing this normative commitment to race
<em>conservationism</em>, racial constructivists can be subdivided into
three groups with slightly different accounts of the ontology of
race.</p>

<p>

<em>Thin constructivism</em> depicts race as a grouping of humans
according to ancestry and genetically insignificant, “superficial
properties that are prototypically linked with race,” such as
skin tone, hair color and hair texture (Mallon 2006, 534). In this way,
thin constructivists such as Robert Gooding-Williams (1998), Lucius
Outlaw (1990, 1996) and Charles Mills (1998) rely on the widespread
folk theory of race while rejecting its scientific foundation upon
racial naturalism. <em>Interactive kind constructivism</em> goes
further, in arguing that being ascribed to a certain racial category
causes the individuals so labeled to have certain common experiences
(Mallon 2006, 535; Piper 1992). So for instance, if society ascribes
you as black, you are likely to experience difficulty hailing cabs in
New York or are more likely to be apprehended without cause by the
police (James 2004, 17). Finally, <em>institutional constructivism</em>
emphasizes race as a social institution, whose character is specific to
the society in which it is embedded and thus cannot be applied across
cultures or historical epochs (Mallon 2006, 536). Michael Root (2000,
632) notes that a person ascribed as black in the United States would
likely not be considered black in Brazil, since each country has very
different social institutions regarding the division of humanity into
distinct races. Similarly, Paul Taylor (2000) responds to
Appiah’s racial skepticism by holding that races, even if
biologically unreal, remain real social objects (Mallon 2006, 536–537).
Indeed, in a later work Taylor (2004) argues that the term
“race” has a perfectly clear referent, that being those
people socially ascribed to certain racial categories within the United
States, regardless of the widespread social rejection of biological
racial naturalism.</p>

<p>

The third school of thought regarding the ontology of race is
<em>racial population naturalism</em>. This camp suggests that,
although racial naturalism falsely attributed cultural, mental, and
physical characters to discrete racial groups, it is possible that
genetically significant biological groupings could exist that would
merit the term races. Importantly, these biological racial groupings
would not be essentialist or discrete: there is no set of genetic or
other biological traits that all and only all members of a racial group
share that would then provide a natural biological boundary between
racial groups. Thus, these thinkers confirm the strong scientific
consensus that discrete, essentialist races do not exist. However, the
criteria of discreteness and essentialism would also invalidate
distinctions between non-human species, such as lions and tigers. As
Philip Kitcher puts it, “there is no…genetic
feature…that separates one species of mosquito or mushroom from
another” (Kitcher 2007, 294–6; Cf. Mallon 2007, 146–168). Rather,
biological species are differentiated by reproductive isolation, which
is relative, not absolute (since hybrids sometimes appear in nature);
which may have non-genetic causes (e.g., geographic separation and
incompatible reproduction periods or rituals); which may generate
statistically significant if not uniform genetic differences; and which
may express distinct phenotypes. In effect, if the failure to satisfy
the condition of discreteness and essentialism requires jettisoning the
concept of race, then it also requires jettisoning the concept of
biological species. But because the biological species concept remains
epistemologically useful, some biologists and philosophers use it to
defend a racial ontology that is “biologically informed but
non-essentialist,” one that is vague, non-discrete, and related
to genetics, genealogy, geography, and phenotype (Sesardic 2010,
146).</p>

<p>

There are three versions of racial population naturalism: cladistic
race; socially isolated race; and genetically clustered race.
<em>Cladistic races</em> are “ancestor-descendant sequences of
breeding populations that share a common origin” (Andreasen 2004,
425). They emerged during human evolution, as different groups of
humans became geographically isolated from each other, and may be dying
out, if they have not already, due to more recent human reproductive
intermingling (Andreasen 1998, 214–6; Cf. Andreasen 2000, S653–S666).
<em>Socially isolated race</em> refers to the fact that legal sanctions
against miscegenation might have created a genetically isolated African
American race in the USA (Kitcher 1999). Finally, defenders of
<em>genetically clustered race</em> argue that although only 7% of the
differences between any two individuals regarding any one specific gene
can be attributed to their membership in one of the commonly recognized
racial categories, the aggregation of several genes is statistically
related to a small number of racial categories associated with major
geographic regions and phenotypes (Sesardic 2010; Kitcher 2007,
304).</p>

<p>

The question is whether these new biological ontologies of race
avoid the conceptual mismatches that ground eliminativism. The short
answer is that they can, but only through human intervention. Socially
isolated race faces no mismatch when applied to African Americans,
defined as the descendants of African slaves brought to the United
States. However, this racial category would not encompass black
Africans. Moreover, because African American race originated in legally
enforced sexual segregation, it is “both biologically real and
socially constructed” (Kitcher 2007, 298). Genetic clustering
would seem to provide an objective, biological foundation for a broader
racial taxonomy, but differences in clustered genes are continuous, not
discrete, and thus scientists must decide where to draw the line
between one genetically clustered race and another. If they program
their computers to distinguish four genetic clusters, then European,
Asian, Amerindian, and African groups will emerge; if only two clusters
are sought, then only the African and Amerindian “races”
remain (Kitcher 2007, 304). Thus, genetic clustering avoids racial
mismatch only through the decisions of the scientist analyzing the
data. The same problem also confronts cladistic race, since the number
of races will vary from nine, at the most recent period of evolutionary
reproductive isolation, to just one, if we go back to the very
beginning, since all humans were originally Africans. But in addition,
cladistic race faces a stronger mismatch by
“cross-classifying” groups that we typically think of as
part of the same race, for example by linking northeast Asians more
closely with Europeans than with more phenotypically similar southeast
Asians. Robin Andreasen defends the cladistic race concept by correctly
arguing that folk theories of race have themselves generated
counter-intuitive cross-classifications, particularly with respect to
the Census’s Asian category, which previously excluded Asian
Indians and now excludes native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders.
(Andreasen 2005, 100–101; Andreasen 2004, 430–1; Cf. Glasgow 2003,
456–74; Glasgow 2009, 91–108). But this hardly saves her argument, since the US
Census’s history of shifting racial categories and past use of
ethnic and religious terms (e.g., Filipino, Hindu, and Korean) to
signify races is typically taken as evidence of the <em>social</em>,
rather than biological, foundations of race (Espiritu 1992, Chapter
5).</p>

<p>

In each case, racial population naturalism encounters problems in
trying to demarcate discrete boundaries between different biological
populations. If discreteness is indispensable to a human racial
taxonomy, then mismatches can only be avoided, if at all, through human
intervention. But as noted above, biological species are also not
genetically discrete, and thus boundaries between non-human species
must also be imposed through human intervention. And just as the
demarcation of non-human species is justified through its scientific
usefulness, so too are human racial categories justified. For instance,
Andreason contends that a cladistic race concept that divides
northeastern from southeastern Asians is scientifically useful for
evolutionary research, even if it conflicts with the folk concept of a
unified Asian race. In turn, the concepts of genetically clustered and
socially isolated race may remain useful for detecting and treating
some health problems. Ian Hacking provides a careful argument in favor
of the provisional use of American racial categories in medicine.
Noting that racial categories do not reflect essentialist, uniform
differences, he reiterates the finding that there are statistically
significant genetic differences among different racial groups. As a
result, an African American is more likely to find a bone marrow match
from a pool of African American donors than from a pool of white
donors. Thus, he defends the practice of soliciting African American
bone marrow donors, even though this may provide fodder to racist
groups who defend an essentialist and hierarchical conception of
biological race (Hacking 2005, 102–116; Cf. Kitcher 2007, 312–316).
Conversely, Dorothy Roberts emphasizes the dangers of using racial
categories within medicine, suggesting that it not only validates
egregious ideas of biological racial hierarchy but also contributes to
conservative justifications for limiting race-based affirmative action
and even social welfare funding, which supposedly would be wasted on
genetically inferior minority populations. In effect, race-based
medicine raises the specter of a new political synthesis of colorblind
conservatism with biological racialism (Roberts 2008, 537–545).
However, Roberts’s critique fails to engage the literature on the
statistical significance of racial categories for genetic differences.
Moreover, she herself acknowledges that many versions of colorblind
conservatism do not rely at all on biological justifications.</p>

<h2><a name="RacVerEth">3. Race versus Ethnicity</a></h2>

<p>

Stephen Cornell and Douglas Hartmann (1998) provide a helpful
discussion of the differences between the concepts of race and
ethnicity. Relying on social constructivism, they define race as
“a human group defined by itself or others as distinct by virtue
of perceived common physical characteristics that are held to be
inherent…Determining which characteristics constitute the
race…is a choice human beings make. Neither markers nor
categories are predetermined by any biological factors” (Cornell
and Hartmann 1998, 24). Ethnicity, conversely, is defined as a sense of
common ancestry based on cultural attachments, past linguistic
heritage, religious affiliations, claimed kinship, or some physical
traits (1998, 19). Racial identities are typically thought of as
encompassing multiple ethnic identities (Cornell and Hartmann 1998,
26). Thus, people who are racially categorized as black may possess a
variety of ethnic identities based either on African national or
cultural markers (e.g., Kenyan, Igbo, Zulu) or the newer national,
sub-national, or trans-national identities created through the mixing
of enslaved populations in the Americas (e.g., African American,
Haitian, West Indian).</p>

<p>

Cornell and Hartmann outline five additional characteristics that
distinguish race from ethnicity: racial identity is typically
externally imposed by outsiders, as when whites created the negro race
to homogenize the multiple ethnic groups they conquered in Africa or
brought as slaves to America; race is a result of early globalization,
when European explorers “discovered” and then conquered
peoples with radically different phenotypical traits; race typically
involves power relations, from the basic power to define the race of
others to the more expansive power to deprive certain racial groups of
social, economic, or political benefits; racial identities are
typically hierarchical, with certain races being perceived as superior
to others; and racial identity is perceived as inherent, something
individuals are born with (1998, 27–29).</p>

<p>

Race and ethnicity differ strongly in the level of agency that
individuals exercise in choosing their identity. Individuals rarely
have any choice over their racial identity, due to the immediate
visual impact of the physical traits associated with race. Individuals
are thought to exercise more choice over ethnic identification, since
the physical differences between ethnic groups are typically less
striking, and since individuals can choose whether or not to express
the cultural practices associated with ethnicity. So an individual who
phenotypically appears white with ancestors from Ireland can more
readily choose whether to assert their Irish identity (by celebrating
St. Patrick’s Day) than whether to choose their white identity
(Cornell and Hartmann 1998, 29–30).  Moreover, Mary Waters
(1990) argues that the high level of intermarriage among white
Americans from various national ancestries grants their children
significant “ethnic options” in choosing with which of
their multiple heritages to identify. Waters (1999) and Philip
Kasinitz (1992) document how phenotypically black West Indian
immigrants exercise agency in asserting their ethnic identity in order
to differentiate themselves from native-born African Americans, but
discrimination and violence aimed at all Blacks, regardless of
ethnicity, strongly constrains such agency.The greater constraints on
racial identity stem from the role of informal perceptions,
discriminatory social action, and formal laws imposing racial
identity, such as Census categorization (Nobles 2000), the infamous
“hypodescent” laws, which defined people as black if they
had one drop of African blood (Davis 1991), and judicial decisions
such as the “prerequisite cases,” which determined whether
specific immigrants could be classified as white and thus eligible for
naturalized citizenship (Lopez 1996).
</p>

<p>

The line between race and ethnicity gets blurred in the case of Asians
and Latinos in the United States. Yen Le Espiritu (1992) notes that
Asian American racial identity, which of course encompasses a
remarkable level of ethnic diversity, results from a combination of
external assignment and agency, as when Asians actively respond to
anti-Asian discrimination or violence through political action and a
sense of shared fate. Consequently, Espiritu uses the term
“panethnicity” to describe Asian American identity, a
concept which has racial connotations, given the role of “racial
lumping” together of members of diverse Asian ethnicities into a
single racial group defined by phenotypical traits.  Thus, she
declares that “African Americans [are] the earliest and most
developed pan-ethnic group in the United States” (1992,
174). Hispanic or Latino identity exhibits traits similar to
pan-ethnicity. Indeed, unlike Asian identity, Hispanic identity is not
even a formal racial identity under the Census. However, informal
perceptions, formal laws, and discrimination based on physical
appearance nevertheless tend to lump together various nationalities
and ethnicities that share some connection to Latin America (Rodriquez
2000). Moreover, scholars have noted that Jews (Brodkin 1998) and the
Irish (Ignatiev 1995) were once were considered distinct, non-white
races but are now considered to be racially white ethnic groups,
partly by exercising agency in distancing themselves from African
Americans exercising political power. Thus, it is conceivable that
groups today considered to be sociological racial groups could
transform into something more like an ethnic group. For this reason,
Blum describes Hispanics and Asians as incompletely racialized groups
(Blum 2002, 149–155).</p>

<p>
A robust philosophical debate has emerged regarding the status of
Hispanic or Latino identity. Jorge Gracia (2000) defends the utility
of Hispanic ethnic identity as grounded primarily in the shared,
linguistic culture that can be traced to the Iberian peninsula. Jorge
Garcia (2001, 2006) challenges this approach, arguing that the
diversity of individual experiences undermines the use of Hispanic
ethnicity as a meaningful form of collective identity. Linda Martin
Alcoff (2006) develops a “realist” defense of Latino identity against
charges of essentialism and views it as a category of solidarity that
develops in reaction to white privilege. Christina Beltran (2010), on
the other hand, does not try to paper over the diversity
within <em>Latinidad</em>, which she instead portrays as a
pluralistic, fragmented, and agonistic for of political action. </p>

<h2><a name="RacMorPolLeg">4. Race in Moral, Political and Legal Philosophy</a></h2>

<p>

Two strands in moral, political, and legal philosophy are pertinent to
the concept of race. One strand examines the broader conceptual and
methodological questions regarding the moral status of race and how to
theorize racial justice; the other strand normatively assesses
specific policies or institutional forms that seek to redress racial
inequality, such as affirmative action, racially descriptive
representation, the general question of colorblindness in law and
policy, residential racial segregation, and racism in the criminal
justice system and policing.</p>

<p>
Lawrence Blum, Anthony Appiah, and Tommie Shelby articulate
indispensable positions in addressing the moral status of the concept
of race. Blum (2002) examines both the concept of race and the problem
of racism. He argues that “racism” be restricted to two
referents: <em>inferiorization</em>, or the denigration of a group due
to its putative biological inferiority; and <em>antipathy</em>, or the
“bigotry, hostility, and hatred” towards another group
defined by its putatively inherited physical traits (2002, 8). These
two moral sins deserve this heightened level of condemnation associated
with the term racism, because they violate moral norms of
“respect, equality, and dignity” and because they are
historically connected to extreme and overt forms of racial oppression
(2002, 27). But because these connections make “racism” so
morally loaded a term, it should not be applied to “lesser racial
ills and infractions” that suggest mere ignorance, insensitivity
or discomfort regarding members of different groups (28), since doing
so will apply a disproportionate judgment against the person so named,
closing off possible avenues for fruitful moral dialogue.</p>

<p>

Due to the historical connection between racism and extreme oppression,
Blum argues against using the term race, since he rejects its
biological foundation. Instead, he advocates using the term
“racialized group” to denote those socially constructed
identities whose supposedly inherited common physical traits are used
to impose social, political, and economic costs. To Blum,
“racialized group” creates distance from the biological
conception of race and it admits of degrees, as in the case of Latinos,
whom Blum describes as an “incompletely racialized group”
(2002, 151). This terminological shift, and its supposed revelation of
the socially constructed character of physiognomically defined
identities, need not require the rejection of group-specific policies
such as affirmative action. Members of sociologically constructed
racialized identities suffer real harms, and laws might have to
distinguish individuals according to their racialized identities in
order to compensate for such harms. Nevertheless, Blum remains
ambivalent about such measures, arguing that even when necessary they
remain morally suspect (2002, 97).</p>

<p>

Similar ambivalence is also expressed by Anthony Appiah, earlier
discussed regarding the metaphysics of race. While his metaphysical
<em>racial skepticism</em> was cited as grounding his normative
position of <em>eliminativism</em>, Appiah is “against
races” but “for racial identities” (1996). Because of
a wide social consensus that races exist, individuals are ascribed to
races regardless of their individual choices or desires. Moreover,
racial identity remains far more salient and costly than ethnic
identity (1996, 80–81). As a result, mobilization along racial lines is
justifiable, in order to combat racism. But even at this point, Appiah
still fears that racial identification may constrain individual
autonomy by requiring members of racial groups to behave according to
certain cultural norms or “scripts” that have become
dominant within a specific racial group. Appiah thus concludes,
“Racial identity can be the basis of resistance to racism; but
even as we struggle against racism…let us not let our racial
identities subject us to new tyrannies” (1996, 104). This
residual ambivalence, to recall the metaphysical discussions of the
last section, perhaps ground Mallon’s contention that Appiah
remains an <em>eliminativist</em> rather than a <em>racial
constructivist</em>, since ideally Appiah would prefer to be free of
all residual constraints entailed by even socially constructed races.</p>

<p>

Tommie Shelby responds to the ambivalence of Appiah and Blum by
distinguishing <em>classical black nationalism</em>, which rested upon
an organic black identity, with <em>pragmatic black nationalism</em>,
based on an instrumental concern with combating anti-black racism
(2005, 38–52; 2003, 666–668). Pragmatic nationalism allows
blacks to generate solidarity across class or cultural lines, not just
through the <em>modus vivendi</em> of shared interests but upon a
principled commitment to racial equality and justice (2005,
150–154). As a result, black solidarity is grounded upon a
principled response to common oppression, rather than some putative
shared identity (2002), thus mitigating the dangers of biological
essentialism and tyrannical cultural conformity that Appiah associates
with race and racial identities. Anna Stubblefield (2005) provides an
alternative defense of Black solidarity by comparing it to familial
commitments.</p>

<p>
Shelby (2005, 7) briefly mentions that his pragmatic, political
version of black solidarity is compatible with John
Rawls's <em>Political Liberalism</em>, but his more detailed defense
of the ideal social contract method of Rawls's <em>A Theory of
Justice</em> for theorizing racial justice has drawn substantial
controversy (Shelby 2004). Elizabeth Anderson eshews ideal theory for
analyzing racial justice because it assumes motivational and cognitive
capacities beyond those of ordinary humans; it risks promoting ideal
norms (like colorblindness) under unjust conditions that require
race-specific policies; and its idealizing assumptions, like an
original position in which parties do not know relevant personal and
social racial facts, precludes recognition of historical and present
racial injustice. She instead uses a normative framework of democratic
equality to ground her moral imperative of integration.</p>

<p>
Charles Mills, extending his critique of how early modern social
contract thinking obfuscates racial injustice (1997), fears that
Rawls's ideal theory can similarly serve as an ideology that
whitewashes non-white oppression (Mills 2013). But rather than
jettisoning a contractarian approach entirely, Mills instead develops
a model of a non-ideal contract, in which the parties do not know
their own racial identities but are aware of their society's history
of racial exploitation and its effects. Because the parties know of
racial hierarchy but do not know if they will be its beneficiaries or
victims, Mills hypothesizes that they will rationally agree to racial
reparations as a form of corrective or rectificatory justice (Pateman
and Mills 2007, Chapters 3, 4, 8).</p>

<p>
Shelby responds that, while Rawls's ideal theory of justice excludes a
theory of rectification because it is not comprehensive, rectificatory
justice is not only complementary but in fact presupposes an ideal
theory that can clarify when injustices have occurred and need to be
rectified. More importantly, Shelby suggests that complying with
rectificatory justice through racial reparations could well leave
blacks living in a society that nevertheless remains racially unjust
in other ways. For this reason, Shelby concludes that ideal theory
remains indispensable (2013).</p>

<p>
Christopher Lebron (2013, 28–42) also suggests that the approaches of
Rawls land Mils are complementary, but in a very different way. He
argues that Rawls's focus on the basic structure of society provides
explanatory mechanisms through which white supremacy persists,
something unspecified in earlier work by Mills (2003). And in sharp
contract to Shelby(2013), Lebron criticizes Mills for rehabilitating
Rawlsian contract thinking, since even a non-ideal form eliminates the
epistemological advantage of a non-white perspective on white
supremacy. Instead of reformulating contractarian thinking to fit the
needs of racial justice, Lebron instead focuses on analyzing how
“historically evolved power” and “socially embedded power” perpetuate
racial injustice.</p>

<p>

Turning to the second strand of practical philosophy devoted to race,
various scholars have addressed policies such as affirmative action,
race-conscious electoral districting, and colorblindness in policy and
law. The literature on affirmative action is immense, and may be
divided into approaches that focus on compensatory justice,
distributive justice, critiques of the concept of merit, and diversity
of perspective. Alan Goldman (1979) generally argues against
affirmative action, since jobs or educational opportunities as a rule
should go to those most qualified. Only when a specific individual has
been victimized by racial or other discrimination can the otherwise
irrelevant factor of race be used as a compensatory measure to award a
position or a seat at a university. Ronald Fiscus (1992) rejects the
compensatory scheme in favor of a distributive justice argument. He
claims that absent the insidious and invidious effects of a racist
society, success in achieving admissions to selective universities or
attractive jobs would be randomly distributed across racial lines.
Thus, he concludes that distributive justice requires the racially
proportional distribution of jobs and university seats. Of course,
Fiscus’s argument displaces the role of merit in the awarding of
jobs or university admissions, but this point is addressed by Iris
Young (1990, Chapter 7), who argues that contemporary criteria of
merit, such as standardized testing and educational achievement, are
biased against disadvantaged racial and other groups, and rarely are
functionally related to job performance or academic potential. Finally,
Michel Rosenfeld (1991) turns away from substantive theories of justice
in favor of a conception of justice as reversibility, a position
influenced by the “Discourse Ethics” of Jürgen
Habermas (1990), which defines justice not by the proper substantive
awarding of goods but as the result of a fair discursive procedure that
includes all relevant viewpoints and is free of coercive power
relations. Thus, affirmative action is justified as an attempt to
include racially diverse viewpoints. All of these positions are
summarily discussed in a useful debate format in Cohen and Sterba
(2003).</p>

<p>

The issues of race-conscious electoral districting and descriptive
racial representation have also garnered substantial
attention. Race-conscious districting is the practice of drawing
geographically based electoral districts in which the majority of
voters are Black. Descriptive racial representation holds that Blacks
are best represented by Black politicians. Iris Marion Young (1990,
183–191) provides a spirited defense of descriptive
representation for racial minorities, grounded in their experiences of
“oppression, the institutional constraint on
self-determination”, and domination “the institutional
constraint on self-determination” (1990, 37). Anne Phillips
(1995) furthers this position, arguing that representatives who are
members of minority racial groups can enhance legislative
deliberation. Melissa Williams (1998) also defends the deliberative
contribution of descriptive racial representation, but adds that
minority constituents are more likely to trust minority
representatives, since both will be affected by laws that overtly or
covertly discriminate against minority racial groups.  Finally, Jane
Mansbridge (1999) carefully demonstrates why a critical mass of
minority representatives is needed, in order to adequately advocate
for common minority interests as well as to convey the internal
diversity within the group. In a later work, Young (2000) addresses
critics who argue that descriptive representation relies upon group
essentialism, since members of a racial group need not all share the
same interests or opinions. In response, Young suggests that members
of the same racial group do share the same “social
perspective” grounded in common experiences, similar to the
<em>interactive kind</em> variant of <em>racial constructivism</em>
discussed earlier. But because it is unclear that Black individuals
are more likely to share common experiences than common interests or
opinions, Michael James prioritizes using race-conscious districting
to create Black racial constituencies which can hold Black or
non-Black representatives accountable to Black interests (James
2011). Abigail Thernstrom (1987) condemns race-conscious districting
for violating the original principles behind the 1965 Voting Rights
Act and the 15<sup>th</sup> Amendment, by promoting the election of
black representatives rather than simply guaranteeing black voters the
right to cast ballots. J. Morgan Kousser (1999) responds that
race-conscious districting simply reflects the right to cast a
“meaningful” vote, as implied by the 15<sup>th</sup>
Amendment protection against not only the denial but also the
“abridgment” of the right to vote. Lani Guinier (1994)
compellingly suggests that instead of drawing majority black
districts, we should adopt more proportional electoral system that
facilitate the electoral strength of racial and other
minorities. Michael James (2004) suggests that alternative electoral
systems facilitate not only descriptive racial representation but also
democratic deliberation across racial lines.</p>

<p>

A general advantage of using alternative electoral systems to enhance
minority racial representation is that they are technically
colorblind: they do not require lawmakers or judges to group citizens
according to their racial identities. The general value of
colorblindness is an ongoing topic of debate within legal
philosophy. Drawing on Justice John Marshall Harlan's famous dissent
in <em>Plessy v. Ferguson</em>, and a not-uncontroversial
interpretation of the origins of the equal protection clause, Andrew
Kull (1992) argues that contemporary American statutory and
constitutional law should strive to be colorblind and combat racial
inequality without dividing citizens into different racial
groups. Haney Lopez (2006, 143–162), on the other hand, fears
“colorblind white dominance,” whereby facially
race-neutral laws leave untouched the race-based inequality that
operates within American political, legal, and economic structures.
Elizabeth Anderson (2010) provides a trenchant critique of
colorblindness as a normative standard for law, policy, or
ethics. Moreover, she provides a compelling philosophical analysis of
the origins and moral status of contemporary racial segregation, a
topic that, apart from the work of Owen Fiss (2003), has garnered much
less philosophical attention than affirmative action and racially
descriptive representation.</p>

<p>

In recent years, the problem of racism within policing and criminal
justice in the United States has attracted intense popular and
scholarly attention. Michelle Alexander (2010) famously depicted the
contemporary American criminal justice system as the “New Jim Crow,”
for its intense racial disparities. Naomi Zack (2015) provides a
trenchant critique of racial profiling and police homicide. David
Boonin (2011), on the other hand, reluctantly defends racial profiling
on pragmatic grounds.</p>
