<h1>Medieval Theories of Modality</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Wed Jun 30, 1999; substantive revision Wed Apr 19, 2017</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
There are four modal paradigms in ancient philosophy: the frequency
interpretation of modality, the model of possibility as a potency, the
model of antecedent necessities and possibilities with respect to a
certain moment of time (diachronic modalities), and the model of
possibility as non-contradictoriness. None of these conceptions, which
were well known to early medieval thinkers through the works of
Boethius, was based on the idea of modality as involving reference to
simultaneous alternatives. This new paradigm was introduced into
Western thought in early twelfth-century discussions influenced by
Augustine’s theological conception of God as acting by choice
between alternative histories.</p>

<p>
While the new idea of associating modal terms with simultaneous
alternatives was used also in thirteenth-century theology, it was not
often discussed in philosophical contexts. The increasing acceptance
of Aristotle’s philosophy in the thirteenth century gave support
to traditional modal paradigms, as is seen in Robert Kilwardby’s
influential commentary on Aristotle’s <em>Prior Analytics</em>,
in which modal syllogistic is treated as an essentialist theory of the
structures of being. There were analogous discussions of philosophical
and theological modalities in Arabic philosophy. Arabic modal theories
influenced Latin discussions mainly through the translations of
Averroes’s works.</p>

<p>
John Duns Scotus developed the conception of modality as
alternativeness into a detailed theory. A logically possible state of
affairs is something to which to be is not repugnant, though it may
not be compossible with other possibilities. Scotus’s modal
semantics influenced early fourteenth-century philosophy and theology
in many ways. Thirteenth-century essentialist assumptions were dropped
from modal syllogistic, the Aristotelian version of which was regarded
as a fragmentary theory without a sufficient explication of the
various fine structures of modal propositions.</p>

<h2><a id="AspAncModPar">1. Aspects of Ancient Modal Paradigms</a></h2>

<p>
In speaking about the general features of the universe, ancient
philosophers were inclined to think that all generic possibilities
will be actualized, a habit of thinking called the principle of
plenitude by Arthur O. Lovejoy (1936). Correspondingly, it was natural
for them to think that the invariant structures of reality are
necessary. This line of thought is found, e.g., in Plato’s
doctrine of the ideas which are exhaustively imitated in the world by
the Demiurge, in Aristotle’s theory of the priority of actuality
over potentiality, in the Stoic doctrine of the rational world-order
and the eternal cosmic cycle, as well as in Plotinus’
metaphysics of emanation (Knuuttila 1993).</p>

<p>
In these approaches to the constituents of the universe, modal notions
could be understood in accordance with the so-called
‘statistical’ or ‘temporal frequency’ model of
modality where the meaning of modal terms is spelled out extensionally
as follows: what is necessary is always actual, what is impossible is
never actual and what is possible is at least sometimes actual. The
term ‘statistical interpretation of modality’ was
introduced into the modern discussion by Oscar Becker (1952), and it
has been applied since in descriptions of certain ways of thinking in
the history of philosophy as well, particularly by Jaakko Hintikka
(1973).</p>

<p>
Even though Aristotle did not define modal terms with the help of
extensional notions, examples of this habit of thought can be found in
his discussion of eternal beings, the natures of things, the types of
events, and generic statements about such things. Modal terms refer to
the one and only world of ours and classify the types of things and
events on the basis of their actuality. This paradigm suggests that
actualization is the general criterion of the genuineness of
possibilities, but the deterministic implications of this view
compelled Aristotle to seek ways of speaking about unrealized singular
possibilities. Diodorus Chronus (fl. 300 BCE) was a determinist who
found no problem in this way of thinking. Some commentators have
argued that Aristotle’s views showing similarities to the
statistical model are based on special metaphysical and ontological
doctrines and not on his conception of modal terms themselves.
However, it is not clear that Aristotle had any such distinction in
mind. (For different interpretations and evaluations of the role of
this model in Aristotle, see Hintikka 1973, Sorabji 1980, Seel 1982,
Waterlow 1982a, van Rijen 1989, Gaskin 1995.) In <em>Posterior
Analytics</em> I.6 Aristotle states that certain predicates may belong
to their subjects at all times without belonging to them necessarily.
Some ancient commentators took this to mean that Aristotle operated
with a distinction between strong essential <em>per se</em>
necessities and weak accidental necessities in the sense of
non-essential invariances, such as inseparable accidents (see also
Porphyry, <em>Isagoge</em> 3.5–6), and that this distinction
played an important role in his modal syllogistic. See the
commentaries on the <em>Prior Analytics</em> by Alexander of
Aphrodisias (36.25–32; 201.21–24) and Philoponus
(43.8–18; 126.7–29); Flannery 1995, 62–65,
99–106. This was also the view of Averroes and some Latin
authors in the Middle Ages. (See below.)</p>

<p>
Another Aristotelian modal paradigm was that of possibility as
potency. In <em>Met</em>. V.12 and IX.1 potency is said to be the
principle of motion or change either as the activator or as the
receptor of a relevant influence. (For agent and patient in
Aristotle’s natural philosophy in general, see Waterlow 1982b.)
The types of potency-based possibilities belonging to a species are
recognized as possibilities because of their actualization — no
natural potency type remains eternally frustrated. Aristotle says that
when the agent and the patient come together as being capable, the one
must act and the other must be acted on (<em>Met</em>. IX.5).</p>

<p>
In <em>De Caelo</em> I.12 Aristotle supposes, <em>per
impossibile</em>, that a thing has contrary potencies, one of which is
always actualized. He argues that the alleged unactualized potencies
are not potencies at all because they cannot be assumed to be realized
at any time without contradiction. Aristotle applies here the model of
possibility as non-contradictoriness which is defined in <em>Prior
Analytics</em> I.13 as follows: when a possibility is assumed to be
realized, it results in nothing impossible. In speaking about the
assumed non-contradictory actualization of a possibility, Aristotle
thinks that it is realized in the real history. This argument excludes
those potentialities which remain eternally unrealized from the set of
genuine possibilities. Aristotle applies here and in some other places
(for example, <em>Met</em> IX.4, <em>An. pr.</em> I.15) a
<em>reductio</em> argument which consists of a modal inference rule
L(p → q) → (Mp  → Mq) and
the assumption that the possibility is realized (Rosen and Malink
2012; Smith 2016). The argument has created much controversy about how
possibilities are supposed to obtain. See Judson 1983; Rini 2011,
135–156.) </p>

<p>
Aristotle refers to potencies in criticizing some of his
contemporaries who claimed that only that which takes place is
possible (<em>Met</em>. IX.3). The model of possibility as potency
<em>prima facie</em> allowed him to speak about all kinds of
unrealized singular possibilities by referring to passive or active
potencies, but taken separately they represent partial possibilities
which do not guarantee that their actualization can take place. More
is required for a real singular possibility, but when the further
requirements are added, such as a contact between the active and
passive factor and the absence of an external hindrance, the potency
model suggests that the potency can really be actualized only when it
is actualized (<em>Met</em>. IX.5, <em>Phys</em>. VIII.1). It is
possible that this led Aristotle to define motion
(<em>kinêsis</em>) as the actuality of the potentiality (of the
end) <em>qua</em> potentiality (<em>Phys</em>. III.1), but this did
not explain the possibility of beginning (Hintikka et al. 1977).</p>

<p>
In discussing future contingent statements in In Chapter 9 of <em>De
interpretatione</em>, Aristotle says that what is necessarily is when
it is, but he then qualifies this necessity of the present with the
remark that it does not follow that what is actual is necessary
without qualification. If he meant that the temporal necessity of a
present event does not imply that such an event necessarily takes
place in circumstances of that type, this is an unsatisfactory
‘statistical’ attempt to avoid the problem that
changeability as a criterion of contingency makes all temporally
definite singular events necessary (Hintikka 1973). Another
interpretation is that Aristotle wanted to show that the necessity of
an event at a certain time does not imply that it would have been
antecedently necessary. Aristotle discusses such singular diachronic
modalities in some places (<em>Met</em>. VI.3; <em>EN</em> III.5,
1114a17–21; <em>De int</em>. 19a13–17) in which he seems
to assume that the conditions which at
<em>t</em><sub><small>1</small></sub> are necessary for <em>p</em> to
obtain at a later time <em>t</em><sub><small>2</small></sub> are not
necessarily sufficient for this, although they might be sufficient for
the possibility (at <em>t</em><sub><small>1</small></sub>) that
<em>p</em> obtains at <em>t</em><sub><small>2</small></sub>. Aristotle
did not elaborate these ideas, which might have been his most
promising attempt to formulate a theory of unrealized singular
possibilities. (The importance of this model is particularly stressed
in Waterlow 1982a; see also von Wright 1984; Weidemann 1986; Gaskin
1995.)</p>

<p>
Aristotle’s conceptual difficulties can be seen from his various
attempts to characterize the possibilities based on dispositional
properties such as heatable, separable, or countable. Analogous
discussions were not unusual in later ancient philosophy. In
Philo’s definition of possibility (ca. 300 BCE), the existence
of a passive potency was regarded as a sufficient ground for speaking
about a singular possibility. The Stoics revised this definition by
adding the condition of the absence of external hindrance, thinking
that otherwise the alleged possibility could not be realized. They did
not add that an activator is needed as well, because then the
difference between potentiality and actuality would disappear.
According to the deterministic world view of the Stoics, fate as a
kind of active potency necessitates everything, but they did not
accept the Master Argument of Diodorus Cronus for determinism, which
was meant to show that there cannot be possibilities which will not be
realized. The number of passive potencies with respect to a definite
future instant of time is greater than what will be realized. As long
as these possibilities are not prevented from being realized by other
things, they in some sense represent open possibilities. Alexander of
Aphrodisias thought that it was misleading to speak about about
unrealized diachronic possibilities if everything is determined. He
argued for what he took to be Aristotle’s view, namely that
there are undetermined prospective alternatives which remain open
options until the moment of time to which they refer. (See Sharples
1983; Bobzien 1993, 1998; Hankinson 1998.) Neither Aristotle nor later
ancient thinkers had any considered conception of simultaneous
alternatives. They thought that what is necessarily is when it is, and
that the alternative possibilities disappear when the future is fixed.
Alexander’s Peripatetic theory of alternative prospective
possibilities could be characterized as the model of diachronic
modalities without simultaneous alternatives: there are transient
singular alternative possibilities, but those which will not be
realized vanish instead of remaining unrealized.</p>

<p>
Aristotle often made use of indirect arguments from false or
impossible positions by adding hypotheses which he himself labelled as
impossible. In order to defend Aristotle’s procedure against
ancient critics, Alexander of Aphrodisias characterized these
hypotheses as impossibilities which were not nonsensical. (For this
controversy, see Kukkonen 2002.) Some late ancient authors were
interested in impossible hypotheses as tools for conceptual analysis.
In the arguments which were called Eudemian procedures something
impossible was assumed in order to see what followed. The
impossibilities discussed in this way by Philoponus and Boethius show
similarities with Porphyry’s characterization of inseparable
accidents as something which cannot occur separately but can be
separated in thought. These hypotheses were not regarded as
formulations of possibilities in the sense of what could be actual;
they were counterpossible and not merely counterfactual (Martin
1999).</p>

<p>
There are several recent works on Aristotle’s modal
syllogistics, but no generally accepted historical reconstruction
which would make it a coherent theory. It was apparently based on
various assumptions which were not fully compatible (Hintikka 1973,
Smith 1989, Striker 2009). Some commentators have been interested in
finding coherent layers of the theory by explicating them in terms of
Aristotle’s other views (van Rijen 1989; Patterson 1995). There
are also several formal reconstructions such as Rini 2011 (modern
predicate logic), Ebert and Nortmann 2007 (possible worlds semantics),
various set-theoretical approaches discussed in Johnson 2004, and
Malink 2006, 2013 (mereological semantics).</p>

<h2><a id="EarMedDev">2. Early Medieval Developments</a></h2>

<p>
Early medieval thinkers were well acquainted with ancient modal
conceptions through Boethius’ works. One of the Aristotelian
modal paradigms occurring in Boethius is that of possibility as
potency (<em>potestas</em>, <em>potentia</em>). According to Boethius,
when the term ‘possibility’ (<em>possibilitas</em>) is
used in the sense of ‘potency’, it refers to real powers
or tendencies, the ends of which are either actual or non-actual at
the moment of utterance. Some potencies are never unrealized. They are
said to be necessarily actual. When potencies are not actualized,
their ends are said to exist potentially (<em>In Periherm</em>.
II.453–455). Necessarily actual potencies leave no room for the
potencies of their contraries, for they would remain unrealized
forever and the constitution of nature does not include elements which
would be in vain (<em>In Periherm</em>. II. 236). The potencies of
non-necessary features of being do not exclude contrary potencies.
They are not always and universally actualized, but as potency-types
even these potencies are taken to satisfy the actualization criterion
of genuineness (<em>In Periherm</em>. I.120–1; II.237).</p>

<p>
Boethius’ view that the types of potencies and potency based
possibilities are sometimes actualized is in agreement with the
Aristotelian frequency interpretation of modality. This is another
Boethian conception of necessity and possibility. He thought that
modal notions can be regarded as tools for expressing temporal or
generic frequencies. According to the temporal version, what always is
is by necessity, and what never is is impossible. Possibility is
interpreted as expressing what is at least sometimes actual.
Correspondingly, a generic property of a species is possible only if
it is exemplified at least in one member of that species (<em>In
Periherm</em>. I.120–1, 200–201; II.237).</p>

<p>
Like Aristotle, Boethius often treated statement-making utterances as
temporally indeterminate sentences. The same sentence can be uttered
at different times, and many of these temporally indeterminate
sentences may sometimes be true and sometimes false, depending on the
circumstances at the moment of utterance. If the state of affairs the
actuality of which makes the sentence true is omnitemporally actual,
the sentence is true whenever it is uttered. In this case, it is
necessarily true. If the state of affairs associated with an
assertoric sentence is always non-actual, the sentence is always false
and therefore impossible. A sentence is possible only if what is
asserted is not always non-actual (I.124-125). Quasi-statistical ideas
are also employed in Ammonius’ Greek commentary on
Aristotle’s <em>De interpretatione</em> which shares some
sources with Boethius’s work (88.12–28) and in Alexander
of Aphrodisias’ commentary on Aristotle’s modal
syllogistic. (See Mueller 1999, 23–31.)</p>

<p>
In dealing with Chapter 9 of Aristotle’s <em>De
interpretatione</em>, Boethius argues (II.241) that because</p>

<blockquote>
(1) M(<em>p</em><sub><em>t</em></sub> &amp; ¬
<em>p</em><sub><em>t</em></sub>)
<br />
(1′) It is possible that <em>p</em> obtains at <em>t</em> and
not-<em>p</em> obtains at <em>t</em>
</blockquote>

<p>
is not acceptable, one should also deny</p>

<blockquote>
(2) <em>p</em><sub><em>t</em></sub> &amp;
M<sub><em>t</em></sub> ¬<em>p</em><sub><em>t</em></sub>
<br />
(2′) <em>p</em> obtains at <em>t</em> and it is possible at
<em>t</em> that not-<em>p</em> obtains at <em>t</em>.
</blockquote>

<p>
The denial of (2) is equivalent to</p>

<blockquote>
(3) <em>p</em><sub><em>t</em></sub> → 
L<sub><em>t</em></sub> <em>p</em><sub><em>t</em></sub>
<br />
(3′) If <em>p</em> obtains at <em>t</em> then it is necessary at
<em>t</em> that <em>p</em> obtains at <em>t</em>.
</blockquote>

<p>
(2) was generally denied in ancient philosophy and its denial was
taken as an axiom by Boethius as well. Correspondingly, (3) shows how
the necessity of the present was understood in ancient thought.
Boethius thought that the temporal necessity of <em>p</em> can be
qualified by shifting attention from temporally definite cases or
statements to their temporally indeterminate counterparts
(I.121–122; II.242–243; cf. Ammonius 153.24–26).
This was one of Boethius’ interpretations of the Aristotelian
distinction between necessity now and necessity without qualification.
But he also made use of the diachronic model according to which the
necessity of <em>p</em> at <em>t</em> does not imply that, before
<em>t</em>, it was necessary that <em>p</em> obtains at
<em>t</em>.</p>

<p>
Boethius developed the diachronic ideas as part of his criticism of
Stoic determinism. If it is not true that everything is causally
necessitated, there must be genuine alternatives in the course of
events. Free choice was the source of contingency in which Boethius
was mainly interested, but he thought in addition that according to
the Peripatetic doctrine there is a real factor of indeterminacy in
the causal nexus of nature. When Boethius refers to chance, free
choice, and possibility in this context, his examples include
temporalized modal notions which refer to diachronic prospective
possibilities at a given moment of time. A temporally determinate
prospective possibility may not be realized at the time to which it
refers, in which case it ceases to be a possibility. Boethius did not
develop the idea of simultaneous alternatives which would remain
intact even when diachronic possibilities had vanished, insisting that
only what is actual at a certain time is at that time possible at that
time (cf. (3) above). But he also thought that there are objective
singular contingencies, so that the result of some prospective
possibilities is indefinite and uncertain ‘not only to us who
are ignorant, but to nature’ (<em>In Periherm</em>. I.106, 120;
II.190–192, 197–198, 203, 207). (For Boethius’s
modal conceptions, see Kretzmann 1985; Knuuttila 1993,
45–62.)</p>

<p>
As for the discussion of future contingent statements in <em>De
interpretatione</em> 9, Boethius’ view shows similarities to
that of Ammonius, both authors apparently having known some similar
Greek discussions. (Ammonius’s Greek commentary on <em>De
interpretatione</em> is translated by D. Blank and Boethius’s
two Latin commentaries by N. Kretzmann in the same volume, with essays
by R. Sorabji, N. Kretzmann and M. Mignucci, in 1998.) According to
the majority interpretation, Ammonius and Boethius ascribe to
Aristotle the view that the predictions of future contingent events
and their denials differ from other contradictory pairs of
propositions, because truth and falsity are not definitely distributed
between them and the propositions are consequently neither true nor
false. (For various interpretations of how Boethius restricted
bivalence, see Frede 1985; Craig 1988; Gaskin 1995, Kretzmann 1998.)
Another interpretation holds that future contingents are not
definitely true or false in Boethius’ view because their
truth-makers are not yet determined, but are true or false in an
indeterminate way. No qualification of the principle of bivalence is
involved (Mignucci 1989, 1998; for related interpretation of Ammonius,
see Seel 2000.) While most medieval thinkers regarded the latter view
as true, many of them thought that Aristotle’s opinion was
similar to the majority interpretation of Boethius. Peter Abelard and
John Buridan were among those who read Aristotle as holding that
future contingent propositions are true or false. Peter Auriol argued
that these propositions lack a truth-value; even God is aware of the
future in a way which does not imply bivalence. This was an
exceptional view. (See Normore 1982, 1993; Lewis 1987; Schabel 2000;
Knuuttila 2011.) Boethius, Aquinas, and many others thought that God
can know future contingents only because the flux of time is present
to divine eternity. Some late medieval thinkers, for example John Duns
Scotus and William of Ockham, found the idea of atemporal presence of
history to God problematic and tried to find other models for
foreknowledge. These discussions led to the so-called middle knowledge
theory of the counterfactuals of freedom (Craig 1988; Freddoso 1988;
Dekker 2000).</p>

<p>
From the point of view of the history of modal thought, interesting
things took place in theology in the eleventh and twelfth centuries.
Augustine had already criticized the application of the statistical
model of possibility to divine power; for him, God has freely chosen
the actual world and its providential plan from alternatives which he
could have realized but did not will to do (<em>potuit sed
noluit</em>). This way of thinking differs from ancient philosophical
modal paradigms, because the metaphysical basis is now the eternal
domain of simultaneous alternatives instead of the idea of one
necessary world order. In Augustine, God’s eternal ideas of
finite beings represent the possibilities of how the highest being can
be imitated, the possibilities thus having an ontological foundation
in God’s essence. This was the dominating conception of
theological modal metaphysics until Duns Scotus departed from it. The
discrepancy between the Catholic doctrine of God’s freedom and
power and the philosophical modal conceptions was brought into the
scope of discussion by Peter Damian and Anselm of Canterbury and was
developed in a more sophisticated way in twelfth-century
considerations of God’s power and providence and historical
contingencies. While the new idea of associating modal terms with
simultaneous alternatives continued to be used in thirteenth-century
theology, it was not often discussed in philosophical contexts. The
increasing acceptance of Aristotle’s philosophy gave support to
traditional modal paradigms in logical treatises on modalities, in
metaphysical theories of the principles of being, and in the
discussions of causes and effects in natural philosophy. (See
Holopainen 1996; Knuuttila 2001, 2008; 2012; for Arabic discussions;
see also Bäck 2001; Kukkonen 2000, 2002; for divine omnipotence,
see Moonan 1994; Gelber 2004, 309–349.) A typical example of the
Averroist frequency view of contingency is found in John of
Jandun’s <em>Questions on Aristotle’s De caelo</em>
I.34.</p>

<p>
In addition to Augustinian theological issues, one can find some
theoretical considerations of the new modal semantics in the twelfth
century. Even though Abelard made use of traditional modal concepts,
he was also interested in the philosophical significance of the idea
of modality as alternativeness. Assuming that what is actual is
temporally necessary at a certain point of time as no longer
avoidable, he adds that unrealized counterfactual alternatives are
possible at the same time in the sense that they could have happened
at that time. There are also merely imaginable alternatives, such as
Socrates’ being a bishop, which never had a real basis in
things. (See Martin 2001, 2003; Marenbon 2007, 156–158, is
sceptical about this interpretation.) Gilbert of Poitiers stressed the
idea that natural regularities which are called natural necessities
are not absolute, since they are freely chosen by God and can be
overridden by divine power. This basically Augustinian conception was
a widespread theological view, but in explaining Plato’s
‘Platonitas’ Gilbert argues that this includes all that
Plato was, is and will be as well as what he could be but never is
(<em>The Commentaries on Boethius</em> 144.77–78,
274.75–76). The modal element of the individual concept was
probably needed in order to speak about Plato in alternative possible
histories (Knuuttila 1993, 75–82).</p>

<p>
An interesting early thirteenth-century philosophical analysis of
Augustinian modalities was put forward by Robert Grosseteste (Lewis
1996). Grosseteste taught that while things are primarily called
necessary or possible ‘from eternity and without
beginning’ with respect to God’s eternal knowledge, there
are necessities and impossibilities with a beginning in God’s
providence which are eternal contingencies in the sense that God could
have chosen their opposites (<em>De libero arbitrio</em>
168.26–170.33, 178.24–29). One of the theses of
twelfth-century authors, later called <em>nominales</em>, was that
‘What is once true is always true’. It was argued that
while tensed statements about temporally definite singular events have
a changing truth-value, the corresponding non-tensed propositions are
unchangingly true or false, without being necessarily true or false
for this reason (Nuchelmans 1973, 177–189; Iwakuma and Ebbesen
1992). This was in agreement with Abelard’s view that future
contingent propositions are true or false. The actuality of a
contingent state of affairs at a specified future time does not
exclude the non-temporalized possibility of simultaneous alternatives,
nor does the truth of a proposition about this state of affairs make
it necessary (<em>Glossae super Peri hermeneias</em> IX.520–577;
Peter of Poitiers, <em>Sententiae</em> I.7.133–43,
I.12.164–223, I.14, 328–353).</p>

<h2><a id="ModThiCenLogTre">3. Modalities in Thirteenth-Century Logical Treatises</a></h2>

<p>
Modifying Boethius’s systematization of Aristotle’s
remarks in <em>De interpretatione</em> 12 and 13, twelfth- and
thirteenth-century logicians often presented the equipollences between
modal terms and opposed relations between modal propositions with the
help of the following diagram:</p>

<div class="figure">
<img src="square.png" width="590" alt="square" />

<p class="center">
<span class="figlabel">Figure 1.</span></p>
</div>

<p>
The square could be taken to refer to modals <em>de dicto</em> or
singular modals <em>de re</em> (see below.) Abelard tried to define
the opposed relations between quantified <em>de re</em> modals as
well, mistakenly thinking that these were the same as those between
singular modal propositions (<em>Glossae super Perihermeneias</em>
XII.468–471, 530–544). This question was not much
discussed before its satisfactory solution in fourteenth-century modal
semantics. (See Hughes 1989 and his description of Buridan’s
octagon of modal opposites and equipollences.) While
<em>possibile</em> and <em>contingens</em> are treated as synonyms in
the figure, it became more usual to associate the former with
one-sided possibility (not impossible) and the latter with two-sided
possibility (neither necessary nor impossible). </p>

<p>
The anonymous <em>Dialectica Monacensis</em> (ca. 1200) is one of the
numerous works representing the new terminist approach to logic and
can be used as an example of how modalities were treated in it. (A
collection of late twelfth- and early thirteenth-century logical texts
is edited in de Rijk 1962–67.) In discussing the quantity
(universal, particular, singular) and quality (affirmative, negative)
of the modals, the author states that modal terms may be adverbial or
nominal. The modal adverb qualifies the copula, and the structure of
the sentence can be described as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
(4) quantity/subject/modalized copula/predicate (for example: Some
A’s are necessarily B)
</blockquote>

<p>
In this form, the negation can be located in different places,
either</p>

<blockquote>
(5) quantity/subject/copula modalized by a negated mode/predicate (for
example: Some A’s are-not-necessarily B)
</blockquote>

<p>
or</p>

<blockquote>
(6) quantity/subject/modalized negative copula/predicate (for example:
Some A’s are-necessarily-not B)
</blockquote>

<p>
The modal sentences with nominal modes can be read in two ways. One
can apply an adverbial type of reading to them, which is said to be
how Aristotle treats modal sentences in the <em>Prior Analytics</em>.
The quality and quantity of such a <em>de re</em> modal sentence is
determined by the corresponding non-modal sentence. In a <em>de
dicto</em> modal sentence that which is asserted in a non-modal
sentence is considered as the subject about which the mode is
predicated. When modal sentences are understood in this way, they are
always singular, their form being:</p>

<blockquote>
(7) subject/copula/mode (for example: That some A’s are B is
necessary.)
</blockquote>

<p>
This reading is said to be the one which Aristotle presented in <em>De
interpretatione</em> (De Rijk 1967, II-2, 479.35–480.26). The
idea of the systematic distinction between the readings <em>de
dicto</em> (<em>in sensu composito</em>) and <em>de re</em> (<em>in
sensu diviso</em>) of modally qualified statements was employed in
Abelard’s investigations of modal statements (<em>Glossae super
Perihermeneias</em> XII, 3–106; <em>Dialectica</em>
191.1–210.19). Independently of Abelard, the distinction was
often used, as in the <em>Dialectica Monacensis</em>, in discussions
of the composition-division ambiguity of sentences. (See also
Maierù 1972, ch. 5; Jacobi 1980, ch. 4.)</p>

<p>
The author of the <em>Dialectica Monacensis</em> says that the matter
of an assertoric sentence may be natural, remote, or contingent. True
affirmative sentences about a natural matter maintain the existence of
compounds which cannot be otherwise; these sentences as well as the
compounds are called necessary. False affirmative sentences about a
remote matter maintain the existence of compounds which are
necessarily non-existent; they are called impossible. Sentences about
a contingent matter are about compounds which can be actual and which
can be non-actual (472.9-473.22). The theory of the modal matter was
popular in early medieval logic and was also dealt with in
mid-thirteenth-century handbooks. It was sometimes associated with the
statistical interpretation of natural modalities, for example by
Thomas Aquinas who wrote that universal propositions are false and
particular propositions are true in contingent matter (<em>In
Periherm</em>. I.13, 168). For the history of modal matter, see
Knuuttila 2008, 508–509. Another often discussed theme was the
distinction between modalities <em>per se</em> and <em>per
accidens</em> which was based on the idea that the modal status of a
temporally indefinite sentence may be changeable or not; for example,
‘You have not been in Paris’ may begin to be impossible,
whereas ‘You either have or have not been in Paris’ may
not. (See, for example, William of Sherwood, <em>Introduction to
Logic</em>, 41). Another distinction between sentences necessary
<em>per se</em> and <em>per accidens</em> was based on
Aristotle’s theory of <em>per se</em> predication in
<em>Posterior Analytics</em> I.4. A sentence was said to be
accidentally necessary when it was unchangeably true but, as distinct
from <em>per se</em> predications, there was no necessary conceptual
connection between subject and predicate. This became an important
part of thirteenth-century interpretations of Aristotle’s modal
syllogistics. (See, for example, Robert Kilwardby’s <em>Notule
libri Priorum</em> 8.133–142; 40.162–174.)</p>

<p>
One example of the prevalence of the traditional use of modal notions
can be found in the early medieval <em>de dicto/de re</em> analysis of
examples such as ‘A standing man can sit’. It was commonly
stated that the composite (<em>de dicto</em>) sense is ‘It is
possible that a man sits and stands at the same time’ and that
on this reading the sentence is false. The divided (<em>de re</em>)
sense is ‘A man who is now standing can sit’ and on this
reading the sentence is true. Many authors formulated the divided
possibility as follows: ‘A standing man can sit at another
time’. It was assumed that a possibility refers to an
actualization in the one and only world history and that it cannot
refer to the present moment because of the necessity of the present
understood in the Aristotelian sense formulated in (2) and (3) above.
When authors referred to another time, they thought that the
possibility will be realized at that time or that the divided
possibility refers to the future even though it may remain unrealized.
Those who made use of the (at that time modern) idea of simultaneous
alternatives took the composite reading to refer to one and the same
state of affairs and the divided reading to simultaneous alternative
states of affairs. This analysis was also applied to the question of
whether God’s knowledge of things makes them necessary
(Knuuttila 1993, 118–121).</p>

<p>
A great deal of Abelard’s logical works consisted of discussions
of topics, consequences and conditionals. Like Boethius, Abelard
thought that true conditionals express necessary connections between
the antecedents and the consequents. Abelard argued that
inseparability and entailment between the truth of the antecendent and
consequent are required for the truth of a conditional. Some
twelfth-century masters regarded the principle that the antecedent is
not true without the consequent as a sufficient condition for the
truth of a conditional and accepted the so-called paradoxes of
implication. The question of the nature of conditionals and
consequences remained a popular theme in medieval logic (Martin 1987,
2012).</p>

<p>
The principles of propositional modal logic, found in <em>Prior
Analytics</em> I.15, were generally expressed as follows: if the
antecedent of a valid consequence is possible/necessary, the
consequent is possible/necessary (Abelard, <em>Dialectica</em>
202.6–8). However, the main interest was in modal syllogistic
and modal predicate logic. Avicenna (d. 1037) wrote a brief Arabic
summary of Aristotle’s modal syllogistic, but his own theory was
different, being based on the assumptions that the subject terms and
the predicate terms of assertoric and modal propositions stand for all
possible applications and the truth-conditions of assertoric
propositions and corresponding possibility propositions are the same.
It follows, for example, that syllogisms with assertoric premises
coincide with uniform possibility syllogisms (Street 2002, 2005).
Avicenna was particularly interested in relative necessities and
distinguished between various types of conditional necessities in
terms of temporal determinations. Later Arabic works on modal theories
were much influenced by Avicenna. (See Strobino and Thom 2016.) While
Averroes’s commentaries on the <em>Prior Analytics</em> followed
the main lines of Aristotle’s text, his separate treatise on
modality involved new systematic ideas, mainly the theory of
accidental and <em>per se</em> necessary terms and the interpretation
of syllogistic necessity premises as <em>per se</em> necessary
predications with <em>per se</em> necessary terms. Both ideas were
inspired by Aristotle’s remarks in the <em>Posterior
Analytics</em> I.4; Averroes’s syllogistic applications were
probably influenced by ancient sources. Since Averroes took modal
premises to be of the divided type, assertoric premises in
Aristotelian mixed necessity-assertoric syllogisms must have a
predicate term which is necessary. The same applies to the subject
term of the first premise in mixed assertoric-necessity syllogisms
(<em>Quaesita octo in librum Priorum Analyticorum</em>, IV.3, 84, in
<em>Aristotelis Opera cum Averrois Commentariis</em> I.2b; see also
Thom 2003, 81–85). This is a speculative explanation of
Aristotle’s asymmetric treatment of mixed necessity-assertoric
syllogisms and mixed assertoric-necessity syllogisms. Gersonides later
tried to develop further Averroes’s remarks; see Manekin 1992.
Analogous essentialist ideas were developed in thirteenth-century
Latin discussions. </p>

<p>
The first Latin commentary on the <em>Prior Analytics</em> is an
anonymous late twelfth-century treatise (‘Anonymus Aurelianensis
III’) which involves detailed discussions of modal conversion
and modal syllogisms as well as many problems dealt with in ancient
commentaries. (See Ebbesen 2008; an edition by Thomsen Thörnqvist
2015; see also Bydén and Thomsen Thörnqvist, eds., 2017).
<em>Dialectica Monacensis</em> involves a brief summary of
Aristotle’s modal syllogistic the elements of which were
discussed in logic courses in Paris in the first part of the
thirteenth century. Robert Kilwardby’s commentary <em>Notule
libri Priorum</em> (c. 1240) became an authoritative work from which
the discussions of modal syllogisms in the commentaries of Albert the
Great (ca. 1250) and many others were largely derived (Knuuttila 2008,
545–548). Abelard, who did not deal with Aristotle’s modal
syllogistic, said that the modals in mixed syllogisms with both modal
and assertoric premises should be understood in a way which he
elsewhere characterizes as <em>de re</em> interpretation (<em>Glossae
super Perihermeneias</em> XII.189–203). This reading of modal
premises was often assumed, although it was seldom discussed as such.
A central problem of Aristotle’s theory is that the structure of
the premises is not analyzed. Even if it is natural to think that the
presupposition of the mixed moods is a <em>de re</em> reading of
modally qualified premises, this creates difficulties when applied to
the conversion rules, most of which are unproblematic only if
understood as rules for modals <em>de dicto</em>. (According to
Aristotle, necessity premises are converted in the same way as
assertoric premises, ‘Every/some A is B’ implies
‘Some B is A’ and ‘No A is B’ implies
‘No B is A’. Negative contingency premises are converted
to corresponding affirmative contingency propositions and these by the
conversion of terms to particular contingency propositions.)</p>

<p>
While many historians think that Aristotle’s modal syllogistic
included incompatible elements, this was not the view of
mid-thirteenth century logicians. Many of them discussed the same
alleged counter-examples to the universal convertibility of necessary
propositions, such as</p>

<blockquote>
(8) Everything healthy (or awake) is necessarily an animal.
</blockquote>

<p>
Robert Kilwardby’s explanation is based on the view that
convertible necessity premises are necessity propositions <em>per
se</em> and not <em>per accidens</em>, like (8), which are not
convertible. (See <em>Notule libri Priorum</em> 8.133–146.) In
affirmative necessity propositions <em>per se</em>, the subject is
<em>per se</em> connected to the predicate. In negative necessity
propositions <em>per se</em>, the subject is <em>per se</em>
incompatible with the predicate. The terms in <em>per se</em>
inherences or incompatibilities are essential and necessarily stand
for the things they signify. The historical background of
Kilwardby’s interpretation is not clear, but it does show
similarities to Averroes’s discussion mentioned above. (See
Lagerlund 2000, 25–42; Thom 2007, 19–28.)</p>

<p>
As for the conversion of contingency propositions (neither necessary
nor impossible), Kilwardby notes that while the converted propositions
of indefinite (<em>utrumlibet</em>) contingency are of the same type
of contingency, the conversion of natural contingency propositions
(true about most cases) results in contingency propositions when
contingency means possibility proper (not impossible). There were
extensive discussions of the kinds of contingency based on various
philosophical ideas in Kilwardby, Albert the Great and their
contemporaries (Knuuttila 2008, 540–541).</p>

<p>
Following Aristotle’s remark that ‘A contingently belongs
to B’ may mean either ‘A contingently belongs to that to
which B belongs’ or ‘A contingently belongs to that to
which B contingently belongs’, Kilwardby argues that the subject
terms in contingency syllogisms are read in the second way and
ampliated, if syllogistic relations do not demand restrictions. In
explaining the difference in this respect between necessity
propositions and contingency propositions, he states that since the
terms in <em>per se</em> necessity propositions are essential,
‘Every A is necessarily B’ and ‘Whatever is
necessarily A is necessarily B’ behave in the same way in logic.
Contingency propositions which are ampliated do not mean the same as
those which are not ampliated (<em>Notule libri Priorum</em>
18.187–207; 18.653–672).</p>

<p>
According to Kilwardby, the modal character of the predication in the
conclusion of the perfect first figure syllogism follows from the
first premise, which involves the whole syllogism in accordance with
the <em>dici de omni et nullo</em> (Lagerlund 2000, 41–42). The
premises and the conclusion in uniform necessity syllogisms are
necessary <em>per se</em>. In mixed first-figure syllogisms with a
major necessity premise and a minor asertoric premise, the
non-modalized premise should be <em>simpliciter</em> assertoric, i.e.,
a necessarily true <em>per se</em> predication. Similarly, in mixed
first-figure syllogisms with contingent major and assertoric minor
premises, the assertoric premise must be <em>simpliciter</em>
assertoric, but this time the criteria are that the predicate belongs
to the subject <em>per se</em>, invariably or by natural contingency
(<em>Notule libri Priorum</em> 15.255–301;
20.706–736).</p>

<p>
Kilwardby explains that in first-figure mixed necessity-assertoric
syllogisms the necessity premise appropriates to itself a minor which
is necessary <em>per se</em>; no such appropriation occurs in
first-figure mixed assertoric-necessity syllogisms. There are similar
appropriation rules for some mixed second-figure and third-figure
moods with assertoric and necessity premises and for various mixed
contingency moods pertaining to the kind of appropriated contingency
premises or assertoric premises (Thom 2007, chs. 5–6).</p>

<p>
Kilwardby and his followers regarded Aristotle’s modal
syllogistic as the correct theory of modalities, the explication of
which demanded various metaphysical considerations. As exemplified by
the appropriation rules, they assumed that propositions of the same
form had different interpretations, depending on how they were related
to other propositions in a syllogism. From the logical point of view,
these rules have an <em>ad hoc</em> character. (For some comparisons
between contemporary philosophical modal logic and thirteenth-century
views, see also Uckelman 2009.)</p>

<p>
After Kilwardby and Albert, several thirteenth-century authors wrote
treatises on the <em>Prior Analytics</em>. These are not yet edited;
the next edited text is Richard Campsall’s early
fourteenth-century <em>Questions on Aristotle’s Prior
Analytics</em>. It shows which kind of questions were found relevant
in the tradition influenced by Kilwardby’s commentary. Campsall
thinks that one should discuss <em>de dicto</em> and <em>de re</em>
modalities separately. He says that an affirmative <em>de re</em>
possibility statement as of now implies the corresponding assertoric
statement (5.40) and a negative assertoric statement as of now implies
the corresponding <em>de re</em> necessity statement (5.50). It
follows that what is possible now is actualized and things cannot be
otherwise because all true present tense negative statements are
necessarily true. This is Campsall’s version of the traditional
doctrine of the necessity of the present. When he says that an
affirmative assertoric statement does not imply the corresponding
<em>de re</em> necessity statement, the background of this remark is
the definition of a <em>de re</em> contingency statement as a
conjunction of an affirmative and corresponding negative possibility
proper statement (7.34–36). For the same reason, a negative
<em>de re</em> possibility statement does not imply the corresponding
assertoric statement. Campsall equates <em>de re</em> necessity with
respect to actual things to unchanging predication and contingency to
changing predication. Actual things may be contingent in the sense
that they will be changed in the future (12.31). For a different
interpretation of Campshall’s confusing formulations, see
Lagerlund 2000, 87–90). </p>

<h2><a id="FouCenDis">4. Fourteenth-Century Discussions</a></h2>

<p>
John Duns Scotus’s modal theory can be regarded as the first
systematic exposition of the new intensional theory of modality, some
elements of which were put forward in the twelfth century. In
criticizing Henry of Ghent’s theory of theological modalities,
Scotus sketched the famous model of ‘divine psychology’ in
which certain relations between theological, metaphysical, and modal
notions are defined. Scotus deviated from the metaphysical tradition
in which possibilities were founded in divine being. According to him,
when God as an omniscient being knows all possibilities, he does not
know them by turning first to his essence. Possibilities can be known
in themselves (<em>Ord</em>. I.35, 32). In fact they would be what
they are even if there were no God. Scotus states that if it is
assumed that, <em>per impossibile</em>, neither God nor the world
exists and the proposition ‘The world is possible’ then
existed, this proposition would be true. The actual world is possible
as it is, and this possibility and the possibilities of unrealized
things are primary metaphysical facts which are not dependent on
anything else (<em>Ord</em>. I.7.1, 27; <em>Lect</em>. I.7, 32,
I.39.1–5, 49).</p>

<p>
Scotus calls the propositional formulations of pure possibilities
‘logical possibilities’. These express things and states
of affairs to which it is not repugnant to be. Possibilities as such
have no kind of existence of their own nor are they causally
sufficient for the existence of anything, but they are real in the
sense that they form the precondition for everything that is or can
be. God’s omniscience involves all possibilities and as object
of divine knowledge they receive an intelligible or objective being.
Some of these are included in God’s providential plan of
creation and will receive an actual being. The description of how
things could be at a certain moment consists of compossible
possibilities. Though possibilities necessarily are what they are, the
actualization of non-necessary possibilities is contingent. Since all
finite things are contingently actual, their alternatives are possible
with respect to the same time, though these are not compossible with
what is actual. Impossibilities are incompossibilities between
possibilities (<em>Ord</em>. I.35, 32, 49–51, I.38, 10, I.43,
14; <em>Lect</em>. I.39.1–5, 62–65).</p>

<p>
In criticizing extensional modal theories Scotus redefined a
contingent event as follows: ‘I do not call something contingent
because it is not always or necessarily the case, but because its
opposite could be actual at the very moment when it occurs’
(<em>Ord</em>. I.2.1.1–2, 86). This is a denial of the
traditional thesis of the necessity of the present and the temporal
frequency characterization of contingency. In Scotus’s modal
semantics, the meaning of the notion of contingency is spelt out by
considering simultaneous alternatives. What is actual is contingently
so if, instead of being actual, it could be not actual. This
conception of simultaneous contingent alternatives is part of an
argument that the first cause does not act necessarily. According to
Scotus, the eternal creative act of divine will is free only if it
could be other than it is in a real sense (<em>Lect</em>.
I.39.1–5, 58). (For Scotus’s modal theory, see Vos et al.
1994; Knuuttila 1996; King 2001; Normore 2003; Hoffmann 2009.)</p>

<p>
Scotus’s approach to modalities brought new themes into
philosophical discussion. One of these was the idea of possibility as
a non-existent precondition of all being and thinking. Some of his
followers and critics argued that if there were no God, there would
not be any kind of modality (see Hoffmann 2002, Coombs 2004; for
Bradwardine’s criticism, see Frost 2014). Scotus’s views
were known in the seventeenth century through the works of
Suárez and some Scotist authors (Honnefelder 1990). In his
discussion of eternal truths, Descartes criticized the classical view
of the ontological foundation of modality as well as the Scotist
theory of modality and conceivability. (There are different
interpretations of Descartes’s view of the foundations of
modality and how it is related to late medieval discussions; see
Alanen 1990; Normore 1991, 2006.)</p>

<p>
Another influential idea was the distinction between logical and
natural necessities and possibilities. In Scotus’s theory,
logically necessary attributes and relations are attached to things in
all those sets of compossibilities in which they occur. Against this
background one could ask which of the natural invariances treated as
necessities in earlier natural philosophy were necessary in this
strong sense of necessity, and which of them were merely empirical
generalizations without being logically necessary. (For a discussion
of logical and natural necessities in the fourteenth century, see
Knuuttila 1993, 155–160, 2001a.) Buridan applied the frequency
model in natural philosophy, and it was often used in early modern
thought as well (Knebel 2003). </p>

<p>
One important branch of medieval logic developed in treatises called
<em>De obligationibus</em> dealt, roughly speaking, with how an
increasing set of true and false propositions might remain coherent.
According to thirteenth-century rules, a false present tense statement
could be accepted as a starting point only if it was taken to refer to
a moment of time different from the actual one. Scotus deleted this
rule, based on the Aristotelian axiom of the necessity of the present,
and later theories accepted the Scotist revision. In this new form,
obligations logic could be regarded as a theory of how to describe
possible states of affairs and their mutual relationships. These
discussions influenced the philosophical theory of counterfactual
conditionals (Yrjönsuuri 1994, 2001; Gelber 2004; Dutilh Novaes
2007).</p>

<p>
In dealing with counterfactual hypotheses of indirect proofs mentioned
above, Averroes and Thomas Aquinas made use of the idea of abstract
possibilities which did not imply the idea of alternative domains. The
possibilities of a thing can be dealt with at various levels which
correspond to Porphyrian predicables. Something which is possible for
a thing as a member of a genus can be impossible for it as a member of
a species. The same holds of it as a member of a species and an
individuated thing. Thus humans can fly because there are other
animals which can fly. These abstract possibilities are impossible in
the sense that they cannot be actualized. Buridan heavily criticized
this approach from the point of view of his new modal theory. He
argued that if a counterfactual state of affairs is possible, it can
be coherently imagined as actual. If something cannot be treated in
this way, calling it possible is based on a conceptual confusion. (See
Knuuttila and Kukkonen 2011.) While Scotus, Buridan and many others
understood the basic level of possibility in terms semantic
consistency, Ockham wanted to preserve the link to the notion of power
in his modal considerations, thinking that necessity is actuality plus
immutability, the past and the present are necessary, and Scotus was
wrong in assuming that things could be different from how they are at
the very moment of their actuality (Normore 2016). </p>

<p>
Influenced by the new philosophical ideas about modality, William of
Ockham (<em>Summa logicae</em>), John Buridan (<em>Tractatus de
consequentiis</em>, <em>Summulae de Dialectica</em>) and some other
fourteenth-century authors could formulate the principles of modal
logic much more completely and satisfactorily than did their
predecessors. Questions of modal logic were discussed separately with
respect to modal propositions <em>de dicto</em> and <em>de re</em>;
modal propositions <em>de re</em> were further divided into two groups
depending on whether the subject terms refer to actual or possible
beings. It was thought that logicians should also analyze the
relationships between these readings and, furthermore, the
consequences having various types of modal sentences as their parts.
Ockham, Buridan and their followers largely dropped thirteenth-century
essentialist assumptions from modal syllogistic. They regarded the
Aristotelian version as a fragmentary theory in which the distinctions
between different types of fine structures were not explicated and,
consequently, did not try to reconstruct Aristotle’s modal
syllogistic as a consistent whole by one unifying analysis of modal
propositions; they believed, like some modern commentators, that such
a reconstruction was not possible. (For fourteenth-century modal
logic, see King 1985; Lagerlund 2000; Thom 2003; Knuuttila 2008,
551–567.)</p>

<p>
According to Hughes (1989), one could supply a Kripke-style possible
worlds semantics to Buridan’s modal system. Comparing
Buridan’s general ideas with this may be of heuristic value,
although many theoretical questions of modern formal semantics were
not those of medieval logicians. (See also Klima 2001.) Ockham and
Buridan state that the truth of ‘A white thing can be
black’ demands the truth of ‘This can be black’ and
that ‘This can be black’ and ‘‘This is
black’ is possible’ mean the same. Compound (<em>de
dicto</em>) and divided (<em>de re</em>) readings do not differ at
this level, but are separated in dealing with universal and particular
propositions. While Ockham did not discuss unrestricted divided
necessity propositions, Buridan took the subject terms of all
quantified divided modal propositions as standing for possible beings
if they are not restricted. The truth of these propositions demands
the truth of all or some relevant singular propositions of the type
just mentioned; the demonstrative pronoun is then taken to refer to
the possible beings even though they may not exist. Buridan could have
said that the possible truth of ‘This is X’ means that it
is true in a possible state of affairs in which the possible being
referred to by ‘this’ occurs and that the necessary truth
of ‘This is X’ means that it is true in all possible
states of affairs in which the possible being referred to by
‘this’ occurs.</p>

<p>
The new modal logic was among the most remarkable achievements of
medieval logic. Buridan’s modal logic was dominant in late
medieval times, being more systematic than that of Ockham because of
its symmetric treatment of possibility and necessity. It was embraced
by Marsilius of Inghen, Albert of Saxony, Jodocus Trutfetter and
others (Lagerlund 2000, 184–227; for the later influence of
medieval modal theories, see also Coombs 2003; Knebel 2003; Roncaglia
1996, 2003; Schmutz 2006). The rise of the new modal logic was
accompanied by elaborated theories of epistemic logic (Boh 1993) and
deontic logic (Knuuttila and Hallamaa 1995).</p>
