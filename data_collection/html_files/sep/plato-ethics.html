<h1>Plato’s Ethics: An Overview</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Tue Sep 16, 2003; substantive revision Wed Dec 6, 2017</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
Like most other ancient philosophers, Plato maintains a virtue-based
eudaemonistic conception of ethics. That is to say, happiness or
well-being (<em>eudaimonia</em>) is the highest aim of moral thought
and conduct, and the virtues (<em>aretê</em>:
‘excellence’) are the requisite skills and dispositions
needed to attain it. If Plato’s conception of happiness is
elusive and his support for a morality of happiness seems somewhat
subdued, there are several reasons. First, he nowhere defines the
concept or makes it the direct target of investigation, but introduces
it in an oblique way in the pursuit of other questions. Second, the
treatment of the human good varies in the different dialogues, so that
readers find themselves confronted with the problem of what to make of
the discrepancies in different works. This touches on a fundamental
problem with Plato’s work – namely whether to follow a
‘unitarian’, ‘revisionist’, or
‘developmentalist’ approach to Plato’s writings.
Whereas unitarians regard the dialogues as pieces of one mosaic, and
take the view that Plato in essence maintains a unified doctrine from
his earliest to his latest works, revisionists maintain that
Plato’s thought underwent a fundamental transformation later in
his life, while ‘developmentalist’ hold that Plato’s
views evolved significantly throughout his career. While revisionism
has lost its impact in recent years, developmentalism has gained in
influence. Although there is no unanimity, few unitarians deny
nowadays that the character of Plato’s early, middle, and late
works differ in style, language, scope and content, as is to be
expected in a philosopher who worked for more than fifty years. Most
developmentalists, in turn, agree that it is impossible to line up
Plato’s works like pearls on a string and to reconstruct his
progress from dialogue to dialogue; for example, where the views
expressed in different dialogues seem to disagree there may be
complementation or supplementation at work, rather than divergence.
Given that Plato never speaks in his own voice, it is important to
take note of who the interlocutors are and what role is assigned to
Socrates, if he is the main speaker. Plato’s dialogues should
never be treated in isolation when it comes to the reconstruction of
his doctrine; but even the comparison and contrasting of ideas
presented in different dialogues is not a sure recipe for interpreting
this elusive thinker’s views. </p>

<p>
Plato’s so-called ‘Socratic’ dialogues share certain
characteristics as a group. They are short interrogations by Socrates
of the kind indicated in his explanation of his divine mission in the
<em>Apology</em>. They seem designed to undermine unquestioned
traditional views and values rather than to develop positive accounts,
although they sometimes contain indications that seeming dead ends are
not real dead ends. The positive accounts contained in the middle
dialogues – the so-called ‘Platonic’ dialogues
– that are grouped around the <em>Republic</em> – treat
happiness in different ways as a state of perfection. The exact nature
of this state is not easy to pinpoint, however, because it is based on
metaphysical presuppositions that are, at least prima facie, both hazy
and out of the realm of ordinary understanding. There is not, as there
is in Aristotle, an explicit determination of happiness as a
self-sufficient state of the active individual. Instead, at least in
some texts, Plato’s moral ideals appear both austere and
self-abnegating: The soul is to remain aloof from the pleasures of the
body in the pursuit of higher knowledge, while communal life demands
the subordination of individual wishes and aims to the common good.
</p>

<p>
The difficulties of assessing Plato’s ethical thought are
compounded by the fact that the metaphysical underpinnings seem to
have changed during his long life. In the Socratic dialogues, there
are no indications that the search for virtue and the human good goes
beyond the human realm. This changes with the middle dialogues, which
show a growing interest in an all-encompassing metaphysical grounding
of knowledge, a development that leads to the positing of the
‘Forms’ as the true nature of all things, culminating in
the Form of the Good as the transcendent principle of all goodness.
Though the theory of the Forms is not confined to human values, but
encompasses the whole of nature, Plato in the middle dialogues seems
to assume no more than an analogy between human affairs and cosmic
harmony. The late dialogues, by contrast, display a growing tendency
to assume a unity between the microcosm of human life and the
macrocosmic harmonic order of the entire universe, a tendency that is
displayed most fully in the <em>Philebus</em> and the
<em>Timaeus</em>. While these holistic tendencies appeal to the
imagination because they rely on harmonic relations expressed in
mathematical proportions, the metaphysical status of the Forms is even
harder to make out in the late dialogues than in the middle dialogues.
Though Plato’s late works do not show any willingness to lower
the standards of knowledge as such, Plato acknowledges that his design
of a rational cosmic order is based on conjecture and speculation, an
acknowledgement that finds its counterpart in his more pragmatic
treatment of ethical standards and political institutions in his
latest politcal work, the <em>Laws</em>. Finally, at no stage of his
philosophy does Plato go into a systematic treatment of, or and
commitment to, basic principles of ethics from which rules and norms
of human interaction can be derived and justified. Instead, Plato
largely confines himself to the depiction of the good soul and of what
is good for the soul, on the assumption that the state of the soul is
the necessary and sufficient condition for the good life and its moral
precepts. This abstemiousness explains the widely diverging
reconstructions of Plato’s ethics in the secondary literature
from antiquity to this day.</p>

<h2><a id="Pre">1. Preliminaries</a></h2>

<p>
If ethics is widely regarded as the most accessible branch of
philosophy, it is so because many of its presuppositions are
self-evident or trivial truths: All human actions, for example, serve
some end or purpose; whether they are right or wrong depends on an
actor’s overall aims. At least for secularists, the attainment
of these overall aims is thought to be a condition or prerequisite for
a good life. What we regard as a life worth living depends on the
notion we have of our own nature and of the conditions of its
fulfillment. This, in turn, is determined, at least in part, by the
values and standards of the society we live in. Personal ends and
purposes depend in each case not only on reason, but also on the
individual agents’ dispositions (i.e.their likes and dislikes,
which determine their personal character). The attainment of these
ends can also depend at least in part on external factors, such as
health, material prosperity, social status, and even on good looks or
sheer luck.</p>

<p>
Although these presuppositions may appear to be self-evident, most of
the time, human beings are aware of them only implicitly, because many
individuals simply lead their lives in accordance with pre-established
standards and values that are, under normal circumstances, not objects
of reflection. It is only in times of crisis that a society’s
traditions and precepts are challenged by someone like Socrates, who
sees the need to disturb his fellows’ complacency. The
historical Socrates was, of course, not the first to question the
Greek way of life. Presocratic philosophers such as Heraclitus or
Xenophanes had been critics of their times, and the sophists had
argued provocatively that, contrary to the naïve view, it is
custom and convention, rather than nature that set the standards for
what is deemed right or wrong, good or bad, in every society. But if
other thinkers had preceded Socrates with moral and social criticism,
he was certainly the first to challenge his fellows on an individual
basis on the ground that ‘the unexamined life is not worth
living’ (<em>Ap</em>. 38a). Whatever position one may take in
the controversy concerning the degree to which Plato’s early
dialogues are true to the historical Socrates’ discussions, the
independent testimony of Xenophon leaves little doubt that
Socrates’ cross-examinations (<em>elenchos</em>) provoked the
kind of enmity that led to his conviction and execution. In the eyes
of conservative Athenians, Socrates’ questioning undermined the
traditional values of their society. As Socrates saw it, the
‘virtues’ – which is to say the social skills,
attitudes, and character-traits possessed by most Athenian citizens of
his time – were all too often geared towards their
possessors’ wealth, power, and capacities for self-indulgence,
to the detriment of public morality and the community’s
well-being.</p>

<p>
The Socratic legacy prompted Plato to engage in a thorough examination
of the nature of knowledge and reality, an examination that gradually
took him far beyond the scope of the historical Socrates’
discussions. Nevertheless, Plato continued to present his
investigations as dialogues between Socrates and some partner or
partners. And Plato preserved the dialogical form even in those of his
late works where Socrates is replaced by a stand-in and where the
didactic nature of the presentations is hard to reconcile with the
pretense of live discussion. But these didactic discourses continue to
combine questions of ethical, political, social, or psychological
importance with metaphysical, methodological and epistemological
considerations, and it can be just as hard to assess the extent to
which Plato agrees with the pronouncements of his speakers, as it is
when the speaker is Socrates. Furthermore, the fact that a certain
problem or its solution is not mentioned in a dialogue does not mean
that Plato was unaware of it. There is, therefore, no certainty
concerning the question: “What did Plato see and when did he
first see it?” The lack of information about the order in which
Plato wrote his works adds to this difficulty. It stands to reason,
however, that he started with the short dialogues that question
traditional virtues – courage, justice, moderation, piety. It
also stands to reason that Plato gradually widened the scope of his
investigations, by reflecting not only on the social and political
conditions of morality, but also on the logical, epistemological, and
metaphysical presuppositions of a successful moral theory. These
theoretical reflections often take on a life of their own. Several of
Plato’s later works address ethical problems only marginally or
not at all. The <em>Parmenides</em>, the <em>Theaetetus</em>, and the
<em>Sophist</em> deal primarily or exclusively with epistemological
and metaphysical problems of a quite general nature. Nevertheless, as
witnessed by the <em>Philebus</em>, the <em>Statesman</em>, the
<em>Timaeus</em>, and the <em>Laws</em>, Plato never lost interest in
the question of what conditions are necessary for a good human
life.</p>

<h2><a id="EarDiaExaLif">2. The early dialogues: Examining life</a></h2>

<h3><a id="QueForDef">2.1 The quest for definitions</a></h3>

<p>
The early ‘Socratic’ dialogues are not concerned with the
question of the good life and its conditions in general, but rather
with particular virtues. Socrates explores the individual virtues
through a discussion with persons who are either representatives of,
or claim to be experts on, that virtue. Socrates’ justification
for this procedure is that a paragon or expert must know the
characteristic property of a particular virtues, and therefore be able
to give an account or definition of it (cf. Xenophon
<em>Memorabilia</em> I, 10; 16). Thus, in the <em>Euthyphro</em>,
Socrates discusses piety with an ‘expert’ on religious
affairs. In the <em>Laches</em>, he discusses courage with two
renowned generals of the Peloponnesian war, Laches and Nicias.
Similarly, in the <em>Charmides</em> Socrates addresses—somewhat
ironically—the nature of moderation with the two of the Thirty
Tyrants, namely the then very young Charmides, an alleged model of
modesty, and his guardian and intellectual mentor, Critias. In the
<em>Greater Hippias</em> Socrates raises the question of the nature of
the beautiful with a producer of ‘beautiful things’, the
sophist and polymath Hippias. In the <em>Protagoras</em> Socrates
focuses on the question of the unity of virtue in a discussion with
Protagoras, the most famous teacher of ‘civic virtues’
among the sophists. And in the <em>Gorgias</em> Socrates discusses the
nature of rhetoric and its relation to virtue with the most prominent
teacher of rhetoric among the sophists. Finally, in the <em>Meno</em>
the question how virtue is acquired is raised by Meno, a disciple of
Gorgias, and an ambitious seeker of power, wealth, and fame.
Socrates’ interlocutors are usually at first quite confident
about their own competence in the discussion. Nor is such confidence
unreasonable. If virtue is a kind of ‘skill’ or special
property that enjoys general recognition, its possessor should know
and be able to give an account of his skill. As the Socrates’
examinations demonstrate, however, such self-confidence is usually
misplaced and the ‘knowledge’ professed by Socrates’
conversation partners is frequently revealed to be at best an implicit
familiarity, When they are confronted with their inability to explain
the nature of their cherished virtue or expertise, they end up
admitting their ignorance, often with considerable chagrin and anger.
</p>

<p>
Socrates’ purpose in conducting these sometimes cruel-looking
games is not just to undermine the false confidence of his
interlocutors, but also to arrive at formal definitions and standards
concerning the virtues. There were no widely acknowledged standards of
definition in Socrates’ time, but by exposing the flaws in his
partners’ abortive arguments in his investigations Socrates
contributed significantly to the establishment of such standards.
These flaws vary greatly in kind and gravity: Socrates shows that
enumerations of examples are not sufficient to capture the nature of
the thing in question. Definitions that consist in the replacement of
a given concept with a synonym are open to the same objections as the
original definition. Definitions may be hopelessly vague or miss the
mark entirely, which is to say that they may be either too wide, and
include unwanted characteristics or subsets, or too narrow, and
exclude essential characteristics. Moreover, definitions may be
incomplete because the object in question does not constitute a
unitary phenomenon. If generally accepted ‘social
excellences’ are not simple conditions, they may be subject to
conflicting convictions. Examples of all these flaws are provided in
Plato’s early dialogues, where Socrates exposes the exact nature
of the underlying deficiencies with more or less diagnostic
transparency.</p>

<p>
Given that the focus in the early dialogues is almost entirely on the
exposure of flaws and inconsistencies, one cannot help wondering
whether Plato himself knew the <em>answers</em> to his queries, and
had some cards up his sleeve that he chose not to play for the time
being. This would presuppose that Plato had not only a clear notion of
the nature of the different virtues, but also a positive conception of
the good life as such. Since Plato was neither a moral nihilist nor a
sceptic, he cannot have regarded moral perplexity (<em>aporia</em>) as
the ultimate end, nor regarded continued mutual examination, <em>
Socratico more</em>, as a way of life for everyone. Perplexity, as is
argued in the <em>Meno</em>, is just a wholesome intermediary stage on
the way to knowledge (<em>Me</em>. 84a–b). But if Plato assumes
that the convictions that survive Socratic questioning will eventually
coalesce into an account of the good life, then he keeps this
expectation to himself. Nor would such optimism seem warranted, given
Socrates’ disavowal of knowledge. There is no guarantee that
only false convictions are discarded in a Socratic investigation,
while true ones are retained. For, promising suggestions are often as
mercilessly discarded as their less promising brethren. Perhaps Plato
counted on his readers’ intelligence to straighten out what is
skewed in Socratic refutations, and also to detect unfair moves, and
to supplement what is missing. It is, in fact, often not difficult to
make out fallacies in Socrates’ argument and to correct them;
but such corrections must remain incomplete without sufficient
information about Plato’s overall conception of the good life
and its moral presuppositions. It is therefore a matter of conjecture
whether Plato himself held any positive views while he composed one
aporetic dialogue after the other. He may have regarded his
investigations as experimental stages, or have seen each dialogue as
an element in a network of approaches that he hoped to eventually
integrate.</p>

<p>
If there is a general lesson to be drawn from the many failed accounts
of the virtues by Socrates’ different conversation partners,
beyond the particular shortcomings of individual definitions and
assertions, it is that isolated definitions of single virtues, summed
up in one sentence, will not do. The evidence that Plato already
wanted his readers to draw this very conclusion in his early dialogues
is somewhat contradictory, however. Plato famously pleads for the
unity of the virtues in the <em>Protagoras</em>, and seems intent to
reduce them all to knowledge. Scholars are therefore wont to speak of
the ‘intellectualistic’ character of the so-called
‘Socratic ethics’, because it leaves no room for other
motivational forces, such as emotions or desires. Socrates’
proof in the <em>Protagoras</em> that reason cannot be overcome by the
passions has, from Aristotle on, been treated as a denial of
<em>akrasia</em>, of the phenomenon that was later somewhat
misleadingly dubbed as ‘weakness of the will’. This
intellectualizing tendency, however, does not tell us what kind of
master-science would fulfill all of the requirements for defining
virtues, and what its content should be. What is more, the emphasis on
knowledge does not rule out an awareness on Plato’s part of the
importance of other factors, even in his early dialogues. Though Plato
often compared the virtues with technical skills, such as those of a
doctor or a pilot, he may have realized that virtues also involve
emotional attitudes, desires, and preferences, but not yet have seen a
clear way to coordinate or relate the rational and the affective
elements that constitute the virtues. In the <em>Laches</em>, for
instance, Socrates partners struggle when they try to define courage,
invoking two different elements. In his attempt to define courage as
steadfastness in battle, Laches, one of the two generals and
‘experts’ on courage, is faced with the dilemma that
steadfastness seems not to be a satisfactory definition of courage
either in itsself or in combination with knowledge (<em>La</em>.
192a–194c). His comrade Nicias, on the other hand, fails when he
tries to identify courage exclusively as a certain type of knowledge
(197e–200a). The investigation of moderation in the
<em>Charmides</em>, likewise, points up that there are two disparate
elements commonly associated with that virtue – namely, a
certain calmness of temper on the one hand (<em>Chrm</em>.
158e–160d) and self-knowledge on the other (166e–175a). It
is clear that a complex account would be needed to combine these two
disparate factors. For moral skills not only presuppose sufficient
‘operative’ rationality but also require appropriate
evaluative and emotional attitudes towards the desirable ends to be
attained and the means to be employed. Such an insight is at least
indicated in Socrates’ long and passionate argument in the
<em>Gorgias</em> against Polus and Callicles that the just life is
better for the soul of its possessor than the unjust life, an argument
that he fortifies with a mythical depiction of the soul’s reward
and punishment after death (523a–527e). But the nature of
justice and what is required for the proper care of one’s soul,
is thereby illuminated only indirectly. For the most part,
Socrates’ interrogations focus on the incompatibility of his
interlocutor’ selfish aims with their more selfless and noble
views. In his earlier dialogues, Plato may or may not already be
envisaging the kind of solution that he is going to present in the
<em>Republic</em> to the problem of the relationship between the
various virtues, with wisdom, the only intellectual virtue, as their
basis. Courage, moderation, and justice presuppose a certain
steadfastness of character as well as a harmony of purpose among the
disparate parts of the soul, but their goodness depends entirely on
the intellectual part of the soul, just as the virtue of the citizens
in the just state depends on the wisdom of the philosopher kings
(<em>R</em>. 428a–444e). The dispositional or
‘demotic’ virtues are thus acknowledged but relegated to
second place (500d; 522a–b).</p>

<p>
There are at least some indications that Plato already saw the need
for a holistic conception of the good life when he composed his
‘Socratic’ dialogues. At the end of the <em>Laches</em>,
he lets Nicias founder in his attempt to define courage as the
‘knowledge of what is to be feared and what should inspire
confidence’. Nicias is forced to admit that such knowledge
presupposes the knowledge of good and bad <em>tout court</em>
(<em>La</em>. 199c–e). In a different but related way, Socrates
alludes to a comprehensive knowledge at the end of the
<em>Charmides</em>, in his final refutation of Critias’
definition of moderation as ‘knowledge of knowledge’, by
urging that this type of knowledge is insufficient for the happy life
without the knowledge of good and bad (<em>Chrm</em>. 174b–e).
But pointing out what is wrong and missing in particular arguments is
a far cry from a philosophical conception of the good and the bad in
human life. The fact that Plato insists on the shortcomings of a
purely ‘technical’ conception of virtue suggests that he
was at least facing up to these problems. The discussion of the
‘unity of the virtues’ in the <em>Protagoras</em> –
regardless of the perhaps intentionally unsatisfactory structure of
his proofs – confirms that Plato realized that a critique of the
inconsistencies implied in conventional values is insufficient to
justify such a unitary point of view. But the evidence that Plato
already had a definitive conception of the good life in mind when he
wrote his earlier dialogues remains, at most, indirect.</p>

<h3><a id="DefRec">2.2 Definition and recollection</a></h3>

<p>
A reflection on the meaning of Socrates’ quest for definitions
in the early dialogues suggests that Plato cannot have been blind to
the sterility of a purely negative way of argument, or if he was blind
at first, his blindness cannot have lasted long. For Socrates’
quest for definitions has important consequences. First and foremost,
definitions presuppose that there is a definable object; that is to
say, that it must have a stable nature. Nothing can be defined whose
nature changes all the time. In addition, the object in question must
be a unitary phenomenon, even if its unity may be complex. If
definitions are to provide the basis of knowledge, they require some
kind of essentialism. This presupposition is indeed made explicit in
the <em>Euthyphro</em>, where Plato employs for the first time the
terminology that will be characteristic of his full-fledged theory of
the Forms. In response to Euthyphro’s enumeration of various
examples of pious behavior, Socrates demands an account of <em>the
one</em> feature (<em>Euthphr</em>. 5d: <em>idea</em>; 6d:
<em>eidos</em>; 6e: <em>paradeigma</em>) that is common to all cases
of what is holy or pious. Despite this pregnant terminology, few
scholars nowadays hold that the <em>Euthyphro</em> already presupposes
transcendent Forms in a realm of their own– models that are
incompletely represented by their imitations under material
conditions. The terms <em>eidos</em> and <em>idea</em> preserved their
original meaning of ‘look’ or ‘shape’ into the
classical age; but they were also often used in the more abstract
sense of ‘form’, ‘sort’, ‘type’,
or ‘kind’. No more than piety or holiness in the abstract
sense seems to be presupposed in the discussion of the
<em>Euthyphro</em>. There is, at any rate, no mention here of any
separation of a sensible and an intelligible realm, let alone of an
existence of ‘the holy itself’, as an entity existing in
splendid isolation from all particular cases of holiness.</p>

<p>
The passage in the <em>Euthyphro</em> where Socrates asks Euthyphro to
identify the one feature that is common to all that is holy or pious
makes intelligible, however, the reason why Plato felt encouraged to
develop the idea of transcendent Forms in dialogues that no longer
confine themselves to the ‘negative’ approach of
questioning the foundations or premises of other people’s
convictions. The requisite unity and invariance of entities such as
‘the holy’, ‘ the beautiful’, ‘the
just’ or ‘the equal’, necessarily prompts
reflections on their ontological status and on the appropriate means
of access to them. Given that they are the objects of definition and
the models of their ordinary representatives, there is every reason
not only to treat them as real, but also to assign to them a state of
higher perfection. And once this step has been taken, it is only
natural to make certain epistemological adjustments. For, access to
paradigmatic entities is not to be expected through ordinary
experience, but presupposes some special kind of intellectual insight.
It seems, then, that once Plato had accepted invariant and unitary
objects of thought as the objects of definition, he was predestined to
follow the path that let him adopt a metaphysics and epistemology of
transcendent Forms. The alternative of treating these objects as mere
constructs of the mind that more or less fit the manifold of everyday
experience, clearly was not to Plato’s taste. It would have
meant the renunciation of the claim to unassailable knowledge and
truth in favor of belief, conjecture, and, <em>horribile dictu</em>,
of human convention. The very fact that mathematics was already an
established science with rigorous standards and unitary and invariant
objects must have greatly enhanced Plato’s confidence in
applying the same standards to moral philosophy. It led him to search
for models of morality beyond the limits of everyday experience. This,
in turn, explains the development of his theory of recollection and
the postulate of transcendent immaterial objects as the basis of
reality and thought that he refers to in the <em>Meno</em>, and that
he presents more fully in the <em>Phaedo</em>.</p>

<p>
We do not know when, precisely, Plato adopted this mode of thought,
but it stands to reason that his contact with the Pythagorean school
on his first voyage to Southern Italy and Sicily around 390 BC played
a major role in this development. Mathematics as a model-science has
several advantages. It deals with unchangeable entities that have
unitary definitions. It also makes a plausible claim that the essence
of these entities cannot be comprehended in isolation but only in a
network of interconnections that have to be worked out at the same
time as each particular entity is defined. For instance, to understand
what it is to be a triangle, it is necessary – <em>inter
alia</em> – to understand the nature of points, lines, planes
and their interrelations. That Plato was aware of this fact is
indicated by his somewhat prophetic statement in his introduction of
the theory of recollection in the <em>Meno</em>, 81d: “As the
whole of nature is akin, and the soul has learned everything, nothing
prevents a man, after recalling one thing only – a process men
call learning – discovering everything else for himself, if he
is brave and does not tire of the search; for searching and learning,
are, as a whole, recollection (<em>anamnesis</em>).” The
somewhat mystifying claim of an ‘overall kinship’ is then
illuminated in the famous ‘mathematical experiment’
(<em>Me</em>. 82b–85c). The slave finally manages, with some
pushing and pulling by Socrates, and some illustrations drawn in the
sand, to double the area of a given square. In the course of this
interrogation, the disciple gradually discovers the relations between
the different lines, triangles, and squares. That Plato regards these
interconnections as crucial features of knowledge is confirmed later
by the distinction that Socrates draws between knowledge and true
belief (97b–98b). As Socrates argues, true beliefs are
unreliable, because they behave like ‘the statues of Daedalus
that easily run away as long as they are not tied down’. The
requisite ‘tying down’ happens (98a) “by giving an
account of the reason why. And that, Meno my friend, is recollection,
as we previously agreed. After they are tied down, in the first place,
they become knowledge, and then they remain in place.” This
explanation indicates that, according to Plato, knowledge does not
consist in a mental ‘gazing’ at isolated models, but
rather in uncovering the invariant relations that constitute the
objects in question. </p>

<p>
The complexity underlying Plato’s theory of the Forms as it is
first applied in the <em>Phaedo</em> is easily overlooked, because the
<em>Phaedo</em> initially suggests that that recollection is no more
than the grasping of concepts – the concept of ‘exact
equality in size’, for example, is prompted by the perception of
more or less equal-seeming sticks and stones (74a–e). Not only
that, the same is suggested by the list through which Socrates first
introduces the Forms, 65d–e: “Do we say that there is such
a thing as the Just itself or not? And the Beautiful, and the Good?
[…] I am speaking of all things such as Tallness, Health,
Strength, and in a word, the reality of all other things, that which
each of them essentially is.” Such an appeal to recollection
leaves a lot to be desired. How does it work? How can one ensure that
one’s intuitive grasp of these natures is correct? That the
‘recollection’ of isolated ideal objects is not the whole
story emerges later in the <em>Phaedo</em> when Socrates presents a
‘simple minded hypothesis’ of the Forms as a way to avoid
his difficulties with the causes of generation and destruction
(<em>Phd</em>. 99d–100e). The hypothesis he starts out with
seems simpleminded indeed, because it consists of nothing more than
the assumption that everything is what it is by participating in the
corresponding Form. But it soon turns out that more is at stake than
that simple postulate. First, the hypothesis of each respective Form
is to be tested by looking at the compatibility of its consequences.
Second, the hypothesis itself is to be secured by higher hypotheses,
until some satisfactory starting point is attained. Unfortunately,
Socrates explains neither the kinds of consequences nor of the kind of
‘satisfactory highest principle’ he has in mind, but
confines himself to the demand for an orderly procedure. The
distinctions that Socrates subsequently introduces in preparation of
his last proof of the immortality of the soul seem, however, to
provide some information about the procedure in question
(103d–107b). Socrates first introduces the distinction between
essential and non-essential attributes. This distinction is then
applied to the soul: because it always causes life in whatever it
occupies, it must have life as its essential property, which it cannot
lose. The soul is therefore incompatible with death and must be
‘deathless’ = immortal. The viability of this argument,
stripped here to its bare bones, need not engage us. The procedure
shows, at any rate, that Plato resorts to relations between Forms
here. The essential tie between the soul and life is clearly not open
to sense-perception; instead, understanding this tie takes a good deal
of reflection on what it means to be, and to have a soul. To admirers
of a two-world metaphysics, it may come as a disappointment that in
Plato, recollection should consist in no more than the uncovering of
such relationships. But this agrees well with the fact that with the
exception of such concepts of perfection as ‘the Good’ and
‘the Beautiful’, all of Plato’s examples in the
<em>Phaedo</em> are quite pedestrian. Not only does he confine himself
to concepts like ‘tallness’, ‘health’,
‘strength’ and ‘the equal as such’, –
thereby invoking objects that are familiar from every-day experience;
– but he also treats the fact that knowledge of their nature
cannot be derived from sense-perception alone as sufficient evidence
for the existence of the respective Forms, as he shows in the case of
equal-looking sticks and stones.</p>

<p>
Plato does not employ his newly established metaphysical entities as
the basis to work out a definitive conception of the human soul and
the appropriate way of life in the <em>Phaedo</em>. Rather, he
confines himself to warnings against the contamination of the soul by
the senses and their pleasures, and quite generally against corruption
by worldly values. He gives no advice concerning human conduct beyond
the recommendation of a general abstemiousness from worldly
temptations. This seems a rather austere picture of human life, and an
egocentric one, to boot, for nothing is said about relations between
human beings, beyond Socrates’ exhortations that his friends
should likewise take care of their souls as best they can. It is
unclear whether this otherworldly and ascetic attitude is the sign of
a particularly pessimistic period in Plato’s life or whether it
merely reflects the circumstances of the discussion –
Socrates’ impending death. But as long as this negative or
other-worldly attitude towards the physical side of human nature
prevails, no interest is to be expected on the part of Plato in nature
as a whole – let alone in the principles of the cosmic order
(but cf. 5.1 below). But it is not only Platonic asceticism that
stands in the way of such a wider perspective. Socrates himself seems
to have been quite indifferent to the study of nature. The
<em>Phaedo</em> admits that Socrates is unable to deal with the causes
of natural processes, and the <em>Apology</em> contains an energetic
denial of any concern with natural philosophy on Socrates’ side.
The accusations that depict him as “a student of all things in
the sky and below the earth” are quite false (18c); he has never
conversed on such issues at all, and the attribution to him of the
Anaxagorean tenet that the sun is stone and the moon earth is a sign
of his accusers’ recklessness (26d–e). And in a dialogue
as late as the <em>Phaedrus</em>, Socrates famously explains his
preference for the city and his avoidance of nature (230d):
“Landscapes and trees have nothing to teach me – only the
people in the city can do that.” That Plato is not distorting
the facts here is confirmed by the testimony of Xenophon, who is
equally emphatic about Socrates’ repudiation of the study of
heavenly phenomena and his concentration on human affairs
(<em>Memorabilia</em> I 1.15–16). If Plato later takes a much
more positive attitude towards nature in general, this is a
considerable change of focus. In the <em>Phaedo</em>, he quite
deliberately confines his account of the nature of heaven and earth to
the myth about the afterlife (108d–114c). As he states in
conclusion, this mythical depiction is not to be taken literally, but
as an encouragement to heed its moral message and to take care of
one’s soul (114d–e). This is as constructive as Plato gets
in his earlier discussions of the principles of ethics.</p>

<h2><a id="MidPerJusOthVir">3. The middle period: Justice and other virtues</a></h2>

<h3><a id="NeeNatHumBei">3.1 The needy nature of human beings</a></h3>

<p>
If Plato went through a period of open-ended experimentation, this
stage was definitely over when he wrote the <em>Republic</em>, the
central work of his middle years. Because of the
<em>Republic</em>’s importance a more detailed account will be
necessary, in order to explain the ethical principles set forth in
that work, for the principles are closely intertwined with political,
psychological, and metaphysical conceptions. That the work represents
a major change in Plato’s thinking is indicated already by the
dialogue’s setting. The aporetic controversy about justice in
the first book is set off quite sharply against the cooperative
discussion that is to follow in the remaining nine books. Like the
<em>Gorgias</em>, the first book of the <em>Republic</em> presents
three interlocutors who defend, with increasing vigor, their notion of
justice against Socrates’ <em>elenchos</em>. Of these disputes,
the altercation with the sophist Thrasymachus has received a lot of
attention, because he defends the provocative thesis that natural
justice is the right of the stronger, and that conventional justice is
at best high-minded foolishness. The arguments employed by Socrates at
the various turns of the discussion will not be presented here. Though
they reduce Thrasymachus to angry silence, they are not above
criticism. Socrates himself expresses dissatisfaction with the result
of this discussion <em>R</em>. 354c: “As far as I am concerned,
the result is that I know nothing, for when I don’t know what
justice is, I’ll hardly know whether it is a kind of virtue or
not, or whether a person who has it is happy or unhappy.” But
for once, the confession of <em>aporia</em> is not the end of the
discussion. Two members of the audience, Plato’s brothers
Glaucon and Adeimantus, challenge Socrates: Perhaps Thrasymachus has
defended his case badly, but if Socrates wants to convince his
audience, he must do better than that. The brothers demand a positive
account of what justice is, and of what it does to the soul of its
possessor.</p>

<p>
The change of character in the ensuing discussion is remarkable. Not
only are the two brothers not subjected to <em>elenchos</em>, they get
ample time to elaborate on their objections (357a–367e). Though
they are not themselves convinced that injustice is better than
justice, they argue that in the present state of society injustice
pays – with the gods as well as with men – as long as the
semblance of respectability is preserved. To prove this claim the
brothers play devil’s advocate by unfolding a scathing picture
of their society’s attitude towards justice. As the story of the
Ring of Gyges and its gift of invisibility proves, everyone who does
not have a god-like character will eventually succumb to such a
ring’s temptations (359c–360d). Instead of the wolf of
Thrasymachus’ account, it is the fox who is the paragon of
injustice. He will succeed at every level because he knows how to play
the power game with cunning. The just man, by contrast, pays no heed
to mere semblance of goodness, rather than its substance,and therefore
suffers a Christ-like fate, because he does not comply with the
demands of favoritism and blandishment (361e). Even the gods, as the
poets allegedly confirm, are on the side of the successful scoundrel,
since they can be propitiated by honors and sacrifices. Given this
state of affairs, a logic-chopping argument that justice is better
than injustice is quite insufficient for the brothers (367b–e:
<em>logôi</em>). Instead, Socrates should show what effect each
of them have on the soul of their possessors. Plato at this point
clearly regards refutation as an insufficient method of making true
converts; whether he ever had such confidence in the power of
refutation must remain a moot point. But the <em>Republic</em> shows
that the time had come for a positive account of morality and the good
life. If <em>elenchos</em> is used in Plato’s later dialogues,
it is never again used in the knock-down fashion of the early
dialogues. It should be pointed out, however, that in his treatment of
justice Plato does not resort to the theory of Forms. Instead, he
offers a political and psychological solution to the problem of
justice. That a metaphysical solution is possible is indicated only
briefly and enigmatically, when Plato speaks of a ‘longer
way’ that would also have been possible for him to take (435d;
504b)</p>

<p>
A brief sketch of Plato’s approach to his inquiry into the
nature of justice must suffice here, to make intelligible his
distinction of justice from the other kinds of virtue, and their role
in the good life. This question is addressed in a quite circuitous
way. Justice is first to be studied in the ‘larger text’
of the state, rather than in the hard-to-decipher ‘small
text’ of the soul. A study of how a city comes to be will
supposedly reveal the origin of justice and injustice (369a). Its
founding principle is – at least at first – not
high-minded concern, but mutual economic <em>need</em>: “A city
comes to be because none of us is self-sufficient
(<em>autarkês</em>), but we all need many things. … And
because people need many things, and because one person calls on a
second out of one need and on a third out of a different need
(<em>chreia</em>), many people gather in a single place to live
together as partners and helpers.” The ‘need’ is, at
least at this point, purely economic. The minimal city is based on the
need for food, clothing, shelter, and for the requisite tools.
Economic efficiency dictates the adoption of the principle of the
‘division of functions’: It is best if everyone performs
the task s/he is naturally most fit for. This principle determines not
only the structure of the minimal, self-subsistent state of farmers
and craftsmen, but also the subsequent separation of the city’s
inhabitants into three classees in the ‘maximal state’
that caters to higher demands. For a more luxurious city needs
protection by a professional army as well as the leadership of a class
of philosopher-kings and -queens. Beyond the claim that the division
of functions is more economical, Plato gives no justification for this
fateful decision that determines the social order in the state, as
well as the nature of the virtues. Human beings are not born alike,
but with different abilities that predestine them for different tasks
in a well-ordered state. This leads to Plato’s rule: ‘one
person – one job’ (<em>R</em>. 370a–c; 423d).</p>

<p>
Because the division of functions paves the way for the definition of
justice as ‘doing your own thing’ in Book IV
(432d–433b), it is necessary to briefly review the kind of
social order Plato has in mind, the psychological principles he
assumes, and the political institutions by which that order is to be
attained. For this explains not only the establishment of a
three-class society and the corresponding structure of the soul, but
also Plato’s theory of education and its metaphysical
underpinnings. That economic needs are the basis of the political
structure does not, of course, mean that they are the only human needs
Plato recognizes. It indicates, however, that the emphasis here is on
the unity and self-sufficiency of a well-structured city, not on the
well-being of the individual (423c–e; 425c). This focus should
be kept in mind when assessing the ‘totalitarianism’ and
rigorous cultural conservatism of Plato’s political
philosophy.</p>

<p>
The need for a professionally trained army leads to the discussion of
education and moral psychology, because the preservation of internal
peace and external security presupposes the combination of two
different character-traits among the ‘guardians’
(‘the philosophical watchdogs’, 375d–376c):
friendliness towards their fellow-citizens and fierceness towards
their enemies. The injunctions concerning their appropriate education
are very detailed, because it must combine the right kind of
‘muses’ (poetry, music, and other fine arts) with the
appropriate physical training to develop the right temperament and
attitude in the soldiers (376d–403d). The ‘muses’
come in for protracted criticism, both in content and form. All
stories that undermine respect towards the gods are to be banned,
along with tales that instill fear of death in the guardians. The
imitation of bad persons is forbidden, as are depictions of varieties
of character, quite generally. Analogous injunctions apply,
<em>mutandis mutatis</em>, to the modes and rhythms in music and to
painting. Physical exercise must suit the harmonious soul and
therefore must not exceed what is healthy and necessary
(403e–412b). Because the educational scheme is geared to secure
a harmonious and yet spirited class of soldiers, Plato bans from his
city most of the cultural achievements that were his
contemporaries’ pride and joy. There must be nothing to disturb
the citizens’ willingness to fulfill their tasks. The
supervision of education is the function of the third class, the
rulers of the city (412b–417b). They are to be selected through
tests of intelligence and character from among the soldiers, to
identify individuals who are unshakable in their conviction that their
own well-being is intimately tied to that of the city. To ensure that
members of the ruling and military classes retain their right attitude
towards their civic duties, members of both classes must lead a
communal life, without private homes, families, or property. His
interlocutor’s objection that such a life is not apt to make
these citizens happy (419a) is the first approach to the topic of
happiness, but it is quickly brushed aside at this point on the
grounds that the political order is designed to make the entire city
happy, rather than any particular group.</p>

<h3><a id="VirStaSou">3.2 Virtues of state and soul</a></h3>

<p>
The division of functions that leads to the separation of the three
classes for the purpose of achieving the social conditions for justice
concludes the discussion of the social order (427d–434c). The
somewhat peculiar manner in which Socrates further develops his
explation of the nature of justice can be understood with reference to
this concluding discussion. The catalogue of what in later tradition
has been dubbed ‘the four cardinal Platonic virtues’
– wisdom, courage, moderation, and justice – is first
presented without comment. Piety, as the text indicates, is no longer
treated as a virtue, for religious practices should be left to
tradition and the oracle of Apollo at Delphi (427b–c). The
definition of justice is to be discovered by a process of elimination.
If there are four virtues in the city, then justice must be the one
that is left over after the other three have been identified (427e).
There is no proof offered that there are exactly four virtues in a
state, nor that they are items that can be lifted up, singly, for
inspection, like objects from a basket. Instead, Socrates points out
the role they play in the maintenance of the social order. About
wisdom (<em>sophia</em>), the only purely intellectual virtue and the
exclusive possession of the rulers (428b–429a), little more is
said at this point than that it is ‘good council’
(<em>euboulia</em>) in decisions about the internal and external
affairs of the city. Courage (<em>andreia</em>) is the soldiers’
specific virtue (429a–430c). Socrates takes some trouble
explaining its nature, because it is a mixture of belief
(<em>doxa</em>) and steadfastness of character
(<em>sôtêria</em>). It is compared to colorfast wool:
through thick and thin the guardians must be dyed-in-the-wool
adherents to the laws’ decrees about what is to be feared.
Moderation (<em>sôphrosunê</em>) (430d–432a) is not
an intellectual excellence either, but rather a combination of belief
with a certain disposition to support order. It is a conviction
(<em>doxa</em>, 431e) shared by all classes about who should rule
– a conviction based on a state of ‘order’
(<em>kosmos</em>), ‘consonance’ (<em>sumphônia</em>)
and ‘harmony’ (<em>harmonia</em>) in and through which the
better class in the state controls the pleasures and desires of the
lower class. The third class, then, has no specific virtue of its own.
The identification of justice, the virtue that is left over, is due to
a sudden ‘discovery’ on Socrates’ part
(432d–434c) that justice is the principle that has been at work
all along in the founding of the model state – namely that
everyone is to “do their own thing and not meddle with that of
another” (433a). At first sight, it seems hard to tell how
justice differs from moderation as a “consonance about who
should rule and be ruled.” Justice as “doing your own
thing” may represent a more active state of mind with a wider
extension, given that its task is also to see to it that “no
citizen should have what belongs to another or be deprived of what is
his own” (433e). But since Socrates does not elaborate on the
dispositions of justice and moderation any further, there seems to be
only a fine line between the functions of justice and moderation in
the city. That there are four virtues rather than three probably also
reflects the fact that this catalogue of four was a fixture in
tradition. As will emerge in connection with the virtues in the
individual soul, the distinction between justice and moderation is far
less problematic in the case of the individual than in that of the
city as a whole, because in the individual soul, internal self-control
and external self-restraint are clearly different attitudes. As this
survey shows, the virtues are no longer confined to knowledge. They
also contain right beliefs and attitudes of harmony and compliance
– extensions that are apt to make up for deficiencies in the
explanation of certain virtues in earlier dialogues.</p>

<p>
The promise to establish the isomorphic structure of the city and soul
has not been forgotten. After the definition and assignment of the
four virtues to the three classes of the city, the investigation turns
to the role and function of the virtues in the soul. The soul is held
to consist of three parts , corresponding to the three classes in the
city. The lengthy argument for the tri-partition of the soul into a
rational (<em>logistikon</em>), a spirited (<em>thumoeides</em>), and
an appetitive (<em>epithumêtikon</em>) part (434d–441c),
can here be neither reproduced nor subjected to critical evaluation.
That Plato lets Socrates express reservations concerning the adequacy
of his own procedure (435c–d), despite his unusually circumspect
way of justifying his division of the soul’s faculties,
indicates that he regards it as an important innovation. Indeed, there
is no indication of separate parts of the soul in any of the earlier
dialogues; irrational desires are attributed to the influence of the
body. In the <em>Republic</em>, by contrast, the soul itself becomes
the source of the appetites and desires. The difference between the
rational and the appetitive part is easily justified, because the
opposition between the decrees of reason and the various kinds of
unreasonable desires is familiar to everyone (438d–439e). The
existence of a third, a ‘spirited’ or courageous part
– different from reason and desire – is harder to prove.
But the phenomenon of moral indignation is treated as evidence for a
psychic force that is reducible neither to reason nor to any of the
appetites; it is rather an ally of reason in a well-ordered soul, a
force opposed to unruly appetites (439e–441c). This concludes
the proof that there are three parts in the soul corresponding to the
three classes in the city – namely the rational part in the
wisdom of the rulers, the spirited part, which is manifested in the
courage of the soldiers, the appetitive part, which is manifested in
the rest of the population, whose defining motivation is material
gain. </p>

<p>
The discussion of the division of the soul sets the stage for
Socrates’ final contrast of of justice with injustice: In the
city there is justice if the members of the three classes mind their
own business; in the individual soul, justice likewise consists in
each part fulfilling its own function. This presupposes that the two
upper parts have been given the right kind of training and education
in order to control the appetitive part (441d–442a). The three
other virtues are then assigned to the respective parts of the soul.
Courage is the excellence of the spirited part, wisdom belongs to the
rational part, and moderation is the consent of all three about who
should rule and who should obey. Justice turns out to be the overall
unifying quality of the soul (443c–e). For, the just person not
only refrains from meddling with what is not his, externally, but also
harmonizes the three parts of the soul internally. While justice is
order and harmony, injustice is its opposite: it is a rebellion of one
part of the city or soul against the others, and an inappropriate rule
of the inferior parts. Justice and injustice in the soul are, then,
analogous to health and illness in the body. This comparison suffices
to bring the investigation to its desired result. If justice is health
and harmony of the soul, then injustice must be disease and disorder.
Hence, it is clear that justice is a good state of the soul that makes
its possessor happy, and injustice is its opposite. Just as no-one in
his right mind would prefer to live with a ruined body so no-one would
prefer to live with a diseased soul. In principle, the discussion of
justice has therefore reached its promised goal at the end of Book IV.
Socrates has met Glaucon’s and Adeimantus’ challenge to
prove that justice is a good, in and by itself, for the soul of its
possessor, and preferable to injustice. </p>

<p>
That the discussion does not end here but occupies six more books, is
due most of all to several loose ends that need to be tied up. Apart
from the fact that reason and order are to reign supreme, little has
been said about the citizens’ way of life. This gap will be
filled, at least in part, by the description of the communal life
without private property and family in Book V. More importantly,
nothing has been said about the rulers and their particular kind of
knowledge. This is a crucial point because, as the definitions of the
three ‘inferior’ virtues show, their quality is contingent
on the rulers’ wisdom. Socrates addresses this problem with the
provocative thesis (473c–d): “Until philosophers rule as
kings or those who are now called kings and leaders genuinely and
adequately philosophize ... cities will have no rest from evils, nor
will the human race.” This thesis starts the discussion of the
philosophers’ knowledge, and of their upbringing and education,
which will continue through Books VI and VII. Because they also
introduce the special objects of the philosophers’ knowledge,
these books provide the metaphysical underpinning of the entire
conception of the good state and of the good soul. For the ‘Form
of the Good’ turns out to be the ultimate source of all being
and knowledge. A short summary of the upshot of the educational
program must suffice here. The future philosophers, both women and
men, are selected from the group of guardians whose general cultural
training they share. If they combine moral firmness with quickness of
mind, they are subject to a rigorous curriculum of higher learning
that will prepare them for the ascent from the world of the senses to
the world of intelligence and truth, an ascent whose stages are summed
up in the similes of the Sun, the Line, and the Cave
(508a–518b). To achieve this ascent, the students have to
undergo, first, a preparatory schooling of ten years’ duration
in the ‘liberal arts’: arithmetic, geometry, astronomy,
and theoretical harmonics (518c–531c). Afterwards they are
admitted to the training in the master-science of
‘dialectic’, a science of which little more is said beyond
the indication that it enables its possessor to deal in a systematic
way with the objects of real knowledge – the Forms in general,
– and with the Form of the Good, – the principle of the
goodness of all else, – in particular (531c–535a). This
study is to last for another five years. Successful candidates are
then sent back into the Cave as administrators of ordinary political
life for about 15 years. At the age of fifty the rulers are granted
the pursuit of philosophy, an activity that is interrupted by periods
of service as overseers of the order of the state. This completes, in
a nutshell, the description of the philosopher-kings’ and
-queens’ education and activities (539d–541b).</p>

<p>
This design of an autocratic rule by an aristocracy of the mind has
received a lot of flak; but an assessment of Plato’s politics
must here be limited to the kind of happiness it supposedly provides.
Regardless of whether or not we accept his overall principle of the
Good as the basis of the political order, Plato’s model state
has, at least in theory, the advantage that it guarantees external and
internal peace. That is no mean feat in a society where external and
civil wars were a constant threat, and often enough ended in the
destruction of the entire city. The division of functions guarantees a
high degree of efficiency, if every citizen does what he/she is
naturally suited to do. But what about the citizens’ needs,
beyond those for security and material goods? Are they to find their
life’s fulfillment in the pursuit of their jobs only? Plato
seems to think so; he characterizes each class by its specific kind of
desire and its respective good (581c): the philosophers are lovers of
wisdom (<em>philosophoi</em>), the soldiers lovers of honor
(<em>philotimoi</em>), and the workers are lovers of material goods
(<em>philochrêmatoi</em>). That human beings find, or at least
try to find, satisfaction in the kinds of goods they cherish is a
point further pursued in the depiction of the decay of the city and
its ruling citizens, from the best – the aristocracy of the mind
– down to the worst – the tyranny of lust, in Books VIII
and IX. A discussion of the tenability of this explanation of
political and psychological decadence will not be attempted here. It
is supposed to show that all inferior forms of government of city and
soul are doomed to fail because of the inherent tensions between the
goods that are aimed for.</p>

<p>
Some comments on Plato’s conception of happiness are in order,
however. He clearly goes on the assumption that human beings are happy
insofar as they achieve the goals they cherish. Though this notion
seems to come close to the ‘preference satisfaction’ for
all citizens that is nowadays regarded as the primary aim of every
liberal state, Plato’s restriction of each class to one type of
good remains objectionable, most obviously in the case of the citizens
of the third class who supposedly covet nothing but material goods.
This ‘reductive’ view of their human nature militates not
only against present-day intuitions: It should also militate against
Plato’s own moral psychology, in that all human souls consist of
three parts – a rational, a spirited, and an appetitive part
– whose health and harmony constitute the soul’s and the
state’s happiness. Why, then, reduce the third class to
animal-like creatures with low appetites, as suggested by the
comparison of the people to a strong beast that must be placated
(493a–c)? This comparison is echoed later in the comparison of
the soul to a multiform beast, where reason just barely controls the
hydra-like heads of the appetites, and then only with the aid of a
lion-like spirit (588c–590d). Is Plato thereby giving vent to
anti-democratic sentiments, showing contempt for the rabble, as has
often been claimed? He can at least be cleared of the suspicion that
the workers are mere serfs of the upper classes, because he explicitly
grants them the free enjoyment of all the customary goods that he has
denied to the upper classes (419a): “Others own land, build fine
big houses, acquire furnishings to go along with them, make their own
private sacrifices to the gods, entertain guests, and also, of course,
possess what you were talking about just now, gold and silver and all
the things that are thought to belong to people who are blessedly
happy.” But apart from such liberties, the members of the third
class are quite neglected in Plato’s ideal city. Apparently no
education is provided for them, for there is no suggestion that they
participate in the guardians’ musical and athletic training, and
there is no mention that obedience to the rulers’ commands
cannot be the only source of happiness for the third class. Plato
seems to sidestep his own insight that all human beings have an
immortal soul and have to take care of it as best they can, as he not
only demands in the <em>Phaedo</em> but is going to confirm in a
fanciful way in the Myth of Er at the end of <em>Republic</em> Book
X.</p>

<p>
The life-style designated for the upper classes also seems open to
objections. The soldiers’ musical and physical training is
strictly regimented; they must take satisfaction in the obedience to
the laws for the sake of preserving the city’s inner and outer
peace, and in deeds of valor in war. Theirs is an austere camp-life;
not all of them will be selected for higher education. But even the
philosophers’ lives leave a lot to be desired, and not only
because they have to starve their common human appetites and devote
many years to administrative duties back in the ‘Cave’.
Their intellectual pursuits are also not entirely enviable, as a
closer inspection would show. Not only do the philosophers have two
jobs – in violation of the rule ‘one person – one
function’ – in that they are responsible for both
administrative work and philosophical reflection: They are also not to
enjoy open-ended research, but are rather subject to a mental training
that is explicitly designed to turn their minds away from the
enjoyment of all worldly beauty in order to focus exclusively on the
contemplation of the Forms. This is indicated in the injunctions
concerning the study of astronomy and harmonics (529a–531d). The
students are not to crane their necks to watch the beauty of the
“embroidery in the heavens”, but rather to concern
themselves with the ideal motions of ideal moving bodies in a purely
geometrical fashion, and they are not to listen to audible sounds, but
to attend to the mathematics of harmonics. The universe is not treated
as an admirable cosmos, with the explicit purpose of providing moral
and intellectual support to the citizens, in the way Plato is going to
state in the <em>Timaeus</em> and in the <em>Laws</em>. Given these
limitations of the philosophers’ mental exercises in the
<em>Republic</em>, the claim that their lives are 729 times more
pleasant than the tyrants’ (IX 587e) seems like a gross
exaggeration, even if they enjoy the pleasures of being filled with
pure and unadulterated truths while everyone else enjoys only
semblances of the really real (581e–588a).</p>

<p>
For all the advances that the <em>Republic</em> represents in some
respects, Plato’s ideal city seems to us far from ideal. The
system resembles a well-oiled machine where everyone has their
appointed function and economic niche; but its machine-like character
seems repellent, given that no deviations are permitted from the
prescribed pattern. If innovations are forbidden, no room seems to be
left for creativity and personal development. Plato seems to
presuppose that the fulfillment of a person’s function is
sufficient to secure her happiness, or at least that is suggested by
the ‘functional’ argument that defeats Thrasymachus
(352d–354a). It states that every object, animal, and person has
a specific function or work (<em>ergon</em>). If it performs its
function well, it does well: for a living thing, ‘doing
well’ means ‘living well’ and living well is
tantamount to living happily. Though Socrates’ refutation of
Thrasymachus is found wanting as a proof of justice’s
superiority, the <em>ergon</em>-argument is nowhere revoked. On the
contrary, it is affirmed by the principle of ‘one person –
one job’ that is the basis of Plato’s ideal city. But it
seems rather inhumane to confine everyone’s activities to just
<em>one</em> kind of work, even if such confinement may be most
economical and efficient. These features suffice to make the ideal
life in Plato’s city unpalatable to us, not to speak of certain
other features that have not been explored here, such as the communal
life envisaged for the upper classes, and the assignment of sexual
partnerships by lotteries that are rigged for reasons of eugenics. The
feature that must strike us as strangest about Plato’s depiction
of his citizens’ lives is that he does not even emphasize the
<em>one</em> factor that could throw a more favorable light on his
social order – that each citizen will take pride and joy in
their work and its products, given that these are to be regarded, each
in their own way, as valuable contributions to the community’s
well-being. This applies especially to the members of the third class
– tailors, carpenters, doctors, architects, sailors, and all
those who are summed up rather ungraciously under the epithet of
‘money-lovers’ — because they, after all, produce
the city’s material goods, whithout which the city could not
function or exist.</p>

<p>
Has this fact escaped Plato’s notice, alongside other
deficiencies of his blue-print of an ideal city? Against all these
complaints, justified as they must seem, it should be pointed out that
Plato clearly is not concerned with the conditions that would make his
city ‘livable’. His aim is rather more limited: He wants
to present a <em>model</em>, and to work out its essential features.
The same explanation applies to his depiction of the city’s and
its citizens’ decay in Books VIII and IX. Contrary to many
critics’ assumptions, Plato is not there trying to predict and
explain the course of history. Rather, he wants to explain the
generation and decay typical of each political system and the
psychopathology of its leaders. Plato finds the basis of both in the
‘values’ – be they honor, money, freedom, or lust
– that are embedded in he constitutions of the different types
of state. It is unlikely that Plato presupposes that there are pure
representatives of these types, though some historical states may have
come closer to being representatives than others. Given that
Plato’s aim is to work out the model of a well-functioning
state, he does not and need not concern himself with softening the
features of his bare sketch of the decay of the city and of the souls
of the citizens due to their inherent tensions. If his decision to
concentrate on a model explains certain inhumane features of
Plato’s political vision, are there any indications that he was
aware of the limitations that he imposed on his ‘political
animals’ by confining them to just one function in an
efficiently run community? Was Plato aware of the fact that his
black-and-white picture of civic life in his model state disregards
the claim of individuals to have their own aims and ends, and not to
be treated like automata, with no thoughts and wishes of their own?
Though the <em>Republic</em> contains some suggestions that would
mitigate this bleak picture, for the sake of balancing this picture,
it is more fruitful, to look at other works of Plato’s middle
period that concentrate on and prioritize the conditions of the
individual soul rather than focus on the demands of the community.
These works are the <em>Symposium</em> and the <em>Phaedrus</em>. For
though each dialogue should be studied as a unity of its own, it is
also necessary to treat the individual dialogues as part of a wider
picture.</p>

<h2><a id="LatDiaEthDia">4. The later dialogues: Ethics and Dialectic</a></h2>

<h3><a id="HapDesForSelCom">4.1 Happiness and the desire for self-completion</a></h3>

<p>
The <em>Symposium</em> and the <em>Phaedrus</em> are two dialogues
that focus on the individual soul and pay no attention to communal
life at all. Instead, they concentrate on self-preservation,
self-improvement, and self-completion. The <em>Symposium</em> is often
treated as a dialogue that predates the <em>Republic</em>, most of all
because it mentions neither the immortality nor the tripartition of
the soul. But its dramatic staging – the praise of Eros by a
company of symposiasts – is not germane to the otherworldly and
ascetic tendencies of the <em>Gorgias</em> and the <em>Phaedo</em>. In
addition, Plato has good reasons for leaving aside a discussion of the
separation of the soul’s faculties in the <em>Symposium</em>,
because he aims to show that love is an incentive, not only for all
humans, but also for other living beings. Contrary to all other
speakers, Socrates denies that Eros is a god, because the gods are in
a state of perfection. Love, by contrast, is a desire of the needy for
the beautiful and the good (199c–201c). Socrates thereby
corrects the previous speakers’ confusion of love with the
beloved object. This insight is presented not as Socrates’ own,
but as the upshot of a ‘lecture on the nature of love by the
wise Diotima’ (201d–212b): Eros is a powerful demon, a
being between the mortal and the immortal, an eternally needy hunter
of the beautiful. Human beings share that demonic condition; for they
are neither good nor bad, but desire the good and the beautiful, the
possession of which would constitute happiness for them. Because all
people want happiness, they pursue the good as well as they can
(205a–206b). In each case they desire the particular kinds of
objects that they hope will fulfill their needs. Such fulfillment is
not a passive possession; it is rather the objects of love are deemed
to be essential in the struggle for self-preservation,
self-completion, and self-fulfillment (207d): “For among animals
the principle is the same as with us, and mortal nature seeks so far
as possible to live forever and be immortal. And this is possible in
one way only: by reproduction, because it leaves behind a new young
one in place of the old.” There is, then, a constant need for
self-restoration and self-improvement by procreation in the quest for
earthly immortality. In the case of human beings this need expresses
itself in different ways. The search for
‘self-eternalization’ may result in, or even be fulfilled
by, the production of biological children or of so-called
‘children of the mind’ (e.g. works of the arts), or even
by the creation of order in cities that are then guided by the virtues
of justice and moderation (209a–e). Diotima’s lecture is
finally crowned by a depiction of the famous <em>scala amoris</em>
– Diotima’s explanation of the refinement and sublimation
that a person experiences when recognizing higher and higher kinds of
beauty (210a–212a). Starting with the love of one beautiful
body, the individual gradually learns to appreciate not only all
physical beauty, but also the beauty of the mind, and in the end she
gets a glimpse of the supreme kind of beauty, namely the Form of the
Beautiful itself – a beauty that is neither relative, nor
changeable, nor a matter of degree.</p>

<p>
Because beauty of the higher kind is tied to virtue, and is attained
by the comprehension of what is common in laws and public
institutions, it is clear that Plato does not have purely aesthetic
values in mind, but principles of good order that are ultimately tied
to the Form of the Beautiful/Good. The difference between the
<em>Republic</em>’s and the <em>Symposium</em>’s accounts
lies in the fact that the <em>scala amoris</em> treats physical beauty
as an incentive to the higher and better, an incentive that in
principle affects every human being. There is no talk of a painful
liberation from the bonds of the senses, or of a turn-around of the
entire soul that is reserved only for the better educated. Brief as
the <em>Symposium</em>’s explanation of happiness is, it shows
three things: First, all human beings aim for their own
self-preservation and -completion. Second, this drive finds its
expression in the products of their work, in creativity. Third, their
respective activities are instigated by each person’s own
particular desire for the beautiful. There is no indication that
individuals must act as part of a community. Though the communitarian
aspect of the good and beautiful comes to the fore in the high praise
of the products of the legendary legislators (209e–210a), the
ultimate assent to the Beautiful itself is up to the individual. The
message of the <em>Symposium</em> is not unique in Plato’s
works. The <em>Lysis</em> shares its basic assumption concerning the
intermediary state of human nature between good and bad, and regards
<em>need</em> as the basis of friendship. Due to the aporetic
character of that dialogue, its lesson remains somewhat obscure, but
it is obvious enough that it shares the <em>Symposium’s</em>
general anthropological presuppositions. </p>

<p>
The idea that <em>eros</em> is the incentive to sublimation and
self-completion is worked out further in the <em>Phaedrus</em>.
Although the close relationship between the two dialogues is generally
acknowledged, the <em>Phaedrus</em> is commonly regarded as a much
later work. For not only does it accept the <em>Republic’s</em>
psychological doctrine of a tri-partite soul, it also advocates the
immortality of the soul – doctrines that are conspicuously
absent in the <em>Symposium</em>. But this difference seems due to a
difference in perspective rather than to a change of mind. The
discussion in the <em>Symposium</em> is deliberately confined to the
conditions of self-immortalization <em>in</em> this life, while the
<em>Phaedrus</em> takes the discussion beyond the confines of this
life. If it shares the <em>Republic’s</em> doctrine of a
division of the soul into three parts, it does so for reasons of its
own: The three parts of the soul in the <em>Phaedrus</em> are not
supposed to justify the separation of people into three classes. They
explain, rather, the different routes taken by individuals in their
search for beauty and their levels of success. If the
<em>Phaedrus</em> goes beyond the <em>Symposium</em>, it does so in
order to show how the enchantment of beauty can be combined with an
element of Plato’s philosophy that seems quite alien to the
notions of self-improvement and sublimation through the love of
beauty. That element is abruptly identified as <em>dialectic</em>, the
systematic method of collection and division that is characteristic of
Plato’s later work. At first sight, it might seem that the
dialogue’s topic, Eros, is hardly the right tie to keep together
the dialogue’s two disparate parts – i.e. the highly
poetical depiction of the enchantment of beauty, and Plato’s
subsequent, quite pedestrian methodological explanations of the
presuppositions of rhetoric. But although the coherence of the
<em>Phaedrus</em> cannot be argued for in full here, the notion that
the <em>Phaedrus</em> is disjointed does not do justice to the
dialogue’s careful composition and overall aim. </p>

<p>
Rhetoric, its purpose and value, is in fact the dialogue’s topic
right from the start. The misuse of rhetoric is exemplified by the
speech attributed to the orator Lysias, a somewhat contrived plea to
favor a non-lover rather than a lover. Socrates’ retort points
up Lysias’ presuppositions – that love is a kind of
sickness, an irrational craving for the pleasures of the body; that a
lover tries to dominate and enslave the beloved physically, materially
and mentally, and, most importantly, that the lover tries to deprive
the beloved of philosophy. Once restored to his senses the lover will
shun his former beloved and break all his promises. This one-sided
view of Eros is corrected in Socrates’ second speech: Eros,
properly understood, is not a diseased state of mind, but a kind of
‘divine madness’ (<em>theia mania</em>). To explain the
nature of this madness, Socrates employs the comparison of the
tripartite soul to a charioteer with a pair winged horses, an obedient
white one and an unruly black one. The crucial difference between the
<em>Phaedrus</em>’ tripartition and that in the
<em>Republic</em> lies in in this: instead of a painful liberation
through education, the <em>Phaedrus</em> envisages a liberation
through the uplifting force of love, a love that is – just as it
is in the <em>Symposium</em> – instigated by physical beauty.
That is what first makes the soul grow wings and soar in the pursuit
of a corresponding deity, to the point where it may attain godlike
insights. The best-conditioned souls – those where the
charioteer has full control over his horses – get a glimpse of
true being, including the nature of the virtues and of the good
(247c–e). Depending on the quality of each soul, the quality of
the beauty pursued will also determine the cycle of reincarnations
that is in store for each soul after death (248c–249c). </p>

<h3><a id="QueForMet">4.2 The quest for method</a></h3>

<p>
What is remarkable in the <em>Phaedrus</em>’ picture of the
uplifting effect of beauty is not only its exuberant tone and imagery,
which goes far beyond the <em>Symposium’s</em> unadorned
<em>scala amoris</em>, but also its intricate interweaving of mythical
and philosophical elements. For in the midst of his fanciful depiction
of the different fates that are in store for different kinds of souls,
Plato specifies, in quite technical terms, that the capacity “to
understand speech in terms of general Forms, proceeding to bring many
perceptions together into a reasoned unity”, (249b–c), is
the condition for the reincarnation of dead individuals as human
beings. It is this capacity for abstract thought that he then calls
“recollection of what the soul saw when it was traveling with
god, when it disregarded the things we now call real and lifted up its
head to what is truly real instead.” The heavenly adventure
seems to amount to no more than the employment of the dialectical
method that Socrates is going to describe, without further mythical
camouflage, in the dialogue’s second part. The ability to
establish unity in a given subject-matter, and to divide it up
according to its natural kinds, is the art that characterizes the
‘scientific rhetorician’ (265d–266b). Socrates
professes the greatest veneration for such a master: “If I
believe that someone is capable of discerning a single thing that is
also by nature capable of encompassing many, I follow ‘straight
behind, in his tracks, as if he were a god’.” So the
heavenly voyage has a quite down-to-earth counterpart in the
dialectical method – a method that Plato regards, as he is going
to confirm in the <em>Philebus</em>, as a ‘gift of the
gods’. At the same time, Plato’s esteem for taxonomy
explains the inner unity of the <em>Phaedrus</em>’ seemingly
incongruous two parts as two sides of one coin, and it also shows why
Plato no longer treats the sensory as a distraction and disturbance of
the mind <em>per se</em>. For the properly conditioned souls’
sensory impressions are its first incentives to the higher and
better.</p>

<p>
What concept of happiness is suggested by this ‘inspired’
view of human life? The individual does not find her or his
fulfillment in peaceful interactions in a harmonious community.
Instead, life is spent in the perennial pursuit of the higher and
better. But in that task the individual is not alone; she shares that
task with kindred spirits. The message of the the <em>Symposium</em>
and the <em>Phaedrus</em> is therefore two-pronged. On the one hand,
there is no permanent attainment of happiness as a stable state of
completion in this life. In the ups and downs of life (and of the
afterlife), humans are in constant need of beauty as an incentive to
aim for their own completion. Humans are neither god-like nor wise; at
best, they are god-lovers and philosophers, demonic hunters for truth
and goodness. To know is not to have; and to have once is not to have
forever. In the <em>Symposium</em>, Diotima states in no uncertain
terms that humans have a perennial need to replenish what they lose,
both in body and soul, because they are mortal and changeable
creatures, and the <em>Phaedrus</em> confirms the need for continued
efforts, for the heavenly voyage is not a one-time affair. On the
other hand, the second part of he message conveyed is that the pursuit
of the good and the beautiful is not a lonely enterprise. As the
<em>Phaedrus</em> makes clear, love for a beautiful human being is an
incentive to search for a higher form of life, as a sacred joint
journey of two friends in communion (255a–256e). The need for,
and also the possibility of, constant self-completion and -repletion
is a motive that will also reappear in the ethical thought of
Plato’s late works, a motif he sometimes presents as the maxim
that humans should aim at the ‘likening of oneself to
god’, (<em>homoiôsis theôi</em> <em>Theaetetus</em>
176b; <em>Timaeus</em> 90c).</p>

<p>
Sober philosophers have a tendency to ignore such visionary talk as
too elevated and lacking in substance to be worth serious thought.
That Plato, appearances notwithstanding, is not indulging in a
god-besotted <em>rêverie</em> in the <em>Phaedrus</em> is
indicated by his interweaving of the mythical description in the
dialogue’s first part, and his description and exploration of
the dialectical method in the later part (259e-279c), where Socrates
attempts to determine the requirements of ‘scientific
rhetoric’ (259e–279c). Artful speaking (and even artful
deception) presupposes knowledge of the truth, especially where the
identity of the phenomena is difficult to grasp, because similarities
can be deceptive. This applies in particular to concepts like the good
and the just, as witnessed by the wide disagreement about their nature
(263a–c). The development of the ‘sharp eye’ that is
needed to assign each object to the right class is the aim of
Plato’s method of collection and division, a method on which he
expounds at some length in the <em>Phaedrus</em>. Plato discusses the
care that is needed in order to (265d–e) “see together
things that are scattered about everywhere, and to collect them into
one kind (<em>mia idea</em>)”, as well as “to cut the
unity up again according to its species along its natural joints, and
to try not to splinter any part, as a bad butcher might do.”
That this method is supposed to serve an overall ethical purpose is
confirmed by the fact that rhetoric based on truth must reflect the
speaker’s knowlege not only of the different types of souls and
the types of speech that fit them (271d), but also of the truth about
just and good things (272d).</p>

<p>
That dialectic is geared to this end is somewhat obscured in the
subsequent discussion in the <em>Phaedrus</em>. First of all, Plato
turns away from this issue in his long depiction of the iniquities of
contemporary rhetoricians, when he constrasts their efforts with
scientific rhetoric. And Plato continues this excursion with a
discussion of speaking and writing, culminating in his famous
‘critique of writing’. Second, although Plato makes ample
use of the method of collection and division in later dialogues such
as the <em>Sophist</em> and the <em>Statesman</em>, he seems to pay
little heed to problems of ethics, with the exception of the
<em>Philebus</em>. But the aptness of the dialectical method in
discerning the nature of the good has already been emphasized in the
<em>Republic</em> (534b–c): “ Unless someone can
distinguish in an account the Form of the good from everything else,
can survive all refutation as if in battle... you will say that he
does not know the good itself or any other good.” Brief as these
remarks are, they show that the application of dialectic to the
understanding and pursuit of the good is of central importance. That
the Good is nowhere subjected to such treatment must be due to the
enormity of the task involved in undertaking a systematic
identification of all that is good, and in distinguishing good things
from each other, as well as from the Form of the Good. Although it is
unclear whether Plato had already refined the dialectical method in
the systematic way indicated in the <em>Phaedrus</em>, the hints
contained in the <em>Republic</em> about a ‘longer way’
(435d; 504b) to determine the nature of justice and the other virtues
seem to suggest that the the development of a systematic method of
collection and division was ‘in the works’. As a closer
look at the much later <em>Philebus</em> will show, the determination
of what is good about each kind of thing presupposes more than a
classification by collection and division. For in addition, the
internal structure of each kind of entity has to be determined.
Knowledge is not confined to the comprehension of the objects’
being, identity, difference and other external interrelations that
exist in a given field. It also presupposes the knowledge of what
constitutes the objects’ internal unity and complexity. It
would, of course, be rather presumptuous to claim that Plato had not
seen the need to investigate the ontological ‘anatomy’, as
well as taxonomy, of the Forms from early on. But as the late
dialogues show, it took him quite some effort to develop the requisite
conceptual tools for such analyses. </p>

<p>
Before we turn to the late dialogues, a final review is in order of
the kind of good life Plato envisages in the dialogues under
discussion here. In the <em>Symposium</em>, the emphasis is on the
individual’s creative work, which involves others at least as
catalysts in one’s efforts to attain self-perpetuation and
completion. The quality of life attainable for each person differs,
depending on the kind of ‘work’ each individual is able to
produce. This is what the <em>scala amoris</em> is all about. In the
<em>Phaedrus</em>, the emphasis is more on the ‘joint
venture’ of kindred souls. True friends will get to the highest
point of self-fulfillment by the joint insights that their
souls’ conditions permit them to attain. Just as in the
<em>Symposium</em>, the philosophical life is deemed the best. But
then, this preference is found everywhere in Plato and itis not unique
to him: all ancient philosophers regard their own occupation as the
true fulfillment of human life. If there are differences between them,
they concern the kinds of study and occupation that are deemed
appropriate to philosophy. The more individualistic view of happiness
espoused in the <em>Symposium</em> and in the <em>Phaedrus</em> need,
however, not be seen as a later stage in Plato’s development
than the <em>Republic’s</em> communitarian conception. They may
be complementary, rather than rival, points of view, and no fixed
chronology need be assumed in order to accommodate both. </p>

<h2><a id="LatDiaEthCos">5. The late dialogues: Ethics and Cosmology</a></h2>

<h3><a id="HarCosGoo">5.1 Harmony and cosmic goodness</a></h3>

<p>
Nature and natural things are not among the objects that concern Plato
in his earlier and middle philosophical investigations. Thus, in the
<em>Republic</em>, he dismisses the study of the visible heaven from
the curriculum of higher learning along with audible music. But such
generalizations about Plato’s intentions may be misleading. What
he denigrates is not the study of the heavenly order as such, nor that
of harmonics; it is rather the extent to which we must necessarily
rely on our eyes and ears in those concerns. Students of philosophy
are, rather, encouraged to work out the true intelligible order
underlying the visible heaven and audible music. Not only that: The
ascent out of the Cave includes recognition of objects outside,
especially “the things in the sky” (<em>R.</em>
516a–b). If Plato is critical of natural science, it is because
of its empirical approach. This echoes the <em>Phaedo</em>’s
complaint that one ruins one’s eyes by looking directly at
things, most of all at the sun (<em>Phdo</em>. 99d–e).
Nevertheless, Plato already indicates in his critique of Anaxagoras
that comprehension of the workings of the order of nature would be
highly desirable, as long as it contained an explanation of the
<em>rationale</em> of that order (98a): “I was ready to find out
about the sun and the moon and the other heavenly bodies, about their
relative speed, their turnings and whatever happens to them, how it is
<em>best</em> that each should be acted upon.” But Anaxagoras
has not fulfilled his promise to explain how mind is the cause of all
things by showing (99c): “that the truly good and binding ties
and holds everything together”, i.e. through a teleological
rather than a mechanical explanation of the cosmic order. Plato
himself does not pursue this idea in the rest of the <em>Phaedo</em>,
but his elaborate ‘geographical’ depiction of the under-,
middle-, and upper world in the final myth can be read as a model of
such an explanation in mythological garb. The same can be claimed for
the description of the heavenly order and the structure of the
‘spindle of necessity’ in the myth of Er at the end of the
<em>Republic</em> (<em>R.</em> 616b–617d).</p>

<p>
What kind of ‘binding force’ does Plato attribute to
‘the Good’? His reticence about this concept, despite its
centrality in his metaphysics and ethics, is largely responsible for
the obscurity of his concepts of happiness and of what it is to lead a
good life, except for the claim that individuals are best off if they
‘do their own thing’. The philosophers’ knowledge
provides a solid basis for the good life of the entire community, as
well as for that of the – perhaps uncomprehending –
majority, because they benefit from the good order of the state. But
what is ‘the Good’ that is responsible for the goodness of
all other things? A lot of ink has been spilt over the following
passage in <em>Republic</em> book VI, 509b: “Not only do the
objects of knowledge owe their being <em>known</em> to the Good, but
their <em>being</em> (<em>ousia</em>) is also due to it, although the
Good is not being, but superior (<em>epekeina</em>) to it in rank and
power.” The analogy with the sun’s maintenance of all that
is alive suggests that the Good is the intelligent inner principle
that determines the nature of every object that is capable of
goodness, in the sense that these objects fulfill their respective
functions in an appropriate way. Plato did not attempt to state how
such a principle of goodness works in all things when he wrote the
<em>Republic</em>. That he was thinking of an internal ‘binding
force’ is indicated, however, in Book X, where Plato elucidates
the ontological differences that exist, respectively, between the
Forms as the products of a divine maker, their earthly copies, and the
imitation of these copies by an artist (<em>R</em>. 596a ff.).
According to Plato, in each case it is the <em>use</em> or
<em>function</em> that determines what it is to be good, (601d):
“Aren’t the virtue or excellence, the beauty and
correctness of each manufactured item, living creature, and action
related to nothing but the use (<em>chreia</em>) for which each is
made or naturally adapted?” Given that he does not limit this
account to instruments, but explicitly includes living things and
human actions in it, he seems to have a specific criterion in mind for
what constitutes each thing’s excellence. A similar thought is
already expressed in <em>Republic</em> I (353a–e) when Socrates,
in his refutation of Thrasymachus, employs the argument that the
ability to fulfill one’s own task (<em>ergon</em>) well
constitutes the excellence of each object. In the case of human
beings, this means ‘doing well’; ‘doing well’,
in turn, means ‘living well’, and ‘living
well’, in turn, means ‘living happily’. The
stringency of these inferences is far from obvious; but they show that
Plato saw an intimate connection between the nature, the function, and
the well-being of all things, including human beings.</p>

<p>
What determines the ‘use’ of a human being, and to what
extent can there be a common principle that accounts for all good
things? In the <em>Republic</em>, this question is answered only
indirectly through the isomorphism of the just state and soul as a
harmonious internal order. The postulate of such an orderly structure
is not explicitly extended beyond the state and the soul. In contrast,
in the later dialogues, the Good clearly operates on a cosmic scale.
That such is Plato’s view comes to the fore in his excursus on
the philosopher’s nature in the <em>Theaetetus</em>
(173c–177c). Contrary to Socrates’ denial in the
<em>Apology</em>, Socrates in the <em>Theaetetus</em> affirms that the
philosopher is to pursue both what lies below the earth and the
heights above the heaven (173e): “tracking down by every path
the entire nature of each whole among the things that are.” And
Socrates also concerns himself with the question of “What is
man? What actions and passions properly belong to human nature and
distinguish it from all other beings?” In that connection he
compares the discovery of the true nature of things with
‘likening oneself to God’ (<em>homoiôsis
theôi</em>) and indicates that there is a unitary principle of
goodness. The ability to achieve this superhuman state depends on
one’s readiness to engage in strenuous philosophical discourse
(177b).</p>

<p>
If, in the <em>Republic</em>, the goodness of the individual soul is
explained in terms of its being a smaller copy of a harmonious
society, in the <em>Timaeus</em>, Plato goes for a larger model. The
universe now supplies the ‘large’ text for deciphering the
nature of the human soul. The structure of the world-soul is
replicated in the nature of the human soul. That there is,
nevertheless, a close affinity between the <em>Republic</em> and the
project that Plato meant to pursue in the <em>Timaeus</em> and its
intended sequels is clearly indicated in the preface to the
<em>Timaeus</em>. The tale of the origin of the universe, including
human nature, is presented as the first step in a reply to
Socrates’ wish to see his own best city ‘in action’
(<em>Ti</em>. 19b–c). From antiquity on, this introduction has
created the impression that the <em>Timaeus</em> is the direct
continuation of the <em>Republic</em>, an impression that explains its
juxtaposition in the <em>Corpus Platonicum</em>. Strong indications
speak, however, for a much later date for the <em>Timaeus</em>. If
Plato establishes a link between these two works, his intent is to
compare as well as to contrast. The continuity consists solely in the
fact that Socrates reaffirms that he still considers his city’s
order as the best (<em>Ti</em>. 17c–19b). It is this ideal order
that Critias promises to illustrate by narrating the tale of the war
between pre-historic Athens, a city that exempified the ideal order,
and Atlantis, a powerful tyrannical superpower (<em>Ti</em>.
20d–26e). However, Plato eventually set aside the project of
illustrating the ideal city in action: the <em>Critias</em> breaks off
after 15 pages, in mid-sentence, and the third dialogue in the series,
<em>Hermocrates</em>, was never written at all. So the story of
Socrates’ ideal city in action and of the life of its citizens
remains untold. All we have is Plato’s cosmic model.</p>

<p>
The difference between the philosophical approach of the
<em>Republic</em> and that of the <em>Timaeus</em> lies in the fact
that Plato concerns himself in the later dialogue with the structure
of the visible heaven as a model for the human soul, and also with the
material conditions of human physiology. What is confined to mythology
in Plato’s earlier works is here worked out – though not
without the <em>caveat</em> to the effect that Plato is merely
offering a likely account of the structure of the universe, of the
human soul, and of human physiology – rather than proven facts.
Plato’s choice of presenting his explanation of the order of the
universe as a story of creation by a ‘divine workman’ is
certainly no accident. It can be understood as a kind of
‘retractation’ of his deprecatory statement concerning the
divine workman’s product that appears in the <em>Republic</em>,
where this product is denigrated because of its inferiority to a
purely theoretical model. To be sure, the <em>Timaeus</em> presupposes
the Forms as the divine workman’s unchanging models
(27d–29d; 30c–31b) and resorts to mathematical principles
to explain the cosmic order, but the focus is almost exclusively on
the construction of the visible heavens. Plato now seems convinced
that in order to explain the nature of a living being, it is necessary
to show what factors constitute such a live organism. </p>

<p>
This intention explains certain peculiarities of the <em>Timaeus</em>
that make the dialogue hard to penetrate. For the dialogue falls into
three rather disparate parts. The first part describes the structure
of the world-soul and its replication in the human soul in a way that
combines the formal principles with those of mathematics and harmonics
and illustrates it with fantastic imagery (29d–47e). The second
part consists of a rather meticulous account of the elementary
physical constituents of nature, which are held to be formed of
geometrically constructed atoms (47e–69a). The third part
combines elements from the first and second parts in a lengthy
explanation of human physiology and psychology (69b–92c). The
first, cosmological, part of the <em>Timaeus</em> greatly taxes
one’s ability to relate the notion of a divinely created
world-soul to the motions of the visible heavens, since Plato only
offers the bare hints of an intelligible, mathematical, and harmonic
structure that would explain these motions. By contrast, the
explanations in the second and third part are hard to follow because
of Plato’s, quite unique, concern with detail with respect to
nature.</p>

<p>
This is not the place to summarize Plato’s description of the
complex structure of the world-soul at greater length. Suffice it to
say that this structure combines three features – namely, (1)
the components or ingredients, of the world-soul itself, which are the
essential tools for <em>dialectic</em>; (2) the mathematical
proportions that define the structure of the world-soul; and (3) the
influence that the structure of the world-soul has in turn on the
observable order of the universe, such as the motion of the heavenly
bodies. According to Plato, the soul itself is composed of being,
sameness, and difference – i.e., three of the ‘most
important kinds’ discussed in the <em>Sophist</em> as the
objects of the philosopher’s art of combination and separation
(<em>Sph</em>. 253b–254b). Each of the three concepts that
constitute the world-soul do so in a mixture of their unchangeable and
their changeable types (<em>Ti</em>. 35a–b): the world-soul is a
combination of unchangeable and changeable being, of unchangeable and
changeable sameness, and of unchangeable and changeable difference.
What is the use of this strange concoction? As Timaeus points out, the
combination of the eternal and temporal versions of the formal
concepts allows the soul to comprehend both unchangeable and
changeable objects in the world (37a–c). In other words, the
soul has ‘unchangeable’ tools to identify the Forms, and
‘changeable’ tools to deal with the objects in the
physical realm. By mixing together the unchangeable and the changeable
versions of the formal concepts, Plato maintains the unity of the
soul. In other words, there is no such thing as a
<em>world-reason</em> – dealing only with eternal being,
sameness and difference – separate from the <em>world-soul</em>,
which is concerned with temporal and changeable things, their being,
sameness and difference. Rather, there is one mental force that does
both, resulting in either knowledge or firm belief. <em>Nous</em> and
<em>psuchê</em> are united in the <em>Timaeus</em>. The
‘mixed tools’ of dialectic (once more – being,
sameness, and difference) are at the same time depicted as extended
‘bands’ that provide the soul with a mathematical
structure through division in a complex set of proportions
(35b–36b). The portions (1 - 2 - 4 - 8 - 3 - 9 - 27) of the
mixture, with further subdivisions according to the arithmetical,
geometrical and harmonic means, are the proportions that demarcate the
intervals in theoretical harmonics (1 : 2 is the ratio underlying the
octave, 3 : 2 the fifth, 4 : 3 the fourth, 9 : 8 the major second,
etc.). As these harmonic divisions suggest, the world-soul is at the
same time a kind of musical instrument. No music of the spheres is
mentioned in the <em>Timaeus</em>, but Plato seems to have in mind at
least the possibility of heavenly music. The mathematical proportions
are applied, in turn, to explain the order and the motions of the
heavenly bodies (36b–d). For the soul-bands, divided in
different proportions, form circles that are ordered in a complicated
system, and in doing so they represent a geometrical model of the
motions and distances of the stars revolving around the earth.</p>

<p>
Why does Plato burden himself and his readers with such a complex
machinery and what does this heavenly instrument have to do with
ethics? Since the human soul is formed from the same ingredients as
the world soul (albeit in a less pure form), and displays the same
structure (41d–e), Plato is clearly not just concerned with the
order of the universe, but with that of the human soul as well. He
attributes to it the possession of the kinds of concepts that are
necessary for the understanding of the nature of all things, both
eternal and temporal. The soul’s ingredients are here limited to
the purely formal conditions, however. A theory of recollection of the
nature of all things is no longer being advocated. Rather, Plato is
concerned with ascertaining all of the following: (1) the most
important concepts used to identify and differentiate objects in the
way necessary for dialectical procedure; (2) the numbers and
proportions needed to understand numerical relations and harmonic
structures of all sorts; and (3) the capacity of the soul to perform
and comprehend harmoniously coordinated motions. This, it seems, is
all the soul gets and all it needs in order to perform its various
tasks. The unusual depiction of the soul’s composition makes it
hard, at first, to penetrate to the rationale of its construction, and
it must remain an open question to what extent Plato expects his model
to be taken in a literal rather than in a figurative sense. His
overall message should be clear, however: the soul <em>is</em> a
harmoniously structured entity, that can in principle function
forever, and it also <em>comprehends</em> the corresponding structures
in other entities, and therefore has access to all that is good and
well-ordered. This last point has consequences for his ethical thought
that are not developed in the <em>Timaeus</em> itself, but that can be
detected in other late dialogues.</p>

<h3><a id="MeaForMea">5.2 Measure for Measure</a></h3>

<p>
Plato’s concern with ‘right measure’ in a sense that
is relevant for ethics is, of course, not confined to his late work.
It shows up rather early. Already in the <em>Gorgias</em>, Socrates
blames Callicles for the undisciplined state of his soul, and
attributes it to his neglect of geometry, (508a): “You’ve
failed to notice that proportionate equality (<em>geometrikê
isotês</em>) has great power among both gods and men.” But
it is unclear whether this expression is to be taken in a more than
metaphorical sense; it is, at any rate, not repeated anywhere else in
Plato’s earlier work. Numbers are treated as paradigmatic
entities from the middle dialogues on, and in the <em>Protagoras</em>
(156c–157e), Socrates maintains that virtue is ‘the art of
measuring’ (<em>metrêtikê technê</em>)
pleasure and pain. But nothing further is made of that suggestion; the
dialogue ends in <em>aporia</em> about the nature of virtue
(161c–d) — a fact that strongly speaks against the
attribution of a kind of ‘enlightened hedonism’ to Plato,
as certain interpreters are wont to do. There is no indication that
Plato takes seriously the idea of a ‘quantification’ of
the nature of the virtues in his middle dialogues. If mathematics
looms large, then, it is as a model science on account of its
exactness, the stability of its objects, and their accessibility to
reason. A systematic exploration of the notion that measure and
proportion are the fundamental conditions of goodness is confined to
the late dialogues. Apart from the <em>Timaeus</em>’ emphasis on
a precise cosmic and mental order, there is a crucial passage in the
<em>Statesman</em> (283d–285c), where the Eleatic Stranger
distinguishes two kinds of ‘art of measurement’. The first
kind is the ordinary measuring of quantities relative to each other
(‘the great and small’). The second kind has a normative
component; it is concerned with the determination of ‘due
measure’ (<em>to metrion</em>). The latter is treated with great
concern, for the Eleatic Stranger claims that it is the basis of all
expertise, including statesmanship, the very art that is the subject
of the dialogue itself, (284a–b): “It is by preserving
measure in this way that they produce all the good and fine things
they do produce.” His point is that all good productions and all
processes of generation that come to a good end presuppose
‘right measure’, while arbitrary quantities (‘the
more and less’) have no such results. The Eleatic Stranger
therefore suggests the separation of the simple arts of measuring from
the arts concerned with due measure, (284e): “Positing as one
part all those sorts of expertise that measure the numbers, lengths,
depths, breadths and speeds of things in relation to what is opposed
to them, and as the other, all those that measure in relation to what
is in due measure (<em>to metrion</em>), what is fitting (<em>to
prepon</em>), the right moment (<em>to kairion</em>), what is as it
ought to be (<em>to deon</em>)—everything that is removed from
the extremes to the middle (<em>meson</em>).” This distinction
is not applied in the <em>Statesman</em> itself, except that due
measure seems to be presupposed in the final definition of the
statesman as a ‘kingly weaver’, weaving together the
fabric of the state by combining the aggressive and the moderate
temperaments of the population so as to produce a harmonious citizenry
(305e– 311c). But mathematics is not mentioned as the condition
of the ‘mixing of the citizens’ characters’. </p>

<p>
The importance of measure in a literal sense becomes more explicit,
however, in the <em>Philebus</em>, the dialogue that is concerned with
the question of whether pleasure or knowledge constitutes the human
good. In that dialogue, number (<em>arithmos</em>), measure
(<em>metron</em>), and limit (<em>peras</em>) play a crucial role at
various points of the discussion, and the <em>Philebus</em> is the
dialogue where Plato requires that numerical precision must be
observed in the application of the ‘divine gift’ of
dialectical procedure by the method of collection and division
(16c–17a). The dialectician must know precisely how many species
and subspecies a certain genus contains; otherwise he has no claim to
any kind of expertise. Despite this emphasis on precision and on the
need to determine the numerical ‘limit’ in every science,
Socrates does not provide the envisaged kind of numerically complete
division of the two contenders for the rank of the best state of the
human soul – pleasure and knowledge – envisaged by the use
of collection and division. This is because Socrates suddenly
remembers that neither of the two contenders suffices in itself for
the good life, and that a mixture of the two is preferable. To explain
the nature of this mixture, Socrates introduces a fourfold division of
all beings (23c–27c), a division that uses the categories of
‘limit’ and ‘measure’ in a different way than
in the ‘divine method of dialectic’. As he now states, all
beings belong in one of four classes – namely (1) limit
(<em>peras</em>), (2) the unlimited (<em>apeiron</em>), (3) the
mixture (<em>meixis</em>) of limit and the unlimited, or (4) the cause
(<em>aitia</em>) of such a mixture. As the subsequent explications
concerning the four classes show, the unlimited comprises all those
things that have no exact grade or measure in themselves, such as the
hotter and colder, the faster and slower. Although at first the
examples are confined to relative terms, the class of the unlimited is
then extended to things like hot and cold, dry and moist, fast and
slow, and even heat and frost. Mixture takes place when such qualities
take on a definite quantity (<em>poson</em>) or due measure
(<em>metrion</em>) that limits their variation. That only measured
entities qualify as mixtures is not only suggested by the examples
Socrates refers to (health, strength, beauty, music, and the seasons),
but by his assertion much later in the dialogue that a mixture without
due measure or proportion does not deserve its name (64d–e):
“[it] will necessarily corrupt its ingredients and most of all
itself. For there would be no blending in such cases at all, but
really an unconnected medley, the ruin of whatever happens to be
contained in it.” The upshot of this discussion is that all
stable entities (mixtures) represent a harmonious equilibrium of their
otherwise unlimited ingredients. Since indeterminate elements usually
turn up in pairs of opposites, the right limit in each case is the
right proportion necessary for their balance. In the case of health,
there must be the right balance between the hot and the cold, the dry
and the moist. The cause of the proper proportion for each mixture
turns out to be reason; it is the only member of the fourth class. As
Socrates indicates, divine reason is the ultimate source of all that
is good and harmonious in the universe, while human reason is but a
poor copy (26e–27c; 28a–30e).</p>

<p>
The adoption of this fourfold ontology allows Socrates to assign the
two contenders for best condition in human nature to two of the four
classes: pleasure turns out to be unlimited, because it admits of the
‘more and less ’. Reason, by contrast, belongs to the
fourth class, as the cause of good mixtures. On the basis of this
classification, Socrates’ investigation provides a critical
assessment of different kinds of pleasure and knowledge
(31b–59d). It turns out that pleasure is at best a remedial
good: pleasure is always the filling of a lack, or the restoration of
a harmonious state, and therefore pleasure presupposes some kind of
disturbance of the physical or mental equilibrium. A pleasure may be
false, harmful or violent if its pursuer is mistaken about the
object’s identity and quantity, or if there is no real cure for
the disturbance. A pleasure may be ‘true and pure’ if it
is a compensation for a harmless and unfelt lack, and if its possessor
is not mistaken about the nature of its object (31b–55c). The
rivals of the pleasures – the different intellectual disciplines
– also vary in quality; but in their case the difference in
quality depends on the amount of mathematical precision they contain
(55c–59d). The decision about what mixture will make for a happy
life leads to a combination of the true and pure pleasures with all
the kinds of knowledge and disciplines that are necessary for
life’s needs (59d–64b). In the final ranking of goods,
measure and due proportion, unsurprisingly, get the first rank, things
in proper proportion come in second, reason is ranked third, the arts
and sciences obtain fourth place, whereas the true and pure pleasures
get fifth and last place on the scale of goods (64c–67b). If
Plato in the <em>Philebus</em> is more favorably disposed towards a
hedonist stance than in some of his earlier works, he is so only to a
quite limited degree: he regards pleasure as a necessary ingredient in
human life, because both the physical and the psychic equilibria that
constitute human nature are unstable. There is always some deficiency
or lack that needs supplementing. Because the range of such
‘supplements’ include learning and the pursuit of the
virtues, there are some pleasures that are rightly cherished. But even
they are deemed goods only because they are compensations for human
imperfection.</p>

<p>
What are we to make of this conception of happiness as a mixture of
pleasure and knowledge that is based on ‘due measurement’?
There are two questions worth exploring here. One concerns the role
that Plato assigns to measure in his late concept of ethics. Secondly,
there is the question of how serious Plato is about such a
‘mathematization’ of his principles, quite generally. </p>

<p>
Regardning the issue of the role of measure in Plato’s ethics,
though harmony and order are treated as important principles in
Plato’s metaphysics and ethics from early on, in his late
dialogues he seems to envisage right measure in a literal sense. This
explains his confidence that even physical entities can attain a
relatively stable state. As he specifies both in the <em>Timaeus</em>
and in the <em>Philebus</em>, not everything is in a hopeless constant
flux; on the contrary, those things that possess the measure that is
right for their type are stable entities and can be the objects of
‘firm and true beliefs and convictions’ (<em>Ti</em>.
37b–c). This applies not only to the nature of the visible
universe, but also to the human body and mind, as long as they are in
good condition. Plato seems to have been encouraged to embrace such
theories by the advances of astronomy and harmonics in his own
lifetime, so that he postulates ‘due proportion’ in an
arithmetical sense as the cause of all harmony and stability. His
confidence seems to have extended not only to the physical, but also
to the moral state of human nature. That assumption is confirmed not
only by the emphasis on right mixture in the <em>Philebus</em>, but
also by the the discussion in the <em>Laws</em> about how the laws are
to achieve peace in the state and harmony in the souls of the
citizens. In the <em>Laws</em> it seems that Plato no longer regards
the emotions as a menace to the virtues; rather, he sees it as the
legislators’ obligation to provide an adequate balance of
pleasure and pain by habituating citizens in the right way
(632a–643a). This balance, through <em>paideia</em>, is crucial
for maintaining a truly free soul (I 636e): “Pleasure and pain
flow like two springs released by nature. If a man draws the right
amount from the right one at the right time, he lives a happy
life.” This is not the place to discuss the project Plato
pursues in the <em>Laws</em> as a whole, which ist to determine the
best possible constitution and its laws. Suffice it to note that the
discussion of the right measure of pleasure and pain forms the preface
to the entire project. This is an indication of a considerable shift
of emphasis on the emotions in the <em>Laws</em> compared with
Plato’s treatment of the subject in the <em>Republic</em>. For
the form of education that provides the citizens with the right
habituation (<em>ethos</em>) concerning the measure of pleasure and
pain is the topic of the <em>Laws</em>’ second book. The
emphasis put on the right measure and on the right object of pleasure
and pain in the citizens’ sentimental education to some degree
anticipates the Aristotelian conception of the moral virtues as the
right mean between excess and deficiency (II 653b–c):
“Virtue is this general concord of reason and emotion. But there
is one element you could isolate in any account you give, and this is
the correct formation of our feelings of pleasure and pain, which
makes us hate what we ought to hate from first to last, and love what
we ought to love.” The confidence expressed in the <em>Laws</em>
in the power of due measure in all matters finally culminates in the
famous maxim that God is the measure of all things (IV 716c–d:
“In our view, it is God who is preeminently the ‘measure
of all things’, much more so than any man, as they say. So if
you want to recommend yourself to someone of this character, you must
do your level best to make your own character reflect his, and on this
principle the moderate man is God’s friend, being like him,
whereas the immoderate and unjust man is not like him and is his
enemy; and the same reasoning applies to the other vices too.”
Because Plato, like Aristotle after him, carefully refrains from any
kind of specifications about what actual right measures might be, we
should treat the ‘arithmetic’ of the good life with more
than a pinch of salt. That individuals differ in their internal and
external conditions is as clear to Plato as it is to Aristotle. This
does not shake his faith in the <em>Laws</em> that right habituation
through the right kind of education, most of all in the arts, will
provide the necessary inner equilibrium in the good citizen. </p>

<p>
As to the second question concerning the extent to which Plato
believed that ethics was amenable to quantification, stated earlier,
Plato’s confidence in a mathematically structured order of the
universe that also includes human nature was greatly enhanced by the
progress made by the scientists of his day. This seems to be the
rationale for his depiction in the <em>Timaeus</em> of the
world’s creation as a construction by a divine craftsman who
makes use of proportion, and who also takes care to give a geometrical
construction to the four elements (a factor left out of consideration
here). This conviction is echoed in the <em>Philebus</em>’
emphasis on measure and proportion as the ultimate criteria of
goodness. It should be noted, however, that Plato carefully refrains
from going into any specifics about concrete mathematical relations.
Even in the <em>Timaeus</em>, he does not apply his complicated system
of proportions when it comes to specifying the actual size, distance,
and speed of the heavenly bodies. Nor does he indicate in the
<em>Philebus</em> how the art of establishing the limits of good
mixtures should be attained. It therefore remains an open question to
what extent Plato regarded mathematical physics and metaphysics as
viable projects. That Plato went some way in that direction seems to
be indicated by claims in later reports on his theory of the Forms,
that he either treated the Forms as numbers or associated numbers with
them. Because Aristotle is quite vociferous in his criticism of this
theory in Book A of the <em>Metaphysics</em> (A 6; A 9) and further
expands his criticism of ideas as numbers or idea-numbers in books M
and N, there must be some substance to that claim. As the obscurities
in Aristotle’s various reports indicate, the doctrine cannot
ever have reached a definitive stage, for at one point he complains
that Plato’s theory relied on too few numbers (<em>Met</em>.
1084a10–27), while elsewhere he objects that, (1073a20):
“they speak of numbers now as unlimited, now as limited by the
number 10.” That Plato never presented this theory in a
magisterial form is confirmed by the reports on his public
‘lecture on the good’. It scandalized the general audience
because Plato, instead of speaking about the good in the ordinary
sense, as expected by the uninformed public, spoke about mathematics
and “finally, that the Good is one” (cf. Aristoxenos,
<em>Harmonica</em>, II, 30). But it was not just the general public
who found the message hard to comprehend. As Simplicius reports, even
Plato’s mature students – such as Aristotle, Heraclides
Ponticus, and Hestiaeus – took notes on the lecture,
“because it was stated enigmatically”. Simplicius also
reports that Porphyry, his source, used the <em>Philebus</em> to
unravel the enigma (<em>In Aristotelis physica</em> 453,29). Given the
disagreements in our sources, it may forever remain a matter of debate
how far Plato went in his mathematization of his ethics and
metaphysics. It seems clear, however, that he must at least have
entertained the hope that all that is good rests on ‘due
measure’ in a more than metaphorical sense. We may well ask why
he shouldered his philosophy with such heavy baggage that made it
inaccessible to the mathematically untrained, an inaccessibility that
largely persists to this day and age. Clearly, there is one conviction
that Plato never gave up: The nature of all things requires knowledge,
and that condition applies most of all to the Good. And if it takes
mathematical knowledge to comprehend what is good, then that is the
way to go.</p>

<p>
The speculative character of Plato’s metaphysical thought may
explain why, in his late works, his treatment of ethics strikes us as
less rigid, and as more ready to come to terms with the complexity of
human nature, and with the ordinary requirements for a satisfactory
life. Signs of this more conciliatory stance can be seen in the
depiction of a mixed life in the <em>Philebus</em>, which is a life
open to everyone, as well as in the portrayal in the <em>Laws</em> of
the city-state of Magnesia, which is depicted as the second-best
state, but as a one that is more accommodating to ordinary human
nature. It is a state that is no longer divided into three classes,
and where there are no philosopher-kings and -queens in control of
everything; the heavy work is done by slaves of foreign origin. The
‘overseers’ over the laws are chosen from the most upright
and experienced of the citizenry. That they meet in a ‘Nocturnal
Council’ is not for secrecy’s sake, but because during the
day they have the same occupations as all other citizens. If Plato
does not assign unlimited power to a special class it is for two
reasons: he recognizes that persons of super-human virtue are not easy
to find and that scientific education and philosophy alone are no
warranty of goodness. Plato no longer expects any human being to be
immune to the temptations of power. Therefore, in Book V of the
<em>Laws</em> he recommends a mixed constitution and a
‘nomocracy’ as being more appropriate than a monarchy of
the best minds. Humans are to be servants of the laws, not masters of
each other. It may seem paradoxical that Plato became more
conciliatory towards the ordinary human condition at the same time as
his confidence in scientific rigor increased. But there actually is no
paradox. His conciliatory stance seems, rather, to reflect his insight
that, the more complex things get, the less precision is to be
attained. Therefore no mathematical precision can be expected in the
ordering of such complex mixtures as the human soul and life.
‘Due measure’, as applied to the human condition must
therefore be given some leeway, “if ever we are to find our way
home”, as Plato lets Socrates’ partner conclude in the
<em>Philebus</em>. That ethics cannot be done with the same precision
as mathematics is not, then, an insight that occurred only to
Aristotle. But Plato must have thought that precision should at least
be aimed for, if life is to be based on a harmonious order that is
accessible, at least to a certain degree, to human knowledge. </p>

<p>
Did Plato’ view of the human good, then, become more democratic
in his latest works? If we follow the indications in the
<em>Timaeus</em> concerning the good state of the human soul in
‘orderly circles’, Plato seems to remain as elitist as
ever. But he no longer puts so much emphasis on the distance between
the best and the ordinary. As he remarks in the <em>Statesman</em>,
even the most gifted statesmen don’t stick out from the rest of
humankind like queen-bees do from ordinary bees. Further, the souls of
all human beings are at best only ‘second-best souls’ when
compared with the world-soul. That all human beings have to seek the
best obtainable mixture of life, and even the best of them can be no
more than servants of the laws, suggests that Plato has become more
democratic in the sense that he regards the ‘human herd’
as a more uniform flock than he did in his earlier days. He retains
his conviction, however, that a well-ordered soul is the prerequisite
of the good life and that human beings need not only a careful moral
education, but also a well-regulated life. Whether the life in
Plato’s nomocracy would better please the modern mind than rule
by philosopher-kings, however, is a question that would require a
careful perusal of that enormous compendium of regulations and laws,
the study of which makes the task of reading and understanding the
<em>Laws</em> such hard work. That compendium is at the same time a
sourcebook for all those interested in Plato’s late moral
thought.</p>
