<h2 id="RiseScopNeur">1. The rise and scope of neuroethics</h2>

<p>
Neuroethics focuses on ethical issues raised by our continually
improving understanding of the brain, and by consequent improvements
in our ability to monitor and influence brain function. Significant
attention to neuroethics can be traced to 2002, when the Dana
Foundation organized a meeting of neuroscientists, ethicists, and
other thinkers, entitled <em>Neuroethics: Mapping the Field</em>. A
participant at that meeting, columnist and wordsmith William Safire,
is often credited with introducing and establishing the meaning of the
term “neuroethics”, defining it as </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
the examination of what is right and wrong, good and bad about the
treatment of, perfection of, or unwelcome invasion of and worrisome
manipulation of the human brain. (Marcus 2002: 5) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Others contend that the word “neuroethics” was in use
prior to this (Illes 2003; Racine 2010), although all agree that these
earlier uses did not employ it in a disciplinary sense, or to refer to
the entirety of the ethical issues raised by neuroscience.</p>

<p>
Another attendee at that initial meeting, Adina Roskies, in response
to a perceived lack of recognition of the potential novelty of
neuroethics, penned “Neuroethics for the new
millennium” (Roskies 2002), an article in which she proposed a
bipartite division of neuroethics into the “ethics of
neuroscience”, which encompasses the kinds of ethical issues
raised by Safire, and “the neuroscience of ethics”, thus
suggesting an extension of the scope of neuroethics to encompass
understanding the biological basis of ethical thought and behavior and
the ways in which this could itself influence and inform our ethical
thinking. This broadening of the scope of neuroethics highlights the
obvious and not-so-obvious ways that understanding our own moral
thinking might affect our moral views; it is one aspect of neuroethics
that distinguishes it from traditional bioethics. Another way of
characterizing the field is as a study of ethical issues arising from
what we can do to the brain (e.g., with neurotechnologies) and from
what we know about it (including, for example, understanding the basis
of ethical behavior).</p>

<p>
Although Roskies’ definition remains influential, it has been
challenged in various ways. Some have argued that neuroethics should
not be limited to the neuroscience of ethics, but rather be broadened
to the cognitive science of ethics (Levy, personal communication),
since so much work that enables us to understand the brain takes place
in disciplines outside of neuroscience, strictly defined. This is in
fact in the spirit of the original proposal, since it has been widely
recognized that the brain sciences encompass a wide array of
disciplines, methods, and questions.</p>

<p>
However, the most persistent criticisms have been from those who have
questioned whether the neuroscience of ethics should be considered a
part of neuroethics at all: they argue that understanding our ethical
faculties is a scientific and not an ethical issue, and thus should
not be part of neuroethics (Conrad and Vries 2011). This argument is
usually followed by a denial that neuroethics is sufficiently distinct
from traditional bioethics to warrant it being called a discipline in
its own right.</p>

<p>
The response to these critics is different: Whether or not these
various branches of inquiry form a natural kind or are themselves a
focus of ethical analysis is quite beside the point. Neuroethics is
porous. One cannot successfully engage with many of the ethical issues
without also understanding the science. In addition, academic or
intellectual disciplines are at least in part (if not entirely) social
constructs. And in this case the horse is out of the barn: It is clear
that interesting and significant work is being pursued regarding the
brain bases of ethical thought and behavior and that this theoretical
understanding has influenced, and has the potential to influence, our
own thinking about ethics and our ethical practices. That neuroethics
exists is undeniable: Neuroethical lines of research have borne
interesting fruit over the last 10–15 years; neuroethics is now
recognized internationally as an area of study; neuroethics courses
are taught at many universities; and training programs, professional
societies, and research centers for neuroethics have already been
established. Neuroethics is a discipline in its own right in part
because we already structure our practices in a way that recognizes it
as such. What is most significant about neuroethics is not whether
both the ethics of neuroscience and the neuroscience of ethics are
given the same overarching disciplinary name, but that there are
people working on both endeavors and that they are in dialogue (and
sometimes, the very same folks are doing both).</p>

<p>
Of course, to the extent that neuroethicists asks questions about
disease, treatment, and so on, the questions will look familiar, and
for answers they can and should look to extant work in traditional
bioethics so as not to reinvent the wheel. But, ultimately, Farah is
correct in saying that </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
New ethical issues are arising as neuroscience gives us unprecedented
ways to understand the human mind and to predict, influence, and even
control it. These issues lead us beyond the boundaries of bioethics
into the philosophy of mind, psychology, theology, law and
neuroscience itself. It is this larger set of issues that
has…earned it a name of its own. (Farah 2010: 2)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Neuroethics is driven by neurotechnologies: it is concerned with the
ethical questions that attend the development and effects of novel
neurotechnologies, as well as other ethical and philosophical issues
that arise from our growing understanding of how brains give rise to
the people that we are and the social structures that we inhabit and
create. These questions are intimately bound up with scientific
questions about what kinds of knowledge can be acquired with
particular techniques: what are the scope and limits of what a
technique can tell us? With many new techniques, answers to these
questions are obscure not only to the lay public, but even to the
scientists themselves. The uncertainty about the reach of these
technologies adds to the challenge of grappling with the ethical
issues raised.</p>

<p>
Many new neurotechnologies enable us to monitor brain processes and
increasingly, to understand how the brain gives rise to certain
behaviors; others enable us to intervene in these processes, to change
and perhaps to control behaviors, traits, or abilities. Although it
will be impossible to fully canvass the range of questions neuroethics
has thus far contemplated, discussion of the issues raised by a few
neurotechnologies will illustrate the range of questions neuroethics
entertains. Sections 2–5 below discuss a non-exhaustive list of
topics that fall under the general rubric of ethics of
neuroscience. Section 6 discusses the neuroscience of ethics and
Section 7 looks towards new neurotechnologies.</p>

<h2 id="EthiEnha">2. The ethics of enhancement</h2>

<p>
While medicine’s traditional goal of treating illness is pursued
by the development of drugs and other treatments that counteract the
detrimental effects of disease or insult, the same kinds of compounds
and methods that are being developed to treat disease may also enhance
normal cognitive functioning. We already possess the ability to
improve some aspects of cognition above baseline, and will certainly
develop other ways of doing so. Thus, a prominent topic in neuroethics
is the ethics of neuroenhancement: What are the arguments for and
against the use of neurotechnologies to enhance one’s
brain’s capacities and functioning?</p>

<p>
Extreme proponents of enhancement are sometimes called
“transhumanists”, and opponents are identified as
“bioconservatives”. These value-laden appellations may
unnecessarily polarize a debate that need not pit extreme viewpoints
against each other. Neuroethics offers many nuanced intermediate
positions that recognize shared values (Parens 2005) and may make room
for embracing the benefits of enhancement while recognizing the need
for some type of regulation (e.g., Lin and Alhoff 2008). The relevance
of this debate itself depends to some extent upon a philosophical
issue familiar to traditional bioethicists: the notorious difficulty
of identifying the line between disease and normal function and the
corresponding difference between treatment and enhancement. However,
despite the difficulty attending the principled drawing of this line,
there are already clear instances in which a technology such as a drug
is used with the aim of improving a capacity or behavior that is by no
means clinically dysfunctional, or with the goal of improving a
capacity beyond the range of normal functioning. One common example is
the use of methylphenidate, a stimulant typically prescribed for the
treatment of ADHD. Known by the brand name Ritalin, methylphenidate
has been shown to improve performance on working memory, episodic
memory and inhibitory control tasks. Many students use it as a study
aid, and the ethical standing of such off-label use is a focus of
debate among neuroethicists (Sahakian and Morein-Zamir, 2007; Greely et al. 2008). The
prevalence of use in college students is in question: while some claim
it is widespread, other surveys report minimal usage (2–5%).
(McCabe et al. 2005; Teter et al. 2006; Wilens et al. 2008; Singh et
al. 2014).</p>

<p>
As in the example above, the enhancements neuroethicists most often
discuss are <em>cognitive</em> enhancements: technologies that allow
normal people to function cognitively at a higher level than they
might without use of the technology. One standing theoretical issue
for neuroethics is a careful and precise articulation of whether, how
and why cognitive enhancement has a philosophical status different
than any other kind of enhancement, such as enhancement of physical
capacities by the use of steroids. Often overlooked are other
interesting potential neuroenhancements. These are less frequently
discussed than cognitive enhancements, but just as worthy of
consideration. They include social/moral enhancements, such as the use
of oxytocin to enhance pro-social behavior, and other noncognitive but
biological enhancements, such as potential physical performance
enhancers controlled by brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) (see, e.g.,
Savulescu and Persson 2012; Douglas 2008; Roco and Montemagno 2004). Whether discussions
regarding these kinds of enhancement effectively recapitulate the
cognitive enhancement debate or raise different concerns and arguments
remains to be seen.</p>

<h3 id="ArguForEnha">2.1 Arguments for enhancement</h3>

<p>
Naturalness: Humans naturally engage in many forms of enhancement,
including cognitive enhancement. Indeed, we typically applaud and
value these efforts. After all, the aim of education is to cognitively
enhance students (by, we now understand, changing their brains),
and we look askance at those who devalue this particular enhancement,
rather than at those who embrace it. So some kinds of cognitive
enhancement are routine and unremarkable. Proponents of
neuroenhancement argue that there is no principled difference between
the enhancements we routinely engage in and enhancement by use of
drugs or other neurotechnologies (Greely 2010; Dees 2007). Many in
fact argue that we are a species whose nature it is to develop and use
technology for augmenting our capacities and that continual pursuit of
enhancement is a mark of the human. For example, Greely and colleagues
claim, </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The drugs just reviewed, along with newer technologies such as brain
stimulation and prosthetic brain chips, should be viewed in the same
general category as education, good health habits, and information
technology—ways that our uniquely innovative species tries to
improve itself. (Greely et al. 2008: 702)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Cognitive liberty: Those who believe that “cognitive
liberty” (see
 <a href="#CognLibe">section 3</a>
 below) is a fundamental right argue that an important element of the
autonomy at stake in cognitive liberty is the liberty to determine for
ourselves what to do with and to our minds, including cognitive
enhancements, if we so choose (Boire 2001; Bostrom and Roache 2010).
Although many who champion “cognitive liberty” do so in
the context of a strident political libertarianism, one can recognize
the value of cognitive liberty without swallowing an entire political
agenda. So, for example, even if we think that there is a <em>prima
facie</em> right to determine our own cognitive states, there may be
justifiable limits to that right. More work needs to be done to
establish the boundaries of the cognitive liberties we ought to
safeguard.</p>

<p>
Utilitarian arguments: Many proponents of cognitive enhancement point
to the positive effects of enhancement and argue that the benefits
outweigh the costs. In these utilitarian arguments it is important to
consider the positive and negative effects not only on individuals but
also on society more broadly (see, e.g., Selgelid 2007).</p>

<p>
Practical arguments: These utilitarian arguments often point to the
difficulty in enforcing regulations of extant technology or to the
detrimental effects of trying to do so. They tend to not really be
arguments in favor of enhancement, but rather reasons not to oppose
its use by regulation or legal strictures (Sandberg and Savulescu
2011; Bostrom and Roache 2010; Heinz et al. 2012; Maslen et al.
2014b).</p>

<h3 id="ArguAgaiEnha">2.2 Arguments against enhancement</h3>

<p>
Opposition to enhancement can take the form of moral condemnation
and/or legal prohibition or restriction, or other regulation. It is
possible for these forms of opposition to come apart—for
instance, to condemn cognitive enhancement on moral grounds, while
permitting it legally (for example, for some of the reasons mentioned
above). Below I discuss varieties of moral arguments offered against
enhancement.</p>

<p>
Harms: The simplest and most powerful argument against enhancement is
the claim that brain interventions carry with them the risk of harm,
risks that make the use of these interventions unacceptable. The low
bar for acceptable risk is an effect of the context of enhancement:
risks deemed reasonable to incur when treating a deficiency or disease
with the potential benefit of restoring normal function may be deemed
unreasonable when the payoff is simply augmenting performance above a
normal baseline. Some suggest that no risk is justified for
enhancement purposes (Heinz et al. 2012; Kass 2003a; Sandel 2004). In evaluating
the strength of a harm-based argument against enhancement, several
points should be considered: 1) What are the actual and potential
harms and benefits (medical and social) of a given enhancement? 2) Who
should make the judgments about appropriate tradeoffs? Individuals may
judge differently at what point the risk/benefit threshold occurs, and
their judgments may depend upon the precise natures of the risks and
benefits. The distinction between moral condemnation and legal
prohibition is relevant here as well, since legal strictures
presuppose an answer to this latter question. Notice, too, the harm
argument is toothless against enhancements that don’t pose any
risks.</p>

<p>
Unnaturalness: A number of thinkers argue, in one form or another,
that use of drugs or technologies to enhance our capacities is
unnatural, and the implication is that <em>unnatural</em> implies
<em>immoral</em> (Kass 2003b; Maslen, Faulmüller, and Savulescu 2014a; DeGrazia
2005). Of course, to be a good argument, more reason has to be given
both for why it is unnatural (see an argument for naturalness, above),
and for why naturalness and morality align. Some arguments suggest
that manipulating our cognitive machinery amounts to tinkering with
“God-given” capacities, and usurping the role of God as
creator can be easily understood as transgressive in a religious-moral
framework. Despite the appeal of this framework to religious
conservatives, a neuroethicist may want to offer a more ecumenical or
naturalistic argument to support the link between <em>unnatural</em>
and <em>immoral</em>, and will have to counter the claim, above, that
it is natural for humans to enhance themselves.</p>

<p>
Diminishing human agency: Another argument suggests that the effect of
enhancement will be to diminish human agency by undermining the need
for real effort and allowing for success with morally-meaningless
shortcuts. Human life will lose the value achieved by the process of
striving for a goal and will be belittled as a result (see, e.g.,
Schermer 2008; Kass 2003b).
Although this is a promising form of argument, more needs to be done
to undergird the claims that effort is intrinsically valuable. After
all, few think that we ought to abandon transportation by car for
horses, walking, or bicycling, because these require more effort and
thus have more moral value.</p>

<p>
The hubris objection: This interesting argument holds that the type of
attitude that seems to underlie pursuit of such interventions is
morally defective in some way, or is indicative of a morally defective
character trait. So, for example, Michael Sandel suggests that the
attitude underlying the attempt to enhance ourselves is a
“Promethean” attitude of mastery that overlooks or
underappreciates the “giftedness of human life”. It is the
expression and indulgence of a problematic attitude of dominion toward
life to which Sandel primarily objects: </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The moral problem with enhancement lies less in the perfection it
seeks than in the human disposition it expresses and promotes. (Sandel
2002) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Others have pushed back against this tack, arguing that the hubris
objection against enhancement fundamentally misunderstands the
concepts it relies upon (Kahane 2011).</p>

<p>
Equality and Distributive Justice: One question that routinely arises
with new technological advances is “who gets to benefit from
them?” As with other technologies, neuroenhancements are not
free. However, worries about access are compounded in the case of
neuroenhancements (as they may also be with other learning
technologies). As enhancements increase capacities of those who use
them, they are likely to further widen the already unconscionable gap
between the haves and have-nots: we can foresee that those already
well-off enough to afford enhancements will use them to increase their
competitive advantage against others, leaving further behind those who
cannot afford them (Farah 2007; Greely et al. 2008; Academy of Medical
Sciences 2012). One can imagine policy solutions to this, of course,
such as having enhancements covered by health insurance, having the
state distribute them to those who cannot afford them, etc. However,
widespread availability of neuroenhancements will inevitably raise
questions about coercion. </p>

<p>
Coercion: The prospect of coercion is raised in several ways.
Obviously, if the state decides to mandate an enhancement, treating
its beneficial effects as a public health issue, this is effectively
coercion. We see this currently in the backlash against vaccinations:
they are mandated with the aim of promoting public health, but in some
minds the mandate raises concerns about individual liberty. I would
submit that the vaccination case demonstrates that at least on some
occasions coercion is justified. The pertinent question is whether coercion
could be justifiable for enhancement rather than for harm prevention.
Although some coercive ideas, such as the suggestion that we put
Prozac or other enhancers in the water supply, are unlikely to be
taken seriously as policy recommendations (however, see Appel 2010), less blatant
forms of coercion are more realistic threats. For example, if people immersed
in tomorrow’s competitive environment are in the company of
others who are reaping the benefits from cognitive enhancement, they
may feel compelled to make use of the same techniques just to remain
competitive, even though they would rather not use enhancements. The
danger is that respecting the autonomy of some may put pressure on the
autonomy of others (Tannenbaum 2014; Maslen, Faulmüller, and
Savulescu 2014a; Farah 2007).</p>

<p>
There is unlikely to be any categorical resolution of the ethics of
enhancement debate. The details of a technology will be relevant to
determining whether a technology ought to be made available for
enhancement purposes: we ought to treat a highly enhancing technology
that causes no harm differently from one that provides some benefit at
noticeable cost. Moreover, the magnitude of some of the
equality-related issues will depend upon empirical facts about the
technologies. Are neurotechnologies equally effective for everyone?
For example, there is evidence that some known enhancers such as the
psychostimulants are more effective for those with deficiencies than
for the unimpaired: studies suggest the beneficial effects of these
drugs are proportional to the degree to which a capacity is impaired
(Husain &amp; Mehta 2011). Other reports claim that normal subjects’
capacities are not actually enhanced by these drugs, and some aspects
of functioning may actually be impaired (Mattay, et al. 2000; Ilieva et
al. 2013). If this is a
widespread pattern, it may alleviate some worries about distributive
justice and contributions to social and economic stratification, since
people with a deficit will benefit proportionately more than those
using the drug for enhancement purposes. (However, biology is rarely
that equitable, and it would be surprising if this leveling pattern turned out
to be the norm). Since the technologies that could provide
enhancements are extremely diverse, ranging from drugs to implants to
genetic manipulations, assessment of the risks and benefits and the
way in which these technologies bear upon our conception of humanity
will have to be empirically grounded.</p>

<h2 id="CognLibe">3. Cognitive liberty</h2>

<p>
Freedom is a cornerstone value in liberal democracies and one of the
most cherished kinds of freedom is freedom of thought.  The main
elements of freedom of thought, or “cognitive liberty” as
it is sometimes called (Sententia 2013), include privacy and
autonomy. Both of these can be challenged by the new developments in
neuroscience. The value of, potential threat to, and ways to protect
these aspects of freedom are a concern for neuroethics.</p>

<h3 id="Priv">3.1 Privacy</h3>

<p>
As the framers of the U.S. constitution were well aware, freedom is
intimately linked with privacy: even being monitored is considered
potentially “chilling” to the kinds of freedoms our
society aims to protect. One type of freedom that has been championed
in American jurisprudence is “the right to be let alone”
(Warren and Brandeis 1890), to be free from government or other
intrusion in our private lives.</p>

<p>
In the past, mental privacy could be taken for granted: the first
person accessibility of the contents of consciousness ensured that the
contents of one’s mind remained hidden to the outside world,
until and unless they were voluntarily disclosed. Instead, the battles
for freedom of thought were waged at the borders where thought meets
the outside world—in expression—and were won with the
First Amendment’s protections for those freedoms. Over the last
half century, technological advances have eroded or impinged upon many
traditional realms of worldly privacy. Most of the avenues for
expression can be (and increasingly are) monitored by third parties.
It is tempting to think that the inner sanctum of the mind remains the
last bastion of real privacy.</p>

<p>
This may still be largely true, but the privacy of the mind can no
longer to be taken for granted. Our neuroscientific achievements have
already made significant headway in allowing others to discern some
aspects of our mental content through neurotechnologies. Noninvasive
methods of brain imaging have revolutionized the study of human
cognition and have dramatically altered the kinds of knowledge we can
acquire about people and their minds. The threat to mental privacy is
not as simple as the naive claim that neuroimaging can read our
thoughts, nor are the capabilities of imaging so innocuous and blunt
that we needn’t worry about that possibility. A focus of
neuroethics is to determine the real nature of the threat to mental
privacy and to evaluate its ethical implications, many of which are
relevant to legal, medical, and other social issues. Doing so
effectively will require both a solid understanding of the
neuroscientific technologies and the neural bases of thought, as well
as a sensitivity to the ethical problems raised by our growing
knowledge and ever-more-powerful neurotechnologies. These dual
necessities illustrate why neuroethicists must be trained both in
neuroscience and in ethics. In what follows, I briefly discuss the
most relevant neurotechnology and its limitations and then canvas a
few ways in which privacy may be infringed by it.</p>

<h4>3.1.1 An illustration: potential threats to privacy with functional MRI</h4>

<p>
One of the most prominent neurotechnologies poised to pose a threat to
privacy is Magnetic Resonance Imaging, or MRI. MRI can provide both
structural and functional information about a person’s brain
with minimal risk and inconvenience. In general, MRI is a tool that
allows researchers noninvasively to examine or monitor brain structure
and activity and to correlate that structure or function with
behavior. Structural or anatomical MRI provides high-resolution
structural images of the brain. While structural imaging in the
biosciences is not new, MRI provides much higher resolution and better
ability to differentiate tissues than prior techniques such as X-rays
or CT scans.</p>

<p>
However, it is not structural but functional MRI (fMRI) that has
revolutionized the study of human cognition. fMRI provides information
about correlates of neuronal activity, from which neural activity can
be inferred. Recent advances in analysis methods for neuroimaging data
such as multi-voxel pattern analysis now allow relatively fine-grained
“decoding” of brain activity (Haynes and Rees 2005; Norman
et al. 2006). Decoding involves using a machine-learning algorithm to
compare an observed pattern of brain activation with a database of
brain activity patterns. The database is composed of experimentally
established correlations between brain activity patterns and a
functional variable of interest, such as a task, behavior, or mental
content. The closest match allows one to (defeasibly) attribute the
associated functional variable to the person being scanned. The kind
of information provided by functional imaging promises to provide
important evidence useful for three goals: Decoding mental content,
diagnosis of mental dysfunction, and prediction of
behavior/character/dysfunction. Neuroethical questions arise in all
these areas.</p>

<p>
Before discussing these issues, it is important to remember that
neuroimaging is a technology that is subject to a number of
significant limitations, and these technical issues limit how precise
the inferences can be. For example:</p>

<ul class="jfy">

<li> The correlations between the fMRI signal and neural activity are
rough: the signal is delayed in time from the neuronal activity, and
spatially smeared, thus limiting the spatial and temporal precision of
the information that can be inferred.</li>

<li> A number of dynamic factors relate the fMRI signal to activity,
and the precise underlying model is not yet well-understood.</li>

<li> There is relatively low signal-to-noise ratio, necessitating
averaging across trials and often across people.</li>

<li> Individual brains differ both in brain structure and in function.
Variability makes determining when differences are clinically or
scientifically relevant difficult and leads to noisy data. Due to
natural individual variability in structure and function and to brain
plasticity (especially during development), even large differences in
structure or deviation from the norm may not be indicative of any
functional deficiency. Cognitive strategies can also affect
variability in the data. These sources of variability can complicate
the analysis of data and provide even more leeway for differences to
exist without dysfunction.</li>

<li> Activity in a brain area does not imply that the region is
necessary for performance of the task.</li>

<li> fMRI is so sensitive to motion that it would be virtually
impossible to get information from a noncompliant subject. This makes
the prospect of reading content from an unwilling mind virtually
impossible.</li>
</ul>

<p>
For more information about limitations and capabilities of fMRI see
(Jones et al. 2009; Morse and Roskies 2013).</p>

<p>
Without appreciating these technical issues and the resulting limits
to what can legitimately be inferred from fMRI, one is likely to
overestimate or mischaracterize the potential threat that it poses. In
fact, much of the fear of mindreading expressed in non-scientific
publications stems from a lack of understanding of the science. For
example, there is no scientific basis to the worry that imaging would
enable the reading of mental content without our knowing it. Only NIRS
(Near InfraRed Spectroscopy), an imaging method that could
theoretically be used at a distance, is the sort of method that could
be employed without the subject’s knowledge, but the kind of
information it provides is very crude and unsuitable for decoding
mental content. Thus, fears that the government is able to remotely or
covertly monitor the thoughts of citizens are unfounded.</p>

<h4>3.1.2 Decoding of mental content</h4>

<p>
Noninvasive ways of inferring neural activity have led many to worry
that mindreading is possible, not just in theory, but even now.
Coupled with decoding techniques, fMRI can be used, for example, to
reconstruct a visual stimulus from activity of the visual cortex while
a subject is looking at a scene or to determine whether a subject is
looking at a familiar face or hearing a particular sound. If mental
content supervenes on the physical structure and function of our
brains, as most philosophers and neuroscientists think it does, then
in principle it should be possible to read minds by reading brains.
Because of the potential to identify mental content, decoding raises
issues about mental privacy.</p>

<p>
Despite the remarkable advances in brain imaging technology, however,
when it comes to mental content, our current abilities to
“mind-read” are relatively limited (Roskies 2015a). Although some aspects of
content can be decoded from neural data, these tend to be quite
general and nonpropositional in character. The ability to infer
semantic meaning from ideation or visual stimulation tends to work
best when the realm of possible contents are quite constrained. Our
current abilities allow us to infer some semantic atoms, such as
representations denoting one of a prespecified set of concrete
objects, but not unconstrained content or entire propositions. Of
course, future advances might make worries about mindreading more
pressing. For example, if we develop means for understanding how
simple mental representations can be combined in order to yield
complex combinations and can decode meaning from these complexes, we
may one day come to be able to decode propositional thought.</p>

<p>
Still, some worries are warranted. Even if neuroimaging is not at the
stage where mindreading is possible, it can nonetheless threaten
aspects of privacy in ways that should give us pause. Even now,
neuroimaging provides some insights into attributes of people that
they may not want known or disclosed. In some cases, subjects may not
even know that these attributes are being probed, thinking they are
being scanned for other purposes. A willing subject may not want
certain things to be monitored. In what follows, I consider a few of
these more realistic worries.</p>

<p>
Implicit bias: Although explicitly acknowledged racial biases are
declining, this may be due to a reporting bias attributable to the
increased negative social valuation of racial prejudice. Much
contemporary research now focuses on examining implicit racial biases,
which are automatic or unconscious reflections of racial bias. With
fMRI and EEG, it is possible to interrogate implicit biases, sometimes
without the subject’s awareness that that is what is being
measured (Chekroud et al. 2014;
Richeson et al. 2003; Luo et al. 2006). (These can also be measured
behaviorally, through tests like the IAT (Implicit Attitude Test), so
the worry is not solely a neuroimaging worry.) While there is
disagreement about how best to interpret implicit bias results (e.g.,
as a measure of perceived threat, as in-group/out-group distinctions,
etc.) and what relevance they have for behavior, the possibility that
implicit biases can be measured, either covertly or overtly, raises
scientific and ethical questions (see implicit.harvard.edu). When
ought this information to be collected? What procedures must be
followed for subjects legitimately to consent to implicit measures?
What significance should be attributed to evidence of biases? What
kind of responsibility should be attributed to people who hold them?
What predictive power might they hold? Should they be used for
practical purposes? One can imagine obvious but controversial
potential uses for implicit bias measures in legal situations, in
employment contexts, in education, and in policing, all areas in which
concerns of social justice are significant. See also entry on
 <a href="../implicit-bias/">implicit bias</a>.</p>
 

<p>
Lie detection: Several neurotechnologies are being used to detect
deception or neural correlates of lying or concealing information in
experimental situations. For example, both fMRI measures looking for
neural correlates of deception and EEG analysis techniques relying on
the P300 signal in versions of the GKT (or Guilty Knowledge Test) have
been used in the laboratory to detect deception with varying levels of
success. These methods are subject to a variety of criticisms (Farah
et al. 2014; National Research Council 2003). For example, almost all
experimental studies fail to study <em>real</em> lying or deception,
but instead investigate some version of instructed misdirection. The
context, tasks, and motivations differ greatly between actual
instances of lying and these experimental analogs, calling into
question whether these laboratory tests are relevant in real-world
situations. Few studies address the tests’ efficacy in the face
of countermeasures. Moreover, accuracy, though significantly higher
than chance, is far from perfect, and because of the inability to
determine base rates of lying, error rates cannot be effectively
assessed. Thus, we cannot establish their reliability for real-world
uses (Roskies 2015a). Despite these limitations, several companies
have marketed neurotechnologies for this purpose (see, e.g., No Lie
MRI, Brainwave Science, Cephos—though Cephos no longer markets
neuroimaging techniques for lie detection).
</p>

<p>
Character traits: Neurotechnologies have shown some promise in
identifying or predicting aspects of personality or character. In an
interesting study aimed at determining how well neuroimaging could
detect lies, Greene and colleagues gave subjects in the fMRI scanner a
prediction task in a game of chance that they could easily cheat on.
By using statistical analysis the researchers could identify a group
of subjects who clearly cheated and others who did not (Greene and
Paxton 2009). Although they could not determine with neuroimaging on
which trials subjects cheated, there were overall differences in brain
activation patterns between cheaters and those who played fair and
were at chance in their predictions. Moreover, Greene and colleagues
repeated this study at several months remove, and found that the
character trait of honesty or dishonesty was stable over time:
cheaters the first time were likely to cheat (indeed, cheated even
more the second time), and honest players remained honest the second
time around. Also interesting was the fact that the brain patterns
suggested that cheaters had to activate their executive control
systems more than noncheaters, not only when they cheated, but also
when deciding not to cheat. While the differential activations cannot
be linked specifically to the propensity to cheat rather than to the
act of cheating, the work suggests that these task-related activation
patterns may reflect correlates of trustworthiness.</p>

<p>
The prospect of using methods for detecting these sorts of traits or
behaviors in real-world situations raises a host of thorny issues.
What level of reliability should be required for their employment? In
what circumstances ought they to be admissible as evidence in the
courtroom? For other purposes? Using lie detection or decoding
techniques from neuroscience in legal contexts may raise
constitutional concerns in the U.S.: Is brain imaging a search or
seizure as protected by the 4<sup>th</sup> Amendment (Farahany 2012a)?
Would its forcible use be precluded by 5<sup>th</sup> Amendment rights
(Farahany 2012b)? These questions, though troubling, might not be
immediately pressing: in a recent case (<em>United States
v. Semrau</em> 2012) the court ruled that fMRI lie detection is
inadmissible, given its current state of development. However, the
opinion left open the possibility that it may be admissible in the
future, if methods improve. Finally, to the extent that relevant
activation patterns may be found to correlate significantly with
activation patterns on other tasks, or with a task-free measure such
as default-network activity, it raises the possibility that
information about character could be inferred merely by scanning the
subjects doing something innocuous, without their knowledge of the
kind of information being sought. Thus, there are multiple dimensions
to the threat to privacy posed by imaging techniques.</p>

<h4>3.1.3 Diagnosis</h4>

<p>
Increasingly, neuroimaging information can bear upon diagnoses for
diseases, and in some instances may provide predictive information
prior to the onset of symptoms. Work on the default network is
promising for improving diagnosis in certain diseases without
requiring that subjects perform specific tasks in the scanner
(Buckner, Andrews-Hanna, and Schacter 2008). For some diseases, such
as in Alzheimer’s disease, MRI promises to provide diagnostic
information that previously could only be established at autopsy. fMRI
signatures have also been linked to a variety of psychiatric diseases,
although not yet with the reliability required for clinical diagnosis.
Neuroethical issues also arise regarding ways to handle incidental
findings, that is, evidence of asymptomatic tumors or potentially
benign abnormalities that appear in the course of scanning research
subjects for non-medical purposes (Illes et al. 2006; Illes and
Sahakian 2011). Because of the popularity of fMRI for basic research
in cognitive neuroscience, this common issue in medical ethics has
become significant for non-medical researchers.</p>

<p>
The ability to predict future functional deficits through neuroimaging
raises a host of issues, many of which have been previously addressed
by genethics (the ethics of genetics), since both provide information
about future disease risk. What may be different is that the diseases
for which neurotechnologies are diagnostically useful are uniformly
those that affect the brain, and thus potentially mental competence,
mood, personality, or sense of self. As such they may raise peculiarly
neuroethical questions (see next section).</p>

<h4>3.1.4 Prediction</h4>

<p>
As discussed above, decoding methods allow one to associate observed
brain activity with previously observed brain/behavior correlations.
In addition, such methods can also be used to predict future
behaviors, insofar as these are correlated with observations of brain
activity patterns. Some studies have already reported predictive power
over upcoming decisions (Soon et al. 2008). Increasingly, we will see
neuroscience or neuroimaging data that will give us some predictive
power over longer-range future behaviors. For example, brain imaging
may allow us to predict the onset of psychiatric symptoms such as
psychotic or depressive episodes (Singh, Sinnott-Armstrong, and
Savulescu 2013; Arbabshirani et al. 2013; Fryer et al. 2013). In cases
in which this behavior is indicative of mental dysfunction it raises
questions about stigma but also may allow more effective
interventions.</p>

<p>
One confusion regarding neuro prediction should be clarified
immediately: When neuroimages are said to “predict” future
activity, it means they provide <em>some</em> statistical information
regarding likelihood. Prediction in this sense does not imply that the
predicted behavior necessarily will come to pass; it does not mean a
person’s future is fated or determined. Although scientists
occasionally make this mistake when discussing their results, the fact
that brain function or structure may give us some information about
future behaviors should not be interpreted as a strong challenge to
free will. The prevalence of this mistake among both philosophers and
scientists again illustrates the importance for neuroethicists of
sophistication in both neuroscience and philosophy.</p>

<p>
Perhaps the most consequential and most ethically difficult potential
use of predictive information is in the criminal justice system. For
example, there is evidence that structural brain differences are
predictive of scores on the PCL-R, a tool developed to diagnose
psychopathy (Hare 1991; Hart and Hare 1997). It is also
well-established that psychopaths have high rates of recidivism for
violent offenses. Thus, in principle neuroimaging could be used to
provide information about an individual’s likelihood of
recidivism. Indeed, a recent study has shown that brain scans did have
predictive value for recidivism, controlling for other risk factors
(Aharoni et al. 2013). Should data like that be admissible for
determining sentences or parole decisions? Would that be equivalent to
punishing someone for crimes they have not committed? Or is it just a
neutral extension of current uses of actuarial information, such as
age, gender, and income level? At an extreme, one could imagine using
predictive information to detain people who have not yet committed a
crime, arresting them before they do. This dystopian scenario,
portrayed in the film <em>Minority Report</em> (Speilberg 2002), also
illustrates how our abilities to predict can raise difficult ethical
and policy questions when they collide with intuitions about and the
value of free will and autonomy. More generally, work in neuroethics
could be of significant practical use for the law, and indeed is often
called by another moniker, “neurolaw”.</p>

<h3 id="Auto">3.2 Autonomy</h3>

<p>
A second way in which cognitive liberty could be impacted is by
limiting a person’s autonomy. Autonomy is the freedom to be the
person one wants to be, to pursue one’s own goals without
unjustifiable hindrances or interference, to be self-governing.
Although definitions of autonomy differ (see, e.g., entries on
 <a href="../personal-autonomy/">personal autonomy</a>
 and
 <a href="../autonomy-moral/">autonomy in moral and political philosophy</a>)
 , it is widely appreciated as a valuable aspect of personhood.
Autonomy of the mental can be impacted in a number of ways. Here are
several:</p>

<p>
Direct interventions: The ability to directly manipulate our brains to
control our thoughts or behavior is an obvious threat to our autonomy.
Some of our neurotechnologies offer that potential, although these
sorts of neurotechnologies are invasive and used only in cases where
they are medically justified. Other types of interventions, such as
the administration of drugs to calm a psychotic person, may also
impact autonomy.</p>

<p>
We know that stimulating certain brain areas in animals will lead to
repetitive and often stereotyped behaviors. Scientists have implanted
rats with electrodes and have been able to control their foraging
behaviors by stimulating their cortex. In theory we could control a
person’s behavior by implanting electrodes in the relevant
regions of cortex. In practice, we have a few methods that can do
this, but only in a limited way. For example, Transcranial Magnetic
Stimulation (TMS) applied to motor cortex can elicit involuntary
movements in the part of the body controlled by the cortical area
affected, or when repetitively administered it can inhibit activity
for a period of time, acting as a temporary lesion. Effects will vary
depending on what area of the brain is stimulated; higher cognitive
functions can be impacted as well. tDCS, or transcranial Direct
Current Stimulation, uses direct current to stimulate cortex, and
there are conflicting reports about whether it can reliably enhance
cognitive function (Horvath, Forte, and Carter 2015; Bennabi et al. 2014). More
invasive methods, such as Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS, discussed
below) and electrocorticography (ECOG), both invasive techniques
requiring brain surgery, demonstrate that direct interventions can
affect cognition, action, and emotion, often in very particular and
predictable ways.</p>

<p>
However much of a threat to autonomy these methods pose in theory,
they are rarely used with the aim of compromising autonomy. On the
contrary, direct brain interventions, when used, are largely aimed at
augmenting or restoring rather than bypassing or diminishing autonomy.
For example, one rapidly advancing field in neuroscience is the area
of neural prostheses and brain computer interfaces. Neural prostheses
are artificial systems that replace defective neural ones, usually
sensory systems. Some of the more advanced and widely-known are
artificial cochleas. Other systems have been developed that allow
vision-like information to feed touch-specific receptors, enabling
blind people to navigate the visual world (Bach-y-Rita and Kercel
2003). Brain computer interfaces (BCIs), on the other hand, are
systems that read brain activity and use it to guide robotic
prostheses for limbs, or to move a cursor on a video screen (Lebedev
and Nicolelis 2006; Wolpaw et al. 2000). Prosthetic limbs that are
guided by neural signals have restored motor agency to paraplegics and
quadriplegics, and other BCIs have been used to communicate with
people who are “locked in”, that is, they are fully
conscious but cannot move their bodies (Birbaumer, Murguialday, and
Cohen 2008; Naseer and Hong 2015). Thus, although in principle brain
interventions could be used to control people and diminish their
autonomy, in general, direct interventions are being developed to
restore and enhance it.</p>

<p>
Neuroeconomics and neuromarketing: There are more subtle ways to
impact autonomy than direct brain manipulations, and these are well
within our grasp: Our thoughts can be manipulated indirectly: old
worries prompted by propaganda and subliminal advertising have taken
on a renewed currency with the advent of neuroeconomics and
neuromarketing. By better understanding how we process reward, how we
make decisions more generally, and how we can bias or influence that
process, we open the door to more effective external indirect
manipulations. Indeed, social psychology has been showing how subtle
alterations to our external environment can affect beliefs, moods, and
behaviors. The precise threats posed by understanding the neural
mechanisms of decision making have yet to be fully articulated. Is
neuromarketing being used merely to design products that satisfy our
desires more fully or is it being used to manipulate us? Depending on
how you see it, it could be construed as a good or an evil. Does
understanding the neural substrates of choice and reward provide
advertisers more effective tools than they had merely by using
behavioral data, or just more costly ones? Do consumers consequently
have less autonomy? How can we compensate for or counteract these
measures? These questions are only beginning to be adequately
addressed (Stanton et al. 2014).</p>

<p>
Regulation: Yet another way that autonomy can be impacted is by
restricting the things that a person can do with and to her own mind.
For instance, banning mind-altering drugs is an externally imposed
restraint on people’s ability to choose their states of
consciousness. The degree to which a person should be prevented from
doing what he wishes to his or her self, body or mind, is an ethical
issue on which people have differing opinions. Some claim this kind of
regulation is a problematic infringement of autonomy (Juth 2011;
Bostrom and Sandberg 2009), but certain regulations of this type are
already largely accepted in our society. For instance, regulation of
drugs of abuse does impact individual autonomy, but it arguably averts
potentially great harms, both self-inflicted harms to the individual
users and associated harms to society. Allowing cognitive enhancing
technologies only for treatment uses but not for enhancement purposes
is another restriction of mental autonomy. Whether it is one we want
to sanction is still up for debate. For instance, the potential harms
to individuals and to society are much less obvious and foreseeable.
Regardless of where this debate goes, it should be clear that complete
autonomy is not practically possible in a world in which one
person’s actions affect the well-being of others.</p>

<p>
Belief in free will: Advances in neuroscience have been frequently
claimed to have bearing upon the question of whether we have free will
and on whether we can be truly morally responsible for our actions.
Although the philosophical problem of free will is generally
considered to be a metaphysical problem, demonstrable lack of freedom
would have significant ethical consequences. A number of
neuroscientists and psychologists have intimated or asserted that
neuroscience can show or has shown that free will is or is not an
illusion (Brembs 2011; Libet et al. 1983; Soon et al. 2008; Wegner
2003). Others have countered with arguments to the effect that such a
demonstration is in principle impossible (Roskies 2006). Regardless of
what science actually shows about the nature of free will, the fact
that people believe neuroscience evidence supports or undermines free
will has been shown to have practical consequences.  For example,
evidence merely supporting the premise that our minds are a function
of our brains, as most of neuroscience does, is perceived by some
people to be a challenge to free will (Nahmias, Coates, and Kvaran
2007). And in several studies, manipulating belief in free will
affects the likelihood of cheating (e.g., Vohs and Schooler 2008). The
debate within neuroscience about the nature and existence of free will
will remain relevant to neuroethics in part because of its impact on
our moral, legal and interpersonal practices of blaming and punishing
people for their harmful actions (see also entries on
 <a href="../freewill/">free will</a>
 and
 <a href="../moral-responsibility/">moral responsibility</a>).</p>

<h2 id="IdenCons">4. Identity and consciousness</h2>
 
<h3 id="PersIden">4.1 Personal Identity</h3>

<p>
One of the aspects of neuroethics that makes it distinctive and
importantly different from traditional bioethics is that we recognize
that, in some yet-to-be-articulated sense, the brain is the seat of
<em>who we are</em> (see, e.g.,
 <a href="../identity-personal/">personal identity</a>).
 For example, we now have techniques that alter memories by blunting
them, strengthening them, or selectively editing them. We have drugs
that affect sexuality, and others that affect mood. Here, neuroethics
rubs up against some of the most challenging and contentious questions
in philosophy: What is the self? Does neuroscience show that the
concept does not refer? If there is a self, what sorts of changes can
we undergo and still remain ourselves? What is it that makes us the
same person over time? Of what value is this temporal persistence?
What costs would changing personhood incur?</p>

<p>
Because neuroscience intervention techniques can affect memory,
desires, personality, mood, impulsivity and other things we might
think of as constitutive of the person or the self, the changes they
can cause (and combat) have a unique potential to affect both the
meaning and quality of the most intimate aspects of our lives.
Although neuroethics is quite different from traditional bioethics in
this regard, it is not so different from genethics. For a long time,
it was argued that “you are your genes”, and so the
ability to interrogate our genomes, to change them, or to select among
them was seen as both a promising and potentially problematic one,
enabling us to understand and manipulate human nature to an extent far
beyond any we had previously enjoyed. But as we have discovered, we
are not (just) our genes. Our ability to sequence the human genome has
not laid bare the causes of cancer, the genetic basis for
intelligence, or of psychiatric illness, as many had anticipated. One
reason is that our genome is a distal cause of the people we come to
be: many complex and intervening factors matter along the way. Our
brains, on the other hand, are a far more proximal cause of who we are
and what we do. Our moment-to-moment behavior and our long-range plans
are directly controlled by our brains, in a way they are not directly
controlled by our genomes. If “You are your genes” seemed
a plausible maxim, “You are your brain” is far more
so.</p>

<p>
Despite its plausibility, it is notoriously difficult to articulate
the way in which we are our brains: What aspects of our brains makes
us the people that we are? What aspects of brain function shape our
memories, our personality, our dispositions? What aspects are
irrelevant or inessential to who we are? What makes possible a
coherent sense of self? The lack of answers we have to these deep
questions does little to alleviate the pragmatic worries raised by
neuroscience, since our ability to intervene in brains outstrips our
understanding of what we are doing, and can affect all these aspects
of our being.</p>

<p>
In philosophy, work focusing on persons may address a variety of
distinct issues using different constructs. Philosophers might be
interested in the nature of personhood, in the nature of the self, in
the kinds of traits and psychological states or processes that give an
experienced life coherence, or in the ingredients for a flourishing
life. Each calls for its own analysis. Outside of philosophy, many of
these issues are run together, and confusion often results.
Neuroethics, while in a unique position to leverage these issues and
apply them in a fruitful way, often fails to make the most of the
conceptual work philosophers have done in this area. For example,
papers in neuroethics often conflate a number of these distinct
concepts, referring them under the rubric of “personal
identity”. This conflation further muddies already difficult
waters, and diminishes the potential value of neuroethical work. Below
I try to give a brief roadmap of the separate strands that
neuroethicists have been concerned with.</p>

<p>
The philosopher’s conception of personal identity refers to the
issue of what makes a person at one time numerically identical to a
person at another time (see entry on
 <a href="../identity-personal/">personal identity</a>).
 This metaphysical question has been addressed by a variety of
philosophical theories. For example, some theorists argue that what it
is to be the numerically identical over time is to be the same human
organism (Olson 1999) and that being the same organism is determined
by sameness of life. If having the same life is the relevant
criterion, one could argue that although life-sustaining areas of the
brainstem are essential to personal identity (Olson 1999), arguably
brain changes that did not interrupt life would not be. For those who
believe instead that bodily integrity is what is essential, arguably
the ability of neuroscience to alter brain activity will have little
effect on personal identity. Many other philosophers have identified
the sameness of a person as being grounded in psychological continuity
of some sort (e.g., Locke 1689). If this criterion is the correct one,
then the stringency of that criterion may be crucial: radical brain
manipulation may cause an abrupt enough shift in memories and other
psychological states that a person after brain intervention is no
longer the same person he or she was prior (Jotterand and Giordano
2011; Glannon 2009; Schermer 2011; see also papers in
<em>Neuroethics</em>, 6(3), 2013). The more stringent the criterion,
the greater is the potential threat of neurotherapies to personal
identity. On the other hand, if the standards for psychological
continuity or connectedness are high enough, changes in personal
identity may in fact be commonplace even without neurotherapies
(Baylis 2011). Recognizing this may prompt us to question the
criterion and/or the importance or value of personal identity. Parfit,
for example, argues that what makes us one and the same person over
time, and what we value (psychological continuity and connectedness)
can come apart (Parfit 1984).</p>

<p>
For some, the question of personhood comes apart from the question of
identity. Even if personal (i.e., numerical) identity is unchallenged
by neurotechnologies and by brain dysfunction, important neuroethical
questions may still be raised. Philosophers less concerned with
metaphysical questions about numerical identity have focused more on
the self, and on notions of authenticity and self-identification,
emphasizing the importance of the psychological perspective of the
person in question in creating a coherent self (e.g., Witt et al.
2013). In this vein, Schectman has suggested that what is important is
the ability to create a coherent narrative, or “narrative
self” (Schechtman 2014). There is evidence that the ability to
create and sustain a coherent narrative in which we are the
protagonist and with which we identify is a measure of psychological
health (Waters and Fivush 2015). On the other hand, some philosophers
deny that they have a narrative self and locate selfhood in a
synchronic property (Strawson 2004). Concerns about the nature and
coherence of the narrative self, and about authenticity and autonomy,
tend to be the ones most relevant to neuroethics, since these
constructs clearly can be affected by even modest brain changes. For
example, how do we evaluate the costs and ethical issues attending a
dramatic change in personality? If neurointerventions promise to
result in dramatic shifts in a person’s values and commitments,
whose interests should take priority if one person must be
favored—the original or the resulting person? The relevance of
personhood, self, agency, identity and identification needs further
elaboration for neuroethics.  In what follows we discuss how one
neurotechnology can bear upon some of these questions.</p>

<h4>4.1.1 Example: Deep Brain Stimulation</h4>

<p>
Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) involves the stimulation of chronically
implanted electrodes deep in the brain, and it is FDA approved for
treating Parkinson’s Disease, a neurodegenerative disease
affecting the dopamine neurons in the striatum. Neuromodulation with
DBS often restores motor function in these patients, permitting many
to live much improved lives. It is also being explored as treatments
for treatment-resistant depression, OCD, addiction, and other
neurological and psychiatric issues. Although DBS is clearly a boon to
many people suffering from neurological diseases, there are a number
of puzzling issues that arise from its adoption. First, it is a highly
invasive treatment, requiring brain surgery and permanent implantation
of a stimulator, thus posing a real possibility of harm and raising
questions of cost/benefit tradeoffs. This is coupled with the fact
that scientists have little mechanistic understanding of how the
treatment works when it does, and treatment regimes and electrode
placement tend to be determined more by art than by science.
Occasionally DBS causes unusual side effects, such as mood changes,
hypomania or mania, addictive behaviors, or hypersexual behavior. In
one case a patient with wide-ranging musical tastes developed a
fixation for Johnny Cash’s music, which persisted until
stimulation was ceased (Mantione, Figee, and Denys 2014). Other
reported cases involve changes in personality. The ethical questions
in this area revolve around the ethics of intervening in ways that
alter mood and/or personality, which is often discussed in terms of
personal identity or “changing who the person is”, and
around questions of autonomy and alienation (Klaming and Haselager
2013; Kraemer 2013).</p>

<p>
One poignant example from the literature tells of a patient who,
without intervention, was bedridden and had to be hospitalized due to
severe motor dysfunction caused by Parkinson’s Disease
(Leentjens et al. 2004).
DBS resulted in a marked improvement in his motor symptoms but also
caused him to be untreatably manic, which required
institutionalization. Thus, this unfortunate man had to choose between
being bedridden and catatonic, or manic and institutionalized. He made
the choice (in his unstimulated state) to remain on stimulation (the
literature does not mention whether his stimulated self concurred).
While it did not happen in this case, one could imagine a situation in
which the patient will choose, while unstimulated, to undergo chronic
stimulation, but, while under stimulation, would choose otherwise (or
<em>vice versa</em>). The possibility for dilemmas or paradoxes will
arise when, for example, we try to determine the value of two
potential outcomes that are differently valued by the people who might
exist. To which person (or to the person in which state) should we
give priority? Or, even more perplexing: if the “identity”
(narrative or numerical) of the person is indeed shifted by the
treatment, should we give one person the authority to consent to a
procedure or choose an outcome that in practice affects a different
person? DBS cases like this will provide fodder for neuroethicists for
years to come.</p>

<p>
Many neurotechnologies that have been developed for treating brain
dysfunction (and especially psychiatric illnesses) have primary or
side effects that affect some aspect of what we may think of as
related to human agency. The ethical issues that arise with these
neurotechnologies involve determining 1) in which way they do impact
our selves or our agency; 2) what value, positive or negative we
should put on this impact (or ability to so affect agency); and 3) how
to weigh the positive gains against the negatives. One issue that has
been raised is whether we possess a clear enough conception of the
elements of agency in order to effectively perform this sort of
analysis (Roskies 2015b). Moreover, given the likelihood that no
objective criteria exist for how to evaluate tradeoffs in these
elements and the fact that different people may value different
aspects of themselves differently, the weighing process will likely
have to be subjectively relativized.</p>

<p>
Finally, DBS as well as neural prostheses and BCIs raise another
neuroethical issue: our conception of humanity and our relations to
machines. Some contend that these technologies effectively turn a
person into a cyborg, making him or her something other than human.
While some find this an ethically unproblematic natural extension of
our species’ characteristic drive to invent and improve our
selves with technology (Clark 2004), others fear that creating a
bio-cybernetic organism raises troubling questions about the nature or
value of humanity, about the bounds of self, or about Promethean
impulses (Attiah and Farah 2014; Sandel 2009).</p>

<h3 id="ConsLifeDeat">4.2 Consciousness, life, and death</h3>

<p>
The Hard Problem of consciousness (namely, how to explain the
qualitative character of experience, or “what it is like”
to have a particular experience, see e.g., Chalmers 1995) has yielded
little to the probings of neuroscience, and it is not clear whether it
ever will. However, in the last decade impressive advances have been
made in other realms of consciousness research. Most impressive have
been the improvements in detecting altered levels of consciousness
with brain imaging. Diagnosing behaviorally unresponsive patients has
long been a problem for neurology, although as long as 20 years ago,
neurologists had recognized systematic differences between and in the
prognoses for a persistent vegetative state (PVS), a minimally
conscious state (MCS), and locked-in syndrome, a syndrome in which the
patient has normal levels of awareness but cannot move. Functional
brain imaging has fundamentally changed the problems faced by those
caring for these patients. Owen and colleagues have shown that it is
possible to identify some patients mischaracterized as being in PVS by
demonstrating that they are able to understand commands and follow
directions (Owen et al. 2006).
In these studies, both normal subjects and brain injured patients were
instructed to visualize doing two different activities while in the
fMRI scanner. In normal subjects these two tasks activated different
parts of cortex. Owen showed that one patient diagnosed as in PVS
showed this normal pattern, unlike other PVS patients, who showed no
differential activation when given these instructions. This data
suggests that some PVS diagnosed subjects can in fact process and
understand the instructions, and that they have the capacity for
sustained attention and voluntary mental action. These results were
later replicated in other such patients. In a later study the same
group used these imagination techniques to elicit from some patients
with severe brain injury answers to Yes/No questions (Monti et al.
2010). More recent work aims to adapt these methods for EEG, a cheaper
and more portable neurotechnology (Cruse et al. 2011). Neuroimaging
provides new tools for evaluating and diagnosing patients with
disorders of consciousness.</p>

<p>
These studies have the potential to revolutionize the way in which
patients with altered states of consciousness are diagnosed and cared
for, may have bearing on when life support is terminated, and raise
the possibility of allowing patients to have some control over
questions regarding their care and end of life decisions. This last
possibility, while in some ways alleviating some worries about how to
treat severely brain-damaged individuals, raises other thorny ethical
problems. One of the most pressing is how to deal with questions of
competence and informed consent: These are people with severe brain
damage, and even when they do appear capable on occasion of
understanding and answering questions, there is still uncertainty
about whether their abilities are stable, how sophisticated they are,
and whether they can competently make decisions about such weighty
issues (Clausen 2008; Sinnott-Armstrong 2016). Nonetheless, these
methods open up new possibilities for diagnosis and treatment and for
restoring a measure of autonomy and self-determination to people with
severe brain damage.</p>

<h2 id="NeurSoci">5. Neuroscience and society</h2>

<h3 id="NeurSociJust">5.1 Neuroscience and social justice</h3>

<p>
Neuroethics must also be attentive to issues of social justice. Beyond
issues that affect individuals, such as autonomy, consent, and
self-determination, discussed above, are ethical issues that affect
the shape of society. In this regard the concerns are not
substantially different than in traditional bioethics. As neuroscience
promises to offer treatments and enhancements, it must attend to
issues of distributive justice and play a role in ensuring that the
fruits of neuroscientific research do not go only to those who enjoy
the best our society has to offer. Moreover, a growing understanding
that poverty and socioeconomic status more generally have long-lasting
cognitive effects raises moral questions about the social policy and
the structure of our society, and the growing gap between rich and
poor (Farah 2007; Noble and Farah 2013). It seems that the social and
neuroscientific realities may reveal the American Dream to be largely
hollow, and these findings may undercut some popular political
ideologies. Justice may demand more involvement of neuroethicists in
policy decisions (Giordano, Kulkarni, and Farwell 2014; Shook,
Galvagni, and Giordano 2014).</p>

<p>
Ethical issues also arise from neuroscientific research on nonhuman
animals. As does traditional bioethics, neuroethics must address
questions about the ethical use of animals for experimental purposes
in neuroscience. In addition, however, it ought to consider questions
regarding the use of animals as model systems for understanding the
human brain and human cognition. Animal studies have given us the bulk
of our understanding of neural physiology and anatomy, and have
provided significant insight into function of conserved biological
capacities. However, the further we push into unknown territory about
higher cognitive functions, the more we will have to attend to the
specifics of similarities and differences between humans and other
species, and evaluating the model system may involve considerable
philosophical work (Shanks, Greek, and Greek 2009; Shelley 2010;
Nestler and Hyman 2010). In some cases, the dissimilarities may not
warrant animal experiments.</p>

<p>
Finally, neuroethics stretches seamlessly into the law (see, e.g.,
Vincent 2013; Morse and Roskies 2013). Neuroethical issues arise in
criminal law, in particular with the issue of criminal responsibility.
For example, the recognition that a large percentage of prison inmates
have some history of head trauma or other abnormality raises the
question of where to draw the line between the bad and the mad (Center
for Disease Control 2007; Maibom 2008). Neuroethics has bearing on
issues of addiction: some have characterized addiction as a brain
disease or species of dysfunction, and question whether it is
appropriate to hold addicts responsible for their behavior (Hyman
2007; Carter, Hall, and Illes 2011). Research has demonstrated that
human brains are not fully developed until the mid-twenties,and that
the areas last to develop are prefrontal regions involved in executive
control and inhibition. In light of this, many have argued that
juveniles should not be held fully responsible for criminal behavior.
Indeed, a recent Supreme Court ruling (<em>Roper v. Simmons</em>,
2005) has barred the death penalty for juvenile murderers, but
although an <em>amicus</em> brief in favor of the ruling referenced
brain immaturity, the opinion itself does not rely upon it. A later
case, <em>Miller v. Alabama</em> (2012) rules life without parole for
juveniles unconstitutional, and mentions neuroscience and social
science in a footnote. Other areas of law, such in tort law,
employment law, and health care law also overlap with neuroethical
concerns, and may well be influenced by neuroscientific discoveries
(Clausen and Levy 2015; Freeman 2011; Jones, Schall, and Shen
2014).</p>

<h3 id="PublPercNeur">5.2 Public perception of neuroscience</h3>

<p>
The advances of neuroscience have become a common topic in the popular
media, with colorful brain images becoming a pervasive illustrative
trope in news stories about neuroscience. While no one doubts that
popularizing neuroscience is a positive good, neuroethicists have been
legitimately worried about the possibilities for misinformation. These
include worries about “the seductive allure” of
neuroscience, and of misleading and oversimplified media coverage of
complex scientific questions.</p>

<h4>5.2.1 The seductive allure</h4>

<p>
There is a documented tendency for the layperson to think that
information that makes reference to the brain or to neuroscience or
neurology is more privileged, more objective, or more trustworthy than
information that makes reference to the mind or psychology. For
example, Weisberg and colleagues report that subjects with little or
no neuroscience training rated bad explanations as better when they
made reference to the brain or incorporated neuroscientific
terminology (Weisberg et al. 2008). This “seductive allure of
neuroscience” is akin to an unwarranted epistemic deference to
authority. This differential appraisal extends into real-world
settings, with testimony from a neuroscientist or neurologist judged
to be more credible than that of a psychologist. The tendency is to
view neuroscience as a hard science in contrast to “soft”
methods of inquiry that focus on function or behavior. With
neuroimaging methods, this belies a deep misunderstanding of the
genesis and significance of the neuroscientific information. What
people fail to realize is that neuroimaging information is classified
and interpreted by its ties to function, so (barring unusual
circumstances) it cannot be more reliable or “harder” than
the psychology it relies upon.</p>

<p>
Brain images in particular have prompted worries that the colorful
images of brains with “hotspots” that accompany media
coverage could themselves be misleading. If people intuitively
appreciate brain images as if they were akin to a photograph of the
brain in action, this could mislead them into thinking of these images
as objective representations of reality, prompting them to overlook
the many inferential steps and nondemonstrative decisions that
underlie creation of the image they see (Roskies 2007). The worry is
that the powerful pull of the brain image will lend a study more
epistemic weight than is justified and discourage people from asking
the many complicated questions that one must ask in order to
understand what the image signifies and what can be inferred from the
data. Further work, however, has suggested that once one takes into
account the privilege accorded to neuroscience over psychology, the
images themselves do not further mislead (Schweitzer et al. 2011).</p>

<h4>5.2.2 Media hype</h4>

<p>
In this era of indubitably exciting progress in brain research, there
is a “brain-mania” that is partially warranted but holds
its own dangers. The culture of science is such that it is not
uncommon for scientists to describe their work in the most dramatic
terms possible in order to secure funding and/or fame. Although the
hyperbole can be discounted by knowledgeable readers, those less
sophisticated about the science may take it at face value. Studies
have shown that the media is rarely critical of the scientific
findings they report, and they tend not to present alternative
interpretations (Racine et al. 2006). The result is that the popular media conveys sometimes
wildly inaccurate pictures of legitimate scientific discoveries, which
can fuel both overly optimistic enthusiasm as well as fear (Racine et
al. 2010). One of the clear pragmatic goals of neuroethics, whether it
regards basic research or clinical treatments, is to exhort and
educate scientists and the media to better convey both the promise and
complexities of scientific research. It is the job of both these
groups to teach people enough about science in general, and brain
science in particular, that they see it as worthy of respect, and also
of the same critical assessment to which scientists themselves subject
their own work.</p>

<p>
It is admittedly difficult to accurately translate complicated
scientific findings for the lay public, but it is essential.
Overstatement of the significance of results can instill unwarranted
hope in some cases, fear in others, and jadedness and suspicion going
forward. None of these are healthy for the future status and funding
of the basic sciences, and providing fodder for scientific naysayers
has policy implications that go far beyond the reach of
neuroscience.</p>

<h3 id="PracNeur">5.3 Practical neuroethics</h3>

<p>
Medical practice and neuroscientific research raise a number of
neuroethical issues, many of which are common to bioethics. For
example, issues of consent, of incidental findings, of competence, and
of privacy of information arise here. In addition, practicing
neurologists, psychologists and psychiatrists may routinely encounter
certain brain diseases or psychological dysfunctions that raise
neuroethical issues that they must address in their practices (Farah
2005). Because of the overlap with traditional bioethics, these issues
will not be discussed further here (articles on many of these topics
can be found elsewhere in this encyclopedia). For a more detailed
discussion of these more applied neuroethics issues approached from a
pragmatic point of view, see, for example, Racine (2010).</p>

<h2 id="NeurEthi">6. The neuroscience of ethics</h2>

<p>
Neuroscience, or more broadly the cognitive and neural sciences, have
made significant inroads into understanding the neural basis of
ethical thought and social behavior. In the last decades, these fields
have begun to flesh out the neural machinery underlying human
capacities for moral judgment, altruistic action, and the moral
emotions. The field of social neuroscience, nonexistent two decades
ago, is thriving, and our understanding of the circuitry, the
neurochemistry, and the modulatory influences underlying some of our
most complex and nuanced interpersonal behaviors is growing rapidly.
Neuroethics recognizes that the heightened understanding of the
biological bases of social and moral behaviors can itself have effects
on how we conceptualize ourselves as social and moral agents, and
foresees the importance of the interplay between our scientific
conception of ourselves and our ethical views and theories. The
interplay and its effects provide reason to view the neuroscience of
ethics (or more broadly, of sociality) as part of the domain of
neuroethics.</p>

<p>
Perhaps the most well-known and controversial example of such an
interplay marks the beginning of this kind of exploration. In 2001,
Joshua Greene scanned people while they made a series of moral and
nonmoral decisions in different scenarios, including dilemmas modeled
on the philosophical “Trolley Problem” (Thomson 1985). The
trolley problem is an example of a moral dilemma: In one scenario, a
trolley is careening down a track, and is headed for 5 people. If it
hits them they will all be killed. You, an onlooker, could throw a
switch to divert the trolley from the main track onto a side track,
where there is only one person, who, if you throw the switch, will be
killed. Should you do nothing and let the 5 be killed or switch the
trolley to the side track and kill the one to save the 5? In a
supposedly parallel scenario, the “footbridge” case, the
trolley is headed for the 5, but you are on a footbridge above the
track with a heavy man, heavy enough to stop the trolley. Should you
push the man off the tracks in the way of the trolley, saving the 5 at
the expense of the one? The Trolley Problem puzzle is why we seem to
have different intuitions in these cases, since both involve saving 5
at the expense of one. When Greene scanned subjects faced with a
series of such scenarios, he found systematic differences in the
engagement of brain regions associated with moral processing in
“personal” (e.g., pushing) as opposed to
“impersonal” (e.g., flipping a switch) moral dilemmas. He
hypothesized that emotional interference was behind the differential
reaction times in judgments of permissibility in the footbridge case.
In later work, Greene proposed a dual-process model of moral judgment,
where relatively automatic emotion-based reactions and high-level
cognitive control jointly determined responses to moral dilemmas, and
he related his findings to philosophical moral theories (Greene et al. 2004,
2008). Most
controversially, he suggested that there are reasons to be suspicious
of our deontological judgments and interpreted his work as lending
credence to utilitarian theories (Greene 2013). Greene’s work is
thus a clear example of how neuroscience might affect our ethical
theorizing. Claims regarding the import of neuroscience studies for
philosophical questions have sparked a heated debate in philosophy and
beyond, and prompted critiques and replies from scholars both within
and outside of philosophy (see, e.g., Berker 2009; Kahane et al. 2011;
Christensen et al. 2014). One effect of these exchanges is to
highlight a problematic tendency for scientists and some philosophers
to think they can draw normative conclusions from purely descriptive
data; another is to illuminate the ways in which descriptive data
might itself masquerade as normative.</p>

<p>
Greene’s early studies demonstrated that neuroscience can be
used in the service of examining extremely high-level behaviors and
capacities, and have served as an inspiration for numerous other
experiments investigating the neural basis of social and moral
behavior and competences. Neuroscience has already turned its
attention to phenomena such as altruism, empathy, well-being, and
theory of mind, as well as to disorders such as autism and psychopathy
(Sinnott-Armstrong 2007; Churchland 2012; Decety and Wheatley 2015;
Zak 2013). The relevant works range from imaging studies using a
variety of imaging techniques, to manipulation of hormones and
neurochemicals, to purely behavioral studies. In addition, interest in
moral and social neuroscience has collided synergistically with the
growth of neuroeconomics, which has flourished in large part
independently (Glimcher and Fehr 2013). A recent bibliography has
collected almost 400 references to works in the neuroscience of ethics
since 2002 (Darragh, Buniak, and Giordano 2015). We can safely assume
that many more advances will be made in the years to come, and that
neuroethicists will be called upon to advance, evaluate, expound upon,
or deflate claims for the purported ethical implications of our new
knowledge.</p>

<h2 id="LookForwNewNeur">7. Looking forward: new neurotechnologies</h2>

<p>
The examples discussed above included pharmaceuticals that are already
approved for use, existing brain imaging techniques and invasive
neurotherapies. But practical neuroethical concerns, and some
theoretical concerns, are highly dependent upon the details of
technologies. Several technologies are already on the horizon that are
bound to raise some new neuroethical questions, or old questions in
new guises. One of the most powerful new tools in the research
neuroscientist’s arsenal is “optogenetics”, a method
of transfecting brain cells with genetically engineered proteins that
make the cell responsive to light of specific wavelengths. The cells
can then be activated or silenced by shining light upon them, allowing
for cell-specific external control (Deisseroth 2011; Yizhar et al.
2011). Optogenetics has been successfully used in many model
organisms, including rats, and work is underway to use optogenetics in
monkeys. One may presume it is only a matter of time before it will be
developed for use in humans. The method promises to provide precise
control of specific neural populations and relatively noninvasive
targeted treatments for diseases. It promises to introduce the kind of
neuroethical issues raised by many mechanisms that intervene with
brain function: questions of harm, of authenticity, and the prospect
of brain cells being controlled by someone other than the agent
himself. A second technique, CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced
Short Palindromic Repeat), allows powerful targeted gene editing (Cong
et al. 2013). Although not strictly a neuroscientific technique, it
can be used on neural cells to effect brain changes at the genetic
level. Genetic engineering might make possible neural gene therapies
and designer babies, making real the consequences of the genetic
revolution thus far only imagined.</p>

<p>
These and other technologies were not even imagined a few decades ago,
and it is likely that other future technologies will emerge which we
cannot currently conceive of. If many neuroethical issues are closely
tied to the capabilities of neurotechnologies, as I have argued, then
we are unlikely to anticipate future technologies in enough detail to
predict the constellation of neuroethical issues that they may give
rise to. Neuroethics will have to grow as neuroscience does, adapting
to novel ethical and technological challenges.</p>
