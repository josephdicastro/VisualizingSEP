<h1>Newton’s Philosophy</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Fri Oct 13, 2006; substantive revision Tue May 6, 2014</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>Isaac Newton (1642–1727) lived in a philosophically rich and
tumultuous time, one that saw the end of the Aristotelian dominance of
philosophy in Europe, the rise and fall of Cartesianism, the emergence
of “experimental philosophy” (later called
“empiricism” in the nineteenth century) in Great Britain,
and the development of numerous experimental and mathematical methods
for the study of nature. Newton's contributions to
mathematics—including the co-discovery of the calculus with his
(eventual) foe Leibniz—and to what is now called physics,
including both its experimental and theoretical aspects, will forever
dominate discussions of his lasting influence. But his impact on the
development of early modern philosophy was also profound, so much so
that it is difficult to grasp the history of philosophy in the late
seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries without considering
Newton's role. His engagement with Cartesian ideas and methods early
in his life was just as significant to the transformation of
philosophy in the seventeenth century as his debates with Leibniz were
to the setting of the agenda of philosophy in the eighteenth.
Obviously, Newton is not part of the traditional canon of the period,
which would focus on the great sextet, Descartes, Spinoza, Leibniz,
Locke, Berkeley, and Hume. (The distinction between the two pairs of
three “rationalists” and “empiricists” owes
much to the Kantian conception of the history of philosophy in the
late eighteenth century.) But this conception of the canon has been
challenged substantially by the past generation of scholarship. And
ironically, with the possible exception of Spinoza, Newton engaged
with or personally influenced the other five canonical philosophers of
the early modern era (cf. Schliesser 2012). Thus Newton's
contributions to, and influence on, early modern philosophy is a rich
topic.</p>

<h2><a id="PlaNewHisNat">1. Placing Newton in the history of natural philosophy</a></h2>

<p>

Traditionally, Newton would be characterized as a mathematician for
his work on the calculus and as scientist for his work in physics. His
celebrated talent in mathematics is perhaps equaled not only by his
profound theorizing concerning the physical world, but also his
influential experimental methods in optics. Indeed, Newton is
remarkable for the fact that his work as a theoretician is matched by
his work as an experimentalist—either aspect of his
<em>oeuvre</em> would be sufficient to secure his place in the history
of modern science. So in the popular imagination, and in the history
books, Newton is seen as one of the greatest scientists of the modern
period, on a par with few others (perhaps Darwin or Einstein). It is
unwise to quibble with this perspective, and it is presumably the view
that will continue to dominate our understanding of Newton in the
twenty-first century.</p>

<p>
If we attempt to understand Newton's work from an historical point of
view, however, a different, and more complex, conception
emerges. There are historical reasons for resisting the temptation to
think of Newton as a scientist. For starters, no such category existed
during Newton's day: the category of the scientist—along with
that word in English—is a nineteenth century invention.
Specifically, at a meeting of the British Association for the
Advancement of Science in June of 1833, the Cambridge philosopher
William Whewell coined the word “scientist”. At the
meeting, Whewell said that just as the practitioners of art are called
“artists”, the practitioners of science ought to be called
“scientists”, indicating that they should no longer be
called
 philosophers.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#1" name="note-1">1</a>]</sup>
 Indeed, before the early nineteenth
century, people like Newton were called “philosophers”, or
more specifically, “natural philosophers”. This might
appear to be mere semantics, but it is not. During the seventeenth
century, and well into the eighteenth (at least until 1750, if not
later), figures like Newton worked within the century's-old tradition
of natural
 philosophy.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#2" name="note-2">2</a>]</sup>
 The modern disciplines of physics,
chemistry, biology and so on had not yet been formed. Philosophers who
studied nature investigated such things as planetary motions and the
possibility of a vacuum, but they also discussed many aspects of human
beings, including the psyche, and how nature reflects its divine
creator (Hatfield 1996). As the title of Newton's magnum opus,
<em>Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica</em> (<em>Mathematical
Principles of Natural Philosophy</em>), suggests, he intended his work
to be in dialogue with Descartes's <em>Principia Philosophiae</em>
(<em>Principles of Philosophy</em>, 1644), a complex text that
includes discussions of everything from the laws of nature to the
nature of God's causal influence on the world. Just as Descartes had
sought to replace Aristotelian or “Scholastic” methods and
doctrines in natural philosophy, Newton sought his work to replace
Descartes's. It is therefore more historically accurate and more
illuminating to interpret Newton within the historical stream of
natural
  philosophy.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#3" name="note-3">3</a>]</sup></p>

<p>
As is well known, natural philosophy in the Aristotelian traditions of
the thirteenth through the sixteenth centuries involved an analysis of
Aristotle's ideas about the natural world, especially within the
Christianized context of the medieval period. Philosophers studying
nature were often actually studying texts—such as commentaries
on Aristotle—rather than conducting experiments or engaging in
observations, and they often did not employ mathematical techniques.
Traditionally, natural philosophy in Aristotelian circles was not
conceived of as a mathematical discipline (unlike, say, optics or
astronomy); instead, it focused especially on the natures of objects
and on causation. In the seventeenth century, natural philosophers
like Galileo, Boyle, Descartes, and Newton began to reject not only
the doctrines of the Aristotelians, but their techniques as well,
developing a number of new mathematical, conceptual and experimental
methods. Newton respected Descartes's rejection of Aristotelian ideas,
but argued that Cartesians did not employ enough of the mathematical
techniques of Galileo, or of the experimental methods of Boyle, in
trying to understand nature. Of course, these developments have often
been regarded as central to the so-called Scientific
Revolution. Despite the centrality of these changes during the
seventeenth century, however, the <em>scope</em> of natural philosophy
had not dramatically changed. Natural philosophers like Newton
expended considerable energy trying to understand, e.g., the nature of
motion, but they regarded that endeavor as a component of an
overarching enterprise that also included an analysis of the divine
being. Newton was a natural philosopher—unlike Descartes, he was
not a founder of modern philosophy, for he never wrote a treatise of
the order of the <em>Meditations</em>. Nonetheless, his
<em>influence</em> on philosophy in the eighteenth century was
profound, extending well beyond the bounds of philosophers studying
nature, encompassing numerous figures and traditions in Britain, on
the Continent, and even in the New 
World.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#4" name="note-4">4</a>]</sup>
 Newton's influence has at least two salient
aspects.</p>

<p>
First, Newton's achievement in the <em>Opticks</em> and in the
<em>Principia</em> was understood to be of such philosophical import
that few philosophers in the eighteenth century ignored it. Most of
the canonical philosophers in this period sought to interpret various
of Newton's epistemic claims within the terms of their own systems,
and many saw the coherence of their own views with those of Newton as
a criterion of philosophical excellence. Early in the century,
Berkeley grappled with Newton's work on the calculus in <em>The
Analyst</em> (1734) and with his dynamics in <em>De Motu</em> (1721),
and he even mentioned gravity, the paradigmatic Newtonian force, in
his popular work <em>Three Dialogues between Hylas and Philonous</em>
(1713). When Berkeley lists what philosophers take to be the so-called
primary qualities of material bodies in the <em>Dialogues</em>, he
remarkably adds “gravity” to the more familiar list of
size, shape, motion, and solidity, thereby suggesting that the
received view of material bodies had already changed before the second
edition of the <em>Principia</em> had circulated widely. Hume
interpreted Newtonian natural philosophy in an empiricist vein and
noted some of its broader implications in his <em>Treatise of Human
Nature</em> (1739) and <em>Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding</em>
(1750). Newton's work also served as the impetus for the extremely
influential correspondence between Leibniz and the Newtonian Samuel
Clarke early in the century, a correspondence that proved significant
even for thinkers writing toward the century's end. Unlike the <em>vis
viva</em> controversy and other disputes between the Cartesians and
the Leibnizians, which died out by the middle of the century, the
debate between the Leibnizians and the Newtonians remained
philosophically salient for decades, serving as the impetus for Emilie
Du Châtelet's influential work during the French Enlightenment,
<em>Foundations of Physics</em> (1740), and also as one of the driving
forces behind Kant's development of the “critical”
philosophy during the 1770s, culminating in the <em>Critique of Pure
Reason</em> (1781). In addition, Newton's work spawned an immense
commentarial literature in English, French, and Latin, including John
Keill's <em>Introduction to Natural Philosophy</em> (1726), Henry
Pemberton's <em>A View of Sir Isaac Newton's Philosophy</em> (1728),
Voltaire's <em>Elements of the Philosophy of Newton</em> (1738),
Willem 's Gravesande's <em>Mathematical Elements of Natural
Philosophy</em> (1747), Colin MacLaurin's <em>An Account of Sir Isaac
Newton's Philosophical Discoveries</em> (1748), which probably
influenced Hume, and Du Châtelet's and Clairaut's commentary on
Newton's <em>Principia</em> (1759). These and other commentaries were
printed in various editions, were translated into various languages,
and were often influential.</p>

<p>
A second aspect of Newton's influence involves thinkers who attempted
in one way or another to articulate, follow, or extend, the Newtonian
“method” in natural philosophy when treating issues and
questions that Newton ignored. Euclidean geometry and its methods were
seen as a fundamental epistemic model for much of seventeenth-century
philosophy—as is well known, Descartes' <em>Meditations</em>
attempts to achieve a type of certainty he likens to that found in
geometry, and Spinoza wrote his <em>Ethics</em> according to the
“geometrical method”. Propositions deduced from theorems
in Euclidean geometry were seen as paradigm cases of knowledge. We
might see Newton's work as providing eighteenth-century philosophy
with one of its primary models, and with a series of epistemic
exemplars as well, but part of philosophy's task was to articulate
precisely what the new Newtonian method essentially involved. David
Hume is perhaps clearest about this aspect of Newton's influence. His
<em>Treatise</em> of 1739 has the subtitle: “An Attempt to
Introduce the Experimental Method of Reasoning Into Moral
Subjects”, and there can be little doubt that he meant (at least
in part) the method of the <em>Opticks</em> and the <em>Principia</em>
(DePierris 2012). Indeed, as Hume's text makes abundantly clear,
various eighteenth-century philosophers, including not only Hume in
Scotland but Jean-Jacques Rousseau on the Continent, were taken to be,
or attempted to become, “the Newton of the 
mind”.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#5" name="note-5">5</a>]</sup> 
For Hume, this meant
following what he took to be Newton's empirical method by providing
the proper description of the relevant natural phenomena and then
finding the most general principles that account for them (of course,
one aspect of Hume's work is to provide an analysis of the concept of
causation that is far more extensive than anything found in Newton,
which has a substantial impact on what counts as an
“account” of a phenomenon). This method would allow us to
achieve the highest level of knowledge attainable in the realm of what
Hume calls “matters of
 fact”.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#6" name="note-6">6</a>]</sup></p>

<p>
Despite the influence of Newton's “method” on
eighteenth-century philosophy, it is obvious that the
<em>Principia</em>'s greater impact on the eighteenth century is to
have effected a branching within natural philosophy that led to the
development of mathematical physics on the one hand, and philosophy on
the other. And yet to achieve an understanding of how Newton himself
approached natural philosophy, we must carefully bracket such
historical developments—they did not solidify until at least
1750, a generation after Newton's death. Indeed, if we resist the
temptation to understand Newton as working within a well established
discipline called mathematical physics, if we see him instead as a
philosopher studying nature, his achievement is far more impressive, for
instead of contributing to a well-founded field of physics, he had to
begin a process that would eventually lead aspects of natural
philosophy to be transformed into a new field of study. This
transformation took many decades, and involved a series of
methodological and foundational debates about the proper means for
obtaining knowledge about nature and its processes. Newton himself not
only engaged in these debates from his very first publication in
optics in 1672, his work in both optics and in the <em>Principia</em>
generated some of the most significant methodological discussions and
controversies in the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries.
These debates concerned such topics as the proper use of hypotheses,
the nature of space and time, and the appropriate rules for conducting
research in natural philosophy. Newton's achievement was in part to
have vanquished both Cartesian and Leibnizian approaches to natural
philosophy; in the later eighteenth century, and indeed much of the
nineteenth, physics was largely a Newtonian enterprise. But this
achievement, from Newton's own perspective, involved an extensive,
life-long series of philosophical debates. Those debates focused on
numerous substantive issues, but also included extensive discussions
of the proper methodology in natural philosophy.</p>

<h2><a id="MetIOptDeb167">2. Methodology I: the optics debates of the 1670s</a></h2>

<p>

Philosophers have long known about various aspects of Newton's work
that are salient for understanding debates in the early modern
period. For instance, no history of debates about the ontology of
space and time would exclude a discussion of Newton's famous
conception of “absolute” space (see below). Similarly, any
discussion of the role of hypotheses in philosophical reasoning would
mention Newton prominently. These aspects of Newton's work continue to
be significant in contemporary scholarship, but the scope of
discussions of Newton has greatly expanded, encompassing the whole of
Newton's mature intellectual life. This is especially evident in
discussions of Newton's earliest published work, which was in the
field of optics. In at least three relevant respects, Newton's early
work in optics, which was published in the <em>Philosophical
Transactions</em> of the Royal Society beginning in 1672, set the
stage for the principal themes of his long career in natural
philosophy (he remained active well into his seventies). Firstly,
Newton's letter to the Society's secretary, Henry Oldenburg, often
called the “New theory about light and colors”, generated
an immediate, extensive, and protracted debate that eventually
involved important philosophers such as Robert Hooke in Britain and
Christiaan Huygens, G.W. Leibniz and Ignatius Pardies on the Continent
(the beginning of the very long title of the paper is: “A letter
of Mr. Isaac Newton, Mathematick Professor in the University of
Cambridge, containing his New Theory about Light and
Colors”). Newton consistently regarded these figures not merely
as disagreeing with his views, but as misinterpreting them. This
experience helped to shape Newton's famous and lifelong aversion to
intellectual controversy, a feature of his personality that he often
mentioned in letters, and one that he would never outgrow. Secondly,
because Newton regarded himself as misinterpreted by his critics, he
had recourse to meta-level or methodological discussions of the
practice of optics and of the kinds of knowledge that philosophers can
obtain when engaging in experiments with light. The novelty and power
of Newton's work in the <em>Principia</em> years later would
eventually generate similar controversies that led him to analogous
kinds of methodological discussions of his experimental practice
within natural philosophy and of the kinds of knowledge that one can
obtain in that field using either experimental or mathematical
techniques. From <em>our</em> point of view, Newton's science was
unusually philosophical for these reasons. Thirdly and finally, in his
earliest optical work Newton began to formulate a distinction that
would remain salient throughout his long intellectual career,
contending that a philosopher must distinguish between a conclusion or
claim about some feature of nature that is derived from experimental
or observational evidence, and a conclusion or claim that is a mere
“hypothesis”, a kind of speculation about nature that is
not, or not yet anyway, so derived.  Newton's much later proclamation
in the second edition of the <em>Principia</em> (1713),
“<em>Hypotheses non fingo</em>”, or “I feign no
hypotheses”, would infuriate his critics just as much as it
would prod his followers into making the pronouncement a central
component of a newly emerging Newtonian method (see below for
details).</p>

<p>
The field of optics has its origins in the Ancient Greek period, when
figures like Euclid and Ptolemy wrote works on the subject, but they
often focused primarily on the science of vision, analyzing (e.g.)
the visual rays that were sometimes thought to extrude from the eye,
enabling it to perceive distant physical objects. In the early modern
period, Kepler and Descartes each made fundamental contributions to
the field, including the discovery of the inversion of the retinal
image (in the former case) and an explanation of refraction (in the
latter case). Newton's work helped to shift the focus of optics from
an analysis of vision to an investigation of light. In “New
theory about light and colors”, published in the
<em>Philosophical Transactions</em> in 1672, Newton presented a number
of experiments in which sunlight was allowed to pass through one or two
prisms in order to probe some of its basic features. The paper
recounts a number of experiments that Newton says he had conducted
several years earlier.  But what precisely counts as a
<em>feature</em> of light? Numerous philosophers during the
seventeenth century, including Hooke and Huygens, developed doctrines
concerning the fundamental physical nature of light in answer to the
question: is light a stream of particles (or
“corpuscles”), or is it a wave? Both Hooke and Huygens
were wave theorists. This question obviously continued to have
relevance into the twentieth century, when wave-particle duality was
discovered.  In his experiments with the prism, however, Newton
apparently sought to investigate something else, viz. what he calls
“the celebrated <em>Phenomena of Colours</em>”. Newton's
various prism experiments, which he describes in considerable depth,
suggested to him a “Doctrine” that he expresses in
thirteen consecutive numbered propositions. Included in these
propositions are the following claims about features of rays of light:
first, the rays of light that emerge when sunlight passes through a
prism exhibit various colors; second, these colors differ in their
“degrees of Refrangibility”, which means that they exhibit
and retain an index of refraction, even when they are passed through a
second prism; third, these colors—or colorful rays—are not
modifications of sunlight itself, but rather are
“<em>Original</em> and <em>connate properties</em>” of it;
and, fourth, these facts mean that although ordinary sunlight appears
white, or perhaps colorless, to our perception, it actually contains
numerous colors within it, which can be experimentally revealed. This
final point suggests, in turn, that from Newton's point of view,
colors are not solely perceived, or even perceptible, aspects of
physical objects; they can also be conceived of as hidden features of
light which cannot be perceived directly under any ordinary
circumstance (the physical influence of the prism is required for them
to become perceptible).</p>

<p> From a contemporary point of view, Newton's 1672 paper exhibits an
intriguing blend of experimental evidence and philosophical
argumentation. The latter hinges on Newton's interpretation of the
concept of a property or a quality, as the following passage, which
follows the “Doctrine” expressed in thirteen propositions,
tellingly reveals:</p>
<blockquote>
 <p>

These things being so, it can be no longer disputed, whether there be
colours in the dark, nor whether they be the qualities of the objects
we see, no nor perhaps, whether Light be a Body. For, since Colours
are the <em>qualities</em> of Light, having its Rays for their entire
and immediate subject, how can we think those Rays <em>qualities</em>
also, unless one quality may be the subject of and sustain another;
which in effect is to call it <em>substance</em>. We should not know
Bodies for substances, were it not for their sensible qualities, and
the Principal of those being now found due to something else, we have
as good reason to believe that to be a substance also. (Newton
1959–, vol. 1: 100)</p></blockquote> 

<p>
Newton seems to be arguing as follows here: since rays of light have
colors as basic features, we should regard these colors as qualities
or properties of the rays (despite the fact that these properties are
imperceptible under any ordinary circumstance); but doing so requires
us to think of the rays as bearers of qualities, which is to say, as
substances in their own right. And if rays of light are substances,
this means that we cannot also think of them as qualities or
properties of anything else. This last point follows from a widely
accepted notion of a substance at the time, one easily found in
 Descartes<sup>[<a href="notes.html#7" name="note-7">7</a>]</sup>,
viz., that substances are those items that can exist independently of
other items (whether they can exist independently even of God is a
further question that we can ignore here). And if we cannot think of
rays of light as properties or qualities, then they are not waves, for
waves are features of some medium—think of waves on the surface
of a lake. Newton concludes: light must be a stream of
particles. Clearly, philosophical argumentation is a significant
aspect of Newton's reasoning in this paper, as are various
philosophical concepts. It is intriguing to ponder the question, what
overall conception of “sensible qualities” does Newton
presuppose in this piece? If a ray of sunlight passes through my
window, the fact that it appears perfectly white to me does not
undermine Newton's view (or so he thinks) that the ray actually
contains a series of colors as its “qualities”. Are these
qualities “sensible” if their presence can be detected
only through the use of one or more prisms and never through the
inspection of the sunlight through ordinary means (unaided perception,
glasses, a magnifying glass, etc.)?  These are apt to strike us as
canonical philosophical problems.</p>

<p>
Newton's line of argument quoted above became one of the centerpieces
of the debate that his paper generated. In some parts of his paper,
when Newton wrote of the “rays” of light, he had evidently
intended to remain neutral on the question of whether the rays are
particles or waves (this is reminiscent of the ancient Greek practice
of avoiding physical discussions of visual rays). But then towards the
paper's end, Newton added his new line of argument, which employed
some philosophical analysis together with some experimental evidence
to support the conclusion that rays of light cannot be waves after
all. Newton's critics pounced. This led to the first problem he
encountered in response to his paper: what he calls his
“theory” of light and colors was not merely rejected, but
rather immediately misunderstood, at least from his own
perspective. Just days after Newton's paper was read at the Royal
Society, Robert Hooke responded with a detailed letter to
Oldenburg. In the first few sentences, Hooke indicates that from his
point of view, Newton's “Hypothesis of saving the phenomena of
colours” essentially involves the contention that rays of light
are particulate, rather than
 wavelike.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#8" name="note-8">8</a>]</sup> 
Hooke argues, in contrast, that light
“is nothing but a pulse or motion propagated through an
homogeneous, uniform and transparent medium;” that is, he argues
that light is indeed wavelike. He makes it perfectly clear, moreover,
that his hypothesis—the name did not carry a negative
connotation in his work—can save the phenomena of colors just as
well as Newton's, which is to say, his hypothesis is compatible with
the experimental evidence Newton gathers. Evidently, the line of
argument in the passage quoted above caught Hooke's eye. Among
philosophers, he was not alone. In a letter to Huygens explaining
Newton's theory of light, Leibniz writes that Newton takes light to be
a “body” propelled from the sun to the earth which,
according to Leibniz, Newton takes to explain both the differential
refrangibility of rays of light and the phenomena of 
colors.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#9" name="note-9">9</a>]</sup> 
Since Newton had
employed the concepts of substance, quality and sensible quality when
concluding in his paper that light is (presumably) particulate, we are
apt to regard the paper as contributing to important discussions
within philosophy. After the extensive correspondence, and
controversy, generated in response to Newton's early optical views and
experiments, he often threatened to avoid engaging in mathematical and
philosophical disputes altogether. He insisted to friends and
colleagues that he found intellectual controversy unbearable. But he
never followed through with his threat to disengage from discussions
in natural philosophy, and sent many important letters throughout his
long intellectual career.</p> 

<h2><a id="NewRelCar">3. Newton's relation to Cartesianism</a></h2> 

<p>
Like many philosophers who worked in the wake of Galileo and of
Descartes, it seems that Newton never extensively analyzed
Aristotelian ideas about nature. He would have encountered such ideas
in the curriculum at Trinity College, but there is not much evidence
that he took them seriously. Instead, he focused on the
“modern” thinkers that enterprising young students were
told to read outside of the standard 
curriculum.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#10" name="note-10">10</a>]</sup> 
And in England in
Newton's day, the greatest modern philosopher of nature was thought to
be Descartes (Heilbron 1982: 30). There is substantial evidence that
Newton took Descartes's ideas very seriously, and expended
considerable energy thinking them through and eventually coming to
criticize them. Much of that evidence comes from a manuscript that was
first transcribed and published in 1962 by the great historians of
science, Marie Boas Hall and Rupert Hall. The manuscript, which is now
known as “<em>De Gravitatione</em>”, after its first line,
has been the subject of extensive discussions over the past fifty
years because it indicates the depth of Newton's interest in Cartesian
ideas in metaphysics and natural philosophy.  Despite its importance
to contemporary understandings of Newton's relation to Cartesianism,
and much else besides, <em>De Gravitatione</em> is not without its
problems. First and foremost, the manuscript lacks a date, and there
is no scholarly consensus regarding that
 issue.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#11" name="note-11">11</a>]</sup>
 Second, the
manuscript was never finished, so it is difficult to assess its
relationship with Newton's mature thinking in philosophy.  Finally,
the manuscript was not published during Newton's lifetime, so there
are questions about whether it represents his considered
views. Despite these facts, the text contains a treasure trove of
argument concerning Cartesian ideas. It therefore helps to dispel the
easily formed impression that Newton sought, in the
<em>Principia</em>, to undermine a Leibnizian conception of space and
time, as his defender, Samuel Clarke, would attempt to do years later
in the correspondence of 1715–16 (discussed below). Although
Leibniz did eventually express what became the canonical early modern
formulation of “relationalism” concerning space and
time—the view, roughly, that space is nothing but the order of
relations among physical objects, and time nothing over and above the
succession of events involving those objects—and although Newton
and Clarke were highly skeptical of such a view, it is misleading to
read the <em>Principia</em> through the lens provided by the later
controversy with the Leibnizians. Newton's extensive attempt in <em>De
Gravitatione</em> to refute Descartes's conception of space and time in
particular indicates that the Scholium should be read as providing a
replacement for the Cartesian
 conception.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#12" name="note-12">12</a>]</sup>
 That is, Newton had a Cartesian, and not
a Leibnizian, opponent primarily in mind when he wrote his famous
articulation of “absolutism” concerning space and time.
Unlike questions about Newton's methods and his apparent deviation
from the norms established by mechanist philosophers like Descartes
and Boyle, Newton's conception of space and time, along with his view
of the divine being, did not immediately engender a philosophical
debate. It was Leibniz more than any other philosopher who eventually
succeeded in fomenting a philosophical debate in which the
“Newtonian” conception of space, time and the divine would
play a central role (see below). But Leibniz's philosophical views
were relatively unknown when Newton first formed his conception;
instead, it was Descartes's view of space, the world, and God, which
he pondered in his youth and eventually came to reject.</p>

<p>
Newton took special interest in the Cartesian view of space, and in
related views concerning the causal relations between minds and
bodies, and between God and the bodies that constitute the natural
world. Like many of Newton's contemporaries in Cambridge in those
days, he encountered these Cartesian views within the context of Henry
More's then famous discussions of Cartesianism (a term coined by More
himself). Beginning with his correspondence with Descartes in 1648
(Lewis 1953), and continuing with a series of publications in later
years, many of which Newton owned in his personal library (Harrison
1978), More argued that Descartes made two fundamental mistakes:
first, he wrongly contended that extension and matter are identical
(and that the world is therefore a plenum); and second, he mistakenly
believed that God and the mind were not extended substances, which
made their causal interactions with such substances mysterious. Just
as Princess Elisabeth of Bohemia raised fundamental objections to
Cartesian dualism, More raised similar objections against the
Cartesian view of the divine (see Shapiro 2007). Descartes agreed with
More's suggestion that God can act anywhere on nature if he so
chooses, and came very close to accepting More's contention that such
a view entails that God must be present within the world wherever he
in fact chooses to act. For how could God part the Red Sea, suggested
More, unless God were present precisely where the Red Sea is located?
Of course, More agreed that God is not made of parts, cannot be
imagined, and cannot be affected by the causal activity of material
bodies—the causal arrow flows only in one direction. But More
concluded that God is extended in his own way. If one fixes
Descartes's two basic mistakes, one obtains what More regarded as a
proper philosophical view: space is distinct from matter because it is
extended but penetrable, whereas matter is extended but impenetrable;
and, in tandem, all substances are extended, but whereas some, such as
tables and chairs, are impenetrable, others, such as the mind and even
God, are penetrable and therefore not
 material.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#13" name="note-13">13</a>]</sup> 
 Newton was deeply
influenced both by More's criticisms of Descartes and by his positive
philosophical conception of space and the divine.</p>

<p>
In a number of texts, including <em>De Gravitatione</em>, the famous
discussion of space and time in the Scholium to the
<em>Principia</em>, and the discussion of God in the General Scholium,
Newton made his generally Morean attitudes perfectly clear. He
rejected the Cartesian identification of extension and matter, arguing
that space itself exists independently of material objects (and their
relations), and he contended that all entities, including the human
mind and even the divine being, are extended in the sense that they
have spatial location, even if they are extended in ways that
distinguish them from ordinary material
 bodies.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#14" name="note-14">14</a>]</sup>
 In Newton's hands,
space becomes a fundamental concept of natural philosophy, an attitude
that is foreign to Cartesians and (later) objectionable to
Leibnizians. As Newton puts it in a famous passage from <em>De
Gravitatione</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Space is an affection of a being just as a being. No being exists or
can exist which is not related to space in some way. God is every
where, created minds are somewhere, and body is in the space that it
occupies; and whatever is neither everywhere nor anywhere does not
exist. And hence it follows that space is an emanative effect of the
first existing being, for if any being whatsoever is posited, space is
posited. (Newton 2004: 25)</p> </blockquote><p>

Space is a fundamental concept in part because Newton not only
conceives of it as independent of objects and their relations, but
because he argues that every entity must somehow connect with space in
some way. For Newton, then, if one follows the Cartesians and thinks
of the mind, or of God, as existing without any spatial
location—as existing either “beyond” the natural
world or somehow outside of it—then that is equivalent to
conceiving of them as non-existent. Newton does not shy away from
making this conception of the divine explicit in his public writings,
despite the fact that it was anathema to his Cartesian and Leibnizian
contemporaries. In the General Scholium to the <em>Principia</em>,
which was added to the second edition of the text in 1713, for
instance, he famously writes of God: </p> <blockquote><p> He endures
always and is present everywhere, and by existing always and
everywhere he constitutes duration and space. Since each and every
particle of space is <em>always</em>, and each and every indivisible
moment of duration is <em>everywhere</em>, certainly the maker and
lord of all things will not be <em>never</em> or <em>nowhere</em>
… God is one and the same God always and everywhere. He is
omnipresent not only <em>virtually</em> but also
<em>substantially</em>; for active power cannot subsist without
substance. (Newton 1999: 941)</p></blockquote> 

<p>
For Newton, just as bodies are present in some spatial location, God,
an infinite being, is present throughout all of space throughout all
of time. There could not be a clearer expression of agreement with
More in his debate with the Cartesians concerning the substantial
presence of the divine within space.</p>

<p>
Newton also took issue with Cartesian ideas about motion. His
rejection of Cartesian views of space, and his embrace of space as a
fundamental concept in philosophy following More's influence, aligns
with his famous discussion of space and time in the Scholium that
follows the opening definitions in the <em>Principia</em>. This text
influenced nearly every subsequent philosophical discussion of space
and time for the next three centuries, so its contours are well known
(see DiSalle 2006: ch. 2). In his <em>Principles of Philosophy</em> of
1644, Descartes had distinguished between the “ordinary”
and the “proper” view of motion: whereas the ordinary view
presents motion as a body's change of place, the philosopher knows
that properly speaking, motion is a body's change of relations to the
bodies that surround it (recall Descartes's plenum). Newton contends
in <em>De Gravitatione</em> that this idea of proper motion, according
to which the motion of a body is at least partially a function of its
relations to other bodies, is in tension with Descartes's own laws of
nature, also presented in the <em>Principles</em>. For according to
the conception of (what we now call) inertia that Descartes presents as his first two
laws, a body moving rectilinearly will continue to do so unless caused
to deviate from its path—hence a body's motion is not a function
of its spatial relations to other bodies, but rather of its
<em>causal</em> relations.  That is, according to the first two laws,
changing a body's spatial relations to others bodies will not alter
its rectilinear motion unless a causal interaction occurs. This
tension runs deep in the Cartesian system. Newton's Scholium reflects
his idea that the concept of motion in the <em>Principia</em> ought to
cohere with the laws of motion he endorses. He distinguishes between 
absolute and relative motion, true and apparent motion, and
mathematical and common motion (the same distinctions hold for time,
space and place), and the former item in each of these three pairings
is a concept that coheres with the laws of motion. Newton's first law
reflects Descartes's laws: it is a new version of the principle of
inertia, one incorporating the concept of an impressed force. Since
this law indicates that a body's motion is not a function of its
spatial relations to other bodies, but rather of whether forces are
impressed on it—which replaces the Cartesian concept of causal
interactions that involve only impact (see below)—Newton cannot
rely on a body's motion relative to other bodies if he is to avoid the
kind of tension he found in the Cartesian view. Hence he indicates
that a body's true motion—rather than its apparent motion, which
depends on our perceptions, or its relative motion, which depends on
its spatial relations—is a body's change of position within
space itself. That is, true motion should be understood as absolute
motion. This means, in turn, that we must distinguish between the
common idea of space, according to which space is conceived of as
involving relations among various objects (like the space of our air),
and the mathematical idea, one presumably obtained from geometry or
geometrical reasoning, that space is independent of any objects or
their relations. In order to account for the idea that true motion is
absolute motion, then, the famous “absolute space” is
postulated.</p>

<p>
Newton was perfectly well aware that the notion of absolute space is
not
 unproblematic.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#15" name="note-15">15</a>]</sup>
 For instance, if a body's true motion
just <em>is</em> its absolute motion, its motion with respect to space
itself, then the imperceptibility of space would appear to render any
detection of true motion difficult, if not hopeless. Indeed, how would
we detect any body's true motion on this view? We might be able to
detect a body's changing spatial relations with its neighbors, but not
its changing relationship with space itself! Newton's solution to this
problem is ingenious. Under certain circumstances, we can detect a
body's true motion by detecting its acceleration. We can do so when
the body is rotating or has a circular motion, for such motions often
have detectable effects. This is one way of understanding what has
become one of the most famous, if not infamous,
<em>gedankenexperimenten</em> of the early modern period, Newton's
bucket. If one takes an ordinary bucket and fills it with water, and
then attaches a rope to the top of the bucket, one can then twist the
rope and let it go in order to make the bucket spin.  When the bucket
full of water spins around, we can detect the water's acceleration by
its changing surface. As Newton puts it, using some concepts from his
laws of motion, the water endeavors to recede from the axis of its
motion (hence its changing surface). In this way, despite the fact
that Newton wishes to conceive of the water's true motion as its
absolute motion within space itself, which cannot be perceived, he
shows his readers how they might detect the water's true motion
through its effects. Newton provides another
<em>gedankenexperiment</em> to illustrate a similar point. If two
balls are joined together by a rope and then spun around, say over
one's head, then the changing tension in the rope will indicate that
the balls are accelerated. Since any acceleration is a true
motion—although not all true motions are accelerations, since a
so-called inertial motion is not—this case indicates that we can
detect a body's true motion even though space itself is
imperceptible. In this way, Newton did not merely develop an
alternative to the Cartesian view of motion, along with its allied
conception of space; he presented a view that could be employed to
pick out some of the true motions of objects within nature. Once one
has found a true motion, one can then ask what <em>caused</em> that
motion (for Newton, as we will see, it is forces that are understood
to cause motions). As the last line of the Scholium in the
<em>Principia</em> indicates, that is one reason that Newton wrote his
<em>magnum opus</em> in the first place.</p>

<p>
Newton's idea of space, then, fulfilled at least two roles.  First, it
enabled him to avoid the tension between the concept of true motion
and the laws of motion of the kind found in Descartes. Second, it also
enabled him to articulate what he took to be God's relation to the
natural world. Many regarded his achievements as an important advance
over the Cartesian system. However, it would be a mistake to think
that Newton vanquished Cartesian ideas within his lifetime: even in
England, and certainly on the Continent, Cartesianism remained a
powerful philosophical force for several decades after Newton
published his primary
 works.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#16" name="note-16">16</a>]</sup>
 Typically, however, Descartes's followers
emphasized the importance of his ideas about the mechanisms that
pervade nature rather than his views of space and time. In that arena,
Newton's views were especially prominent, and came in for significant
criticism from Leibniz.</p>

<h2><a id="MetIIPri">4. Methodology II: the <em>Principia</em></a></h2>
<p>

Many legends concerning momentous events in history are apocryphal,
but the legend of Halley's visit to Newton in 1684 is true, and
explains what prompted Newton to write his <em>magnum opus</em>. In
August of 1684, Edmond Halley—for whom the comet is
named—came to visit Newton in Cambridge in order to discover his
opinion about a subject of much dispute in celestial mechanics. At
this time, many in the Royal Society and elsewhere were at work on a
cluster of problems that might be described as follows: how can one
take Kepler's Laws, which were then considered among the very best
descriptions of the planetary orbits, and understand them in the
context of dynamical or causal principles? What kind of cause would
lead to planetary orbits of the kind described by Kepler? In
particular, Halley asked Newton the following question: what kind of
curve would a planet describe in its orbit around the Sun if it were
acted upon by an attractive force that was inversely proportional to
the square of its distance from the Sun? Newton immediately replied
that the curve would be an ellipse (rather than, say, a
circle).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#17" name="note-17">17</a>]</sup>
Halley was amazed that Newton had the answer at the ready. But Newton
also said that he had mislaid the paper on which the relevant
calculations had been made, so Halley left empty handed (whether there
was any such paper is a subject of dispute). But he would not be
disappointed for long. In November of that year, Newton sent Halley a
nine-page paper, entitled <em>De Motu</em> (on motion), that presented
the sought-after demonstration, along with several other advances in
celestial mechanics. Halley was delighted, and immediately returned to
Cambridge for further discussion. It was these events that
precipitated the many drafts of <em>De Motu</em> that eventually
became <em>Principia mathematica</em> by 1686. Several aspects of the
<em>Principia</em> have been central to philosophical discussions
since its first publication, including Newton's novel methodology in
the book, his conception of space and time, and his attitude toward
the dominant orientation within natural philosophy in his day, the
so-called mechanical philosophy, which had important methodological
consequences.</p>

<p>
When Newton wrote the <em>Principia</em> between 1684 and 1686, he was
not contributing to a preexisting field of study called mathematical
physics; he was attempting to show how philosophers could employ
various mathematical and experimental methods in order to reach
conclusions about nature, especially about the motions of material
bodies. In his lectures presented as the Lucasian Professor at
Cambridge, Newton had been arguing since at least 1670 that natural
philosophers had to employ geometrical methods in order to understand
various phenomena in 
 nature.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#18" name="note-18">18</a>]</sup>
 The <em>Principia</em> represented his
attempt to reorient natural philosophy, taking it in a direction that
neither his Aristotelian predecessors, nor his Cartesian
contemporaries, had envisioned. He did not immediately convince many
of them of the benefits of his approach.  Just as his first
publication in optics in 1672 sparked an intense debate about the
proper methods for investigating the nature of light—and much
else besides—his <em>Principia</em> sparked an even longer
lasting discussion about the methodology that philosophers should
adopt when studying the natural world. This discussion began
immediately with the publication of the <em>Principia</em>, despite
the fact that its first edition contained few explicit methodological
remarks (Smith 2002: 138–39) and it intensified considerably
with the publication of its second edition in 1713, which contained
many more remarks about methodology, including many attempts at
defending the Newtonian method. Indeed, many of Newton's alterations
in that edition changed the presentation of his methods. Discussions
of methodology would eventually involve nearly all of the leading
philosophers in England and on the Continent during Newton's
lifetime.</p>

<p>
In Cartesian natural philosophy, all natural change is due to the
impacts that material bodies make upon one another's surfaces (this is
reflected in Descartes's first two laws of nature). The concept of a
force plays little if any role. Unlike Descartes, Newton placed the
concept of a force at the very center of his thinking about motion and
its causes within nature. In that regard, his reactions to the
shortcomings of Cartesian natural philosophy parallel Leibniz's, who
coined the term “dynamics”, and who obviously regarded
force as a fundamental concept in metaphysics as well (Westfall
1971). But Newton's attitude toward understanding the forces of nature
involved an especially intricate method that generated intense
scrutiny and debate amongst many philosophers and mathematicians,
including Leibniz (Garber 2012). Newton's canonical notion of a force,
which he calls a <em>vis impressa</em> or “impressed
force”, is the notion of an “action exerted on a
body” that changes its state of motion. This was a confusing
notion at the time. Perhaps it is not difficult to see why that should
be so. To take one of Newton's own examples: suppose I hit a tennis
ball with my racquet—according to Newton, I have impressed a
force on the tennis ball, for I have changed its state of motion
(hopefully!). We have a reasonably good idea of what the tennis ball
is, of what the racquet is, and even of what I am, and a Cartesian
might wish to stop her analysis there. But what exactly is this
“force” that I impressed on the tennis ball? The ball, the
racquet and I are physical things of one sort or another, but is the
force physical? Is it not physical? It does not seem likely that a
force is itself a physical thing in the sense of being a substance, to
use a philosophical notion popular in Newton's day (as we saw above in
his first optics paper). The reason is that in Definition Four in the
<em>Principia</em>, which defines an impressed force for the first
time, Newton remarks: “This force consists solely in the action
and does not remain in a body after the action has ceased”. So
when I hit the tennis ball over the net, the force I impressed on it
was the action of hitting the ball, or an action associated with
hitting the ball, and not a property of me or of the ball after the
action had ceased. This idea confused many of Newton's readers.  By
the mid-eighteenth century, the time of Hume's analysis of causation
in the <em>Treatise</em> and the <em>Enquiry</em>, many philosophers
started to think that actions and other kinds of event are important
items to have in one's ontology, and they often contended in
particular that causal relations hold between <em>events</em>. But in
Newton's day, philosophers typically regarded objects or substances as
the causal relata (one finds an equivocation between thinking of
events and thinking of objects as the relevant causal relata even in
Hume). So actions were difficult to analyze or often left out of
analyses. As a result, Newton's conception of force proved
confusing. Moreover, it was unclear to many of Newton's mechanist
readers how his forces fit into their rather austere ontological view
that material bodies consist solely of properties such as size, shape,
mobility and solidity.</p>

<p>
Newton did try to clarify his method of characterizing forces. If one
brackets the question of how to understand forces as ephemeral actions
that do not persist after causal interactions have ceased, one can
make progress by conceiving of forces as <em>quantities</em>. In
particular, since Newton's eight definitions and three laws indicate
that forces are proportional to mass and to acceleration, and since
mass—or the quantity of matter, a concept Newton transformed
from its Cartesian origins, where it was understood as a measure of a
body's volume—and acceleration are both quantities that can be
measured, Newton gives us a means of measuring forces. This is crucial
to his method. If one thinks of forces as measurable quantities,
moreover, then one can attempt to identify two seemingly disparate
forces as in fact the same force through thinking about measuring
them. For instance, in Book III of the <em>Principia</em>, Newton
famously argues in proposition five and its scholium that the
centripetal force maintaining the planetary orbits is in fact the same
as the force of gravity, viz., the force that causes the free fall of
objects on earth. This was a revolutionary idea at the time, one
rendered possible in the first place by Newton's way of thinking about
forces as quantities. This idea then led Newton to the even more
revolutionary view in proposition seven of Book III that all bodies
gravitate toward one another in proportion to their quantity of
matter. That is, it led him to the idea of universal gravity, a view
that shocked many of his Continental readers in its boldness. This
helped to unify what were once called superlunary and sublunary
phenomena, a unification that was obviously crucial for later research
in physics. Again, the idea was enabled by Newton's abstract way of
understanding forces—without conceiving of a force as involving
any specific mechanism or type of physical interaction, Newton thought
of forces as quantities that are proportional to other features of
nature.</p>

<p>
Despite his evident success in obtaining what we now call the law of
universal gravitation, Newton admits that he lacks another kind of
knowledge about gravity; this lack of knowledge directly reflects an
aspect of his abstract characterization of forces. In the General
Scholium, he reminds his readers that gravity is proportional to a
body's quantity of matter (its mass) and reaches across vast distances
within our solar system, adding: “I have not as yet been able to
deduce from phenomena the reason for these properties of gravity, and
I do not feign
 hypotheses”.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#19" name="note-19">19</a>]</sup>
 With this phrase, one of the most famous
in all of Newton's writings, he returned to a key theme of his very
first optical paper from forty years earlier, viz. the proper role of
hypotheses and of hypothetical reasoning within natural
 philosophy.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#20" name="note-20">20</a>]</sup>
Some of Newton's interpreters have regarded this phrase as signaling a
strong commitment to the broad doctrine that all hypotheses concerning
natural phenomena ought to be avoided in principle. This
interpretation is sometimes coupled with the view that some British
philosophers in the late seventeenth century regarded Cartesianism as
overly reliant on hypotheses in reaching conclusions about
phenomena. But this interpretation may be hard to square with Newton's
texts. For instance, in the Scholium to Proposition 96 of Book I of
the <em>Principia</em>, Newton discusses hypotheses concerning light
rays.  Similarly, in query 21 of the <em>Opticks</em>, he proposes
that there might be an aether whose differential density accounts for
the gravitational force acting between bodies. In light of such
examples, one can read the General Scholium's pronouncement in this
way: a philosopher concerned with explaining some feature of
nature—such as the fact that gravity is inversely proportional
to the <em>square</em> of spatial separation, rather than, say, the
<em>cube</em>—may legitimately entertain and propose hypotheses
for consideration, but she may not “feign” the hypothesis
in the sense of taking it as having been established either through
experiment, observation, or some form of reasoning (including
mathematical reasoning). Hence Newton thinks that he has established
the fact that gravity acts on all material bodies in proportion to
their quantity of matter, but he has <em>not</em> established the
existence of the aether. By the time of the General Scholium, Newton
was increasingly embroiled in philosophical disputes with Leibniz. In
order to account for the motions of the planetary bodies in his
<em>Tentamen</em> of 1690, Leibniz introduces <em>ex hypothesi</em>
the premise that some kind of fluid surrounds, and is contiguous to,
the various planetary bodies, and then argues that this fluid must be
in motion to account for their
 orbits.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#21" name="note-21">21</a>]</sup>
 Newton may have argued that Leibniz had
“feigned” the hypothesis of the vortices. A debate between
the two philosophers on this score would bring them to the question of
the mechanical philosophy: whereas Newton would object to Leibniz's
reasoning on methodological grounds, Leibniz would reply that Newton's
theory of gravity involves action at a distance, which his vortex
hypothesis avoids (see below for more details).</p>

<p>
Once the <em>Principia</em> was published, Newton had a vexed
relationship with the mechanical philosophy, an orientation within
natural philosophy that is associated strongly with nearly every
significant early modern philosopher, including Descartes, Boyle,
Huygens, Leibniz, and
 Locke.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#22" name="note-22">22</a>]</sup>
 One of the reasons for this complex
relationship can be understood if we consider Newton's attitude toward
forces in an abstract way.  His second law indicates that a body
moving rectilinearly will continue to do so unless a force is
impressed on it. This is not equivalent to claiming that a body moving
rectilinearly will continue to do so unless another body impacts upon
it. A <em>vis impressa</em>—an impressed force—in Newton's
system is not the same as a body, nor even a quality of a body, as we
have seen; but what is more, some impressed forces need not involve
contact between bodies at all.  For instance, gravity is a kind of
centripetal force, and the latter, in turn, is a species of impressed
force. Hence a body moving in a straight line will continue to do so
until it experiences a gravitational pull, in which case it will
deviate from a straight line motion, even if no body impacts upon
it. Indeed, the gravitational pull might originate with a mass that is
millions of miles away. As we have seen, an impressed force is an
action exerted on a body. Hence the gravity exerted on a moving body
is an action (the Latin term is <em>actio</em>), which is obviously a
causal notion. This is not an empirical claim <em>per se</em>; it is
merely a reflection of Newton's laws, together with his notion of an
impressed force, and his further idea that gravity is one kind of
impressed force. These elements of the <em>Principia</em> make
conceptual room for a causal interaction between two bodies separated
by a vast distance, one enabled by Newton's concept of an impressed
force. Aspects of this idea became known in philosophical circles as
the problem of action at a distance (Hesse 1961). Many of Newton's
most influential contemporaries objected vigorously to the fact that
his philosophy had made room for—if not explicitly
defended—the possibility of distant action between material
bodies. Leibniz and Huygens in particular rejected this aspect of
Newton's work in the strongest terms, and it remained a point of
contention between Newton and Leibniz for the rest of their
lives. Both Leibniz and Huygens were convinced that all natural change
occurs through contact action, and that any deviation from this basic
mechanist principle within natural philosophy would lead to serious
difficulties, including the revival of outmoded Aristotelian ideas. By
the seventh proposition of Book III of the <em>Principia</em>, as we
have seen, Newton reached the following conclusion (1999: 810):
“Gravity acts on all bodies universally and is proportional to
the quantity of matter in each”. Leibniz eventually accused
Newton of regarding gravity as a kind of “occult quality”,
that is, as a quality of bodies that is somehow hidden within them and
beyond the philosopher's understanding. Newton's gloss on Rule 3 in
the <em>Principia</em>, discussed below, only made matters worse from
Leibniz's point of view, since it tacitly (or functionally) treats
gravity as a kind of universal quality akin to extension or
impenetrability. But unlike them, it was occult, imperceptible and
unintelligible.</p>

<p>
Newton was well aware that the <em>Principia's</em> methodology of
discovering the forces present in nature was controversial, and not
merely because of questions about action at a distance. So when he
revised the text, under the editorship of Roger Cotes, for publication
in a second edition in 1713, he added other methodological
remarks. These remarks included what Newton called “<em>regulae
philosophandi</em>”, or rules of philosophy, which became the
focal point of vigorous discussion and debate well into the eighteenth
century. The first two rules concern causal reasoning, but it is the
third rule that generated the most debate, for it involved both an
aspect of Newton's controversial argument for universal gravity and
also a rare public statement by Newton of what he regarded as the
“foundation” of natural philosophy. The third rule
concerns an induction problem: we have perceptions and experiments
that provide us with knowledge of the objects and natural phenomena in
our neck of the universe, but on what basis can we reach a conclusion
concerning objects and phenomena throughout the <em>rest</em> of the
universe? Newton himself reached such a conclusion about gravity in
proposition seven of Book III of the <em>Principia</em>. Part of
Newton's answer is presented in rule 3:</p>

<blockquote><p> Those qualities of bodies that cannot be intended and
remitted [i.e., increased and diminished] and that belong to all
bodies on which experiments can be made should be taken as qualities
of all bodies universally.</p></blockquote>

<p>
We know, say, that a clump of dirt has certain qualities such as
extension and mobility, but how do we know that the entire earth has
such qualities? It surely lies beyond the reach of our experiments, or
at any rate, it did in Newton's day. Newton says that the sun and the
earth interact according to his law of gravity, but how do we know
that the sun contains a quantity of matter, that it is a material body
with the same basic qualities that characterize the earth or the moon?
It wasn't at all obvious at the time that the sun is a material body
at all. Newton thinks that gravity reaches into the very center of the
sun, but what did anyone in 1713 know about such things? Newton
glosses his third rule in part as follows, connecting it with his laws
of motion:</p> 

<blockquote><p> That all bodies are movable and persevere in motion or
in rest by means of certain forces (which we call forces of inertia)
we infer from finding these properties in the bodies that we have
seen. The extension, hardness, impenetrability, mobility, and force of
inertia<sup>[<a href="notes.html#23" name="note-23">23</a>]</sup> of
the whole arise from the extension, hardness, impenetrability,
mobility and force of inertia of each of the parts; and thus we
conclude that every one of the least parts of all bodies is extended,
hard, impenetrable, movable, and endowed with a force of inertia. And
this is the foundation of all natural philosophy. (Newton 1999:
795–96)</p></blockquote>

 

<p>
Many of Newton's readers in 1713 would have granted him the following
inference: although we do not have any perceptions of, say, the
interior of the earth, or even of many ordinary objects within our
grasp, we can reasonably infer that everything with certain basic
properties—something akin to what John Locke, borrowing a term
of Robert Boyle's, called the “primary qualities”—at
the macroscopic level is comprised of micro-particles that are
characterized by those same basic properties.  But at the end of his
gloss of Rule 3, Newton applies this same (or analogous) reasoning to
the force of gravity, arguing as follows: since we experience the fact
that all bodies on or near the earth gravitate toward the
earth—in cases such as free fall—and that the moon
gravitates toward the earth, etc., we can infer that all bodies
everywhere gravitate toward all other bodies. This argument would
appear to suggest that gravity—which, as we have seen, is a kind
of impressed force, an action—is somehow akin to qualities like
extension and impenetrability. So is Newton suggesting that gravity is
actually a <em>quality</em> of all bodies? Leibniz and his followers
pounced: if Newton is, at least tacitly, regarding gravity as a
quality, then he had indeed revived the occult qualities of the
Scholastics, for here we have a quality that is not explicable in
mechanical terms, and what is worse, one that is not intelligible to
philosophers. This question became the subject of intense debate
throughout the first half of the eighteenth century (see the last
section below).</p>

<h2><a id="AftPriIRelJohLocRicBen">5. The aftermath of the <em>Principia</em> I: relations with John Locke and Richard Bentley</a></h2>

<p>

Although the first editions of Newton's <em>Principia</em> and of
Locke's <em>Essay</em> were published a mere three years apart (in
1687 and 1690, respectively) their authors worked independently and
did not influence the first editions of one another's principal
texts. But right around the time of the publication of the first
edition of the <em>Essay</em>, Newton and Locke became close friends
and apparently influenced each other's thinking about philosophy,
religion, and theology in various ways (they first met in London in
1689). For his part, Locke called him the “incomparable Mr.
Newton” on several occasions (e.g., in correspondence: Locke
1823: vol. 4: 55; and the next long quotation below). Most historians
think that each questioned the standard Anglican interpretation of the
Trinity, contending that Jesus of Nazareth was not a divine figure on
the same level as God the creator. Interpreting the Bible through
historical and philosophical analysis in a fashion that was not
constrained by standard Anglican doctrine in the late seventeenth
century was fantastically important to Newton, occupying his attention
for many years. Given their controversial and politically sensitive
nature, his so-called anti-Trinitarian views were largely kept secret
among a small circle of friends. However, Newton trusted Locke enough
to send him a very long letter—entitled “Two Notable
Corruptions of Scripture”—to present him with the evidence
for Newton's view that the original version of Christianity was
corrupted beginning in the 4<sup>th</sup> century by the introduction
of the doctrine of the Trinity (Newton 1959–, vol. 3:
83–129).  Locke was apparently sympathetic with Newton's
approach. With respect to their public views, Newton and Locke were
often taken to represent two aspects of the same
experimental-philosophical approach toward the close of the
seventeenth century (Stein 1990; Wilson 1999: 196–214; and
Domski forthcoming). It is perhaps not difficult to understand why,
for Newton was mentioned in one of the most famous passages in all of
Locke's writings. In the Epistle to the reader of Locke's <em>Essay
Concerning Human Understanding</em>, we read:</p>

<blockquote>
<p> The Commonwealth of Learning, is not at this time without
Master-Builders, whose mighty designs, in advancing the sciences, will
leave lasting monuments to the admiration of posterity; but every one
must not hope to be a Boyle, or a Sydenham; and in an age that
produces such masters, as the great—Huygenius, and the
incomparable Mr.  Newton, with some other of that strain; 'tis
ambition enough to be employed as an under-labourer in clearing ground
a little, and removing some of the rubbish, that lies in the way to
knowledge; which certainly had been very much more advanced in the
world, if the endeavors of ingenious and industrious men had not been
much cumbred with the learned but frivolous use of uncouth, affected,
or unintelligible terms, introduced into the sciences, and there made
an art of, to that degree, that philosophy, which is nothing but the
true knowledge of things, was thought unfit, or uncapable to be
brought into well-bred company, and polite conversation. (Locke 1975:
10)</p></blockquote>

<p>

Clearly, Locke seeks in this passage, among other things, to align his
work in the <em>Essay</em> with the work of figures such as Newton.
Here we find, at the opening of Locke's magnum opus, the suggestion
that he is content to be an “under-labourer”, a thinker
who helps to clear the way for the advance of knowledge. But his list
of four “master builders”—Boyle, Sydenham, Huygens,
and Newton—might strike us as an odd pairing: what do these four
have in common exactly? It has recently been argued that Locke
regarded the four as representing the new “experimental
philosophy”, and that Locke himself should be interpreted as
strongly supporting that orientation within natural philosophy more
generally (Anstey 2011: 220). This would become a popular conception
of Newton's philosophical approach.</p>

<p>

Locke may have regarded Newton as a fellow enthusiast for the
experimental philosophy, but there are reasons to think that his
embrace of the mechanical philosophy presented him with a difficulty
in interpreting the consequences of Newton's theory of universal
gravity in the <em>Principia</em>. For Newton's theory seemed to be in
tension with a mechanist constraint on views of causation, at least
from Locke's own point of view. In the first edition of the
<em>Essay</em>, Locke articulated a central tenet of mechanist
thinking about causation when he wrote: “bodies operate by
impulse and nothing else” (<em>Essay</em>, II.viii.11). Impulse
refers here to contact action. In correspondence with Locke that would
prove to be influential, Bishop Edward Stillingfleet questioned this
view from the <em>Essay</em>, contending that Locke must jettison the
idea of human liberty if he insists that bodies can operate solely by
impulse, presumably on the grounds that the human will cannot be
understood to cause bodily action in that manner. In a famous
exchange, Locke responded in part by reformulating his commitment to
the mechanist view that all causation involving material bodies must
be by contact (impulse) alone:</p>

<blockquote>
<p> It is true, I say, that ‘bodies operate by impulse and
nothing else’. And so I thought when I writ it, and can yet
conceive no other way of their operation. But I am since convinced by
the judicious Mr. Newton's incomparable book, that it is too bold a
presumption to limit God's power, in this point, by my narrow
conceptions.  The gravitation of matter toward matter by ways
inconceivable to me, is not only a demonstration that God can, if he
pleases, put into bodies, powers and ways of operations, above what
can be derived from our idea of body, or can be explained by what we
know of matter, but also an unquestionable and every where visible
instance, that he has done so.  And therefore in the next edition of
my book, I shall take care to have that passage rectified. (Locke
1823: vol. 4: 467–8).</p></blockquote>

<p>

This was not merely his privately held view. For instance, near the
beginning of his <em>Elements of Natural Philosophy</em>, Locke
writes:</p>

<blockquote><p> Two bodies at a distance will put one another into
motion by the force of attraction; which is inexplicable by us, though
made evident to us by experience, and so to be taken as a principle in
natural philosophy. (Locke 1823: vol. 3: 305)</p></blockquote>

<p>
In this way, Locke held the common view that Newton's theory of
universal gravity was incompatible with the mechanical
philosophy—and perhaps, unintelligible to us for that very
reason—and when forced to choose between these two options, he
evidently sided with Newton, thinking that his theory was supported by
“experience”. He did so by endorsing the view that God
must have added “powers” or “ways of
operations” to material bodies that cannot be derived from our
idea of body. Such powers or ways of operations would in this case
result in gravitational interactions, presumably amongst bodies that
are spatially separated from one another by great distances. Yet from
Locke's point of view, the fact that Newton's theory convinces him
that such powers exist does <em>not</em> entail that that theory
renders gravity “conceivable”: even if the theory of
universal gravity is correct, it does not allow us to understand how
matter—what Locke would call “extended solid
substance”—can interact gravitationally with other matter
when the bits of matter are not in contact with one another (Downing
1997). So Locke has concluded that bodies can operate on one another
through some means other than impulse, but he retains his firmly held
belief that any such operation is not intelligible to us. Locke did
apparently accept the conclusion that spatially separated bodies
causally interact with one another in accordance with the law of
universal gravitation, but concluded that the law itself did not
render that causal interaction intelligible.  This is precisely the
kind of reaction to Newton's theory of universal gravity bemoaned by
Leibniz, who would argue that any operations or powers attributed to
material bodies must meet the basic criterion of intelligibility
established by the mechanist approach; he might also be inclined to
argue that any laws regarded as governing the interactions of bodies
must also meet that criterion by being derivable in some way from our
basic concept of matter (see below). Regardless, this is an excellent
example of a case in which Newton's theory in the <em>Principia</em>
had a direct impact on the development of philosophical views of
causation in the late seventeenth century.</p>

<p>
When the great English natural philosopher Robert Boyle died at the
end of 1691, he endowed a lecture series designed to promote
Christianity against what Boyle took to be the atheism that had
infected English culture after the revolutionary period of the
mid-century. Famous Newtonians such as Samuel Clarke and William
Whiston would eventually give the Boyle lectures. The first
“Boyle lecturer” was the theologian Richard Bentley, who
would eventually become the Master of Newton's <em>alma mater</em>,
Trinity College, Cambridge, and who also worked under Locke's
correspondent, Bishop Stillingfleet, himself an admirer of Newton's
(Gascoigne 1985: 65). When preparing his lectures for
publication—they had been presented to a public audience in
London in 1692—Bentley conferred with Newton, hoping to solicit
his help in deciphering enough of the <em>Principia</em> to use its
results as a bulwark against atheism (Bentley 1976). Newton obliged,
and a famous correspondence between the two began (eventually
published as Bentley 1756). The exchange is of great philosophical
interest, for Bentley elicited a number of important clarifications
that have no peer within Newton's published <em>oeuvre</em>.</p>

<p>
Bentley sought Newton's assistance in particular because he wanted
guidance in divining how the theory of the <em>Principia</em>
indicates that the solar system must have been designed by an
intelligent agent and could not have arisen through the physical
interactions of material bodies. In the first edition of the
<em>Principia</em> in 1687, Newton had made such a claim in a very
brief statement (Newton 1972: vol. 2: 582–3; Cohen 1971:
154–6). In the second edition of the text (published in 1713),
he removed that statement, replacing it with a more extensive
discussion in the new section of the text, added to its end, called
the “General Scholium” (mentioned above). Through their
correspondence, Bentley learned that from Newton's point of view, the
positions of the planets relative to one another—and especially
to the sun—indicate that mere chance, or the ordinary physical
interactions of the planetary bodies, could not have placed each
planet in precisely the right orbit to maintain a solar system like
ours for an extended period of time. With this argument, Newton seems
to be indicating that mere chance would have produced an unstable
planetary system, one in which the planets would eventually either be
too strongly attracted to the sun, falling into it, or be too weakly
attracted, flying off into space. In this episode, a theologian
appeals to the new authority of Newtonian natural philosophy when
attempting to undermine atheism. And that was apparently the very kind
of interchange that Boyle had envisioned when endowing the lecture
series.</p>

<p>
Newton's correspondence with Bentley is justly famous for another
reason. The criticisms of Newton's theory of gravity by Leibniz and
Huygens, outlined briefly above, would prove essential to the
Continental reception of Newtonian natural philosophy more generally
in the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries. Since Newton
held both of these mathematicians in high regard—he tells
Leibniz in a 1693 letter that “Huygens is a master, and his
remarks on my discoveries are brilliant” (Newton 2004:
108)—one might assume that their criticisms would have pressed
Newton into articulating an extensive defense of the possibility of
action at a distance. Newton presented no such defense; moreover,
there is actually evidence that Newton himself rejected the
possibility of action at a distance, despite the fact that the
<em>Principia</em> allows it as a conceptual possibility, if not an
empirical reality. The evidence lies in Newton's correspondence with
Bentley. In February of 1693, after receiving three letters from
Newton, Bentley wrote an extensive reply that attempted to
characterize Newton's theory of gravity, and his understanding of the
nature of matter, in a way that could be used to undermine various
kinds of atheism. With the three earlier letters as his guide, Bentley
makes the following estimation of Newton's understanding of the
possibility that gravity could somehow be an essential feature of
material bodies: </p> 

<blockquote><p> (2) And as for Gravitation, tis
impossible that That should either be coæternal &amp; essential to
Matter, or ever acquired by it.  Not essential and coæternal to
Matter; for then even our System would have been eternal (if gravity
could form it) against our Atheist's supposition &amp; what we have
proved in our Last. For let them assign any given time, that Matter
convened from a Chaos into our System, they must affirm that before
the given time matter gravitated eternally without convening, which is
absurd. {Sir, I make account, that your courteous suggestion by your
Last, that a Chaos is inconsistent with the Hypothesis of innate
Gravity, is included in this paragraph of Mine.} and again, tis
unconceivable, that inanimate brute matter should (without a divine
impression) operate upon &amp; affect other matter without mutual
contact: as it must, if gravitation be essential and inherent in
it. (Newton 1959–vol. 3: 249)</p></blockquote> 

<p>
In reply to this letter, Newton refers back to this second
proposition, making one of the most famous of all his pronouncements
concerning the possibility of action at a distance:</p>

<blockquote><p> The last clause of the second position I like very
well. It is inconceivable that inanimate brute matter should, without
the mediation of something else which is not material, operate upon
and affect other matter without mutual contact, as it must be, if
gravitation in the sense of Epicurus, be essential and inherent in it.
And this is one reason why I desired you would not ascribe innate
gravity to me. That gravity should be innate, inherent, and essential
to matter, so that one body may act upon another at a distance through
a vacuum, without the mediation of anything else, by and through which
their action and force may be conveyed from one to another, is to me
so great an absurdity that I believe no man who has in philosophical
matters a competent faculty of thinking can ever fall into it. Gravity
must be caused by an agent acting constantly according to certain
laws; but whether this agent be material or immaterial, I have left
open to the consideration of my readers. (Newton 2004:
102–3)<sup>[<a href="notes.html#24" name="note-24">24</a>]</sup></p></blockquote> 

<p>
It certainly seems that Newton was uncomfortable with the very idea of
action at a distance. But of course, things are not always as they
seem in interpretations of difficult philosophical texts: some
historians and philosophers have argued strongly that there are other
readings of the
 letter.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#25" name="note-25">25</a>]</sup>
 Rather than rejecting distant action
between material bodies <em>per se</em>, they argue, Newton may have
been rejecting a particular version of that idea, one associated with
the “Epicurean” idea that gravity is somehow an essential
feature of all material bodies, a stronger view than Newton might wish
to endorse. The idea might be roughly as follows: Newton wanted to
leave open the possibility that God had endowed bodies with a power to
act at a distance on one another, a position that is at least
reminiscent of Locke's view in his correspondence with Stillingfleet
(see above). The reason is that Newton held the standard view at the
time that matter itself is passive, requiring some kind of divine
intervention in order to interact causally with other matter. Again,
one finds a Lockean echo of this idea (which may be no accident):
Locke sometimes suggests that matter itself is passive in the sense
that it cannot move itself; instead, motion must be
“superadded” to it by God. If the world consisted solely
of a bunch of material objects, say rocks floating in interstellar
space, then they would not experience any changes in their states of
motion unless some external force acted upon them—if left to its
own devices, matter is passive and does not move. To argue, as some
“Epicurean” philosophers may have done, that matter itself
essentially contains gravity as a feature, is to deny that matter is
passive; it is to suggest that the rocks in interstellar space would
attract one another and begin to move “on their own”,
without any external force influencing them. And this, in turn, might
lead us on a slippery slope to atheism, for on this view, matter would
act on its own, without any divine intervention. Or so Bentley and
Newton might be interpreted.</p>

<p>
Clearly, one reasonable motive for uncovering a nuanced interpretation
of Newton's letter to Bentley is the obvious fact that Newton
apparently regarded action at a distance as perfectly possible when
writing the <em>Principia</em>. Indeed, it is difficult to reconcile
the <em>Principia</em> with the Bentley correspondence.  One can argue
that although he left open the possibility of action at a distance in
his main work, Newton himself did not accept that possibility because
of his more general commitments (Janiak 2008 and forthcoming). The
debate on such matters continues unabated. However, regardless of
Newton's personal attitude toward distant action among material
bodies, his mechanist interlocutors and readers continued to object to
the physical theory outlined in Book III of the <em>Principia</em> on
the grounds that, at the very least, it left open the conceptual
possibility of a kind of action that cannot in fact exist anywhere in
nature. That remained one of Leibniz's principal objections against
Newtonian natural philosophy throughout the last twenty years of his
life, animating his correspondence with numerous figures, including
most prominently the Newtonian theologian and philosopher Samuel
Clarke.</p>

<h2><a id="AftPriIIDebLei">6. The aftermath of the <em>Principia</em> II: debates with Leibniz</a></h2>

<p>

In many ways, Leibniz and Newton grew up in the same philosophical
environment: each came of age during the heyday of Cartesianism, and
each argued in particular that Cartesian views in natural philosophy
failed to include a sufficiently robust conception of the forces of
bodies in nature. Force would lie at the center of Newton's mature
physics (Westfall 1971), and would become even more central to
Leibniz's thinking, playing an essential role in his metaphysics as
well (Garber 2012). The two knew one another as mathematicians already
in the 1670s, and as we have seen, Leibniz discussed Newton's first
optical work with Huygens; but after the publication of the
<em>Principia</em> in 1687, their philosophical relationship, which
was marked originally by respectful disagreement, began to develop in
earnest. Just two years after the <em>Principia</em> appeared, Leibniz
published his <em>Essay on the Causes of Celestial Motions</em> (or
<em>Tentamen</em>), and then in 1693, the two corresponded with one
another on both mathematical and philosophical issues (Newton 2004:
106–9). Leibniz initiated their discussion in March of 1693:
after highlighting Newton's “astonishing discovery” that
the elliptical planetary orbits found by Kepler can be the result of
gravitational attraction within the solar system, Leibniz contends
that these motions must be caused by “the motion of a fluid
medium” (Newton 2004: 106). He had described such a fluid
medium, or vortex, in detail in his own <em>Essay</em>. The background
to Leibniz's comment is his unwavering commitment—one shared by
Huygens, whose theory of gravity's cause Leibniz mentions in the same
letter—to the mechanical philosophy's requirement that all
changes in motion must be the result of bits of matter impacting on
one another. Thus for Leibniz, one can (e.g.) think of the sun as
attracting the earth, but in fact the cause of the earth's
acceleration, of its true motion around the sun, is its interaction
with a fluid medium (Descartes was also a famous proponent of a vortex
theory of planetary motion—Aiton 1972: 30–64; Gaukroger
2002: 150–3). When he replied in October of 1693, however,
Newton did not accept Leibniz's philosophical olive
branch—Leibniz had insisted that the vortex theory of planetary
motion “would not at all detract from the value and truth of
your discovery” that Kepler's ellipses result simply from the
conception of attraction or gravitation (Newton 2004: 107)—on
the grounds that vortices would disturb the motions of planets and
comets through the solar system. Newton writes that some “very
fine” matter fills the heavens, adding:</p>

<blockquote> <p> For
since celestial motions are more regular than if they arose from
vortices and observe other laws, so much so that vortices contribute
not to the regulation but the disturbance of the motions of planets
and comets; and since all phenomena of the heavens and of the sea
follow precisely, so far as I am aware, from nothing but gravity acting
in accordance with the laws described by me; and since nature is very
simple, I have myself concluded that all other causes are to be
rejected and that the heavens are to be stripped as far as may be of
all matter, lest the motions of planets and comets be hindered or
rendered irregular. But if, meanwhile, someone explains gravity along
with all its laws by the action of some subtle matter, and shows that
the motion of planets and comets will not be disturbed by this matter,
I shall be far from objecting. (Newton 2004:
108–9)</p></blockquote> 

<p>

This is obviously a passage rich with significant meaning. Leibniz
clearly insisted that vortices, or some physical object or fluid, must
be in contact with the planetary orbits if we are to explain why they
deviate from the tangents along the orbital paths when circling the
sun. Newton's reply is that giant swirling fluids in the heavens would
actually disturb the regular orbital paths, and the paths of comets
through the solar system. That reply might be thought of as empirical
in character, for it depends on observational data regarding the
actual paths of the heavenly bodies. But Leibinz's perspective is
obviously not merely empirical in character: he does not postulate
vortices (or anything akin to them) on observational grounds; he
infers their existence because he thinks we know (perhaps we can add,
we know <em>a priori</em>) that physical bodies such as comets or
planets can deviate from a rectilinear path—they can
accelerate—only if some other physical item impacts upon them.
Newton has a reply to that kind of view as well: he insists that the
phenomena of the motion of the heavenly bodies “follows”
solely from gravity itself—an impressed force, as we have seen,
and therefore an “action”—in accordance with the
laws of motion and the law of universal gravitation. Since gravity is
an action—clearly, a causal notion—it seems clear that
Newton's answer to Leibniz's idea that vortices cause the planetary
orbits is that gravity itself causes them, and nothing else.  And it
is not much of a leap to conclude, in turn, that this reply commits
Newton to the idea that bodies involved in gravitational interactions,
such as the sun and the earth, act at a distance on one another
through the force of gravity. It is not hard to divine why Leibniz
(and Huygens) would have concluded that Newton had relinquished any
commitment to the norms of the mechanical philosophy.</p>

<p>
Despite Leibniz's (and Huygens's) criticisms of his theory of gravity
in particular, and his methods in natural philosophy in general,
Newton stuck to his guns. Nearly twenty years after their illuminating
exchange in 1693, Leibniz and Newton narrowly missed a second
opportunity to discuss their philosophical differences directly.  In
May of 1712, Leibniz published a letter to Nicholas Hartsoeker that
was highly critical of the Newtonians; it was published in English
translation in the <em>Memoirs of Literature</em>, a journal to which
Roger Cotes, the editor of the <em>Principia's</em> second edition,
held a subscription (Newton 2004: 109). After Cotes brought Leibniz's
criticisms to Newton's attention—especially the claim that the
<em>Principia</em> renders gravitation a “perpetual
miracle” because it does not specify the physical mechanism
underlying it—Newton wrote an intriguing, but only posthumously
published, rebuttal. Here is part of Newton's paraphrase of Leibniz's
original letter:</p>

<blockquote><p> But he [i.e., Leibniz] goes on and tells us that God
could not create planets that should move round of themselves without
any cause that should prevent their removing through the tangent. For
a miracle at least must keep the planet in. (Newton 2004: 117)
</p></blockquote>

<p>
Newton's response to this Leibnizian charge is illuminating:
</p>

<blockquote><p> But certainly God could create planets that should
move round of themselves without any other cause than gravity that
should prevent their removing through the tangent. For gravity without
a miracle may keep the planets in. (<em>ibid</em>.)</p></blockquote>

<p>
Thus Newton repeats the view he mentions to Leibniz in 1693, viz.,
that the force of gravity itself causes the planets to follow their
orbital paths rather than their inertial trajectories along the
tangents to those orbits, independently of any fluid medium in the
heavens. But in this posthumously published letter, Newton did not
merely repeat his basic understanding of gravity from his 1693
exchange with Leibniz; he also included a wider discussion of
mechanist norms within philosophy more generally. Again, Newton begins
by quoting Leibniz:</p>

<blockquote> <p> But Mr. Leibniz goes
on. “The ancients and the moderns, who own that gravity is an
occult quality, are in the right, if they mean by it that there is a
certain mechanism unknown to them whereby all bodies tend towards the
center of the earth. But if they mean that the thing is performed
without any mechanism by a simple primitive quality or by a law of God
who produces that effect without using any intelligible means, it is
an unreasonable and occult quality, and so very occult that it is
impossible that it should ever be done though an angel or God himself
should undertake to explain it”. (Newton 2004: 116)</p>
</blockquote>

<p> In this passage, Leibniz returns to the kind of criticism that he
would present against the “superaddition” view that Locke
presented to Stillingfleet, arguing that philosophers must reject the
idea that gravity could simply be a feature of bodies that God adds to
them, despite the fact that we cannot possibly understand
gravitational interactions based on our idea of body (our idea of
extended solid substances, or another similar idea). Indeed, Leibniz
raises the stakes by contending that God himself could not explicate
how such interactions are possible based on the idea of
matter. Leibniz would argue, perhaps on metaphysical grounds, that any
laws said to govern the interaction of bodies, and any qualities
attributed to bodies, must be intelligible in the terms available to
philosophers through the mechanist orientation. In particular, laws
and qualities must be intelligible in terms of the shape, size, motion
and impenetrability (or solidity) of bodies. In this way, one might
conclude that Locke and Leibniz actually do not necessarily disagree
on whether gravity can be made intelligible in mechanist terms; they
simply disagree on the propriety of the contention that God could
“superadd” a feature to bodies that cannot be made
intelligible in that way.</p>

<p>
Newton's reply to Leibniz's argument is illuminating.  Instead of
presenting a narrow defense of his view, perhaps by denying that he
has postulated any non-mechanical causation with his theory of
gravity, he challenges the mechanical philosophy itself by contending
that it should not be understood as holding for all natural
phenomena:</p><blockquote> 

<p>
The same ought to be said of hardness. So then gravity and hardness
must go for unreasonable occult qualities unless they can be explained
mechanically. And why may not the same be said of the
<em>vis inertiae</em> [force of inertia] and the extension, the
duration and mobility of bodies, and yet no man ever attempted to
explain these qualities mechanically, or took them for miracles or
supernatural things or fictions or occult qualities. They are the
natural, real, reasonable, manifest qualities of all bodies seated in
them by the will of God from the beginning of the creation and
perfectly incapable of being explained mechanically, and so may be the
hardness of primitive particles of bodies. And therefore if any man
should say that bodies attract one another by a power whose cause is
unknown to us, or by a power seated in the frame of nature by the will
of God, or by a power seated in a substance in which bodies move and
float without resistance and which has therefore no
<em>vis inertiae</em> but acts by other laws than those that are
mechanical: I know not why he should be said to introduce miracles and
occult qualities and fictions into the world. For Mr. Leibniz himself
will scarce say that thinking is mechanical as it must be if to
explain it otherwise be to make a miracle, an occult quality, and a
fiction. (Newton 2004: 116)</p> </blockquote>

<p>
The first aspect of Newton's argument, it seems, is to indicate that
mechanical explanations are predicated on referencing certain kinds of
qualities when investigating natural phenomena, and that these
qualities themselves are therefore not subject to mechanical
explanation. For instance, since mechanist explanations—say, of
the way in which magnets attract iron filings across a
table—must refer to qualities such as the extension of the
bodies subject to the explanations, then we cannot give a mechanist
explanation of extension itself. Of course, Leibniz might reply that
we need not provide any explanation of the basic qualities of bodies
that figure in mechanical explanations, for those properties have been
chosen by the “moderns” precisely because they are
perfectly intelligible on their own, perhaps unlike various qualities
attributed to “Scholastic” accounts of natural
phenomena. The second aspect of Newton's argument is more
intriguing—it also harks back to Locke's discussion with
Stillingfleet, for Locke had contended that God may have superadded
not only gravity to material bodies, but also the power of thought,
linking them because he believed that neither could be rendered
intelligible using any philosophical means at his disposal. That is,
from Locke's point of view, we know that human beings—which are,
or at least contain, material bodies with size, shape, motion and
solidity, along with parts characterized by those qualities—are
capable of thought, but since we cannot discern how any material thing
could possibly have that capacity, we conclude that God may have
superadded that feature to us, or to our bodies. Thought and gravity
are dis-analogous in the sense that we did not require anything like
Newton's theory to convince us that human beings can think, but they
are otherwise analogous.  Newton then attempts to make the following
argument: since Leibniz would have to agree that thinking is not a
mechanical process, and not mechanically explicable, he must agree
that there is at least one aspect of the world that has the following
two features, (1) it is not mechanical; and, (2) it is clearly not to
be rejected on that ground alone. He attempts to liken
<em>gravity</em> (as he understands it) to <em>thinking</em> (as he
believes Leibniz is required to understand it), arguing that despite
the fact that it is not mechanical—it cannot be explained
mechanically—it should not be rejected on that ground. This
argument may be predicated on the view that human beings, material
things, or at least partially material things, do the thinking, rather
than immaterial things, such as minds or souls, for if one attributes
all thought to an immaterial mind or soul, then there is no pressure
to say that anything in nature, or perhaps even any aspect of anything
in nature, has a feature that cannot be mechanically explicated. If
one accepts Locke's view (apparently also endorsed by Newton) that we
should attribute thinking to material things, or to aspects of
material things, then perhaps Newton has successfully followed Locke
in likening gravity to thought, thereby making room for aspects of
nature that are not mechanical after all. This vexing issue would
continue to generate debates amongst Newton's and Leibniz's various
followers in England, and on the Continent, respectively.</p>

<p>
Leibniz's most extensive debate with the Newtonians would not occur
until the very end of his life. His celebrated correspondence with
Samuel Clarke, Newton's friend and supporter in London in the early
part of the eighteenth century, is his most famous interaction with
the Newtonians, occurring right before his death in 1716 (Clarke and
Leibniz 1717). Leibniz fomented the correspondence in November of 1715
by sending a short, provocative letter to Princess Caroline of Wales,
one designed to provoke a response from Newton's circle in
London. Leibniz knew well that Princess Caroline was a leading
intellectual and political figure in England at the time, one who
would surely wish to see the views of her countrymen defended against
Leibniz's rather shocking claims about the religious consequences of
Newtonian thinking. He opens his initial letter by mentioning both
Locke and Newton, along with the issues about materiality and thinking
that arose in his near exchange with Newton in 1712:</p>

<blockquote><p> Natural religion itself seems to decay [in England]
very much. Many will have human souls to be material; others make God
himself a corporeal being. Mr. Locke and his followers are uncertain
at least whether the soul is not material and naturally
perishable. Sir Isaac Newton says that space is an organ which God
makes use of to perceive things by. But if God stands in need of any
organ to perceive things by, it will follow that they do not depend
altogether on him, nor were produced by him. (Clarke and Leibniz 1717:
L 1: 1–3) </p></blockquote>

<p> Thus Leibniz charges both Lockeans and Newtonians with presenting
philosophical views of the human and of the divine that lead to
theologically unsavory consequences, such as the idea that the human
soul might be material, and the view that God must employ something
akin to an organ in order to perceive happenings in the world. These
were fighting words. Although Locke had died in 1704, he had various
followers in England at the time (Gascoigne 1985: 172–3), and
Newton himself was at the height of his influence: he had recently
been knighted, as Leibniz acknowledges by calling him
“Sir” in his letter, and was at that time President of the
Royal Society.  Moreover, Samuel Clarke had given the Boyle lectures
in 1704 and again in 1705, so he was a public figure associated with
the state of Christianity in England. Once Clarke took the bait,
replying that same month to Leibniz's charges, Locke's views quickly
dropped from view and the two focused specifically on Leibniz's
numerous objections to Newtonian ideas and methods. But why did Clarke
respond on Newton's behalf, and what was Newton's actual role in the
correspondence? These questions continue to puzzle scholars (see Cohen
and Koyré 1962; Bertoloni Meli 1999 and 2002; Vailati 1997). There is
no documentary evidence, such as letters, between Clarke and Newton
indicating the contours of his role; then again, at this time, both
men lived in London and Clarke was Newton's parish priest, so the lack
of letters or other papers is perhaps unsurprising. That fact alone is
intriguing, for the theological differences between the two are
salient: since Newton was a committed anti-Trinitarian—a fact
known to figures like Locke and to others such as William
Whiston—he may have decided that Leibniz's contentions about
“natural religion” in England would best be answered by
what we might now call a more mainstream theological figure like
Clarke. In any event, there is no doubt that Clarke was taken by
Leibniz and his followers to be speaking for Newton and his
circle. Nonetheless, there are certainly aspects of Clarke's views
that may deviate from Newton's own opinions, so it would be unwise to
(as it were) remove Clarke from our conception of the correspondence
by regarding it as effectively Newton's work.</p>

<p> Leibniz's correspondence with Clarke is methodologically
characteristic: he leaves much of his own systematic and complex
metaphysical theorizing—including the monadology—in the
background, bringing to the fore only those elements that are both
necessary for his criticisms of the Newtonians and also likely to
garner support from Clarke. Thus the key to many of Leibniz's
criticisms is the principle of sufficient reason (PSR), which he knows
Clarke will endorse (although with a distinct conception of its scope:
Leibniz asserts, while Clarke denies, that the principle demands that
each act of divine willing requires a reason; for Clarke, divine
willing itself is reason enough for some physical state of affairs to
obtain, or event to occur). Leibniz argues in particular that several
key aspects of the Newtonian worldview are simply incompatible with
the PSR, including the idea of absolute space. If space were in fact
completely independent of all physical objects and all relations among
them, as the Newtonians seem to assert, then a problem arises:</p>
<blockquote><p> I have many demonstrations to confute the fancy of
those who take space to be a substance or at least an absolute
being. But I shall only use, at present, one demonstration, which the
author here gives me occasion to insist upon. I say, then, that if
space were an absolute being, something would happen for which it
would be impossible that there should be a sufficient
reason—which is against my axiom.  And I prove it thus: space is
something absolutely uniform, and without the things placed in it, one
point of space absolutely does not differ in any respect whatsoever
from another point of space. Now from this it follows (supposing space
to be something in itself, besides the order of bodies among
themselves) that it is impossible there should be a reason why God,
preserving the same situations of bodies among themselves, should have
placed them in space after one certain particular manner and not
otherwise—why everything was not placed the quite contrary way,
for instance, by changing east into west. But if space is nothing else
but this order or relation, and is nothing at all without bodies but
the possibility of placing them, then those two states, the one such
as it is now, the other supposed to be the quite contrary way, would
not at all differ from one another. Their difference therefore is only
to be found in our chimerical supposition of the reality of
space. (Clarke and Leibniz 1717: L 3: 5)</p> </blockquote>

<p>
Leibniz's argument is clever at the outset: he bypasses the thorny
problem of determining whether Newton's idea of absolute space commits
him to thinking of space as a substance—a view, incidentally,
which Newton explicitly considers and rejects in <em>De
Gravitatione</em> (Newton 2004: 21–2)—by presupposing only
that Newton thinks of space as existing independently of objects and
their relations. If space is indeed independent in this way, then it
would seem that God faces a choice: when creating the world, or
matter, why place (e.g.) the earth in one particular part of space
rather than any other? The parts of space, independently of all
objects and all relations, obviously do not differ from one another in
any salient respect at all, so it would seem that one could not even
theoretically devise a reason for placing the earth anywhere in
particular, as opposed to anywhere else in particular. (This argument,
incidentally, does not depend on our having the capacity to refer to
places within empty space at all.) But since space exists, with all
its places, independently of the earth and everything else, then God
must indeed have some reason to place the earth in one place rather
than another—for Leibniz, even the divine will is inert
independent of any reason for (as it were) moving in one direction
rather than another. Finally, Leibniz argues that he himself avoids
this problem by asserting that space is nothing above and beyond the
objects in the world and all possible relations amongst them (hence he
holds a kind of modal relationalist view, in more modern
terminology). God faces no problematic choice on this view, since
space does not exist prior to the creation of the world, or of
material objects: to create objects with spatial relations just is
<em>ipso facto</em> to create space itself, for it is nothing over and
above objects and their relations.  If you like, space for Leibniz
just is a way of conceptually grasping all objects and all possible
relations amongst them, all at once. Time, similarly, is a way of
grasping the whole series of events that have characterized
history. Clarke's reply is somewhat disappointing: he blocks Leibniz's
inference by simply denying that the divine will must have a reason to
place (say) the earth in one place rather than another (Clarke and
Leibniz 1717: C 3: 5). The PSR is not violated in this case, according
to Clarke's interpretation of it, because it requires only this: if
the earth appears in one place rather than another, there must be a
reason that it appears there, and the reason in this case is simply
the divine will; there is no further question about why the divine
being made a particular choice rather than another. In the quotation
above, Leibniz speaks of the Newtonians as endorsing “the
reality of space”, which Leibniz regards as
“chimerical”. This remark highlights another important
aspect of Leibniz's conception of space and time, one that is often
ignored in contemporary discussions, which tend to emphasize
Leibnizian “relationalism” in opposition to Newtonian
“absolutism”. Leibniz's view of space and time connects
intimately with broader aspects of his metaphysical positions: unlike
ordinary physical objects, which are constituted by their parts (they
are discrete), and which exhibit features that involve internal
distinctions amongst those parts, he thinks of space and time as
continuous and homogeneous. Leaving aside the monadology, as he does
in his correspondence with Clarke, this means that for Leibniz, it is
physical objects that are real things; space and time are merely
“ideal” or abstract entities whose continuity and
homogeneity signal this special status. It is not merely that space
and time are nothing over and above the events and relations of
objects that exist in our world; it is also the case that they are
ideal: they depend in some way on the human mind for their
existence. Or so Leibniz seems to suggest. This aspect of his view
would become of central importance to Kant's understanding of the
Leibniz-Newton debate on the nature of space.</p>

<p>
Obviously, Leibniz's arguments against the Newtonians highlighted a
fundamental difference between his interpretation of the PSR and
Clarke's: where Leibniz held what we might call the
“rationalist” view that all willing, all choice, must
occur for a reason—a requirement from which even the divine
being is not exempt—Clarke held what we might call the
“voluntarist” view that willing, or choice, itself need
not occur for any reason, for it is itself a sufficient reason for
some states of affairs to obtain or event to occur. From Leibniz's
point of view, this renders the will, including the divine will,
opaque or unintelligible: if an agent can act or make a choice without
having any reason for it, then surely the agent is not rational, and
if the PSR demands anything of the world, it is that the world be
rationally intelligible to us. This requirement must hold of agents
and their wills as well. But from Clarke's point of view, this
requirement is too stringent, especially in the divine case: if we
hold that even God must have a reason for choosing to create one state
of affairs rather than another—for choosing, say, to part the
Red Sea rather than the Mississippi River—then we are <em>ipso
facto</em> restricting God's freedom. Surely God has the freedom to
choose to do anything at all, or at least, anything that does not
contain or instantiate a contradiction, and for his part, Leibniz
agrees that the principle of contradiction does not entail the
PSR—the latter is a separate and independent principle which is
necessary for metaphysics and natural philosophy to extend beyond
mathematics, which requires only the principle of contradiction
(Clarke and Leibniz 1717: L 2: 1).  God doesn't need a reason to part
the sea—God can simply do it! Leibniz replies: Clarke's view
leaves us with a God, and indeed with ordinary agents, who can act
arbitrarily, with no reason at all, and that is not the kind of
freedom that philosophy seeks; it wishes to see agents as engaged in
rational action. In their differing interpretations of the PSR, and
their correspondingly distinct conceptions of freedom and reason, the
debate between Leibniz and Clarke hits rock bottom.</p>

<p> Leibniz's criticisms of the Newtonians were not restricted to
questions about the nature of space and time; he also revived his old
complaint—one shared with, and by, Huygens, as we have seen
above—that Newton's physical theory commits him to the
possibility, if not to the reality, of action at a distance among the
planetary bodies. In one passage in his fourth letter, for instance,
Leibniz writes (Clarke and Leibniz 1717: L 4: 45):</p>

<blockquote><p> It is also a supernatural thing that bodies should
attract one another at a distance without any intermediate means and
that a body should move around without receding in the tangent, though
nothing hinders it from so receding. For these effects cannot be
explained by the nature of things.</p></blockquote>

<p>
As a defender of the mechanical philosophy, Leibniz insists here, as
he had before, that a material body like the Earth would recede along
the tangent to its orbit if it were not the case that it was impacted
upon by some physical body or bodies, such as a vortex or another kind
of fluid filling the solar system.  Clarke's reply to this charge is
especially illuminating (Clarke and Leibniz 1717: C 4: 45):</p>

<blockquote><p> That one body should attract another without any
intermediate means, is indeed not a miracle, but a contradiction: for
‘tis supposing something to act where it is not. But the means
by which two bodies attract each other may be invisible and
intangible, and of a different nature from mechanism, and yet, acting
regularly and constantly, may well be called natural, being much less
wonderful than animal motion, which yet is never called a
miracle’.</p></blockquote>

<p>
This passage is bound to confuse readers. On the one hand, Clarke is
clearly arguing that the Newtonians refuse to restrict their
understanding of causal interactions in nature to mechanical cases; on
the other, however, he does not accept what many at that time would
have regarded as the obvious implication of this denial of mechanism,
namely that action at a distance is perfectly possible (a move
embraced by some later in the eighteenth century, such as
Kant). Instead, Clarke not only rejects action at a distance as Newton
possibly had before him; he contends that it isn't even logically
possible! In his various pronouncements to Bentley and others, Newton
never contended that action at a distance was simply a contradiction
and therefore impossible, presumably even for the divine being, who is
typically said to be capable of creating any situation that does not
instantiate a contradiction (although Descartes's views on the eternal
truths are obviously more complicated).  Clarke's view raises a
serious problem for Newtonians: if action at a distance is simply a
contradiction, and therefore not a possible physical situation, even
with divine intervention, then how ought one to interpret the theory
of universal gravity, which certainly <em>appears</em> to indicate
that distant action is perfectly possible, and perhaps even actual? If
we interpret the theory as postulating actual distant action, say
between the moon and the earth, then it clearly must be mistaken; but
even if we interpret it less strongly, as merely postulating that
distant action between the moon and the earth is possible, that would
presumably disqualify the theory as well.  Perhaps one can save
Clarke's view by contending that since distant action is logically
impossible, Newton's theory must therefore be interpreted as neutral
on that issue. This is one issue where Clarke's views may differ
substantially from Newton's own. Regardless of whether Clarke
represented Newton's own views faithfully, there is no doubt that his
correspondence with Leibniz helped to shape the agenda of philosophy
in the eighteenth century.</p>

<h2><a id="NewImp">7. Newton's impact on philosophy</a></h2>

<p>The history of eighteenth-century philosophy cannot be written
without extensive discussion of Newton's own views and of his
influence on the views of other figures both in England and on the
Continent. As we have seen, when Newton was a young student at Trinity
College, Cambridge, Cartesian views in natural philosophy and much
else besides had replaced the ideas and methods of Aristotle and his
followers as the most important subject for discussion amongst
philosophers. In many ways, Newton eventually succeeded in convincing
philosophers that his own ideas and methods were superior to those of
the Cartesians—especially when it came to thinking about motion
and its causes within nature—but this historical fact did not
mean that Newtonianism, even broadly construed, became the dominant
trend in natural philosophy during Newton's lifetime. On the contrary,
Newton's views continued to be the subject of intense scrutiny and
debate, especially amongst Leibniz and his followers (such as
Christiaan Wolff) and fellow mechanists (such as Huygens). Indeed, a
late-seventeenth-century debate between Cartesian and Newtonian ideas
was supplanted by an early eighteenth century debate between
Leibnizian and Newtonian views; the latter debate would continue in
one form or another for the rest of the century: it was a driving
force during the French Enlightenment, and remained a powerful
stimulant to philosophical theorizing in the 1770s and 1780s, when
Kant forged his magisterial “critical” system of
philosophy, an approach that almost single-handedly set the
philosophical agenda of the early nineteenth century. Hence Newton's
influence on the eighteenth century did not take the form of a single
philosophical program or movement; instead, it was the controversial
nature of his ideas and methodology that drove much of the
philosophical discussion.</p>

<p>There are some irreducibly nationalist elements in the way that
philosophy developed over the course of the eighteenth century, so it
may be reasonable to chart Newton's impact country by country.
Newton's ideas and methods were certainly most influential in England,
where there grew to be a strong “Newtonian”
movement—also called the “experimental philosophy”
program—by roughly 1700. By the <em>fin de siecle</em>, it is
probably safe to say that natural philosophy had become heavily
Newtonian in England, at least in the sense that it had eclipsed both
Cartesianism (Henry 2013: 124 and introduction to Voltaire 1738/1992:
7), and other local movements, such as Cambridge Platonism, which had
exhibited a strong influence during the previous generation. One might
put the point somewhat differently: to the extent that there was a
dominant strand in England by 1700, it was the “experimental
philosophy”, a view that was associated strongly with figures
such as Boyle, Newton and Locke. Figures such as Hobbes had opposed
this approach to solving philosophical problems, but had failed to
gain nearly as much influence. Perhaps more importantly, Newton's view
of motion, his understanding of space and time, and his approach to
achieving knowledge of natural phenomena, helped to shape the agenda
of British philosophy for the next fifty years. In addition to
Newton's influence on Locke's thinking about matter and causation,
explored above, both Berkeley and Hume expended considerable energy
grappling with the wider consequences and implications of the
Newtonian version of the experimental philosophy. For his part,
Berkeley famously derided many Newtonians methods and
ideas—sometimes exempting Newton himself from his conception of
the worst philosophical excesses of his followers—including the
rise of the calculus among mathematicians (in <em>The Analyst</em>)
and the use of the idea of a force as the basic causal concept in
natural philosophy (in <em>De Motu</em>—both reprinted in
Berkeley 1992).  Berkeley's theory of ideas, which arose in part from
his reflections of what we would now call Locke's
“empiricist” notion of representation, suggested to him
that no idea can be abstract: each idea must represent a
<em>particular</em> rather than a universal. Hence we can have an idea
of a particular car, but not of a car in general (not of, as it were,
the form of a car); we can have an idea of a particular shade of
yellow, perhaps because we've just seen a lovely yellow rose at the
florist, but not of yellow in general; and so on. Berkeley then argued
that modern mathematics, especially the calculus, and modern natural
philosophy, especially Newtonian versions of it, were often reliant on
abstract ideas, and therefore philosophically suspect. For instance,
he contended that the very idea of absolute motion was suspect because
we can represent to ourselves only various motions with particular
features related to particular bodies in motion, but
“absolute” motion cannot be rendered <em>particular</em>
in anything like this way; it remains abstract (Downing 2005:
235). Thus although Newtonian views were considered to be essential to
the rise of experimental philosophy in Britain, Berkeley derided them
as insufficiently experimental, as overly reliant on representations
of universals and of universal quantities, rather than on the
representation of particulars. In a reflection of Malebranche's
influence, Berkeley also argued that some Newtonians wrongly
attributed genuine causal powers to ordinary material objects through
their use of the concept of impressed force; wrongly, because Berkeley
firmly rejected the notion that any body could exert any causal
power. All causation in Berkeley's system is due either to the
intervention of the divine in the course of history, or to spirits or
minds, which are genuinely causally active. Finally, in an argument
that would prefigure Mach's reactions to Newtonian conceptions of
space, time and motion in the late nineteenth century—which were
expressive of a broad commitment to
“empiricism”—Berkeley contended that absolute space
is a metaphysical aberration: philosophers should not posit any entity
or thing that is beyond all possible perception. In sum, Berkeley was
highly critical of many aspects of the Newtonian program, but for that
very reason, it was Newton's ideas that helped to shape many of his
philosophical projects.</p>

<p>For his part, Hume had a more nuanced reaction to the emergence of
the Newtonian program (cf. Schliesser 2007 and DePierris 2012). He
certainly signaled his endorsement of the experimental
philosophy—itself strongly associated with the Newtonians, along
with figures like Boyle and Hooke, as we have seen—when he gave
his <em>Treatise</em> the following subtitle: “being an attempt
to introduce the experimental method of reasoning into moral
subjects”. And one might argue that Hume made a kind of Lockean
move when he chose to endorse the Newtonian program specifically in
preference to the mechanical philosophy, which he regarded with
suspicion. A famous comment from his <em>History of England</em>
bolsters this interpretation:</p>

<blockquote><p> While Newton seemed to draw off the veil from some of
the mysteries of nature, he showed at the same time the imperfections
of the mechanical philosophy; and thereby restored her ultimate
secrets to that obscurity, in which they ever did and ever will
remain. (Hume 1854 [1754–61]: vol. 5: 374)</p></blockquote>

<p>
The difference between Locke and Hume might be that the former, unlike
the latter, nonetheless insisted that mechanism continued to provide
philosophers with a canon for the intelligibility of causation within
nature (Hume's critique of earlier conceptions of causation, including
Locke's, is certainly well known). Hume also expended considerable
effort in interpreting some of the philosophical aspects or
consequences of Newton's theory of gravity and his corresponding
understanding of the nature of matter. In particular, he wished to
provide what we would now call an empiricist interpretation of
Newton's three laws of motion, his concept of mass (quantity of
matter), and his understanding of gravity; in the process, he does not
shy away from interpreting Newton's sometimes confusing notion of the
<em>vis inertiae</em> or force of inertia, which as we have seen
above, is not a kind of impressed force. This was particularly
difficult because Hume had already contended that strictly speaking,
we have no idea (no representation) of force or power—these are
merely words employed by natural philosophers without any ideas
corresponding to them. Thus he must find an interpretation of Newton
that is not predicated on our ability to form an idea of forces or
powers. In a famous footnote in his <em>Enquiry Concerning Human
Understanding</em>, he writes (Hume 1777/1993: §vii.i note 2,
48–49):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I need not examine at length the <em>vis inertiae</em> which is so
much talked of in the new philosophy, and which is ascribed to matter.
We find by experience, that a body at rest or in motion continues for
ever in its present state, till put from it by some new cause; and
that a body impelled takes as much motion from the impelling body as
it acquires itself. These are facts. When we call this a <em>vis
inertiae</em>, we only mark these facts, without pretending to have
any idea of the inert power; in the same manner as, when we talk of
gravity, we mean certain effects, without comprehending that active
power. It was never the meaning of Sir ISAAC NEWTON to rob second
causes of all force or energy; though some of his followers have
endeavoured to establish that theory upon his authority. On the
contrary, that great philosopher had recourse to an ethereal active
fluid to explain his universal attraction; though he was so cautious
and modest as to allow, that it was a mere hypothesis, not to be
insisted on, without more experiments.</p> </blockquote>

<p>In mentioning Newton's speculation that an aether might explain
universal gravity in some sense (for instance, in query 21 to the
<em>Opticks</em>), Hume does not appear to be concerned about action
at a distance; instead, he is concerned to argue that this speculation
indicates that Newton himself did not regard his theory as requiring
that we attribute a “power” of gravity to material
bodies. This is important for Hume to establish, not least because he
believes that we can form no representation at all of any such
power. Similarly, when Newton indicates in the <em>Principia</em> that
we can conceive of a body's quantity of matter as its <em>vis
inertiae</em>, its power of resisting any change to its state of
motion (Newton 1999: 404–5), he is not attributing any power to
that body, but rather employing a means of characterizing its
behavior. Or so Hume contends. In this specific regard, we find an
echo of Berkeley's earlier work: in <em>De Motu</em>, Berkeley argues
in particular that although some philosophers misunderstand the
Newtonian theory of gravity as attributing a special force or nature
to material objects, there is an interpretation of Newton that is
consistent with the new theory of ideas. He writes (Berkeley 1992:
<em>De Motu</em>, §6):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Again, <em>force</em>, <em>gravity</em>, and terms of that sort are
more often used in the concrete (and rightly so) so as to connote the
body in motion, the effort of resisting, etc. But when they are used
by philosophers to signify certain natures carved out and abstracted
from all these things, natures which are not objects of sense, nor can
be grasped by any force of intellect, nor pictured by the imagination,
then indeed they breed errors and confusion.</p></blockquote>

<p>
There is little doubt, then, that the new British philosophy
represented by Locke, Berkeley, and Hume in the early-to-mid
eighteenth century was concerned to present interpretations of
Newton's work that were consistent with their overarching
philosophical commitments, principles and methods, or to alter those
commitments, principles and methods as necessary.</p>

<p>In France, perhaps not surprisingly, the intellectual situation was
rather different than in England. Cartesian ideas held sway for many
decades after Newton first emerged on the scene in the 1670s with his
optics papers and in the late 1680s with the <em>Principia</em>; they
were especially popular at the Académie Royale des Sciences, unlike
the situation in the Royal Society (Henry 2013: 120). Voltaire became
famous for challenging the Cartesian French orthodoxy, traveling to
England for a celebrated visit and bringing home
“enlightened” ideas about philosophy, politics, and much
else besides in an attempt to foment the emergence and development of
a French Newtonian program. His most important publication in this
regard is probably the <em>Elements of the philosophy of Newton</em>
(Voltaire 1738/1992), which attempts to signal the
“errors” of Descartes and to highlight the advantages of
the Newtonian program in “Physique”. Of course, Cartesian
ideas and methods retained numerous adherents and defenders in France,
and so the debate between Cartesian and Newtonian ideas flourished in
that environment (cf. Aiton 1972: ch. 8). But even in France,
Cartesianism eventually gave way to a newer version of metaphysics
associated with Leibniz and his German follower and expositor,
Wolff. One of Voltaire's most significant collaborators, the French
aristocrat Émilie du Châtelet (formally, the Marquise du Châtelet),
published a key text in 1740, <em>Institutions de physique</em>
(<em>Foundations of physics</em>), in which she argued that although
the best physics should be Newtonian rather than Cartesian,
nonetheless the best metaphysics should be considered Leibnizian
rather than Newtonian in spirit, if not in detail. In this
text—which was republished in a second edition in 1742 and
swiftly translated into German and Italian—Châtelet makes
precisely the kind of argument that presses Hume a few years later to
articulate a conception of the <em>vis inertiae</em> that is
consistent with the experimental philosophy. She argues that the
Cartesian view that extension is the essence of body is mistaken; we
must conceive of material objects as exhibiting a “<em>force
d'inertie</em>” if we are to understand their physical
interactions properly (Châtelet 1742: ch. 1, §2). From her point
of view, this Newtonian conception of body is not inherently
problematic; the problem arises when some Newtonians interpret the
theory of universal gravity as proving that bodies have a property of
attraction or attractive power endowed by God (Châtelet 1742: ch. 16,
§385). She accepts the idea that gravity is proportional to the
masses of bodies and inversely proportional to the square of their
spatial separation, arguing that this Newtonian idea of attraction
“marvelously” explains the fall of bodies on earth, the
tides, and various astronomical phenomena, something that the vortex
theory of the Cartesians fails to do. But she denies that this
acceptance entails that she must also accept the conclusion that
bodies have an “essential property” called gravity or
attractive force, contending that such a conclusion transcends the
knowledge available to philosophers (Châtelet 1742: ch. 16,
§388). In this specific way, Châtelet's work is predicated on the
familiar notion that although Cartesianism has been properly
overthrown by Newtonian ideas and methods, philosophers must
nonetheless develop a proper interpretation of the Newtonian theory of
gravity and of its implications. Yet unlike Voltaire, who not only
rejected Cartesianism, but became famous for his ridicule of
Leibnizian philosophy in <em>Candide</em>, Châtelet argued that
philosophers should continue to work on developing the proper
metaphysical foundations for natural philosophy much as Descartes had
argued, only they should follow the ideas and methods of Leibniz and
Wolff. In particular, Châtelet argued that the principle of sufficient
reason should be a guiding force in metaphysical theorizing, and as
Leibniz had argued, it shows the fundamental error in Newton's concept
of absolute space; she added that Clarke's method of replying to
Leibniz's argument, viz., that one can develop a non-Leibnizan or
voluntarist conception of the PSR to evade the problem with absolute
space, is underwhelming (Châtelet 1742: ch. 5, §74). The great
challenge for Châtelet, of course, is to show in depth how she can
develop a consistent system in which the natural
philosophy—especially the laws of motion and the theory of
gravity—is Newtonian even while the metaphysics—especially
the commitment to a rationalist interpretation of the PSR and the
corresponding conception of space and time—is Leibnizian.
Clearly, many Newtonians and many Leibnizians would have rejected this
project as impossible. It would obviously be no small philosophical
feat to make the project succeed. Suitably modified, the project
animated much of Kant's work later in the century.</p>

<p>The question of whether to accept, and of how to interpret,
absolute space, time and motion, and the related question of how to
conceive of the relation between Newton's work in natural philosophy
and the flourishing Leibnizian-Wolffian metaphysics on the Continent,
continued to drive conversations in the middle of the eighteenth
century. Just a few years after Châtelet published her
<em>Institutions</em>, the mathematician Leonard Euler presented a
novel approach to these two questions in a short paper entitled
“Reflexions sur l'Espace et le Temps”, first published in
1748 in the <em>Mémoires de l'Académie des Sciences de
Berlin</em>. The Berlin Academy had been witnessing a vociferous
debate between Wolffians and Newtonians since 1740 (a debate that
would continue until roughly 1759), one in which Euler played a
role. Whereas one might regard the British philosophers, especially
Berkeley and Hume, as arguing that philosophical principles and
commitments take a kind of precedence in driving one's interpretations
of the concepts of force, motion, space and time, Euler argued that
natural philosophy—specifically, mechanics—ought to take
precedence. The famous first sentence of his essay indicates why: he
contends that the principles of mechanics—for instance, the
principle of inertia—are so well established that it would be
foolish to doubt them (Euler 1748: 324). In particular, if one's
metaphysical commitments stand in tension with the concepts of space 
and motion found in geometry and mechanics, then one must adjust those
commitments accordingly.</p>

<p>The most important figure in German-speaking Europe to react in
depth to Newton's ideas was surely Immanuel Kant, who was influenced
by Euler's argument (Friedman 1992: 16–17) in the 1748
piece.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#26" name="note-26">26</a>]</sup> Kant
began grappling with Newtonian ideas at the very beginning of his
career—he discussed the inverse-square law in his first
publication (Kant 1747: § 10)—and they would remain central
both to his magnum opus, the <em>Critique of Pure Reason</em> (Kant
1787/1992) and to his <em>Metaphysical Foundations of Natural
Science</em> (1786/2002). Early in the so-called pre-critical period,
Kant diverged sharply from the approach toward natural philosophy
defended by many Leibnizians in German-speaking Europe by deciding to
accept the Newtonian theory of universal gravity, along with
corresponding aspects of the Newtonian conception of matter, as a
starting point for philosophical theorizing (Friedman 2012:
485–6). He makes this explicit already in 1763, in <em>The Only
Possible Argument</em>:</p>

<blockquote> <p>I will attempt to provide an explanation of the origin
of the world system according to the general laws of mechanics, not an
explanation of the entire natural order, but only of the great masses
of matter and their orbits, which constitute the most crudest
foundation of nature … I will presuppose the universal
gravitation of matter according to <em>Newton</em> or his followers in
this project. If there are any who believe that through a definition
of metaphysics formulated according to their own taste they can
annihilate the conclusions established by men of perspicacity on the
basis of observation and by means of mathematical inference—if
there are such persons, they can skip the following propositions as
something which has only a remote bearing on the main aim of this
essay. (Kant 1763: AK 2: 139)</p> </blockquote>

<p>A rare case of Kantian irony, it seems. Already in this early text,
Kant has clearly broken with his predecessors both in England and on
the Continent, who insisted on disputing Newton's theory of universal
gravity, either on metaphysical or theological grounds.  Instead,
Kant's work will be predicated on that theory. But Kant never became
an orthodox Newtonian, any more than an orthodox Leibnizian (or
Wolffian). This is evident from the radically different fates of two
classic Newtonian concepts within the Kantian system: the idea that
the theory of universal gravity shows that gravity is a feature of
material bodies, along with the related concept of action at a
distance, on the one hand; and absolute space, on the other. The
quotation from 1763 above indicates that Kant was willing to endorse
Newton's theory of universal gravity, despite the many objections
raised against it by his Leibnizian predecessors. Indeed, he was also
willing to accept the most radical interpretation of that theory, one
according to which every material body in the world should be
understood as bearing a feature called gravity, one that involves that
body in actions at a distance on all other such bodies. As Kant puts
it dramatically in Proposition 7 of the second chapter of
<em>Metaphysical Foundations of Natural Science</em>: “The
attraction essential to all matter is an immediate action of matter on
other matter through empty space” (Kant 1786/2002: 223; AK 4:
512). This view is radical in two senses: first, it involves the
highly controversial claim that gravity is essential to matter, which
indicates that a body lacking gravitational interactions would fail to
count as a material entity at all (much as an earlier generation of
philosophers would conceive of extension as essential to matter); and
second, it also involves the debated idea that material bodies act at
a distance on one another. One can conceivably endorse the latter
without endorsing the former, contending, e.g., that although material
bodies in the actual world act at a distance on one another, perhaps
because of a divine plan, it is perfectly <em>possible</em> for
material bodies to fail to do so under distinct worldly conditions
(i.e., there may be possible worlds in which material bodies lack
gravity altogether). That is, the endorsement of action at a distance
does not entail the endorsement of the essentiality claim. Both ideas
are controversial, and Kant strongly endorses them both. This placed
him in a rather select group of radical Newtonians (Friedman 1992: 1
note 2). Kant himself understood that Newton may not have endorsed
these controversial views, arguing that he was inconsistent on this
score (see Remark 2 to Proposition 7 of chapter 2, AK 4: 514–16;
Friedman 2012: 203–21; Friedman 1990). And yet Kant strongly
resisted the other most controversial Newtonian idea, absolute space,
along with the related idea of absolute motion (Friedman 2012:
35–42). In the <em>Critique of Pure Reason</em>, for instance,
Kant expressed a basically Leibnizian sympathy by arguing that there
are fundamental metaphysical (and perhaps epistemic) difficulties with
thinking of space as existing independently of all objects and all
possible relations among them, as “actual entities
“(<em>wirkliche Wesen</em>—A23/B37) in their own right. He
does so in a passage that (perhaps confusingly) characterizes the
Leibnizians as also defending a kind of realism about space, but we
can focus solely on his criticism of the Newtonians:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Those, however, who assert the absolute reality of space and time,
whether they assume it to be subsisting or only inhering, must
themselves come into conflict with the principles of experience. For
if they decide in favor of the first (which is generally the position
of the mathematical investigators of nature), then they must assume
two eternal and infinite self-subsisting non-entities (space and
time), which exist (yet without there being anything real) only in
order to comprehend everything real within themselves. (A39/B56)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If one regards space (like time) as existing independently of all
objects and all possible relations, and yet one admits that space is
causally inert and imperceptible, as one presumably must in the late
eighteenth century, then one is committed to the idea that there is a
kind of infinite and eternal non-entity in the world. Space is a kind
of non-entity, Kant suggests, because on the one hand it is said to
exist independently of everything else, and yet on the other hand, it
is said to be causally inert and imperceptible, which would
distinguish it from every other sort of thing that exists. Kant simply
cannot stomach this metaphysically preposterous notion. It is
therefore incumbent upon him to develop a theory of space (and of
motion) that meets at least two distinct criteria: (1) it coheres with
his understanding of the theory of universal gravity, and of what he
regards as its implication, viz. that gravity is an essential feature
of material bodies; and, (2) it avoids the metaphysically problematic
aspects of Newtonian absolute space. Kant tackles precisely these
tasks in the <em>Metaphysical Foundations</em>, which was published in
between the appearance of the first and of the second edition of the
<em>Critique</em>, arguing that we can regard absolute space as a kind
of idea of reason, an ideal that we approach asymptotically in our
theorizing about motion. Absolute space is therefore nothing more than
a kind of ideal within our philosophy, and no longer a harmful aspect
of our ontology.</p>

<p>Of course, Newton's influence on the development of philosophy did
not end with the close of the eighteenth century. Most obviously, the
concepts of absolute space and absolute motion continued to play
fundamental roles in philosophical theorizing about space and motion
more generally for the next two centuries, and they remain fundamental
to discussions today (DiSalle 2006). Newton has also had a deep and
lasting influence on numerous other topics in what we now call the
philosophy of science, including the status of our knowledge of
natural phenomena, the best ideas about scientific methodology, the
status of the laws of nature, and so on (McMullin 2001 and Smith
2001).</p>
