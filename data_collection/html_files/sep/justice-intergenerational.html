<h1>Intergenerational Justice</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Thu Apr 3, 2003; substantive revision Mon Aug 10, 2015</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>

Do justice considerations apply to intergenerational relations, that
is, to relations between non-contemporaries? If we follow a broad
understanding of justice (see Mill 1863, ch. 5) this is the case if
future or past generations can be viewed as holding legitimate claims
or
 rights<sup>[<a href="notes.html#1" name="note-1">1</a>]</sup>
 against present generations, who in turn stand under correlative
duties to future or past generations. One of the legitimate claims of
future generations vis-à-vis present generations appears to be
a claim of distributive justice: Depending on the understanding of the
relevant principles of distributive justice to be applied, if there is
an intergenerational conflict of interests, present generations may be
obligated by considerations of justice not to pursue policies that
impose an unfair intergenerational distribution of costs and benefits.</p> 
<p>

This entry will focus primarily on two questions: first, whether
present generations can be duty-bound because of considerations of
justice to past and future people; and second, whether other moral
considerations should guide those currently alive in relating to both
past and future people. Concerning the first question, the entry will
suggest that present generations have duties of justice to future
people but not to past people. Concerning the second question, the
entry will suggest that present generations also have additional moral
duties (duties not grounded in correlative rights) to future people as
well as moral duties to past people owing, in part, to the rights
these people had while alive. The entry will also argue for the
lasting significance of past injustices in terms of what is owed to
the descendants of the direct victims of the injustices. These are
contentious claims as the discussion will show.</p>

<p>

While we owe the first systematic discussion of obligations to future
people within a theory of justice to John Rawls (see Section 4.4),
Derek Parfit’s work has defined the problems of how we can and should
relate to future people (see esp. Section 3).</p>

<h2><a name="HowIntRelDifRelAmoCon">1. How Intergenerational Relations Differ from Relations Among Contemporaries</a></h2>

<p>

It may seem that considerations of justice do not apply to
intergenerational relations, because there is a lack of direct
reciprocity between generations of people who are not
contemporaries. Among non-contemporaries, there is no mutual
cooperation and there are no exchanges in kind (see Barry 1989b,
189–203; Barry 1991, 231–234; Heyd 2009a, 167–176;
but see Gosseries 2009, Mazor 2010, and Brandstedt 2015 for
conceptions of indirect and transgenerational reciprocity that do not
require that the initial contributor is among the final
beneficiaries). This fact about the relations between present and
remote past or future generations is closely related to a second
feature of intergenerational relations: the permanent asymmetry in
power-relations between living people and those who will live in the
future.</p>

<p>

First, present generations may be said to exercise power over (remote)
future generations when, for example, they create conditions that make
it costly for future generations to decide against continuing to
pursue present generations’ projects. In this way, present generations
effectively manipulate interests of future generations, and can
successfully achieve the intended result of having their projects
continued. Remote future generations cannot exercise such an influence
on presently living people, and in this sense the power-relation
between present generations and remote future generations is radically
asymmetrical: remote future people do not even have the
<em>potential</em> for exercising such power over presently living
people. Analogously, presently living people cannot exercise influence
over past people (Barry 1977, 243–44; Barry 1989b, 189).</p>

<p>

Second, not only can the present generation influence the conduct of
future people by affecting their desires and circumstances, it can
also exercise power by setting back the interests of future
generations. It can, for example, pursue a natural-resource policy
with long-term negative consequences.  In this case, the present
generation imposes upon future generations the risk of having their
options reduced to an inadequate range—unless, that is, future
generations will have available to them and can afford to use
technologies that allow them to adapt to the circumstances (Barry,
1999; Beckerman, 1999). By contrast, remote future people cannot at
all affect the value of the lives of the presently living, at least
while the latter are alive. Still, such future people might
nevertheless be considered able to set back the interests of or even
wrong present or past persons insofar as the latter have, or had,
interests with respect to posthumous future states of affairs. In the
same way, the presently living may be morally constrained in their
actions that relate to people who lived in the remote past (see
Section 5.3). These power relations are quite different from those
among contemporaries, which are relatively fluid and subject to
change.</p>

<p>

Third, those presently alive can affect the very existence of future
people (whether or not future people will exist), the number of future
people (how many future people will exist), and the identity of future
people (who will exist). In short: future people’s existence,
number, and specific identity depend (are contingent) upon currently
living people’s decisions and actions. A decision taken by
present generations could conceivably result in the termination of
human life; there is a long tradition of institutionalized population
policy whose goal is to control the size of future generations; and,
more prosaically, a couple can certainly decide whether or not to have
children. Furthermore, many of our decisions have indirect effects on
how many people will live and who they are, for many of our decisions
affect who meets whom and who decides to have children with whom. To
explain such “different people choices”, Parfit adopts the
genetic identity view of personal identity: the identity of a person
is at least in part constituted by the DNA the person has as a result
of which ovum was fertilized by this or that spermatozoon in the
creation of this person.  Our actions thus have an effect on the
genetic identity of future people in so far as they affect from which
particular pairs of cells future people will grow—and any action
that affects people’s reproductive choices, directly or
indirectly, will do that. Many of our actions in fact have an indirect
effect on when future people will be conceived. If we decide between
two long-term policies regarding the use of natural resources, for
example, we know that depending on which we choose, different (and
most likely also a different number of) future people will come into
existence. E.g., the finding of the European Commission that more than
one million babies may have been produced as a result of the Erasmus
Programme (the European Community Action Scheme for the Mobility of
University Students, and with more than three million students
participating since 1987), most of who would very likely not have come
to existence without at least one of their parents participating in
the Programme (European Commission 2014, 130–131).</p>

<p>

By contrast, when we make decisions affecting our contemporaries, we
do not face different people choices. Our decisions may affect their
existence only with respect to their survival; their number only with
respect to how many survive; their identity only in the sense that we
might be in a position to change their conditions of life, character,
and self-understanding. Of course, we can affect neither the number
nor the identity of past generations.</p>

<p>

Lastly, our knowledge of the future is limited. While we can know the
particular identities of both previously and presently existing
people, we are normally not in a position to refer to specifically
identifiable future persons. It is not that all predictions about the
future decrease in certainty at some constant rate (see Cowen and
Parfit 1992, 148).  Indeed, many predictions are more likely to be
true concerning the further future than the more immediate future. For
example, the prediction that some policy will have changed or that
certain resources will have been exhausted is more likely to be true
in the further future. Nonetheless, we cannot know the specific
identities of persons in the further future. Our lack of certain
knowledge of the future also means that we often will be in a position
to know at best merely the likelihood of normatively relevant
consequences of alternative long-term policies. The question then is
how to assess the imposition of differing risks of rights violations
(see, e.g., McCarthy 1997; Oberdiek 2012; Perry 2014).</p>

<p>

These differences between our relations to one another and our
relations to subsequent or antecedent generations give rise to a
number of important normative problems. Among them are the following:
The first concerns the normative significance of the non-changeable
fact that remote future people as well as deceased people do not even
have the potential for exercising power over presently living
people. According to the Will Theory, for a person to have a right
vis-à-vis another person requires the former to be able to
exercise his or her rights with respect to the conduct of the latter
(Hart 1955, 183–184; Hart 1982, 183; Wellman 1995, 91–92;
Steiner 1994, 59–73). Thus, the unchangeable power-asymmetry
among non-contemporaries will exclude the possibility of future
non-contemporaries and deceased people being bearers of rights claims
against presently living people (Steiner, 1983; Steiner 1994,
249–61; Fabre 2001; see also Ackerman 1980,
70–75). Consequently, for the proponents of the Will Theory
considerations of justice (as understood in this entry) do not apply
to intergenerational relations. In our following discussions we will
assume with the proponents of the Interest Theory of Rights (Raz 1984;
Raz 1986, 166–188; Raz 1994, 45–51; Kramer 1998,
60–101) that being able to exercise one’s rights—to
demand or waive the enforcement of a right—is neither sufficient
nor necessary for someone to be the bearer of the right. According to
the Interest Theory for a person actually to hold a right, the right,
when actual, necessarily preserves one or more of the persons’
interests (Kramer, 1998, 62). In terms of the understanding of justice
that the entry presupposes, we will assume that for a person to have a
valid justice claim vis-à-vis another person (who stands under
the correlative duties) does not depend upon being able to harm or
benefit the other person (Barry 1989b, chs. 4–6; Buchanan, 1990;
but see Gauthier 1986; Heyd 2009a; Hiskes 2009, 9). The entry as a
whole will explore the validity of justice considerations for the
normative assessment of various aspects of intergenerational
relations.</p>

<p>The second problem concerns the normative significance of the
contingency of future people upon currently living people’s
decisions and actions. If and insofar as the existence, identity, or
number of future people depend upon present decisions and actions, to
what extent can the former be said to be harmed by the latter?
Furthermore, can presently existing persons, in making such decisions,
be guided by the interests of future persons?  These are the questions
that underlie the so-called ‘Non-Identity-Problem’ (see
Sections 3 and 4).</p>

<p>Third, our limited knowledge of the future also means that we often
will be in a position to know at best merely the likelihood of
normatively relevant consequences of alternative long-term
policies. How should we relate to people who will live in the future
under conditions of risk and uncertainty? As we know at best merely
the likelihood of the differing consequences of alternative policies,
how should we assess the imposition of differing risks on and the
likely or uncertain provision of benefits for future
people?.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#2" name="note-2">2</a>]</sup>
Fourth, is it possible for us to harm past people, and do we have
duties toward them? (See Section 5). Fifth, what motivation could we
have for fulfilling our duties to future people, given that we know
neither their individual identities nor their particular
preferences?<sup>[<a href="notes.html#3" name="note-3">3</a>]</sup></p>

<p>
The entry will focus on the second and fourth problems as they are
centrally important for understanding the very possibility of
intergenerational justice. In discussing these questions we need to be
clear who (or what) can count. According to the so-called
person-affecting view, an act can be wrong only if that act harms, or
will harm or can be expected to harm, a person who does or will exist
(see especially Parfit 1984, 363, 295–396; Heyd 1992 and 2014,
2–3; Boonin 2008; Roberts 2013). In the context of
intergenerational justice, we assess how a future person is affected
by currently living people’s actions and in particular when
these actions are among the necessary conditions for future
people’s very existence, identity and number. The entry
investigates whether duties of intergenerational justice can be
understood on the basis of what might be called a weak
person-affecting view: Answers to the questions of whether a future
person will be harmed or wronged by having been brought into existence
under certain conditions may rely neither on a comparison with the
state the person would have been in had she not been brought into
existence, that is with the person’s never-ever existing, nor on
a comparison with how well off other people would have been had
currently living people acted differently. Never-ever existing and
potentially existing people do not count; only those people who
actually exist at some time count.</p>

<p>

This weak person-affecting view stands in contrast to a strong
person-affecting view according to which an act or action harms a
person only if the same person is worse off than she would otherwise
at that time have been. Both the weak and the strong person-affecting
views differ from impersonal views according to which the value of
states of affairs is not reducible to their effect on the interests of
actual people. Currently living people ought to choose to bring about
the state of affairs in which more of the morally relevant values will
be realized irrespective of who the people are who will live. Many
theorists claim that a plausible understanding of intergenerational
ethics must be impersonal or must combine person-affecting and
impersonal considerations (see especially Harris 1992, 94–95;
Singer 1998; Buchanan et al. 2000, 249; Harman 2004, 101–102;
McBrayer 2008, 304; Holtug 2009, 71–92; McMahan 2009,
49–68; Temkin 2012, 313–362; Williams and Harris 2014,
347; Heyd’s interpretation of Parfit 2011 in Heyd 2014). The
differences between the person-affecting and impersonal understandings
will come to the fore in Sections 2.2 and 3 on intergenerational
duties that reflect what is owed to future people as a matter of
justice as well as in Section 4.5 on the limits of a rights-based
account of intergenerational ethics.</p>

<p>

This entry discusses and defends an interpretation of
intergenerational justice that can be characterized by the following
two sets of claims. First, with respect to the relation between
currently living people and future people the following propositions
are discussed (Sections 2–4): The dependency (or contingency) of the
number and specific identity of future people upon our decisions does
not matter where the question is our potentially harming future
people’s interests and violating their rights; considerations of
justice, namely the welfare rights claims of future people
vis-à-vis currently living people can guide us in choosing
among long-term policies; such considerations can also guide
prospective parents in deciding whether they ought to revise their
decision to conceive out of regard for the children they would thereby
beget (Sections 2–3); intergenerational justice will reflect, at least
in part, a sufficientarian conception of justice (Section 4); important concerns
for future generations many people share cannot be understood as
duties of justice vis-à-vis future people; rather they
are based on an understanding of the ethical significance of
seeing ourselves as members of a transgenerational polity and
community (Section 4.5).</p>

<p>

Second, with respect to the relations between currently living people
and past people we will investigate the following claims (Section 5):
Currently living people can be understood to be negatively affected by
historical injustices even if these injustices are among the necessary
conditions of their very existence and identity; assuming that the
supersession of injustice is possible we will need to investigate
whether and to what extent it has occurred in any given case; even if
we held the view that the non-identity-problem excluded the
possibility of currently living people being indirect victims of past
injustice or that the historical injustice under consideration has
been superseded, currently living people can stand under surviving
duties to deceased victims owing to the wrongs committed against them
(by others) in the past.  </p>

<h2><a name="RigFutPeoVisVisPreLivPeo">2. Rights of Future People vis-à-vis Presently Living People</a></h2>

<p>

On a person-affecting view, future people count if, and insofar as,
they have interests, just claims, or rights vis-à-vis currently
living people. Some philosophers deny that this can ever be the
case. In addition to an argument reflecting the
‘Non-Identity-Problem’ we can distinguish at least four
further arguments in support of the denial of the possibility of
future people having rights vis-à-vis us. The first argument is
based on the fact that future people will live in the future.
According to the second argument, for future people to have rights
vis-à-vis us we would have to ascribe a right to existence to
them. Third, our epistemic situation does not allow us to relate to
future people as individuals. And in Section 1 we also investigate a
fourth argument according to which future people cannot be said to
have rights vis-à-vis currently living people since they cannot
claim these rights against them and, a fortiori, cannot impose
sanctions on currently living people for non-fulfillment of their
corresponding duties. As will be shown, this argument presupposes what
is a clearly contentious claim about the necessary conditions for
being the bearer of a right.</p>

<p>


We hope to remove these skeptical doubts before turning to a
discussion of the relevance of the contingency of future
people—the subject that, under the title of the
‘Non-Identity-Problem’ has been at the core of much of the
philosophical inquiry into the foundations of intergenerational
justice (Sections 3–4.3). We will introduce that core issue by
addressing a specific criticism of the person-affecting view in the
context of intergenerational justice (Section 2.2): Some have argued
that a person-affecting view cannot account for the widely held belief
that persons have the right not to be brought into existence if the
person-to-be would not reach a sufficiently good (or decent) level of
well-being.</p>

<h3><a name="DouAboPosFutPeoHavRig">2.1 Doubts about the Possibility of Future People Having Rights</a></h3>

<p>

First, some philosophers have denied that future people can have
rights (or just claims), based simply on the fact that they will live
in the future. Consider the following claim: “Future generations
by definition do not exist now. They cannot now, therefore, be the
present bearer or subject of anything, including rights” (De
George 1981, 161; see also Macklin 1981, 151–52; Beckerman and
Pasek 2001, 14–23; Herstein 2009, 1180–82). Claiming that
we can violate the rights of future people now does not, however,
imply that future people have rights now (though see Partridge 1990,
54–55, who suggests that future people have rights in the
present).  That implication would hold only if it were conceded that
presently existing rights alone constrain present action. But we can
safely assume, first, that future people will be bearers of rights in
the future, second, that the rights they have will be determined by
the interests they have then, and third, that our present actions and
policies can affect their interests. If we can violate a
person’s rights by frustrating her interests severely, and if we
can so severely frustrate such interests of future people, we can
violate their future rights (see Hoerster 1991, 98–102). Their
future existence itself is thus insufficient to ground the claim that
we cannot now violate the rights of future persons.</p>

<p>
Second, we are not committed to the claim that if we are able now to
violate the rights of future generations, it is their rights to
<em>existence</em> that we violate. Since it is implausible that
<em>anyone</em> has a right to existence as such, it is implausible
that future persons have rights to existence. Furthermore, when we
prevent someone’s existence, we do not thereby harm the hypothetical
interests of this potential subject. Thus, claiming that actual future
people have rights vis-à-vis currently living people now cannot
commit us to claiming that possible future people have a right to
existence.</p>

<p>

Are our present actions nonetheless constrained by rights of future
generations that are based on interests other than existence as such,
interests such as subsistence, etc.? This is possible only if
attributing rights to people does not require us to make reference to
individual persons (Herstein 2009, 1180–82). However, third,
lack of particular knowledge of future people as individuals does not
stand in the way of attributing to them welfare rights, such as a
right to
 subsistence.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#4" name="note-4">4</a>]</sup></p> 

<p>
 When we consider which natural-resource policy presently living
people ought to adopt, we cannot possibly be guided by obligations to
concrete (genetically identifiable) people living in the (remote)
future. From this fact, however, it does not follow that we have no
obligations to future people. All that follows is that such
obligations do not depend on the <em>particular</em> identity of
future persons. Rather, such obligations would be grounded in the fact
that future persons are human beings; that is, they share those
properties of being human that permit and require us to relate morally
to them as fellow humans. In evaluating a natural-resource policy, we
can safely assume that future people will exist to whom we owe
obligations as human beings—for example, the obligation to
protect their interests in having the means of subsistence. We may
also be able to predict with some accuracy the effects of our present
actions on future generations’ means of subsistence. Thus, if we
decide to deplete rather than conserve resources, this will in all
likelihood have adverse impacts on future people’s rights to
subsistence (to life, health, food, water and housing), to development
and self-determination. In other words, the in principle avoidable
consequences of a policy of depletion (IPCC 2014, 10–17) impose
heavy risks on future people by significantly increasing the
likelihood of very many future people’s basic human rights being
violated (see, e.g., Caney, 2010). If there are rights to subsistence,
development and self-determination based on humanity alone, then,
those people who will exist under our policies of depletion are more
likely than those who will exist under our policies of conservation to
have such rights violated (assuming here the number of future people
being constant). This would be a rights-based consideration for not
choosing a policy of depletion. As will be shown in Section 3, the
claim that rights considerations can guide us in choosing among
policies or actions that have an impact on the composition of the
future human population relies upon a notion of harm that does not
depend upon a comparison of the state of the supposedly harmed person
to a counterfactual state of this person had the harmful action not
occurred.</p>

<h3><a name="RigNonExi">2.2 A Right to Non-Existence?</a></h3>

<p>

Can prospective children be said to have an interest that their
parents not act in a way likely to lead to their birth when the
parents are in a position to know that the life of the child, should
it be born, would fall below some relevant threshold of well-being?
(On the significance of the notion of a threshold level of well-being,
see below, Sections 3 and 4). John Stuart Mill endorses the idea of a
procreational duty not to bring a person into existence unless the
person will have “at least the ordinary chances of a desirable
existence” (see Mill 1859, 301–304). It is a widely held
belief that under certain circumstances prospective parents should
refrain from procreating owing to the predicted plight of the would-be
child. Antinatalists hold that these conditions hold generally (see,
e.g., Schopenhauer, 1851, vol. 2, ch. xii, § 149; Cioran, 1978,
117; Horstmann, 1983, 99–101). More recently, e.g., David
Benatar (2006, esp. ch. 2) has argued that the birth of a new person
always entails nontrivial harm to that person, and therefore we ought
to refrain from procreating.</p>

<p>

Since the publication of Narveson’s seminal paper
“Utilitarianism and New Generations” (Narveson 1967; see
also Narveson 1973), many have contributed to the debate on whether a
person-affecting approach can account for the asymmetry of our
procreational duties (Parfit 1976; Feinberg 1984, 101, and 1986;
Mulgan 2006, ch. 6; Rivera-López 2009). The claimed asymmetry
is the following: while prospective parents have no obligation to
procreate out of regard for the interests of possible future children,
they have an obligation not to beget children who are going to be
miserable.</p>

<p>

Some have argued that belief in such an asymmetry is incompatible with
a person-affecting view and, more particularly, with the claim that
possible people cannot be said to have, against us, a right to
 existence.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#5" name="note-5">5</a>]</sup>
 It is helpful at this point to make a distinction between the
reasoning of potential parents that involves a <em>possible</em>
future child and reasoning that involves <em>their</em> future child
(see Govier 1979, 111).  For instance, in deciding not to procreate at
all people do not thereby harm the children they could have brought
into existence (see Section 2.1) since these are merely possible
individuals. Thus, much reasoning about whether or not to have a child
should concern the interests of those already alive; it is actual
people’s lives that would be affected by whether or not the child
comes into existence (see Heyd 1992, 96–97; Roberts 2009, sec. 2). 
Nonetheless, people might
make choices about procreation based on the welfare of their future
child; that is, the welfare of that as yet non-existent individual
would feature in their reasoning. When prospective parents decide in
favor of having a child and now learn that this child, if born,
would have a life that falls below a certain threshold of well-being
they ought to consider the effects of their actions on <em>their child</em>
and might well decide not to have a child after
 all.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#6" name="note-6">6</a>]</sup></p>

<p>
 Objections to the asymmetry view presented above concern, in
particular, the claim that after having made a decision to have
children, prospective parents should revise their decision out of
regard for their would-be child(ren) when they learn that the
prospective child(ren) would have a life that falls below the relevant
threshold. Why, under these circumstances, should parents revise their
decision to have children out of regard for the children? The reason
is that they would harm the would-be child, and, thus,
 arguably,<sup>[<a href="notes.html#7" name="note-7">7</a>]</sup>
 would act wrongly toward it. Here, harming their child-to-be would
inflict a wrong on it. When prospective parents learn that their child
would have a life that falls below the relevant threshold, they should
refrain from having it, for by bringing the child into existence they
would cause harm to it. In bringing about a child’s existence they can
harm this child.</p>

<p>

This claim has been said to be incompatible with a person-affecting
view (see Heyd 1992, 102, 105–06, 241–42).  In Section 3,
two notions of harm will be distinguished. The first relies on
comparing a person’s actual state to a counterfactual (or
historical) state of the same person. The second relies on no such
comparison. Both notions of harm require us to ask: for whom is the
action worse?  However, while both notions can be understood to
reflect the person-affecting view as specified above (Section 1), only
the first fulfills the stronger conditions of Parfit’s
“two-state requirement” or
“better-or-worse-for-the-same-person” requirement:
“we benefit or harm someone only if we cause him to be better or
worse off than he would otherwise at that time have been”
(Parfit 1984, 487).  The contingency of future people will often mean
that the same person could not or is not likely to have come into
existence as a result of two alternative acts or actions (see below
Section 3.1). As will be shown in Section 3.2 below, in applying the
second notion, we do not have to compare the value of life below some
threshold with nonexistence (or with how well off another person or
other people would have been) in order to be able to claim that we can
cause harm to a person by bringing about that person’s
existence.  </p>

<p>

Assuming that the person can be considered harmed, why was the person
wronged by having been brought into existence if the person has a life
worth living? If we specify the threshold in terms of rights we might
think that the person would waive whatever right was violated by
having been brought into existence as the person can be assumed to
much prefer living to never-ever-coming into existence. Then we might
believe that bringing into existence a person whose life is worth
living, but below the threshold, is a case of wrongless harm-doing if
we consider the issue in person-affecting terms (see Harris 1992,
94–96; Williams and Harris 2014, 347–348).
</p>

<p>
The assumed fact that the person would waive her right clearly does
not settle the matter of whether she was wronged by having been
brought into existence (Harman 2004, 89–101; Liberto 2014,
79–80). A person can have a legitimate complaint about having
been brought into existence although she does not wish that the action
had not occurred, although she (the same person) could not be in the
state of not having been wronged (but see Heyd 2014, 4–5), and
even though she enjoys a life worth living.
</p>

<p>
The claim that bringing into existence a person in a harmed state
according to a certain threshold is wrongful implies that this person
is worse off than she ought to be. That the person will have a life
worth living is not a sufficient reason to render permissible bringing
the person into existence and in a harmed sub-threshold state. The
ground for this reason does not rely on a comparison with how well off
the person or other people would be if we refrain from bringing the
person into existence or acted differently (but see Harman 2004,
101–102; McBrayer 2008, 304; Woollard 2012). The reason
understood in person-affecting terms does not reflect the view that
the person would be better off if he or she would never ever come to
existence or the view that we should bring into existence another
person whose life is above the threshold or the view that we should
maximize the number of people with lives above the threshold. Rather,
if we have a choice between bringing into existence a person with a
life worth living, but below the threshold, and bringing into
existence a person with a life worth living at or above the threshold,
the reason speaks against doing the former but not in favor of doing
the latter.
</p>

<p>
Let us note that one can also defend the asymmetry of our
procreational duties from an impersonal view, according to which the
value of states of affairs is not reducible to how these states affect
the interests of people. From an impersonal view one does not have to
claim that prospective parents should refrain from procreation <em>out
of regard for the children they would have</em>. Based on this view,
two alternative interpretations of the asymmetry of our procreational
duties have been discussed in the literature. One could adopt a
version of negative consequentialism and argue that the universe would
be better if present generations were guided by a criterion of right
action that requires them to give priority to the prevention of
suffering over the creation of good and happiness (see Heyd 1992,
59–60, for problems with this account).  Alternatively, an impersonal
approach could argue that we have a <em>prima facie</em> duty to
promote over-all happiness by creating new well off 
people—which duty, however, may be more easily overridden than duties not to
cause harm. The paradoxical implications of the latter view have been
prominently explored by Derek
 Parfit.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#8" name="note-8">8</a>]</sup></p>

<h2><a name="NoRigDueConFutPeoUpoOurDec">3. No Rights Due to Contingency of Future People Upon Our Decisions?</a></h2>

<p>
 The main source of skepticism concerning the very possibility of
future people having welfare rights vis-à-vis those currently
living rests upon the contingency of future people upon currently
living people’s decisions and actions. We know, of course, that when
we harm future people’s interests and violate their rights, specific
persons are harmed. But the decision we take counts as a necessary
condition of the very existence of this genetically and numerically
specific set of people at some future point in time. The so-called
‘Non-Identity-Problem’ presupposes this fact and
interprets it as a challenge to the very possibility of
intergenerational justice.</p>

<h3><a name="ResNonIdePro">3.1 Responses to the ‘Non-Identity-Problem’</a></h3>

<p>
 Consider a policy of making intensive and extensive use of
exhaustible resources for the aim of increasing the welfare of
currently living people. If the policy is criticized for harming
future people on the ground that this policy will predictably worsen
their conditions of life and thus is likely to violate their welfare
rights, a defender of the policy could reply by saying: many, if not
all<sup>[<a href="notes.html#9" name="note-9">9</a>]</sup> of our
actions have (indirect) effects not only on the conditions of life,
but also on the composition of future persons, that is, on the number,
existence, and identity of future persons. This is also true for
actions that allegedly harm future persons. If the non-performance of
the allegedly harmful action would have resulted in the allegedly
harmed person not coming into existence, then that person cannot be
said to have been harmed by this action—or, at any rate,
according to the common understanding of harm (see Meyer 2003,
147–49, 155–58, for a detailed discussion).</p>

<p>

The common understanding is informed by a diachronic notion of
harm and a notion that requires a subjunctive comparison with
a historical baseline (hereinafter subjunctive-historical
notion of
 harm).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#10" name="note-10">10</a>]</sup>
 Both the diachronic and the subjunctive-historical notions of
harm require that the existence of the harmed person or people qua
individuals is independent of the harming act or policy. On the
diachronic notion of harm the following
formula holds:</p>

<blockquote>(I) (diachronic) An action (or
 inaction)<sup>[<a href="notes.html#11" name="note-11">11</a>]</sup>
 at time <em>t</em><sub>1</sub> harms someone only if the agent causes
(allows) this person to be worse off at some later time
 <em>t</em><sub>2</sub><sup>[<a href="notes.html#12" name="note-12">12</a>]</sup>
 than the person was before <em>t</em><sub>1</sub>.</blockquote>

<p>

On the subjunctive-historical notion of harm, the corresponding necessary condition for harming is:</p>

<blockquote>(II) (subjunctive-historical) An action (or inaction) at
time <em>t</em><sub>1</sub> harms someone only if the agent causes
(or allows) this person to be worse off at some later time
<em>t</em><sub>2</sub> than the person would have been at
<em>t</em><sub>2</sub> had the agent not interacted with (or acted
with respect to) this person at
 all.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#13" name="note-13">13</a>]</sup></blockquote>

<p>

When considering future individuals as possible individuals both the
diachronic and the subjunctive-historical notions of harm will
exclude the possibility of present people harming future people, for the
(future) people whose interests and rights they are required to
respect are not in a particular state of well-being at the time they
take their decision—they do not, at that time, exist. But according
to (I) unless we can claim that the person is in a particular state of
well-being at the time of our decision, that is, at
<em>t</em><sub>1</sub>, we cannot say that the person is worse off at
<em>t</em><sub>2</sub> owing to our decision at
<em>t</em><sub>1</sub>. And likewise with (II): unless we can claim
that there is a specific person who would have been better off at
<em>t</em><sub>2</sub> than this person actually is at
<em>t</em><sub>2</sub> had we not acted with respect to this person at
all, this notion of harm makes no sense.</p>

<p>

Adopting either the diachronic or the subjunctive-historical
notions of harm excludes the possibility of our harming future
people when we choose among long-term policies with significantly
differing consequences for the quality of life of future people. With
respect to persons whose existence is dependent upon the allegedly
harming action, they cannot be worse (or, indeed, better) off owing to this action than
they would have been had this action not been carried out. For in that
case, they would not have existed.</p>

<p>

We can distinguish four main responses to the
‘Non-Identity-Problem’ so understood (compare Boonin 2008,
134 ff; Page 2008; Heyd 2009b; Roberts 2013; Wrigley 2012, 178):
First, some philosophers hold the view that future people whose
existence depends upon currently living people’s actions cannot
have rights vis-à-vis the latter people’s actions (see
Schwartz 1978; cf. Adams 1979; Kavka 1982; Parfit 1984, part iv;
Boonin 2008; Roberts 2009).  Second, others argue that currently
living people can violate the rights of future people even if the
former cannot harm the latter (see Kumar 2003). If so, future people
cannot have welfare rights vis-à-vis currently living people
insofar as violating welfare rights implies setting back or harming
the interests of the right holders. Third, we can attempt to limit the
practical significance of the non-identity-problem by limiting the
relevant actions to those that are not only likely but indeed
necessary conditions of the existence of the concerned
person.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#14" name="note-14">14</a>]</sup></p>

<p>

Finally, some have sought to circumvent the non-identity problem by
suggesting an alternative notion of harm that is unaffected by the
non-identity-problem, the so-called ‘Threshold Conception of
Harm’ (Hanser 1990, 2009; McMahan 1998; Shiffrin 1999; Meyer
2003, 2009; Harman 2004, 2009; Rivera-López 2009). The response
to the ‘Non-Identity-Problem’ based on the threshold
conception is relevantly different from other responses (such as those
criticized by Heyd in 2009b). The threshold response can be understood
to be person-affecting in the weak sense (see Section 1 above): While
the person being harmed according to the threshold notion does not
imply that the same person is worse off than she would have otherwise
been at that time, it does imply that this person is worse off than
she ought to be. We owe it to the person when she will have come to
existence that she is not in a harmed state (see Section 2.2
above). Such an understanding is relevantly different from an
impersonal understanding according to which the universe is a better
place when it does not include people in a harmed state as judged by
the threshold Notion (but see Wrigley 2012, 178).</p>

<p>
The threshold notion substitutes the necessary condition:</p>

<blockquote>(III) (threshold) An action (or inaction) at
time <em>t</em><sub>1</sub> harms a person only if the agent thereby
causes (allows) either the coming into existence of this person in a
sub-threshold state or the already existing person to be in a
sub-threshold state; further, only if this person would not be in the
harmed state had the agent not interacted with (or acted with respect
to) this person at all; and furthermore, only if the agent, if he
cannot avoid causing harm in this sense, does not minimize the
harm.</blockquote>

<p>
 According to such a threshold notion of harm an action harms a person
only if, as a consequence of that action, the (then existing) person
falls below a normatively defined threshold (see McMahan 1998,
223–29; Shiffrin 1999). This threshold notion is unaffected by
the non-identity-problem, for here the finding of harm does not
require that the person who is in the sub-threshold state would be in
a better state in the situation that would have obtained in the
absence of the harming action. Thus, future people can be said to be
harmed by currently living people’s actions even if these
actions are among the necessary conditions of the existence, identity
or number of future people. Such a notion of harm limits the practical
significance of the non-identity-problem to different degrees
depending upon how the threshold is substantially defined (see Section
4 below).</p>

<p>

Both of the claims discussed above (in Sections 1 and 2, passim),
namely,</p>

<blockquote>
 <p>
 first, that considerations reflecting the welfare rights of future
people vis-à-vis present people can guide the latter in
choosing among long-term policies, and</p>

<p>
 second, that considerations of the rights of people not to be brought
into existence if they are likely not to realise a certain level of
well-being can guide prospective parents in deciding not to conceive out of regard for the
children they would otherwise have,</p> </blockquote>

 

<p>
 can be read as relying upon a threshold notion of harm.</p>

<p>
 Adopting either the diachronic or the subjunctive-historical
notions of harm or both excludes the possibility of our harming future
people when we choose among long-term policies with significantly
differing consequences for the quality of life of future people. But
if we adopt the threshold notion of harm at (III), future
people can be said to be wronged by our choice of a policy that harms
them, notwithstanding the fact that the existence of the specific
people who are said to be harmed is causally dependent on our decision
to pursue this
 policy.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#15" name="note-15">15</a>]</sup></p>

<h3><a name="HarFutPerBriPerExi">3.2 Harming a Future Person by Bringing the Person Into Existence</a></h3>

<p>

The threshold notion of harm is also crucial for understanding
the second claim at issue. The three notions of harm as distinguished
above (Section 3.1) can be shown to have differing presuppositions when
they are used to explicate the claim that by bringing about the
existence of a child we can cause harm to this child. Consider the
following claims:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
 (a) A living person can be worse off than that person was
before she was conceived. </p>

<p>

(b) Any life lived by a human being is commensurable with
non-existence.</p>

<p>

(c) We can say of a person that she did not exist before her
conception.</p>

<p>

(d) We can lay out a general standard of well-being so that we
violate a duty to a person when we cause this person to fall below the
standard specified, or when we fail to cause this person to reach the
standard.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>

In shorthand form, the situation is this: Depending on which notion
of harm is used, the claim that parents have harmed their child by
bringing it into existence presupposes a different set of assumptions
((a)-(d)): as explained below, notion (I) commits us to (a), (b), (c);
notion (II) commits us to (b) and (c); and notion (III) commits us to
(c) and (d). Propositions (a) and (b) will be shown to be, at very
least, implausible. Given that it is only the third notion of harm that,
when applied to procreative decisions, does not presuppose either (a)
or (b), this notion seems more apt for explicating the claim that we
can cause harm to a child by bringing about the existence of this
child.</p>

<p>

All three notions presuppose assumption (c). Claiming that a person
harms another person by bringing about this person’s existence
presupposes that bringing about someone’s existence is something that
happens to this person at the time the person comes into existence.
</p>

<p>

When used to explicate the claim that we can cause harm to a
person by bringing that person into existence, (I) presupposes
assumption (a). But attributing a state of well-being to an egg cell
before its fertilization by a sperm does not seem to make sense. In
this case, however, (I) is inapplicable in the context in
question.</p>

<p>

(II) presupposes (b). In claiming that, by bringing about a person’s
existence, we thereby cause that person to be worse off than he or she
would otherwise have been at that time—if , that is, the
person had never come into existence—we are relying on the
possibility of making an intrapersonal comparison between the values
of nonexistence (in the sense of “never
 existing”<sup>[<a href="notes.html#16" name="note-16">16</a>]</sup>)
 and a person’s life. However, from a person-affecting view such
 a comparison is difficult if not impossible as David Heyd has pointed out:
“the comparison between life and nonexistence is blocked by two
considerations: the valuelessness of nonexistence as such and the
unattributability of its alleged value to individual subjects. The two
considerations are intimately connected: one of the reasons for
denying value to nonexistence <em>of</em> people is the very fact that
it cannot be attached <em>to</em> people.” (Heyd 1992, 37,
113). While a person can retrospectively prefer not to have been
brought into existence, it does not follow that this person would have
been better off had she never been brought into existence (but see
Roberts 1998, 151, and Meacham 2012, 262, assigning zero-value to
never having existed (for discussion see Broome 1999, Parsons 2002,
Arrhenius 2003, and Holtug 2004).  To be sure, as we noted above, we
can attribute to an existing person the state “nonexistence
before conception” just as we can attribute the state of
“having ceased to exist” to this person. This does not
mean, however, that never existing at all is of (dis)value for that
person.</p>

<p>

In this respect, death seems to be different from never existing at
all. Life can be understood as an ongoing project that consists of
more particular projects that are defined in part by goals and whose
completion requires time (see Nagel 1979, 8–9; for discussion
see Scheffler 2013, Lecture 3). If a person’s life is cut short,
this can be contrary to this person’s interests. Through death,
the person is hindered from bringing his or her projects to
fruition. As far as carrying out these projects is concerned, there
may not be anyone else in a position to take this person’s
place. Saying this does not require us to compare the value of the
state of being dead to the value of continuing to exist for the
person. Rather the “question is whether had one not died, had
one lived longer, one’s survival would have been good for
one” (Raz 2001, 85; see McMahan 2002, part 2). On the other
hand, the fact that my pursuing certain projects makes my life worth
living for me does not mean that it would necessarily have been
undesirable for me not to have ever been given the chance to form the
idea of any meaningful projects, namely, by having never been brought
into existence at all. “Never existing” is of (dis)value
for no one.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#17" name="note-17">17</a>]</sup></p>

<p>

Harm (III) relies on the idea that we have a general duty to people
not to cause them to be worse off than they should be. We can
cause—by our actions and omissions—a person to be worse
off than <em>that</em> person is entitled to be. This notion of harm
relies on, <em>inter alia</em>, our being able to specify a standard
of what any person is entitled to (d). In claiming that people should
refrain from having children out of regard for the children, when the
children can be expected to have a life that falls below the relevant
threshold, we rely on our being able to define what it means to be in
a state below the relevant threshold and to judge when lives are in
that state. If we make these assumptions, we can then use this notion
of harm to explicate the claim “by bringing a person into
existence we can cause harm to this person” without having to
confront the peculiar ethical difficulties discussed in the previous
paragraphs. In applying this notion of harm, we compare the values of
“having a sufficiently good life” and “having a life
that falls below the relevant threshold”. Comparing these values
does not present special difficulties either intrapersonally or
interpersonally.</p>

<p>

Harming a person by bringing about his existence is clearly a
special case. When applied to this case, same-person-comparative
notions of harm (of which I and II are species) presuppose one or
both of (a) and (b), which were found to be dubious, if not
 mistaken.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#18" name="note-18">18</a>]</sup>
Now, at the time prospective parents consider whether they should
revise their decision to bring about the existence of a child, there
is no right bearer of the right not to be brought into existence in a
harmed sub-threshold state (or of the so-called right to
non-existence). But according to (III) this does not mean that the
parents could not act in light of an interest on the part of their
would-be child in never existing at all: if the child were to be born,
it would have a life below the relevant threshold. The subject of harm
is the person when she is brought into existence in a harmed
state. That she would not be worse or better off than she otherwise
would have been is irrelevant for determining that she is or will be
in a harmed sub-threshold state.</p>

<p>

In the circumstances in which bringing about the existence of a
person causes harm to this person in the sense specified, the right to
non-existence is violated when, quite simply, the existence of the
person is brought about. The only way, here, in which the prospective
parents can avoid violation of the right is by ensuring that the person
whose right it would be does not come into existence at all. Thus, the
only way in which the prospective parents can respect the right is by
excluding the possibility that the right ever becomes actual.</p>

<p>

To be sure, the supposed right to non-existence is open to the
objection that the person cannot be considered wronged by having been
brought into existence when the person is in a harmed sub-threshold
state and has a life worth living (for discussion of the objection see
Section 2.2 above). Often the reasons reflecting the right to
non-existence are not likely to be decisive for our procreational
choices or choices between population policies. If we have a choice
between bringing into existence a person with a life worth living, but
below the threshold, and bringing into existence a person with a life
worth living at or above the threshold, the reasons reflecting the
right to non-existence speaks against doing the former but not in
favor of doing the latter. If we have to choose between two policies,
both of which will lead to future sub-threshold lives, there is a host
of further questions such as whether the reasons can differ in
strength depending on the particular state the person is in (assessed
in terms of, e.g., how many of her basic rights she cannot or will not
be able to realize) and depending on the number of persons whose
rights to non-existence are violated (see Section 3.3 below).</p>

<p>
We do not have to think of the right to non-existence as an absolute
constraint on either people’s procreational choices or policy
choices that affect the composition of a future population. Rather,
the right to non-existence is to be taken into account in the
comparative consequential evaluation of such options (cf. Sen
1982). The right to non-existence is not likely to be the only right
to be taken into account when we choose between population
policies. Thus, that a policy will lead to future sub-threshold lives
is not by itself likely to make the policy morally prohibited.</p>

<h3><a name="OugWeBriExiBesPeo">3.3 Ought We to Bring into Existence the Best People?</a></h3>

<p>

Harm (III) does not support the claim that if a possible person were
to have a sufficiently good life, but a different person could instead
be brought into existence who would have an even better life, there is
an obligation to bring into existence the second, rather than the
first, child; nor does (III) support the analogous claim on the level
of collective decision-making: present generations have no obligation
to bring into existence only those whose lives, among possible future
persons, would be optimal.</p>

<p>

To illustrate this, consider the following
 example:<sup>[<a href="notes.html#19" name="note-19">19</a>]</sup>
 A woman knows that if she conceives a baby now, because of a
particular disease she has, the child will have a particular slight
handicap, but will enjoy a life above the relevant threshold of
well-being—assuming that any marginally disabling condition will
not bring a life below the relevant threshold (but see Harris 1992,
88–89). Fortunately, there is a treatment against this disease
that is such that, afterwards, the woman will be able to conceive a
perfectly healthy child. The treatment takes three months. There is,
thus, no way this <em>particular</em> child can be born without having
this handicap. Can the woman be said to owe it to her child to
postpone conceiving a child until after she has been treated for the
disease?  According to the view outlined here, she cannot be said to
owe this to her child so that she will not harm the child (Woodward
1986, 815, fn. 12; Woodward 1987, 808–09).  She might have good
reasons to receive the medical treatment and conceive later, however.
These reasons will reflect the interests of her and her partner, as
well as the interests of other present and future people (cf. Section
2.2) Such interests could be important enough to give rise to an
obligation on the part of the parents. Then we can have obligations
not to bring into existence persons whose lives, although still above
the decency threshold, are less worth living than the lives of others
we could bring into existence in different circumstances, but these
obligations are not grounded on considerations of harm to the future
children in question—assuming here and in the following
discussion that we can meaningfully carry out the relevant
calculations and weighings.</p>

<p>

To support the claim that parents <em>do</em> owe it to their
prospective child to bring into existence the possible child who,
among the options available to them, enjoys the highest level of
well-being, we will have to rely on a different notion of 
harm—namely a notion of harm which is based upon the comparison of the
state of a person to the counterfactual state of another person who
could have been brought into existence instead of him:</p>

<blockquote>(subjunctive-different-person) Having brought about a
person’s existence at a time <em>t</em><sub>1</sub>, the agent thereby
harms someone only if the agent causes this person to be worse off at
some later time <em>t</em><sub>2</sub> (see note 12) than another
person—whose existence the agent could have brought about
instead—would have been at <em>t</em><sub>2</sub> had the
agent acted
 differently.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#20" name="note-20">20</a>]</sup></blockquote>

<p>

Prospective parents might bring about more or less people (one child,
twins, triplets etc.) depending upon their decisions. Decisions
concerning long-term policies are likely to have an impact on the size
of the future population (see Section 2). Thus at least when we wish to
support an analogous claim at the collective level, we will
have to allow for different numbers also:</p>

<blockquote>(subjunctive-different-persons) Having brought about a
person’s existence at a time <em>t</em><sub>1</sub>, the agent
thereby harms someone only if the agent causes this person to be worse
off at some later time <em>t</em><sub>2</sub> (see note 12) than other
persons—whose existence the agent could have brought about
instead—would have been at <em>t</em><sub>2</sub> (on average or
individually in absolute terms) had the agent acted
differently.</blockquote>

<p>

If we follow the subjunctive-different-person(s) notion of
harm, a person whose quality of life is above the relevant threshold
of well-being will be considered harmed if there is a possible state
of affairs in which this person would not have existed but another
person or other persons would have existed and the latter person or
persons would have realized an even higher quality of life (on
average or individually in absolute terms). But
according to the person-affecting approach and from the perspective of
the allegedly harmed person, the comparison of the life of this person
and the counterfactual state of affairs in which this person could
never have existed but another person or other persons would exist
does not make sense. We cannot attribute the alleged value of
non-existence to individual
 subjects.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#21" name="note-21">21</a>]</sup></p>

<p>

In summary: It is at the very least difficult (if not impossible) to
understand why a person should be considered harmed if the person can
be considered harmed according to neither the subjunctive-historical
(II) nor the diachronic (I) nor the threshold (III)
notions of
 harm.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#22" name="note-22">22</a>]</sup>
 This is not to say that we cannot have person-affecting reasons to
prefer a future of people who have lives far above the relevant
threshold of well-being to a future of people whose lives are less
good but sufficiently good, points to which we shall return (see Section
4.5 below). We next turn to the question how we should understand 
the notions of harm (I-III) as distinguished in light of the so-called ‘No-Difference
View’.</p>

<h3><a name="DerParNoDifVieComVieHar">3.4 Derek Parfit’s No-Difference View and the Disjunctive Notion of Harm</a></h3>

<p>

Derek Parfit has introduced the ‘No-Difference View’: It
makes no (practical or theoretical) difference to how we should act,
all things considered, whether the size and composition of future
generations depend upon our present decision. To what extent we can
defend that view will depend on how we understand the relation between
the notions of harm as distinguished in Section 3.1: Here we will
delineate two views of how to understand these notions of harm and
investigate the question of the extent to which these two alternative
views support Parfit’s ‘No-Difference
View’. According to our first view, one must choose between the
“single threshold” and the “single
subjunctive-historical” notion of harm: to claim that
rights-considerations can guide us in choosing among long-term
policies we will have to adopt one of these notions of harm as
specifying necessary conditions of harm; in doing so, we have to deny
that the other notion specifies necessary (or sufficient) conditions
of harm. According to the second view, the threshold notion of harm
and the subjunctive-historical notion can be combined.</p>

<p>

According to this “disjunctive notion” the necessary
condition for harming is the disjunction of the conditions for harming
as set out by the notions of harm at (II) and (III). The proposal is
this: instead of interpreting accounts of harm at (II) and (III) as
providing alternative necessary conditions for harming, we can take
these two notions to provide the disjuncts for a necessary condition
for harming. This disjunctive notion of harm substitutes yet a fourth
necessary condition of what it means to harm someone:</p>

<blockquote>(IV) (disjunctive) An action (or inaction) at
time <em>t</em><sub>1</sub> harms someone only if either (as in III)
the agent thereby causes (allows) this person to be in a sub-threshold
state, and, if the agent cannot avoid causing harm in this sense, does
not minimize the
 harm;<sup>[<a href="notes.html#23" name="note-23">23</a>]</sup>
 or (as in II) the agent causes this
person to be worse off at some later time <em>t</em><sub>2</sub> than
the person would have been at
<em>t</em><sub>2</sub> had the agent not interacted with this person
at all.</blockquote>

<p>

We clearly ought to prefer the disjunctive notion to the single
subjunctive-historical view according to which the
subjunctive-historical notion of harm specifies necessary conditions
of harm (and the threshold notion at (III) specifies neither necessary
nor sufficient conditions). The disjunctive notion is compatible with
the thesis of this entry that relies upon our employing a threshold
notion of harm where the subjunctive-historical and the diachronic
notions do not
 apply.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#24" name="note-24">24</a>]</sup>
 Some authors also argue that being worse
off than the same person was or would have been is not a necessary
condition for harm where the identity of the person is independent of
the harming action (Hanser 1990; Shiffrin 1999; Harman 2004,
98–101; Woollard 2012, 681–683; but see Roberts 2009,
19–20). Ought we to prefer the disjunctive notion to the single
threshold notion according to which the threshold condition is a
necessary condition of harm? The advantage of the disjunctive notion
is that this view of harm allows us to rely on the
subjunctive-historical notion of harm whenever it is applicable, that
is, when we will harm an existing person. In these cases the notion of
harm at (II) provides us with what most consider a straightforward
account of the harm caused.</p>

<p>

Consider the type of case where we can act in a way that diminishes
the well-being of a person who lives above any plausibly construed
threshold. However, we will diminish the person’s well-being to a
level still clearly above the threshold. For example, someone breaks
into the garage of a mansion and steals the new convertible while the
wealthy owner is at his penthouse in the city.  This theft is not
likely to cause the wealthy person’s well-being to fall below any
plausibly construed threshold of harm, and thus according to (III) does
not harm him. This seems implausible. Such a case is normally
understood as a case in which the affected person is clearly
harmed. More generally, the objection is that the threshold conception
is under-inclusive in interpreting which acts we consider harmful.</p>

<p>

The single threshold view by itself does not provide us
with a response to this objection. For a plausible substantive
specification of a threshold notion (see Section 4.3 below) will
not include a concern for the well-being of those above the
threshold. Thus, in responding to the objection we would have to add
an additional obligation. E.g., we could appeal to the additional
obligation of minimizing harm to other persons: The obligation
requires that we not cause another person to fall to a lower level of
well-being quite independently of the level of well-being the person
already realizes. What counts as a lower level of well-being can be
measured by the specified threshold.</p>

<p>

On the other hand, the disjunctive notion allows us to rely on the notion
of harm at (II). This provides us with a straightforward
account of the harm caused. Thus, the disjunctive notion is not open
to the objection as stated. However, while the single
threshold view can be shown to be fully
compatible with Parfit’s No-Difference View, the disjunctive notion of harm
raises difficult questions of interpretation of its own.</p>

<p> 
 Parfit illustrates the No-Difference View by considering two medical
programs (Parfit 1984, 367).  In each case a certain rare condition
can be passed from mother to child. One involves pregnancy testing. If
the test comes out positive, fetuses are treated for the rare
condition. The other involves preconception testing. The women who
test positive as carriers of the rare condition are told to postpone
conception for at least two months and to undergo (harmless) treatment
after which the condition will have disappeared. Available funds can
be spent on one or the other program, and the other must be
cancelled. Assuming that both programs have equivalent effects on
parents, that the conditions lead to the same particular handicap in
children, and that the two programs will achieve a similar success
rate, the programs differ only in affecting actual people (pregnancy
testing) or possible people (preconception testing). The (practical)
no-difference view says: our reason to prevent harm to possible future
people (those who might be conceived) is as strong as our reason to
prevent harm to actual people (those already conceived who will
develop from the already existing fetuses in due course). The two
medical programs in Parfit’s example are equally worthy and it makes
no moral difference which is cancelled.</p>

<p>

Is the disjunctive notion of harm compatible with the no-difference view,
thus understood? Here we cannot discuss the implications of the
disjunctive notion in any detail. We might first observe that both the
subjunctive-historical and threshold notions of harm can
be employed to interpret many core cases of harm. That is to say, both
sets of conditions as specified by the two notions of harm will
arguably be satisfied in many cases where most people agree that harm
was caused—at least under plausible construals of both
notions of harm. Second, in the cases in which not all sets of
conditions obtain, we still find that harm was caused, namely, as long
as at least one set of conditions obtains. If the
threshold notion of harm applies, we find that harm was
caused. The disjunctive notion entails that canceling either test causes
harm.</p>

<p>

However, the disjunctive notion does not entail that it makes no practical
difference which test we cancel. A plausible interpretation of the
disjunctive notion might be the following: satisfying either set of the
conditions provides a reason for objecting to the proposed action; if
both sets of conditions obtain, the objection is presumably stronger
than when only one set of conditions
 obtains.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#25" name="note-25">25</a>]</sup>
 According to this understanding of the disjunctive notion and assuming
that in Parfit’s example of the two medical programs the children, if
either they or their mothers are not treated, will suffer a severe
handicap, the objection to canceling pregnancy testing is stronger
than the objection to canceling the preconception testing
program. Because the handicap is severe, the children will fall below
the threshold and the threshold notion of harm provides
the same reason for objecting to canceling either program. But if
pregnancy testing is cancelled this will be worse for the children who
are not treated—the subjunctive-historical notion of harm
applies. The subjunctive-historical notion of harm does not, however, provide
a reason for objecting to cancellation of preconception testing. The
children who will be born handicapped would never have existed if
there had been testing prior to
 conception.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#26" name="note-26">26</a>]</sup>
This understanding of the disjunctive notion may not, then, be
compatible with the no-difference view. An alternative understanding
would deny that where both notions of harm are applicable this
strengthens the objection to the harmful act. Whether this strengthens
the objection and, if so, how much more is a matter of future
research(see Woollard 2012, 684–689).</p>

<p>

The single threshold interpretation of harm is also compatible
with a second and stronger understanding of the no-difference view: there is
no <em>theoretical</em> difference in harming possible future people
and harming actual people since the very same reasons hold against
harming either
 group.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#27" name="note-27">27</a>]</sup>
 The disjunctive notion is clearly incompatible
with the theoretical understanding of the no-difference view.
According to the disjunctive notion it would often not be true that the same
reasons hold against harming either such group. When we object to the
harming of actual people we will often have additional reasons that
reflect the fact that the subjunctive-historical notion of harm
 applies.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#28" name="note-28">28</a>]</sup></p>

<h2><a name="HowSpeThr">4. How to Specify the Threshold</a></h2>

<p>

The above mentioned considerations seem to suggest a specification of
the relevant threshold as a <em>sufficientarian</em> standard defined
in terms of absolute, noncomparative conditions (Shiffrin 1999,
123–24; McMahan 1998, 223–29; Page 2006, esp. 90–95,
170–173; Meyer and Roser 2009, 226–243; Huseby 2012).  One
could hold a unitary view of the threshold according to which one and
the same threshold would be applicable to all
decisions.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#29" name="note-29">29</a>]</sup>
Even if we held that the same list of rights were attributable to all
people (wherever and whenever they live), for example, those which are
meant to protect basic capabilities of human beings, what these rights
amount to will reflect contemporary social, economic, and cultural
conditions (see, e.g., Sen 1984; Nussbaum 2000, 132–33; Page
2006, 71–75).</p>

<h3><a name="SpeThrEgaCon">4.1 Specifying the Threshold by Egalitarian Considerations</a></h3>

<p>

Specifying the standard by attributing equal minimal rights to people
is only one possible interpretation of the threshold. We might,
instead, want to define the threshold on the basis of egalitarian
reasons. On the basis of these reasons we will object to inequalities,
for egalitarian reasons make it possible for us to understand relative
differences between the states of persons as something “which is
itself to be eliminated or reduced” (Scanlon 2005, 6). Egalitarian
considerations that address relative differences between people can
help specify the standard in at least two ways. We might hold that
the standing of people relative to their contemporaries is
(extrinsically or
 intrinsically)<sup>[<a href="notes.html#30" name="note-30">30</a>]</sup>
 important and that the threshold notion of harm ought to reflect,
say, the average level of well-being that people realize—or
that future people will realize: the higher the average level of
well-being, the higher the threshold level of harm should be
set. According to one interpretation of such an egalitarian reading,
presently existing people harm future people by causing them to
realize a (much) lower level of well-being than their own
contemporaries (Sher 1979, 389).  In addition or alternatively, we
might hold that the threshold level ought to reflect, say, the average
level of well-being of the present generations upon whose decisions
the existence, identity, and well-being of future people
depend. According to such an interpretation presently existing people
harm future people by causing them to realize a (much) lower level of
well-being than they enjoy themselves (see, for example, Barry 1999).
Still, even if egalitarian considerations that reflect a concern with
the relative differences between people can contribute to the
specification of the threshold, a plausible threshold is not going to
be based on that concern, but will primarily reflect a concern with
the absolute level of well-being of persons. Otherwise—this is
an implication of the first interpretation—any level of
well-being would be considered justified as long as all future people
fare equally badly. This presupposes attributing intrinsic value
exclusively to equality—an implausible
 view.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#31" name="note-31">31</a>]</sup>
 Moreover, to define the threshold standard of well-being of future
people as the level of well-being achieved by currently living people
(whatever it may be) is less than plausible, unless we were to
attribute intrinsic value exclusively to intergenerational equality,
so understood (see Marmor 2003, Steiner 2003, Raz 2003, Gosepath 2004,
454–63; and Holtug and Lippert-Rasmussen 2007).  This view would deny
that currently living people may stand under a duty of justice
positively to save for future people so that they will achieve a
sufficientarian level of
 well-being.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#32" name="note-32">32</a>]</sup></p>

<h3><a name="SpeThrPriRea">4.2 Specifying the Threshold by Prioritarian Reasoning</a></h3>

<p> 

According to the <em>priority view</em> (Parfit 1997, 213), equality
as such does not matter. It is therefore not open to objections
against holding equality to be of intrinsic value.  A plausible
version of the priority view reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<em>Priority view</em>: Benefiting persons matters more the worse off
the person is to whom the benefits accrue, the more people are being
benefited and the greater the benefits in question.

</blockquote>

<p>

The priority view has a built-in tendency towards equality, for the
view accepts the following egalitarian condition: If <em>X</em> is
worse off than <em>Y</em>, we have at least a <em>prima facie</em>
reason for promoting the well-being of <em>X</em> rather than
<em>Y</em> (unless conditions obtain under which the only or best way
of raising the well-being of <em>X</em> is by raising the well-being
of <em>Y</em> or conditions under which promoting the well-being of
<em>X</em> brings about raising the well-being of <em>Y</em> as a
side-effect). Even if prioritarians do not see anything intrinsically
bad in social, economic or other differences, their priority view is a
derivatively egalitarian view. To this extent it is correctly
described as non-relational egalitarianism.</p>

<p>

We might want to rely on, say, a prioritarian version of
utilitarianism for specifying the threshold of harm. On this
interpretation, future people are in a harmed state unless they are as
well off as such a prioritarian view requires. However, such a
prioritarian view for specifying the threshold of harm has most
implausible implications even if it is coupled with the
person-affecting approach. First, such a view is likely to define just
one optimal outcome for people’s actions; people’s failing to bring
about this outcome would then have to count as harming others. Thus
most people’s actions will count as harming others. Second, it implies
a version of Derek Parfit’s so-called ‘repugnant conclusion (see
Parfit 1984, part iv, and ch. 17; see also Ryberg and
Tännsjö 2004 and the entry on the
 <a href="../repugnant-conclusion/">repugnant conclusion</a>).
 Given, first, the large number of future people whose level of
well-being can be affected by the decisions and actions of currently
living people, and second, that the number of future people depends in
part upon currently living people’s decisions and actions, the
priority view might make unreasonable demands on the currently
living. How likely this is will also depend upon the strength we give
to the priority of the worse off who are (very) badly off. According
to such a prioritarian view, in assessing alternative options we will
have to weigh the claims to improvements as well as take into account
both the size of the benefit and the number of beneficiaries; if the
number of future people is sufficiently large, we would then have to
choose the option that improves their well-being even if both their
claims to improvements in well-being are weak and the benefits they
receive are small. If the number of future people is sufficiently
large, currently living people could well stand under an obligation to
improve their well-being even if in fulfilling this obligation they
lose a great deal of their own well-being and the improvements in
well-being of future people are small or even trivial (see Meyer and
Roser 2009, 233–235). Of course, the priority view will not have
this implication if all future people were to enjoy levels of
well-being that are higher than those of all or most currently living
people.</p>

<p>
It thus seems plausible to reject the idea that the priority view as
such specifies the relevant threshold of intergenerational
harm. Instead, the priority view can rather be understood to specify
what we optimally ought to do as a matter of morality. However,
(future) people might be thought not to be harmed if currently living
people do less than that. It might be permissible to bring about a
less than optimal outcome. The less than optimal outcome could not be
said to be harmful to future people. However, such a view depends upon
our being able to specify the relevant threshold of intergenerational
harm in a different way. For this purpose, we now turn to
sufficientarian interpretations of the threshold.
</p>

<h3><a name="SpeThrSufSta">4.3 Specifying the Threshold as a Sufficientarian Standard</a></h3>

<p> 

A sufficientarian conception of justice also holds that equality as
such does not matter (Frankfurt 1987). And sufficientarianism also has a built-in
tendency to equality. However, the tendency is restricted in the
following way: To benefit person <em>X</em> is more important than to
benefit person <em>Y</em>, if <em>X</em> is below the threshold and if
<em>Y</em> is better off than <em>X</em>. On a low level of
well-being, equality is of derivative value. In other words,
concerning the improvement of the position of the less well off,
sufficientarianism holds both a negative and a positive thesis: Below
the threshold the priority view is valid (this being the positive
thesis), above the threshold the improvement of the position of the
less well off is of no particular concern (this being the negative
thesis) (see Benbaji 2005; Brown 2005; Casal 2007, 297–298; for
critical discussion of this characterization see esp. Casal 2007 and
Shields 2012).</p>

<p>

We can distinguish between weak and strong interpretations of
sufficientarianism (see Crisp 2003; Benbaji 2006).  According to weak
sufficientarianism the priority to be given to people below the
threshold decreases to zero at the threshold. However, as the priority
view, the position of weak sufficientarianism can also make
unreasonable demands on the currently living (unless all future people
were to enjoy levels of well-being that are higher than those of all
or most currently living people). For, even if we attribute particular
weight to improving the well-being of people below the threshold, we
might be able to do more good (in total) by benefiting many more
people who are well off already—that is, if, as seems plausible,
we give some weight to the well-being of people above the
threshold.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#33" name="note-33">33</a>]</sup></p>

<p>

The position of strong sufficientarianism, however, differs from weak
sufficientarianism in how it interprets the priority of persons below
the threshold. Strong sufficientarianism attributes a significant
priority to those whose well-being is just below the threshold (while
according to weak sufficientarianism this priority decreases to zero
at the threshold). Versions of sufficientarianism are stronger the
greater the priority they attribute to those just below the
threshold. With an absolute or lexical priority threshold strong
sufficientarianism also rejects the view that it always matters
more—either below or above the threshold—to benefit
persons the more people are being benefited and the greater the
benefits in question. This precludes the implication of unreasonable
demands on currently living people as discussed (though the demands 
might be impossible to meet). Accordingly a
plausible version of <em>strong sufficientarianism</em> can be
characterized as follows:</p>

<p>

<em>Strong sufficientarianism</em>: First, to the group of persons
whose improvement in well-being has absolute or lexical priority
belong those whose level of well-being is below the threshold; to
benefit persons below the threshold matters more the worse off they
are. Second, and in addition, while within the group of both those
below and those above the threshold, it matters more to benefit
persons the more people are being benefited and the greater the
benefit in question, trade-offs between persons above and below the
threshold are precluded.  </p>

<p>
 Richard Arneson and others (Arneson 1999, 2000; Roemer 2004; and see
Casal 2007, esp. 312–314, 315–318) have objected to
thresholds, and especially those that designate an absolute
priority—as is characteristic of the position of strong
sufficientarianism—on the grounds that we cannot avoid an
arbitrary specification of such priority thresholds (but see Crisp
2003, 757–758; Benbaji 2006, 324–326) and, further, that
such thresholds are incompatible with our distributive
convictions’ being continuous (that is, that they all can be
accounted for by means of one principle of distribution) (but see
Crisp 2003, 753–757; Benbaji 2006, 332–344; Page 2007,
16–18; Dorsey 2008; Huseby 2010, 180–182; Freiman 2012,
30–33; Shields 2012, 111–115; and on both objections see
Sher 2014, chs. 8 and 9). For the purposes of the present discussion
we will assume that one could justify a priority threshold as
specified by strong sufficientarianism.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#34" name="note-34">34</a>]</sup> If so, the objections to specifying the
threshold in terms of the prioritarian conception and the conception
relying on the notion that equality is of intrinsic value present a
particular reason for holding that the specification of the threshold
ought to be informed by a sufficientarian understanding of justice, at
least for intergenerational relations.</p>

<p>
In defining the relevant threshold of harm we may also rely on
considerations that reflect the significance of relative differences
among future people or people who belong to different generations
including the currently living. Considerations characteristic of the
priority view may also be considered relevant for the specification of
the threshold of harm. It is implausible, however, to hold the view
that we might define the relevant standard as reflecting reasons
solely based on egalitarian or prioritarian weighting of claims to
improvements of well-being. Defining a threshold of well-being
according to which both currently and future living people are able to
reach a sufficientarian threshold allows us to avoid the implausible
implications of the egalitarian and prioritarian alternatives when we
understand the latter to define thresholds of harm: First, avoiding or
reducing differences must not lead to a state of affairs in which
people are worse off than they ought to be. Secondly, claims against
currently living people are unreasonable if in fulfilling them the
currently living people will bring about minimal or even trivial
improvements of the well-being of future people but suffer losses
themselves, causing them to fall below a plausible threshold level of
well-being.</p>

<p>

This is not to say that it is impermissible for people to choose to
procreate when securing a threshold level of well-being for their
children-to-be will require them to sacrifice their own well-being to
such a degree that they themselves will not enjoy a threshold level of
well-being. Rather, in decision-making contexts where currently living
people relate to future people who will exist (and in high numbers)
whatever they will decide to do, currently living people do not harm
future people when they secure a threshold level of well-being for
them even if they could further improve the well-being of future
people. And: in such decision-making contexts currently living people
cannot be said to stand under an obligation to sacrifice their own
well-being so that they will fall below the threshold standard of
well-being for the sake of securing a well-being for future people
over and above the standard.</p>

<p>

If these objections against an egalitarian and prioritarian 
specification of the threshold of harm are valid, we have particular reasons for
interpreting intergenerational justice according to a sufficientarian
threshold. At the same time, the reasons for a sufficientarian
understanding of intergenerational justice are not equally relevant
for the relations among contemporaries—never mind whether we
think of these contemporaries simply as people wherever they may live,
or as members of a well-ordered liberal society, or as found in
different basic political units. For the reasons reflect particular
features of intergenerational relations: The non-identity-problem
simply does not arise in relations among contemporaries. The problem
does not arise among institutionalized transgenerational legal
entities such as Rawls’s peoples or states understood as subjects of
public international law, either. Also, the objections to both the
prioritarian conception and the conception relying on the notion that
equality is of intrinsic value reflect, in part, particular features
of intergenerational relations: The repugnant conclusion as an
implication of the priority view presupposes that both the number and
the identity of future people are contingent upon the decisions of
currently living people; a large number of future people leads to
unreasonable demands on currently living people—this as an
implication of the priority view, too. Moreover, we can demand of
currently living people that they positively save for future people
only in the context of intergenerational relations. Thus, the specific
reasons for a sufficientarian understanding of intergenerational
justice are at least in part specific reasons and are not relevant for
understanding either global justice or the notion of justice that
holds among contemporary members of well-ordered
 societies.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#35" name="note-35">35</a>]</sup></p>

<h3><a name="RawJusSavPri">4.4 Rawls’s Just Savings Principle</a></h3>

<p>

We owe the first systematic discussion of obligations to
future people to John Rawls (Rawls 1971, 1999, especially section 44; Rawls
1993, 274; Rawls 2001, especially sections 49.2 and 3). Rawls
proposes a principle of “just savings”. Rawls never
discusses the non-identity-problem and for most of his discussions he
assumes that the number of future people is
 constant.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#36" name="note-36">36</a>]</sup>
 However, his principle of just savings can be understood to provide
us with a particularly sensible (and, certainly, the most prominent)
substantive understanding of intergenerational sufficientarianism. It
can be understood as an interpretation of a threshold
notion of harm in different number
choices (see also Reiman 2007; Attas 2009).</p>

<p>
Rawls specifies the sufficientarian threshold relevant for defining
currently living people’s obligations of justice
vis-à-vis future people: “the conditions needed to
establish and to preserve a just basic structure over time”
(Rawls 2001, 159; on the basic structure as the subject of the
application of a sufficientarian principle see also Freiman 2012,
33–37). Rawls distinguishes two stages of societal development
for the application of his principle of just savings. Currently living
people have a justice-based reason to save for future people only if
such saving is necessary for allowing future people to reach the
sufficientarian threshold as specified. This is known as the
accumulation stage. Once just institutions are securely
established—this is known as the steady-state
stage—justice does not require people to save for future
people. Rather they should do what is necessary to allow future people
to continue to live under just institutions. Rawls also holds that, in
that second stage, people ought to leave their descendants at least
the equivalent of what they received from the previous generation (see
Gosseries 2001 for a comparative assessment of Rawls’s
substantive principle). This additional claim can be supported by the
idea of a presumption in favor of equality (see Sidgwick 1907,
379–80, and the entry on
 <a href="../equality/">equality</a>) 
 and by the considerations delineated in the next section
(Section 4.5).</p>

<p>

As is characteristic of Rawls’s work, he presents the just savings
principle as the outcome of a decision reached in the contractualist
(hypothetical and non-historical) decision-situation of the original
position. Who are the persons in the original position? Rawls
considers an original position in which every generation is
represented. However, as the relations between the contractors so
conceived are not characterized by the “circumstances of
justice” (Rawls 1971, paragraph 22), the question of justice as
Rawls understands it does not arise: We cannot cooperate with previous
generations and, while previous generations can benefit or harm us, we
cannot benefit or harm them (see Section
 1).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#37" name="note-37">37</a>]</sup>
 Instead Rawls therefore adjusts the (present-time of entry)
interpretation of the original position for the intergenerational
context (Rawls 1993, 274; Rawls 2001, paragraph 25.2). The
contractors know that they belong to one generation, but the veil of
ignorance blinds them to which particular generation they belong (see
Gardiner 2009, esp. 97–116, and Heyd 2009a, esp. 170–176,
for a comparative analysis of contract theories can be extended to the
subject matter of intergenerational relations). From the position of
the original position the contractors determine a just savings
rate.</p>

<p>

While the circumstances of justice clearly hold among contemporaries,
the contractors cannot know whether previous generations have saved
for them. Why then should they agree to save for future generations?
In <em>A Theory of Justice</em>, Rawls stipulates “a
motivational assumption” according to which the contractors care
for their descendants so that they will want to agree to save for
their successors—irrespective of whether previous generations
saved for them. In <em>Political Liberalism</em>, Rawls withdraws this
motivational assumption. He now understands previous generations’
non-compliance with a just savings principle as a problem of non-ideal
 theory.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#38" name="note-38">38</a>]</sup>
 The original position, however, belongs to ideal theory: strict
compliance with whatever principles are agreed on is assumed (Rawls
1971, 144–45).  Rawls introduces problems of partial and
non-compliance only at the level of non-ideal theory (Rawls 1971,
ch. iv).  In accordance with this understanding of ideal theory, Rawls
assumes that the generations are mutually disinterested. He takes the
contractors to agree to a savings principle “subject to the
further condition that they must want all <em>previous</em>
generations to have followed it.” Rawls continues: “Thus
the correct principle is that which the members of any generation (and
so all generations) would adopt as the one their generation is to
follow and as the principle they would want preceding generations to
have followed (and later generations to follow), no matter how far
back (or forward) in time” (Rawls 1993, 274; Rawls 2001, 160).
The principle of just savings thus agreed on is thought to be binding
for all previous and future
 generations.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#39" name="note-39">39</a>]</sup></p>

<h3><a name="LimRigBasAccDutTowFut">4.5 Limits of a Rights-Based Account: Duties Towards the Future</a></h3>

<p>

So far this entry has argued for interpreting intergenerational
justice in terms of a conception for which a sufficientarian threshold
is of central significance. The argument is, in part, a response to
the non-identity-problem. A sufficientarian interpretation of the
threshold notion of harm (together with an appropriate
conception of wrongdoing) provides us with a plausible understanding
of what is owed to future people: the fact that future persons’
existence is contingent on our present decisions does not matter where
what is in question is our ability to harm future people’s interests
and to violate their rights. By employing a non-comparative
notion of harm one can justify the present generation’s duties
not to violate the rights of future generations against being
harmed. Accordingly, rights-based considerations may not bear merely
upon “same people choices”, but will bear also upon both
types of “different people choices” that Parfit
distinguishes, namely “same number choices” (in which the
same number of future people live, irrespective of present choices)
and “different number choices” (in which a different
number of future people will live depending on which choices we now
make) (Parfit 1984, 355–56).  Thus, intergenerational
sufficientarianism allows us to specify the considerations of justice
relevant for decisions concerning population policies: Future people
have rights vis-à-vis us that reflect considerations of justice
as specified by intergenerational sufficientarianism. Our correlative
duties set a normative framework for most of our decisions concerning
future people, including those that have an impact on their number and
identity.</p>

<p>

However, such a framework does not provide a complete moral theory of
intergenerational relations and especially not in the context of
decisions on the existence, number, and identity of future
people. There are concerns for future people shared by many of us that
cannot be accounted for by rights-based considerations (Jonas 1979;
Heyd 1994 and 2009a; De-Shalit 1995, ch. 1; Meyer 1997; Thompson 2009;
Sanklecha 2013, parts 3 and 4; Scheffler 2013, 60–63,
72–73,80–81).  First, many of us believe that that it is
important that there be future people at all. However, a
person-affecting intergenerational sufficientarianism will account for
the asymmetry of our procreational duties (see Section 2.2): On the
one hand, prospective parents should refrain from procreation out of
regard for the child(ren) they would have if the life of their
child(ren) would fall below the relevant sufficientarian
threshold.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#40" name="note-40">40</a>]</sup>
On the other hand, people have no obligation to procreate out of
regard for the interests of possible future children. Possible people
have no right to be brought into existence (and we do not have the
correlative obligation to procreate). Second, many of us believe that
future people should have a life that is well above the level of
well-being specified by a threshold notion of
harm.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#41" name="note-41">41</a>]</sup> This,
in part, reflects a third concern many have: Future people should be
able to share (at least certain aspects of) the particular way of life
of currently living people.  But, presumably, currently living people
do not violate the rights of future people by failing to sustain their
way of life for them. Thus, we cannot prefer a future with people all
of whom have lives far above the level of a sufficiency threshold to a
future with no people on the basis of considerations of rights of
future people.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#42" name="note-42">42</a>]</sup></p>

<p>

This insufficiency of rights considerations in guiding our choices
concerning future people is not restricted to our choices of
population policies. It will be apparent whenever we are choosing
between securing sufficiently good conditions of life for actual
future people and securing conditions under which actual future people
will be able to live lives above the level of the sufficientarian
threshold. For example, assuming that future people have certain
welfare rights against us, there are considerations based on the
rights of future people that prohibit us from choosing a policy of
depletion. However, such considerations might well be insufficient in
guiding us in choosing among alternative conservation policies that
have different consequences with respect to the quality of life future
people can be expected to enjoy.</p>

<p>

Clearly, considerations based on the rights of future people cannot or
cannot fully account for all the concerns we might have for future
people. What considerations besides rights-based considerations can
guide us in our relations to future people?  It has been suggested
that the widely shared concerns about the continuation of human life
on earth at a high level of well-being can, at least in part, be
accounted for by an obligation toward future people that have no
correlatives in future people’s rights vis-à-vis current
people. This obligation reflects those widely shared concerns about
future people which cannot be accounted for by rights-based
considerations. The obligation can be described along the following
lines (Baier 1981; Meyer 2005, chs. 4 and 5; Thompson 2009):
those currently alive owe respect to highly valuable goods that their
predecessors bequeathed to them as well as to more remote future
people, and they also owe respect to the highly valuable
future-oriented projects of their contemporaries. Owing such respect
gives rise to a general obligation, namely that current people should
not willfully destroy the inherited goods and the conditions that are
constitutive of persons’ pursuit of future-oriented projects. In other
words, such respect gives rise to a general obligation that one not
willfully destroy the social practices on which the possibility of
people pursuing future-oriented projects depends. While future people
belong to the beneficiaries, the obligation is owed to both present
and past people (see also Section 5).</p>

<h2><a name="SigPasWroDoi">5. The Significance of Past Wrongdoing</a></h2>

<p>

Intergenerational justice concerns the relations between
generations. So far we have mainly addressed the relations between
currently living and future people. This section discusses the three
issues that have been central to the philosophical investigation of
the relations between past people and currently living people and to
understanding the significance of what happened in the past (and, in
particular, of past wrongs) for currently living (and future) people’s
justice claims: First, how can currently living people be understood
to be negatively affected by historical injustices? Second, can the
ongoing effect of past wrongs become legitimate when circumstances
change? And, thirdly, we need to address the question of the moral
status of deceased persons and dead victims of injustice in
particular. </p>

<h3><a name="NonIdeProClaCom">5.1 Non-Identity-Problem and Claims to Compensation</a></h3>

<p>

 With respect to harm-doing suffered by victims in the past at the
hands of perpetrators in the past the non-identity-problem gives rise
to the following general question: how can individuals today have a
just claim to compensation owing to what was done to others in the
past when the (potential) claimants may not exist today had past
people not suffered these harms (Morris 1984; Kumar and Silver 2004;
Kershnar 2004, 70–75; Meyer 2004b and 2013)?  The non-identity
problem arises with respect to several specific understandings of how
to justify claims to historic compensation. Here we discuss currently
living people’s just claims to historic compensation based on a
causal link between the past injustices and the harm suffered by them
today. The causal link may be constituted in at least two ways: the
harm suffered by victims in the past at the hands of perpetrators in
the past causes additional harm for currently living people; or the
harming activities of the past perpetrators harmed currently living
people along with victims in the past. In Sections 5.3–4 we
investigate the question whether compensation can be owed to past
victims. Giving benefits to currently living descendants may be
thought to be appropriate compensation for the harms victims in the
past suffered at the hands of perpetrators in the past.</p>

<p>

For example, do African Americans, whose ancestors were subjected to
the terrible injustices of being kidnapped in Africa and subsequently
enslaved, have a just claim to
 compensation?<sup>[<a href="notes.html#43" name="note-43">43</a>]</sup> 
 Let us set aside a host of specifically legal questions concerning,
for example, the statute of limitations and liability. Let us also
assume that it is sometimes possible to identify with certainty direct
descendants of slaves. Consider the case of Robert, who has been
identified as one such person (see Fishkin 1991, 91–93). People can
claim compensation for harms they suffered. As a descendant of slaves,
has Robert been harmed owing to the injustices suffered by his
ancestors? First, consider briefly the subjunctive-historical notion
of harm at (II) (see Section 3.1).  According to this interpretation
of harm, a person can be understood to be fully compensated for an act
or policy (or
 event)<sup>[<a href="notes.html#44" name="note-44">44</a>]</sup>
 when she is as well off as she would have been had the act not been
carried out. According to this interpretation of harm, it is not the
case that Robert has been harmed by his ancestors’ having been
kidnapped and enslaved. If his ancestors had not been kidnapped and
enslaved, Robert would not exist today. His existence depends on the
fact that the genealogical chain was not broken at any point. Hence,
the initial kidnapping in Africa, the transport to America, and the
slavery of his ancestors are necessary conditions for Robert’s having
come into existence at all. He would not have been better off had his
ancestors not been badly wronged. Thus, we cannot rely upon this
interpretation of harm and its accompanying interpretations of
compensation in claiming that Robert has been harmed and should be
compensated; the required state of affairs under this interpretation
implies the nonexistence of the claimant to
 compensation.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#45" name="note-45">45</a>]</sup></p>

<p>
 
To this claim we can respond in a number of ways. As suggested by our
discussion in secs. 3 and 4 we can allow for an identity-independent
notion of harm in addition to the common identity-dependent notion of
harm. Consider the threshold notion of harm at (III). Under this
interpretation of harm, a person can be understood to be fully
compensated for an act or policy (or event) if that person does not
fall below the specified standard. According to this interpretation,
Robert can be harmed because his ancestors were kidnapped and
enslaved. Whether Robert has been harmed due to the way his ancestors
were treated depends upon whether the way they were treated has led to
Robert’s falling below the specified standard of well-being. That this
is true in the case of Robert, however, will turn on a causal link
between the past injustices and his <em>current</em> state of
well-being. Employing this interpretation of harm and its accompanying
interpretation of compensation requires a forward-looking assessment
of what others ought to do today in terms of providing compensation
for past
 injustice.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#46" name="note-46">46</a>]</sup>
 When we analyze historical claims on the basis of such a threshold
notion of harm, the current normative relevance of past wrongs will
depend upon their causal relevance for the well-being of currently
living (and future) generations. Fulfilling our duties to both the
latter might well require compensation for the consequences that stem
from the fact that their predecessors have been badly wronged. That
their predecessors were wronged, however, does not in itself give rise
to just claims of compensation on the part of their descendants
today. Thus in accordance with the disjunctive notion of harm (IV) as
discussed above (Section 4), present generations can have obligations
to compensate those who currently suffer harms resulting from the
lasting impact of injustices experienced by their predecessors, even
if the reasons for providing them with compensation are different from
(and possibly less weighty than (see Section 4.2)) the reasons for
compensating people whose identities are not dependent on (or changed
by) the harmful acts.</p>

<p>

However, the non-identity-problem is of little practical significance
for assessing the validity of rights to compensation or restitution
owing to more recent past injustices. First, the non-identity-problem
does not arise with respect to surviving victims of wrongs. The harm
done to surviving victims can be understood in accordance with the
common understanding of harm: the past wrongdoing caused these people
to be worse off than they would have been in the absence of that act
or policy. These individuals would be fully compensated for the harm
done to them where it the case that as a result of compensation
undertaken they are as well off as they would be if the policy had not
been carried out.</p>

<p>

Second, consider the case of people having been wrongfully expelled
from their homeland and not having received compensation for the
wrongs inflicted upon them. For their descendants it might well be
true that they would not exist had their parents and (great-)
grandparents not been expelled. However, the descendants can be said
to be victims of the additional wrong that their parents did not
receive compensation for the wrongs inflicted upon them. The
individual descendants can be said to have been harmed from conception
or birth because of the lack of sufficient compensation to their
parents (Sher 2005; and see Butt 2006, Cohen 2008, and Herstein 2008).
Again, the harm done to them can be understood in
accordance with the common understanding of harm: If those entities
which stand under the obligation to provide compensation to the first
generation of displaced persons do not (entirely) fulfill their
obligations, they thereby harm the descendants of the first generation
of displaced people by making those descendants worse off than they
would otherwise be—i.e., if (sufficient) compensation had been
provided by the first generation. This line of argument can be
extended to the second, third, fourth etc. generation: generation X of
displaced people would be fully compensated for the harm done to them
were it the case that as a result of compensation undertaken the
people of generation X are as well off as the people of this
generation would be if the first generation of displaced people had
received the compensation they were entitled to. While it is clear
that thus understood the later generations’ claims to compensation do
not have to contend with the non-identity problem (Sher 2005), what is
owed to them will depend on how best to understand the counterfactual
relevant to determine the amount of compensation owed. Here we do not
discuss the intricate problem of how best to understand the relevant
counterfactual (cf. Sher 1979, 1981).</p>

<p>

However, most agree that the legitimacy of people’s claims to
compensation can depend upon their actions (and inactions) and the
impact these have on their well-being. For these actions (and
inactions) can normatively be attributed to people only insofar as
they make the decision to act (or not act). Then the strength of later
generations’ claim to compensation—owing to the failure of
providing sufficient compensation to the first generation that
suffered the initial harm—may wane over time. The more the
descendants’ well-being can be attributed to actions or inactions for
which they themselves or members of the intermediate generations are
responsible, the less the hypothetical state of affairs that would
obtain had the direct victims received adequate compensation is
 relevant<sup>[<a href="notes.html#47" name="note-47">47</a>]</sup>
 for the determination of the claims of the indirect victims (Sher
1981). However, historical injustices may well have resulted in
ongoing systemically unequal distributions of life chances due to the
inheritance of the benefits stemming from historical injustices on the
side of the descendants of the perpetrators (see Butt 2013).</p>

<p>
 
We will have to assess the practical significance of these claims for
each case. For the claims to compensation of the first couple of
generations of descendants for the direct victims the insight is
likely to be of little practical significance. The harm done to their
ancestors is not ancient. Thus, the descendants’ claim to 
compensation—based on the harm inflicted on them due to the failure of
providing adequate compensation for the initial harm—is likely
to be strong.</p>

<h3><a name="SupHisInj">5.2 Superseding Historical Injustices</a></h3>

<p>

We now turn to a second source of doubts about the validity of
historical claims to reparations. Injustices committed against people
in the past may not give rise to claims to reparations today if such
claims can be understood to presuppose an indefensible interpretation
of property entitlements. Jeremy Waldron (Waldron, 1992a; Waldron
1992b, 27; Waldron 2002; Waldron 2003; Waldron 2004a; Waldron 2004b,
37; Waldron 2006a; Waldron 2006b; Waldron 2007; Quist and Veraart
2009; see also Lyons 1977) argues that the view that once we acquire
entitlements they continue until we transfer or relinquish them is
indefensible since there are reasons of
 principle<sup>[<a href="notes.html#48" name="note-48">48</a>]</sup>
 for holding that entitlements and rights are sensitive to the passage
of time and changes of circumstances. According to Waldron, entitlement
to land is based upon the idea that such entitlement can be an
integral part of people’s life plans and projects as individuals and
as members of groups. Entitlements to land can be important for people
being able to autonomously realize particular goods of their way of
life.  When
circumstances change the entitlement might no longer be important in
that sense or decrease in its normative significance. For example, the
entitlement of original owners might weaken over time if they are
separated from the land. Having been separated from the land,
entitlement to the land might no longer be important for the original
owners autonomously realizing their way of life. Thus, generally
speaking, entitlements are sensitive to background circumstances and
they are vulnerable to prescription. As Waldron argues, property
entitlement is a set of claim rights, liberty rights and powers that
are “circumstantially
 sensitive”.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#49" name="note-49">49</a>]</sup></p>

<p>
 
Further, if legitimate entitlement is sensitive to background changes,
it is possible that the ongoing effect of an illegitimate acquisition
and, more generally, of unjust violations of rights of others can
become legitimate when circumstances change. This is Waldron’s
principal argument for the thesis that historical injustices may be
 superseded.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#50" name="note-50">50</a>]</sup>
 He gives an example in which the violation by one group of the
legitimate rights of another group to a given waterhole is superseded
by ecological catastrophe such that the interlopers acquire a right to
share what they had wrongly begun to use. In these circumstances,
“they are entitled to share that water hole. Their use of [the
waterhole] no longer counts as an injustice; it is now in fact part of
what justice now requires. The initial injustice by [the first group]
against [the second] has been superseded by circumstances” (Waldron
2004a, 67).  Hence justice may require that original owners of land
share their land with others and they may be required to share even
with those who unjustly appropriated the land.</p>

<p>
 However, even if supersession of injustice is possible, the claim
that it has occurred in any given situation “depends on which
circumstances are taken to be morally significant and how as a matter
of fact circumstances have changed” (Waldron 2004a, 67).  The argument
for the possibility of supersession rests on a hypothetical case of
ecological disaster such that the need of others to make use of the
resources was both extreme and brought about by circumstances beyond
their control.</p>

<p>

One might doubt that these conditions are fully met even in cases of
so-called ancient historical
 injustice (Patton 2004, 167–71). With respect to more recent injustices the conditions for their
supersession will often not be met (see Lyons 2004a, 296; Meyer 2007, 301–305).</p>

<p>
Waldron put forward the supersession thesis with respect to indigenous
peoples in the U.S., Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, and others
have discussed the idea in this context (Patton, 2005; Sanderson,
2011; Spinner-Halev, 2012). The supersession thesis has also been
discussed in the context of Israel/Palestine (Meisels, 2003, 2009,
ch. 2; Meyer, 2004b; Gans, 2008, ch. 4), Fiji (Carens, 2000, ch. 9),
and Pacific Island nations threatened by climate change (Nine,
2010). The supersession thesis has become influential among theorists
both skeptical and supportive of reparations for past injustice (see,
for example, Kymlicka, 1995, 220; Thompson, 2002; Hill, 2002; Wenar,
2006; Nine, 2008; Meyer, 2004a, 16–23; Waligore, 2009; Marmor,
2004; Hendrix, 2005; Kolers, 2009, ch. 3; Butt, 2009,
145–48).</p>

<h3><a name="SurDut">5.3 Surviving Duties</a></h3>

<p>

So, we often should indeed attempt to counteract the negative
impact of past wrongs for the well-being of current and future
people. However, such an interpretation of the relevance of past
injustices is incomplete when understood as a statement of how we
ought to respond to the fact that past people were severely
wronged. That is true quite independently of whether or not we find, in
a particular case of historical injustice, that currently living people
have valid claims to reparations for being indirect victims of
historical injustice. Even if we held the view that the
non-identity-problem excluded the possibility of currently living
people being (indirect) victims of past injustice or that the historical
injustice under consideration has been superseded, we will not wish to
deny that past people were wronged. The moral significance of past
wrongs does not exclusively lie in their impact on present and future
people’s well-being; rather, the significance of past wrongs is also
to be seen in the fact that <em>past</em> people <em>were</em> victims
of these injustices. We need to enquire into the question of what we
owe to the dead victims of past injustices. As sketched here, the
interpretation is misleading in suggesting that we owe them 
nothing—that, in the words of Max Horkheimer, “[p]ast injuries
took place in the past and the matter ended there. The slain are truly
 slain.”<sup>[<a href="notes.html#51" name="note-51">51</a>]</sup></p>

<p>

To many it is intuitively plausible that present generations can have
duties to dead victims owing to the wrongs committed against them (by
others) in the past. If this intuition can be defended, we have duties
to past generations that are grounded in past deeds. This would imply
that at least some aspects of historical injustice cannot be accounted
for by an historically informed theory of justice between
contemporaries (or between contemporaries and future people).</p>

<p>

To attribute rights to dead people may seem unproblematic if we assume
that people continue to exist after their physical death and that they
may be affected by (and affect) events of this world. These
assumptions about the ontological status of previously living people
are, however, at least as controversial as their converse (see Mulgan
1999, 54–55). In the following discussion we will proceed on the
following assumption that might be said to occupy a sensible middle
ground between the competing views:</p>

<blockquote>(A) either the deceased do not exist (a1) or, if they do
exist, there is no connection between them and those currently alive
(a2).</blockquote>

<p>

In other words, we assume that, upon a person’s death, any causal interaction
between her and the physical world as we know it ceases.</p>

<p>

Assuming that dead people cannot be bearers of interests or rights and
thus that those presently alive can neither harm nor wrong dead
people, Joel Feinberg and others have discussed two alternative
interpretations of posthumous harm. While both are compatible with
presupposition (A), neither of these positions provides a satisfactory
understanding of posthumous harm or wrong. According to the first
interpretation, present generations can be said to owe something to
surviving interests as such—that is, to interests that the
deceased had, while alive, with respect to future posthumous states of
affairs.  However, while we have reasons to care about individual
people, it is not clear that we have reasons to care about interests
as such.  According to the second (re-)interpretation (see Feinberg
1980; Feinberg 1977, 301–02), the significance of posthumous events is
fully accounted for by the harm that these events cause a person
during her life. However, this interpretation is not an interpretation
of posthumous harm as such but of harm to living people that is caused
by posthumous events. This position has been shown to be incompatible
with our normal understanding of the significance of posthumous events
(see Gosseries 2004, ch. iv, sects. 4–5). </p>

<p>

A fourth position, the position of surviving duties, is compatible
with presupposition (A) and does not rely on any of the criticized
views (see Wellman 1995, 155–57). The position of surviving
duties is relevantly different from the three positions as introduced
above. The idea of surviving duties rests neither on the claim that
deceased people can be bearers of interests or rights (contrary to the
first position), nor on the claim that we have reason to care about
interests that have no current bearers (contrary to the second
position). The position of surviving duties does not reject the notion
that currently living people can be harmed by what are to them
posthumous events (for example, when people learn shortly before their
death that a project that they deeply care about is doomed to
failure). However, the position of surviving duties is meant to answer
a different question, namely, whether present generations can be said
to owe something to dead people and, in particular, to those who were
victims of past injustices.</p>

<p>According to this position, duties survive the death of the
bearer of the right.  While the bearer of the right no
longer exists, currently living people can stand under the correlative
duties. The notion of surviving duties relies on the idea that the
reasons for a person’s right imply reasons for a correlative duty
under which other people may stand even after the death of the bearer
of the right. If it is a moral right, then these reasons will also
include general social reasons which are relevant not only for the
bearer of the right but also for the bearer(s) of the surviving duty,
his contemporaries (and future people). For example, we all have
reasons to protect people’s trust that promises be kept and that
people have the reputation they deserve. The reasons for the surviving
duties also include the reasons that are necessary for showing that a
particular person had the moral right.</p>

<p>

The position under consideration relies upon the following claims:
Some rights are future-oriented in the sense that they impose duties
in the future. Such rights can impose surviving duties; they imply
duties that are (also) binding after the death of the bearer of the
right if the appropriate bearer of the duty is identified. In the
following we will comment on these claims by investigating the reasons
for surviving duties with the help of an example of a person who
wishes to establish posthumously a prize for the sciences. Let us call
the person “Alfred Nobel” even though we make no claim
that the example resembles Alfred Nobel to whose bequest we owe the
Nobel Prize.</p>

<p>

“A right implies a duty” means that a proposition about
the right’s validity implies a proposition that some duty
exists. Such an implication relies upon the claim that the reasons for
the right contain (some of) the reasons for the duty. In the case of
rights that are future-oriented in the sense indicated, the reasons
for the rights of people while alive are sufficient for holding
currently living people under a duty, that is, a surviving duty. With
respect to moral rights, specifically moral reasons are among these
reasons. Such reasons are meant to protect the conditions of a,
morally speaking, valuable social life.</p>

<p>

Suppose Alfred Nobel kept to himself his wish to establish,
posthumously, a prize for the sciences. Although he accumulated the
fortune necessary for such, Nobel neglected to write it in his will.
Hiking in isolated mountains together with his friend Barbara, Nobel
has an accident and both he and Barbara realize that he will die
before they can call on somebody for help. Nobel asks his friend to
promise him that she will make sure that his fortune will be spent for
the establishment of a prize for the sciences and that his wish to
this effect will be acknowledged as if it had been written in his
will.</p>

<p>

Why should Barbara keep the promise? The particular strength of the
position under consideration is to be seen in its connecting the
surviving duty both to the previous right of the deceased person and
to those general moral reasons which are relevant for the bearer of
the duty and his contemporaries.  First, the particular reasons which
ground the right of the no longer existing person imply reasons for
the validity of the surviving duty. Some of the reasons for a
currently living person to stand under the duty toward the deceased
person are implied by the reasons for attributing the corresponding
right to the deceased person while alive. This is also the sense in
which we stand under surviving duties <em>toward</em> the deceased
person. For example, the surviving duty to keep a death-bed promise is
valid for, <em>inter alia</em>, the reason that the promise was given
to the deceased person—and that is why the latter, while
alive, had a moral right that the promise given to him be kept. If the
duty is not understood to be binding due to the fact, <em>inter
alia</em>, that the deceased person had the future-oriented right,
surviving duties could not be distinguished from interpretations of,
for example, death-bed promises according to which the duty to keep
the promise is owed to our contemporaries alone (and possibly to
people living in the future). The position under consideration differs
from some consequentialist interpretations of such cases by insisting
that a surviving duty necessarily be based upon, <em>inter alia</em>,
the reasons for the future-oriented right and that these reasons
contain the specific reasons for the attribution of the previous right
to the deceased
 person.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#52" name="note-52">52</a>]</sup></p>

<p>

So far we have investigated one type of reason for a person to stand
under a duty towards the deceased person. These reasons are implied by
the reasons for attributing the corresponding right to the deceased
person while alive. However, and second, there are other reasons
too. These reasons are general in that they concern the protection or
promotion of values important for the quality of social life. With
respect to death-bed promises, trust and the protection from betrayal,
are at stake. We all have reasons to protect the value of people
having confidence that promises be kept. In so far as people can and
do have an interest in future posthumous states of affairs of the
world, and in so far as pursuing such interests can be of high
importance to the well-being of people while alive (Meyer 2005, chs. 4
and 5; Scheffler 2013, esp. 42–43, 52–53), it is important
for people that others can bind themselves by promises or contracts to
the effect that they will carry out certain actions after the
promisee’s death, and that when others have done so, that they
can be confident that the promise will be kept. For the practice of
such promises, trust is of special importance, for the promisee will
not be able to determine whether the promise was kept. Thus, the
practice of such promises is particularly dependent upon the
protection of the value of people having confidence in promises being
kept. At the same time, if such promises have often not been kept,
this is likely to undermine the confidence in promises being kept
generally.  The right of the deceased person that the promise given
will be kept is in part based on, among others, these
reasons. Although the right and the person who is the bearer of the
right have ceased to exist, the moral reasons for honoring the right
are still valid and the duty of the person who gave the promise
continues to be binding on the basis of these reasons. As these
reasons are general moral reasons they are not only relevant for the
individual bearer of the right but also for the surviving bearer of
the correlative duty and his contemporaries. The death of the bearer
of the right leaves these moral reasons unaffected, and the surviving
duty is based in part on these reasons in conjunction with the reasons
that are implied by the particular reasons for the attribution of the
correlative right to the deceased person while alive. Thus,
contemporaries of a person who stands under a surviving duty have
reason to impose sanctions on the person should he not keep his
promise.</p>

<p>

One might wonder whether this interpretation of surviving duties is
compatible with the presupposition that dead people are bearers of
neither interests nor rights and that they cannot be affected by the
actions of present persons. At the very least, the position of
surviving duties as delineated presupposes the possibility of the
attribution of posthumous properties and, more particularly, of their
change—an assumption that has been defended as rather
unproblematic (see Ruben 1988, 223–31).</p>

<h3><a name="CarOutActSymComFulSurDutTowDeaVic">5.4 Carrying Out Acts of Symbolic Compensation in Fulfilling a Surviving Duty Towards the Dead Victims</a></h3>

<p>

Does the theory of surviving duties contribute to an understanding of the moral
significance of the <em>fact</em> that past people <em>were</em>
severely wronged? We shall explore the idea that since people (as
members of ongoing societies) can be said to have an obligation to
compensate surviving and indirect victims of past injustices, they may
also have an obligation symbolically to compensate dead victims of
past injustices, people who cannot now be affected by our actions.</p>

<p>

As argued above, currently living people can stand under surviving
duties toward past people even though we can neither change the value
to them of any moment of their lives since they cannot be affected by
what people do after their death nor can they be thought to be bearers
of interests or rights. Until now the entry has discussed duties
toward dead people with reference to (variations on) the example of
Alfred Nobel and his bequest. Currently living people can act in ways
that will constitute a violation of the surviving duties under which
they stand owing to the rights the deceased once held. Currently
living people stand under particular surviving duties toward the
deceased owing to their future-oriented projects, the promises we made
to them, or the contractual obligations we entered into with
them. However, not all people have the opportunity or the wish to have
a specific impact on posthumous states of affairs. Not all people
pursue projects that are future-oriented in the relevant way and not
all people oblige others to bring about what for them are posthumous
states of affairs. Here one suggestion is that currently living people
can stand under surviving duties toward dead people owing to the fact
that they were victims of historical injustices. In order to show that
currently living people can stand under such duties, one will have to
assume that people generally have interests with respect to posthumous
states of affairs. Indeed, people can generally be thought to be
interested in enjoying a good reputation both during their lifetime
and posthumously. When people were violated in their rights, and badly
so, their posthumous reputation depends upon their being publicly
acknowledged as victims of these wrongs, and others being identified
as the wrongdoers (see also Margalit 2002, chs. 2–4).</p>

<p>

In acknowledging past individuals as victims of egregious wrongs we
cannot affect their well-being. Also, such acknowledgement cannot be
expressed face to face with the dead victims, but only
vis-à-vis currently living people in light of the wrongs past
people suffered. However, if it is true that we stand under surviving
duties toward past victims of historical injustice owing to the wrongs
they suffered, then our fulfilling the duty by publicly acknowledging
the past injustices they suffered will change the relation between us
and the dead victims of historical injustice. It will be true of the
past victims of these injustices that they have the posthumous
property that we fulfilled our surviving duty toward them. To be sure,
a change of the relation between an existent person and a dead person
does not bring about a real change to the latter. Rather, the
relational change is based upon the real change of the person who
carries out the act.</p>

<p>

For currently living people to bring about public acknowledgment of past people as victims
of historical injustice can require different measures under different
circumstances. They can express their
acknowledgement of past people as victims of past wrongs in an
indirect way, namely, by providing compensation for those who are
worse off than they should be owing to the effects of the past
injustices suffered by their predecessors or by conferring benefits on
living people in whose well-being as members of a group we assume the
dead victims of past wrongs had an interest. The message of such
compensation can contain the acknowledgment that past people were
victims of past wrongs. Here I would like to suggest that we can
understand efforts at appropriate commemoration of past victims as
symbolic compensation and restitution.</p>

<p>

Establishing a memorial is the typical course of action where the
effort is made to realize the symbolic value of compensating those
victims who are no longer living. A memorial may be a public speech, a
day in the official calendar, a conference, a public space or a
monument—for example, a sculpture or an installation. Often
these memorials are meant to commemorate crimes that previous members
committed in the name of a political society whose currently living
members now want to carry out actions of public symbolic compensation
or restitution for these crimes toward the victims and their
descendants. Such acts have been carried out since the 1970s in
Germany, and there is evidence of an international practice of
symbolic
 compensation.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#53" name="note-53">53</a>]</sup></p>

<p>

How can we understand this practice of symbolic compensation? One
interpretation relies on the following basic idea: the value of real
compensation—the rectification or compensation at which we would
aim if only it were possible—is imputed, at least in part, to
the act of symbolic compensation (see Nozick 1993, chs. 1 and 2).  The
imputation of the value of real compensation to the acts of symbolic
compensation is partly based upon the expressive value of acts of
symbolic compensation. For those who carry out acts of symbolic
compensation these acts make it possible to express attitudes toward
the past victims—attitudes that are constitutive of acts of
compensation. Acts of symbolic compensation make it possible for those
who carry them out to act in such a way as to express an understanding
of themselves as people who wish to, and would, carry out acts of real
compensation if this were only possible. If successful they will have
firmly expressed an understanding of themselves as persons who would
provide real compensation to the previously living person or people if
this were only possible. They will also have expressed a firm
commitment to prevent the repetition of such injustices.</p>

<p>

Acts of symbolic compensation can thus be valuable for those who
perform them, since doing so helps express attitudes that are
important for their self-understanding and identity. Those involved
understand themselves to be persons committed to support the just
claims of those who have been injured and to be persons prepared to
contribute to the establishment and maintenance of a just political
society. This is a real consequence of such acts and can be of great
importance to those carrying out the
 acts.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#54" name="note-54">54</a>]</sup></p>

<p>

However, those carrying out these acts will not succeed in bringing
about these consequences if they <em>aim</em> to bring about these
consequences as such. Carrying out an act of symbolic value as a means
of bringing about certain consequences will change the character of
the act and, thus, the reasons that speak on behalf of carrying out
the act in the first place. It is not the case that we will become a
person of a certain identity simply by carrying out an act that a
person of this identity would have performed. While the consequences
for self-understanding just outlined can be an important factor in
explaining why a person acts as she does, in choosing what to do the
person cannot herself explicitly take into account this type of
consequence without thereby diminishing or undermining this very
effect of her act (see Anderson 1993, chs. 2 and 4; Raz 1986,
ch. 12).</p>

<p>

Acts of symbolic compensation will have consequences for others as
well, particularly surviving and indirect victims of past injustices.
Acts of symbolic compensation can have consequences for such persons
and groups: the public acknowledgment of the suffering of past people
who were wronged by, say, a genocidal policy cannot be separated from
the acknowledgment of those who survived the same policy and
consequently continue to suffer, or from those who continue to suffer
as indirect victims of the policy. Those who carry out acts of
symbolic compensation will want to provide some real compensation to
those who currently suffer as a result of the same past wrongs, to
help those who currently are victims of similar injustices, and to
prevent such injustices from happening
 again.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#55" name="note-55">55</a>]</sup>
 The reasons for acts of symbolic compensation provide reasons for
real compensation where this is possible. Symbolic compensation
belongs to the measures likely to have the effect of providing
surviving victims or groups with assistance in recovering or regaining
membership and recognition in their respective societies, such that
they are once again able to lead lives under conditions of
 justice.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#56" name="note-56">56</a>]</sup></p>

<p>

Symbolic compensation as understood here demonstrates that we can
recognize past people as victims of injustices without presupposing
that they can be current bearers of interests or rights. Insofar as
people generally have an interest and a just claim to
enjoy the reputation they deserve while alive, and insofar as the reasons for
their just claim can oblige us even after the bearer of the interest
and the just claim has ceased to exist, our carrying out acts of
symbolic compensation can be understood as fulfilling a surviving duty
toward dead people who were wronged in the past, namely the duty of
restoring to them the posthumous reputation they deserve.</p>

<h2><a name="Con">6. Conclusion</a></h2>

<p>

Present generations stand under two types of obligations of
intergenerational justice: They are obliged (i) not to violate the
rights of future generations (Section 2) and (ii) (at least some
presently living people might well be
 obliged)<sup>[<a href="notes.html#57" name="note-57">57</a>]</sup>
to provide compensation to contemporaries with respect to harms
victims in the past suffered at the hands of past perpetrators
(Section 5). By employing a threshold notion of harm which may be
understood as a central element of a sufficientarian conception of
intergenerational justice, but could also be an element of other
substantive understandings of intergenerational justice (Section 4),
we can justify conclusions about both types of present
generations’ duties. The threshold notion of harm can be
understood as a constitutive element of a complex understanding of
harm (disjunctive notion) (Section 3, and, in particular, 3.4).</p>

<p>

The special features of our relations to (remote) future 
people—especially the lack of particular knowledge, the impossibility
of cooperation, and the permanent asymmetry of influence (Section 
1)—do not stand in the way of attributing rights to them that
ground corresponding duties owed by us (Sections 2 and 3). The fact
that past wrongs are among the necessary conditions for the existence
and identity of people currently alive is compatible with the view
that these persons have rights to compensation owing to the impact of
these past wrongs on their well-being, and that these rights can
ground corresponding duties owed by their contemporaries
(forward-looking understanding of the significance of past injustices)
(Section 5.1). Even when we allow for the possibility of the ongoing
impact of past injustices to be just today, namely owing to a change
of circumstances, we will have to investigate the extent
to which the conditions for such a supersession of claims to
restitution or compensation are met for each case (Section 5.2).</p>

<p>

Rights-based considerations of intergenerational justice bear not only
upon “same people choices” but also upon both types of
“different people choices” that Parfit distinguishes,
including what he calls “different number choices”
(Sections 2 and 3). However, widely shared concerns for the
continuation of human life and at a high level of well-being cannot be
accounted for solely by rights-based considerations (Section
4.5). Also, the moral significance of past wrongs should not be
interpreted solely in terms of the impact of these injustices on
present and future people’s well-being. If we allow that
intergenerational relations are not exclusively governed by duties
with correlative rights, the notion that we can stand under surviving
duties towards dead people who cannot be bearers of rights
vis-à-vis present people (Sections 5.3–4) is compatible with
the forward-looking understanding of the significance of historical
injustice. Also, the notion that we stand under an obligation towards
future people to which no rights of future people 
correspond—namely, under the obligation not to destroy willfully the goods
inherited from our predecessors and the conditions that are
constitutive of persons’ pursuit of future-oriented projects (Section
4.5)—is compatible with the view that we do stand under some
obligations of intergenerational justice to which the rights of future
people correspond.</p>
