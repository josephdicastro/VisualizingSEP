<h1>Disability: Definitions, Models, Experience</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Fri Dec 16, 2011; substantive revision Mon May 23, 2016</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
Philosophers have always lived among people who could not see, walk,
or hear; who had limited mobility, comprehension or longevity, or
chronic illnesses of various sorts. And yet philosophical interest in
these conditions was piecemeal and occasional until the past hundred
or so years. Some of these conditions were cited in litanies of life's
hardships or evils; some were the vehicle for inquiries into the
relationship between human faculties and human knowledge [see SEP
entry on “Molyneux's Problem”]. But the treatment of
disability as a subject of philosophical interest is relatively
new.</p>

<p>
The lack of attention to “disability” or
“impairment” in general may have a simple explanation:
there were no such concepts to attend to until 19<sup>th</sup> century
scientific thinking put variations in human function and form into
categories of abnormality and deviance. Once such categories were
established, it became possible to talk, and generalize, about
“the disabled,” and philosophers have done so for various
purposes (Hacking, 1990; Davis, 2002, Ch. 4)). The resurgent political
philosophy of the second half of the last century, preoccupied with
eliminating or reducing unearned disadvantages, tended to treat
disability as a primary source of those disadvantages, to be addressed
with medical correction or government compensation. Somewhat later,
social philosophers began to see disability as a source both of
discrimination and oppression, and of group identity, akin to race or
sex in these respects.</p>

<p>
In some ways, disability looks much like sex or race as a
philosophical topic. It concerns the classification of people on the
basis of observed or inferred characteristics. It raises difficult
threshold questions about the extent to which the classification is
based on biology or is socially constructed. And yet the strong
philosophical interest in some of the characteristics on which the
disability classification is based appears to accord them a
significance that many would deny to the distinguishing
characteristics of sex or race.</p>

<p>
Consider, for example, the question of how well-being is affected by
the characteristics on which the disability classification is based.
There is little interest now in the question of whether, in a world
without discrimination, blacks or women would do better or worse on
various metrics of well-being than whites or men. In contrast, there
is considerable interest in this question when the subject is people
with
 disabilities.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#1" name="note-1">1</a>]</sup>
 Some philosophers and disability scholars claim that the answer is no
different than in the case of race or sex: to the extent that
disability reduces well-being, it is because of the stigma and
discrimination it evokes. In contrast, other philosophers claim that
disability is fundamentally different from race and gender in that it
necessarily reduces well-being: even in a utopian world of
non-discrimination, people with blindness, deafness or paraplegia
would be worse off than their able-bodied counterparts. This is but
one example of the many ways that disability generates philosophical
debate about some of our most familiar ethical, political, and
epistemological concepts.</p>

<p>
This introductory entry will outline the prevailing definitions and
models of disability, and discuss the epistemic and moral authority of
the experiences and self-reports of people classified as disabled.

<h2><a name="DefDis">1. Definitions of Disability</a></h2>

<p>
The definition of disability is highly contentious for several
reasons. First, it is only in the past century that the term
“disability” has been used to refer to a distinct class of
people. Historically, “disability” has been used either as
a synonym for “inability” or as a reference to legally
imposed limitations on rights and powers. Indeed, as late as 2006, the
Oxford English Dictionary recognized only these two senses of the term
(Boorse, 2010). As a result, it is hard to settle questions about the
meaning of “disability” by appeal to intuitions, since
intuitions may be confused by the interplay between older,
ordinary-language definitions and newer, specialized ones.</p>

<p>
Second, many different characteristics are considered disabilities.
Paraplegia, deafness, blindness, diabetes, autism, epilepsy,
depression, and HIV have all been classified as
“disabilities.” The term covers such diverse conditions as
the congenital absence or adventitious loss of a limb or a sensory
function; progressive neurological conditions like multiple sclerosis;
chronic diseases like arteriosclerosis; the inability or limited
ability to perform such cognitive functions as remembering faces or
calculating sums; and psychiatric disorders like schizophrenia and
bipolar disorder. There seems to be little about the functional or
experiential states of people with these various conditions to justify
a common concept; indeed, there is at least as much variation among
“disabled” people with respect to their experiences and
bodily states as there is among people who lack disabilities. Indeed,
some have questioned, in part because of this variation, whether the
concept of disability can do much philosophical work (Beaudry,
2016).</p>

<p>
At the same time, defining “disability” solely in terms of
social responses like stigmatization and exclusion does not
distinguish disability from race or sex (Bickenbach, 1993)—a
result that some disability scholars might welcome, but that begs, or
obscures, an important question. The challenge of distinguishing
“disability” from other concepts, without taking a
simplistic or reductive view of it, has been taken up by various
specialized definitions.</p>

<p>
Two common features stand out in most official definitions of
disability, such as those in the World Health Organization (2001;
1980), the U.N. Standard Rules on the Equalization of Opportunities
for People with Disabilities, the Disability Discrimination Act
(U.K.), and the Americans with Disabilities Act (U.S.) : (i) a
physical or mental characteristic labeled or perceived as an
impairment or dysfunction (in the remainder of this entry, we will
refer to such characteristics as “impairments,” without
assuming the objectivity or validity of that label) and (ii) some
personal or social limitation associated with that impairment. The
classification of a physical or mental variation as an impairment may
be statistical, based on the average in some reference groups;
biological, based on a theory of human functioning; or normative,
based on a view of human flourishing. However classified, impairments
are generally seen as <em>traits</em> of the individual that he or she
cannot readily alter. Just what makes a condition a trait or attribute
of an individual is obscure and debatable, but there seems to be
agreement on clear cases (Kahane and Savulescu, 2009). Thus, poverty
is not seen as an impairment, however disabling it may be, nor is
tasteless clothing, even if it is a manifestation of impaired
fashion-sense rather than scarce income. On the other hand, diseases
are generally classified as impairments, even though they are rarely
permanent or static conditions. Diseases that are not long-lasting,
however, such as the flu and the measles, do not count as
impairments.</p>

<p>
The notion of a limitation is broad and elastic, encompassing
restrictions on such “basic” actions as lifting one's arm
(Nordenfelt, 1997; compare Amundson, 1992: actions “at the level
of the person”); on more complex physical activities such as
dressing and toileting; and on social activities like working,
learning or voting (see Wasserman, 2001).</p>

<p>
The characterization of both features is disputed. Several scholars
have challenged the prevailing view of impairment as objective and
biologically grounded (Shakespeare, 2006; Davis, 2002; Tremain, 2001;
Amundson 2000). There is also disagreement about the conceptual and
practical need for two categories of limitations, one involving
personal activity, the other social or political
participation—“disability” and
“handicap,” respectively (Wright, 1983; Edwards, 1997;
Nordenfelt, 1997; Altman, 2001). But the most controversial issue in
defining disability is the relationship between the two. At one
extreme are definitions that imply, or are read to imply, that
biological impairments are the sole causes of limitation. The
definitions in the World Health Organization's 1980 International
Classification of Impairment, Disability, and Handicap, and the
Disability Discrimination Act (UK) have been interpreted this way. At
the other extreme are definitions that attribute the limitations faced
by disabled people solely to “contemporary social
organization,” such as the definition given by the Union of the
Physically Impaired Against Segregation (UPIAS, 1976). Such
definitions appear to treat impairments merely as
“evocative” causes—as conditions that are subject to
exclusion and oppression. They have been criticized for ignoring
disadvantages that cannot be attributed to social attitudes and
practices (Terzi, 2009, 2004; Shakespeare, 2006). But in
characterizing disability in terms of exclusion, these definitions
need not deny that impairments have undesirable aspects, such as pain
or discomfort—merely that those aspects are not within the
scope, or part of the meaning, of disability.</p>

<p>
In-between are definitions which assert that individual impairment and
the social environment are <em>jointly</em> sufficient causes of
limitation. Perhaps the best-known example is the WHO's International
Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF, 2001),
which emphasizes that disability is a “dynamic interaction
between health conditions and environmental and personal
factors.” Such interactive definitions predominate in current
law and commentary on disability; even the ICIDH and DDA can be
interpreted as compatible with this approach. The ADA is generally
seen as adopting an interactive approach to disability, although it
contains an amalgam of definitional features.</p>

<h2><a name="ModDis">2. Models of Disability</a></h2>

<p>
These different understandings of the relationship of impairment to
limitation inform two contrasting approaches to disability, often
described as opposing models: the medical and social. The <em>medical
model</em> understands a disability as a physical or mental impairment
of the individual and its personal and social consequences. It regards
the limitations faced by people with disabilities as resulting
primarily, or solely, from their impairments. In contrast, the
<em>social model</em> understands disability as a relation between an
individual and her social environment: the exclusion of people with
certain physical and mental characteristics from major domains of
social life. Their exclusion is manifested not only in deliberate
segregation, but in a built environment and organized social activity
that preclude or restrict the participation of people seen or labelled
as having disabilities.</p>

<p>
In their extreme forms, the medical and social models serve to chart
the space of possible relationships between impairment and limitation
more than to reflect the actual views of individuals or institutions.
(A variety of more formal models, described in Altman, 2001,
graphically represent the causal complexity of disability.) The
medical model is rarely defended but often adopted unreflectively by
health care professionals, bioethicists, and philosophers who ignore
or underestimate the contribution of social and other environmental
factors to the limitations faced by people with disabilities.</p>

<p>
A variety of social models are embraced by disability scholars and
activists in and outside of philosophy. The “British social
model” associated with the UPIAS (1976) definition quoted above
appears to deny any causal role to impairment in disability. As
suggested, however, that denial may best be seen as limiting the scope
of “disability” to the effects of exclusion and
discrimination (Beaudry, 2016), or as rhetorical, countering the
prevailing emphasis on biological causes of disadvantage. More
moderate versions of the social model maintain the emphasis on social
causes while insisting on the interactive character of disability
(e.g., Bickenbach 1993; Altman, 2001). Taking the poor fit between
atypical embodiment and standard environments as their starting point,
they treat disability as an interaction between biological and social
causes, denying causal priority to either.</p>

<p>
Implicit in the UPIAS definition of disability are two ways that
society imposes limitations on disabled people, corresponding to two
distinct strands of the social model. When the UPIAS claims that
society “excludes” people with impairments, this suggests
the <em>minority group model</em>, which sees people with impairments
as a minority subject to stigmatization and exclusion. On this view,
the main reason people with disabilities encounter hardship is because
they suffer discrimination along the same lines as racial or ethnic
minorities. Accordingly, civil rights protections and
anti-discrimination laws are the proper responses to disability (e.g.,
Hahn, 1997 and Oliver, 1990). Perhaps the most familiar expression of
the minority-group model is found in the preamble to the Americans
with Disabilities Act, which describes people with disabilities as
“a discrete and insular minority”—an explicit
invocation of the legal characterization of racial minorities.</p>

<p>
The UPIAS also asserts that “contemporary social
organization” fails to “take into account” people
with disabilities. This suggests the <em>human variation model,</em>
according to which many of the challenges faced by disabled people do
not result from their deliberate exclusion, but from a mismatch
between their characteristics and the physical and social environment.
On this view, disability is “an extension of the variability in
physical and mental attributes beyond the present—but not the
potential—ability of social institutions to routinely
respond” (Scotch and Schriner, 1997). This view of disabilities
as human variations is closely related to the view that disability is
a universal human condition (Zola, 1989) or shared human identity
(Davis, 2002, Ch. 1). The claim that disability is universal can be
taken as nothing more than a prediction that we will all acquire
familiar disabilities at some time in our lives. But that claim is
better construed as one about the nature of disability; as maintaining
that all human beings have physical or mental variations that can
become a source of vulnerability or disadvantage in some settings.</p>

<p>
These two versions of the social model are not incompatible, differing
mainly in emphasis. The discrimination stressed by the minority group
model generally leads to, and is expressed in, the societal failure to
accommodate people with various differences. In some contexts, it is
appropriate to analogize people with disabilities to racial
minorities; in others, it is important to reject a dichotomy between
disability and normality and treat impairments as continuous
variations. If one goal of social policy is to remove discrimination
and its enduring disadvantages, another is to encompass the full range
of human variation in the design of the physical environment and
social practices.</p>

<p>
Although the social model, in one version or another, is now the
dominant legislative, social-science, and humanities paradigm for
understanding disability, stronger versions, particularly the British
Social Model, have been subject to extensive criticism. Some argue
that an adequate conceptualization of disability requires a
recognition of impairments as an objective basis for classification,
to distinguish disability discrimination from other types of
discrimination (Bickenbach, 1993). Several critics argue that extreme
versions of the model implausibly deny or understate the role of
impairment itself as a source of disadvantage (Anastasiou and
Kauffman, 2013; Terzi, 2009, 2004; Shakespeare, 2006). Others,
however, contend that this criticism is misplaced, because the British
Social Model does not deny the importance of impairments but rather
seeks to restrict the notion of "disability" to social exclusion and
oppression (Beaudry, 2016). </p>

<p>
Another objection is that the social as well as the medical model both
rest on a false dichotomy between biological impairments and social
limitations. There are two versions of this objection. One maintains
that disability is a complex phenomenon, in which biological
impairment and social exclusion are deeply interwoven and difficult to
tease apart (Martiny 2015; Anastasiou and Kauffman, 2013). The other
version of this objection rejects the treatment of impairment as a
(strictly) biological phenomenon. “Impairment,” the
argument goes, is no less a social construction than the barriers
faced by people so classified. Claims that there is a stable
biomedical basis for classifying a variation as an impairment are
called into question by shifting classifications; by the
“medicalization” of some conditions (shyness) and
“demedicalization” of others (homosexuality). Moreover,
the social environment appears to play a significant role in
identifying and, arguably, in creating some impairments (dyslexia)
(Cole, 2007; Shakespeare, 2006; Davis, 2002, Ch 1; Tremain, 2001;
Amundson, 2000). What counts as an impairment may depend on which
variations appear to be disadvantageous in familiar or salient
environments, or on which variations are subject to social prejudice:
Less-than-average height may be more readily classified as an
impairment than greater-than-average height because the former is more
often disadvantageous in environments designed for people of average
height, or because it is generally seen as less desirable. For such
reasons, it is difficult to establish the objectivity of the
impairment classification by appeal to a clear and undisputed
biomedical norm. Amundson (2000) goes so far as to deny that there is
any biological basis for a concept of functional normality—a
claim emphatically rejected by Boorse (2010). </p>

<p>
The disputed objectivity of the impairment classification is adduced
by Tremain to argue that impairments “must no longer be
theorized as essential biological characteristics (attributes) of a
‘real’ body on which recognizably disabling conditions are
imposed” (2001, 632). Rather, she argues that being classified
as having an impairment is an integral part of the social process of
disablement. Such criticism parallels the debate among gender
theorists about whether we can distinguish sex from gender on the
ground that gender is socially constructed whereas sex is not. [See
the SEP entry on “Feminist Perspectives on Sex and
Gender.”] </p>

<p>
Thus, some critics conclude that it is at best oversimplified and at
worst futile to distinguish biological impairments from social
limitations, or to attempt to separate and compare the biological and
social contributions to the disadvantages of people with disabilities
But even those who believe that the impairment classification can be
defended in biomedical terms recognize that impairments are not merely
biologically-defined atypicalities but also markers for
discrimination—discrimination that may be reinforced by the
conviction that it is a response to objective biological attributes.
Anita Silvers (2003) has argued that a it is both possible and
desirable to construct a neutral, value-free model of disability,
using strictly descriptive criteria to identify atypical forms and
functions, thereby allowing scholars with conflicting views to debate
their normative and policy significance. </p>

<h3><a name="ModDecPol">2.1 Models, Decisions, and Policies</a></h3>

<p>
The medical and social models suggest (although they do not imply)
different views about the impact of disability on well-being, and
different views about how disability is relevant to reproductive
decisions, medical interventions, and social policy. Those who accept
a social model of disability regard the association between disability
and well-being as highly contingent, mediated by a variety of
environmental and social factors. They question conceptions of
well-being that give a central role to the possession or exercise of
the standard array of physical and mental functions, as those
conceptions imply, or are often taken to imply, that well-being is
precluded or diminished merely by the absence or limitation of those
functions. [see SEP entry (forthcoming) on “Disability: Health,
Well-Being, and Personal Relationships”] As a result, they
generally see the disadvantages of disability not only as externally
caused, but as less formidable than they appear to people who view
disability in largely biomedical terms. These differences are
reflected in the conflicting assessments of life with disabilities
found in the bioethics and public policy literature on the one hand,
and disability scholarship on the other (contrast Brock, 2005 with
Goering, 2008).</p>

<p>
The different models of disability also seem to favor different
responses to disability. The medical model appears to support the
correction of the biological condition or some form of compensation
when that is impractical; the minority group model appears to favor
measures to eliminate or compensate for exclusionary practices and
recognize their injustice; the human variation model appears to favor
reconstruction of the physical and social environment to take into
account a wider range of differences in human structure and function.
Importantly, such reconstruction may also be supported by the minority
group model as an antidiscrimination measure, since that model views
exclusionary environments and practices as the characteristic form of
discrimination against people with disabilities. The human variation
model may just make explicit the appropriate social response to
disability in a society without exclusion or discrimination.</p>

<p>
But claims about the causes of disadvantage do not always yield
straightforward prescriptions for their remediation (Wasserman, 2001;
Samaha, 2007). In some cases, medical or surgical
“correction” may be the most effective way to escape
discrimination; if correction is not appropriate, that is because it
reinforces discriminatory attitudes and practices. The proper response
to the disadvantages associated with disability depends not only on
causal attributions but also on moral judgments about responsibility,
respect, justice. The debates over cleft lip surgery and breast
reconstruction after mastectomy are not only about the comparative
importance of biological and social factors in making the treated
conditions disadvantageous. They also concern whether those
interventions are justifiable uses of scarce medical resources, and
whether they are complicit with suspect norms (Little, 1998), as in
the case of skin-lighteners for people of color (Asch, 2006).</p>

<h2><a name="ExpDis">3. The Experience of Disability</a></h2>

<p>
Although it is subject to dispute and qualification, the distinction
between biological impairment and social limitation is relevant to
many normative and policy issues, especially those concerning the
choice between measures that modify the disabled individual or alter
his environment. In this section, we consider the role of that
distinction in addressing the critical question of how the experiences
of people with disabilities are relevant to those issues. The
disability rights movement has long complained that the perspectives
of people with disabilities are too often ignored or discounted. The
slogan that served as the title for James Charlton's 1998 book,
<em>Nothing About Us Without Us</em> (Charlton, 1998; Stone, 1997) has
often been invoked to demand the inclusion of people with disabilities
in policy making and research concerning disability. The slogan
suggests that they have both a unique perspective to bring to those
activities and a right to take part in them. But what is the
“us” to whom the slogan refers? Do persons with different
disabling traits have enough in common to claim that there is a
“disability perspective” to bring to bear on policy and
research?</p>

<p>
Such questions are best approached in terms of the two aspects of
impairments recognized by most disability theorists: as structural or
functional atypicalities, and as markers for discrimination. These two
aspects of impairment roughly correspond with two distinct types of
disability experience:</p>

<ol>

<li>The experience of living with an atypical structure or
function—factual or phenomenological information about living
with different physical, sensory, cognitive, or affective functions
than does the majority of the population.</li>

<li>The experience of facing stigma and discrimination based on one's
structural or functional atypicalities.</li>
</ol>

<p>
There may be more commonalities in one kind of experience than the
other, and greater relevance to specific research or policy issues.
Further, the epistemic and moral authority of statements made by
people with disabilities about their experiences may vary with the
kind of experience they describe.</p>

<h3><a name="FacPhe">3.1 Facts and Phenomenology</a></h3>

<p>
The first type of experience involves the particularities of living
with atypical embodiment or functioning. Questions about this kind of
experience are often framed as what-is-it like questions: “What
is it like to” have moderate or profound deafness? use a
wheelchair to move? be legally or totally blind? be unable to hold or
manipulate objects with one's hands? have atypical speech? have a
learning disability or a mood disorder? Such questions are sometimes
requests for factual information about how one manages tasks with
one's disability—“how do you do x if you are in a
wheelchair?” In other cases, they are requests for self-reports
about the phenomenological experience of being in a particular
state—“what does it feel like to get around in a
 wheelchair?”<sup>[<a href="notes.html#2" name="note-2">2</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
People accustomed to their impairments may have little to report about
“what it feels like” to have them, in part because absence
of a function or a sense may not be something they experience as such,
and because their atypical ways of functioning or sensing may not, in
themselves, be affect-laden—it is what they do
unself-consciously, until it is called to their attention. The
experience of atypical functioning or sensing may be far more salient
for someone getting to know a person with a disability than it is to
the person herself. It may also be highly salient to a person who is
recently impaired, trying to function without limbs or senses that she
used to have. But the experience of loss and frustration becomes less
salient with time, peer and professional support, as she gets more
immersed in going about day-to-day
 life.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#3" name="note-3">3</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
Even when people with disabilities do report about what “it is
like” to have their impairments, those reports may vary
considerably. The most obvious reason is that there is tremendous
variation in the sensory, physical and functional states of which
“impaired” or “disabled” people are capable. A
person who can see but not hear has very different sensory experiences
from a person who can hear but not see, who in turn has very different
experiences from a person who can see and hear but cannot move his
legs. This point should be obvious, but it is worth stressing, because
it underscores the fact that the labels “disabled” and
“impaired” do not track a distinct phenomenological
experience.</p>

<p>
Moreover, even two people with the same impairment label might give
different reports of how they do things or how they feel as they go
about life with their impairment This could be due partly to
differences in the character or extent of their impairment—not
all people labeled “deaf” are deaf to the same extent.
Further, their experience of life with an impairment may vary with the
kinds of activity they engage in, and how they regard their
impairments as affecting their opportunities for self-fulfillment.
Opportunities in turn may be influenced by all the factors, unrelated
to impairment, that affect everyone: the family and neighborhood in
which one grows up or now lives; one's disposition or personality; the
financial resources at one's disposal; or one's education, religion,
sex, or race. Moreover, people's experience of living with an atypical
function sometimes may be difficult to distinguish from their
experience of stigma and discrimination.</p>

<p>
Despite these differences, the experiences of living with diverse
impairments have one thing in common—they are likely to be
ignored, or given insufficient weight, in the design of the physical
and social environment. Unlike new acquaintances, planners and policy
makers may pay little attention to “what it is like” to
get around with atypical functions. In constructing buildings, transit
systems, and work schedules, they often fail to listen carefully to
what people with various impairments say about their experiences of
daily living. Those experiences cannot be adequately simulated by
spending a day in a wheelchair or walking around with a
blindfold—indeed, the confusion and disorientation that
nondisabled people experience in simulating impairments is a very
misleading guide to the way people with disabilities experience and
negotiate the activities of daily living. Moreover, in learning about
the experiences of living with atypical functions, planners and policy
makers cannot take any single impairment as representative. The
experiences of people with different impairments differ as much from
each other as they do from the experiences of nondisabled people. As
the human variation model emphasizes, the very diversity of
impairments poses an important challenge for an inclusive society.</p>

<h3><a name="StiSocConDis">3.2 Stigma and the Social Construction of Disability</a></h3>

<p>
If “baby boomers” who have not learned electronic
communication become a despised, as opposed to merely statistical,
minority, and if, as a result, they become cut off from friends and
acquaintances who rely on email and social media for long-distance
communication, and who dismiss them as luddites and fogeys, they will
learn something about the social construction of disability. They will
learn even more if they cannot cross the “digital divide”
or can do so only at considerable economic cost or cognitive strain,
or if they are still regarded as luddites and fogeys even when they
do. They will experience something of the stigma and discrimination
that cut across impairments.</p>

<p>
The second type of disability experience, then, is of attitudinal
barriers to ordinary activity that are facts of life for people with
disabilities. According to the social model, which highlights these
barriers, the “disability experience” that links people
with cystic fibrosis to people with epilepsy, learning disabilities,
or cerebral palsy is one of having to deal daily with the largely
negative responses of others. These negative responses involve several
elements. The most discussed is overt stigmatization and
discrimination: being treated as a social outcast, losing out on jobs,
friends, or partners, because other people do not want to interact
with a person with a disability, or enduring grossly inadequate
accommodation because reasonable accommodation is thought too costly
or troublesome.</p>

<p>
But there are also less overt ways that society makes living with a
disability difficult. Simply being different from the majority of the
population, in a way that the majority makes salient, can make people
with disabilities feel isolated or alienated. This experience is
similar to those not only of other stigmatized minorities, such as
African-Americans or LGBTs, but of people with atypical
characteristics who may not form a distinct political or cultural
minority but are nonetheless constantly reminded of their difference.
For example, people whose spouses have died and older adults who are
single for whatever reason may feel excluded from social events
intended for couples, or face the presumption that they have a
(usually opposite-sex) partner (“And what does your husband
do?”).</p>

<p>
It is in the social construction of disability that we move from the
particularity of any one disability toward the common social
experiences of people with disabilities. Stigma, discrimination, and
imputations of difference and inferiority are all parts of the social
experience of disability. Being greeted at a party or a conference not
by “hello” but by “do you need any help?” and
having virtually every aspect of one's interests, tastes, and
personality attributed to one's disability are also parts of the
disability experience. As one writer describes it, if he cooks it is
because he doesn't want to be seen in public; if he eats in
restaurants it is because he can't cook (Brickner, 1976). Disability
becomes a “master status,” preventing people from playing
any adult social role and eclipsing sex, race, age, occupation, or
family (Goffman, 1963; Gliedman and Roth, 1980). Many nondisabled
people assume that people with disabilities won't make good partners
and cannot or should not become parents (Safilios-Rothschild, 1970;
Shakespeare, 1996; Asch and Fine, 1988; Wates, 1997). People with
disabilities are perceived to be globally helpless based on their need
for assistance with some facets of daily life (Wright, 1983), fueling
the conviction that they are unable to render the help needed for
successful partnership or parenting. Most nondisabled people, after
all, are not told that they are inspirations simply for giving the
correct change at the drugstore. Perhaps there would not even be a
“disability experience” in a world without the daily
indignities, barriers, and prejudices that characterize life with
disability almost anywhere.</p>

<p>
Just as there is great variation in how members of racial and sexual
minorities experience stigmatization, however, disabled people's
experience also varies. In claiming that the experience of stigma
unites disabled people, we must be careful to acknowledge those
differences. For example, a major source of variation is whether the
disability is visible or invisible (Davis, 2005; Banks and Kaschak,
2003). Whereas visibly disabled people must deal with being instantly
classified as “different” and inferior, people with
invisible disabilities are often placed in the stressful and
exhausting position of having to convince others that they are
“really” disabled and not asking for special treatment.
The alternative is to keep quiet and forgo needed assistance, which
carries other costs, such as the stress of keeping a secret or trying
to decide if a particular disclosure is safe (Schneider and Conrad,
1985; Davis, 2005).</p>

<p>
In addition, disabled people who are also members of other stigmatized
groups may experience a distinct kind of stigmatization that is
“more than the sum of its parts.” For example, disabled
women are disproportionately affected by society's obsession with body
image: they must confront not only sexism and prejudice against
disabled people, but a particularly virulent combination of the two
that stigmatizes women who do not fulfill a narrow ideal of feminine
beauty (Crawford and Ostrove, 2003) or are thought incapable of
performing the stereotypically female role of nurturer (Asch and Fine,
1988). In a similar way, both African-Americans and disabled people
are frequently stereotyped as dependent or ineffectual. And so
African-Americans who are also disabled face a particularly high
burden in overcoming these stereotypes.</p>

<p>
Moreover, some would argue that to the extent that people with
disabilities have distinct and common experiences, they are due to
embodiment as well as stigmatization. A disputed but much-discussed
strand of feminist philosophy holds that the experience of being
female differs in important ways from being male, regardless of
cultural position, discrimination, or political and economic power. On
this view, women differ in some important ways from men because of the
biology of femaleness and of childbearing, and those differences
should be seen as gateways into philosophical and moral understanding
(Whitbeck, 1972). Discussions of “race” are similarly
complex: is the experience of “race” entirely socially
constructed, or is there a biological component after all? (See
generally <em>APA Newsletter on the Black Experience</em>, 2000).
Debates about the experience of disability can be enriched by
understanding these debates about other minority groups, even if
disability differs in significant respects. On the one hand, the
biological reality of many significant impairments affects the
experience of those with the impairments. On the other hand, different
impairments shape experience in very different ways. Clearly,
“the experience of disability” is complex, and usefully
compared to the experience of other stigmatized minorities.</p>

<h3><a name="EpiMorAut">3.3 Epistemic and Moral Authority</a></h3>

<p>
The first-hand experience of stigmatization may confer two sorts of
authority on people with disabilities. The first is epistemic. There
should be “nothing about us without us” because any
discussion of, or research into, disability not informed by that
experience would likely be inaccurate and misguided. For example,
discussions of well-being that do not take into account the
perspective of disabled people may assume that their level of
happiness or satisfaction is much lower than it in fact is, or that it
is lower mainly because of difficulties directly attributable to
impairments rather than to attitudes and social barriers. This is but
one application of the more general issue of first-person authority:
the extent to which people have special or privileged knowledge of
their own mental states and experiences [see SEP entry on
“Self-Knowledge”]. Although this is a subject of great
controversy in the philosophy of mind, there is widespread agreement
that, at minimum, first-person ascriptions of mental states carry a
defeasible presumption of correctness.</p>

<p>
But there is an additional epistemic reason for according significant
weight to the first-hand reports of people with disabilities. The
observations and judgments of all stigmatized minorities are
frequently discounted, but people with disabilities face a distinct
handicap. There is a powerful, pervasive tendency among philosophers,
social scientists, and laypeople to dismiss their self-appraisals as
reflecting ignorance, self-deception, defensive exaggeration, or
courageous optimism [see SEP entry on “Feminist Perspectives on
Disability”, Sec. 3]. Giving those self-appraisals heightened
attention and deference may be an appropriate and effective way to
counteract or correct for that tendency.</p>

<p>
Epistemic authority thus provides a good reason for encouraging
disabled people to speak about their experiences and for nondisabled
people to listen when they do. But there is another reason as well:
people who suffer stigmatization, disrespect, and discrimination have
a moral claim to be heard that is independent of the accuracy of their
testimony. Even if someone lacking those experiences could convey them
accurately and vividly, she would not be an adequate substitute for
those who had the experiences. The experience of stigmatization, like
the experience of other forms of oppression, calls for recognition,
and thereby may impose a duty on those fortunate enough to have
avoided such experiences to listen closely to those who have had them.
To settle for second-hand accounts of those experiences or to ignore
them altogether seems disrespectful to the victims. The conviction
that the oppressed have a right to a hearing lies behind the recent
proliferation of Truth Commissions and tribunals. It also helps
explain the frustration of crime and torture victims denied an
opportunity to tell their stories, even when their oppressors receive
punishment without their testimony. Though few disability advocates
would demand a tribunal for the routine indignities of life with
disabilities in developed countries, most demand a far greater voice
in the media depiction of people with disabilities, in research about
them, and in policies concerning or affecting them.</p>

<p>
At the same time, there are several dangers associated with placing
too much emphasis on the moral privilege of victims of stigmatization.
First, there is the danger of defining people by their oppression. The
victims may not want to be spokespeople or witnesses, or not for very
long; they may want to move on. It is important to recognize both the
moral authority of victims to testify and their prerogative to decline
that role.</p>

<p>
Second, emphasizing the moral privilege of the stigmatized may obscure
differences in the experience of stigmatization, and in the sort of
authority it confers. As we have seen, there is tremendous variation
in the ways that disabled people experience stigma, although certain
broad generalizations may hold.</p>

<p>
Third, in conferring privilege on those who experience particular
forms of oppression, we may obscure or slight the shared vulnerability
of all human beings. For example, Ruth Anna Putnam champions social
improvements for women and other disadvantaged people but is wary of a
particularist feminist theory of justice, which may fail to emphasize
commonality of human experience and human need (Putnam, 1995). Might a
similar wariness be warranted for disability? If, as Scotch and
Schriner (1997) point out, we had a philosophy and public policy based
on common human needs, we might be able to get rid of “special
needs” and focus on multiple methods of meeting common ones,
with no negative shadow cast on any of those varied methods.</p>

<p>
Further, when only the marginalized are asked to share their
“experiences,” the experiences of the dominant group are
left unarticulated, unexamined, and unexplored. Once we argue that
people with disabilities need to be heard in bioethics and policy
debates as they describe the values and difficulties in their lives,
we should also be arguing for experiential accounts of the dominant
group. When dominants examine their own experiences, they might see
similarities to as well as differences from those who have been
marginalized. Both groups might benefit as a result.</p>

<h3><a name="WhoExpJud">3.4 Whose Experience and Judgments?</a></h3>

<p>
The final danger in emphasizing the experience of stigmatization is
that it will exclude the voices of many people classified as having
disabilities but who do not see themselves as disabled or stigmatized.
People with disabilities include millions who do not tend to speak in
social model terms and who may not typically speak to their social, as
opposed to their medical situation (although they do file
discrimination complaints under the ADA when they think it
appropriate). People who have back problems, cancer histories,
Parkinson's disease, Type II diabetes, stroke, emphysema, forms of
dementia, mood disorder, schizophrenia, substance abuse, or HIV do not
typically count themselves as part of the “disability
community.” The case for including such people is based in part
on the shared experience of socially-mediated exclusion. For example,
a person who has difficulty breathing because of emphysema and cannot
visit friends because she cannot walk to a distant bus stop is
disadvantaged by social organization in an analogous way to the person
with paraplegia who can't meet friends in inaccessible
restaurants.</p>

<p>
Such inclusiveness, however, requires an acceptance of diverse
attitudes and opinions. Even if the majority of people we would
classify as having disabilities perceived societal mistreatment and
institutional barriers to be more oppressive than their diagnoses, not
all of them would share that view or agree on the best response.
African-Americans have different views about affirmative action, and
many women do not believe that the option of legal abortion is
essential for women's full participation in society. Disability
theorists can find it frustrating that most nondisabled people in
bioethics dispute their claims about their experience, but those
theorists must respond to whatever challenge to the social model is
posed by people with disabilities who see their condition, and not
society, as the major impediment to their living rewarding lives. Many
people with both congenital and acquired disabilities have said that
they don't want cures but do want societal change, but that hardly
warrants the charge that Christopher Reeve wasn't speaking from his
experience of disability when he argued that what he wanted was
“cure” and not social change (Johnson, 2003; Shakespeare,
2006).</p>

<h3><a name="PlaDisExpBioPubPol">3.5 The Place of Disability Experience in Bioethics and Public Policy</a></h3>

<p>
Let us grant that a large number of people with particular impairments
will say at least some similar things about life with those
impairments, especially concerning stigma and discrimination. We are
still left with complex questions about what uses to make of such
experience in shaping public policy.</p>

<p>
Clearly, one critical role is educational. Forty years ago plenty of
well-meaning men wondered why women objected to having doors held for
them, or to the exclusive use of male pronouns to refer to humans
generally. Language, social conventions, and many aspects of life have
changed because men listened to women's accounts of how seemingly
innocuous acts felt, and of why those acts held not-so-innocuous
implications for their self-realization and social participation.
“Why is that person on crutches so offended when I ask him if
he's traveling alone?” says the flight attendant who doesn't ask
the same question of his nondisabled seatmate. Why doesn't the man who
is blind let it go when a cab driver won't take his money? A
nondisabled person may think it would be great not to pay the
outrageous fare as the meter climbs in New York City traffic.</p>

<p>
The educational value in explaining the daily experience of stigma
goes far beyond “sensitivity training.” In making
nondisabled people aware of how much of “the burden of
disability” arises from routine, seemingly innocuous social
interactions, people with disabilities can help to convince them that
the direct or internal effects of their various impairments are not
nearly as bad as imagined.</p>

<p>
Taking the experiences of disabled people seriously may also have
important implications for health policy. As is apparent in many
bioethical and policy discussions, most nondisabled people, including
health professionals, imagine the experience of disability to be far
worse than reported by the disabled themselves (Basnett, 2001 and
Gill, 2000). This gap is not explainable solely by the limited contact
between the two groups. In developing a plan for Medicaid rationing in
Oregon in the early 1990s, nondisabled people ranked treatments to
sustain the lives of people with quadriplegia as of very low priority
because of their presumed low quality of life (Menzel, 1992); people
with quadriplegia complained that they had been left out of the
surveys and that their appreciation of their lives had not informed
the ranking process<strong>.</strong> Such serious policy errors might
have been avoided by a recognition that people with disabilities had
the same epistemic authority as nondisabled people to assess the
quality of their lives.</p>

<p>
The varied experiences of functioning with an impairment may have a
more modest role to play in policy deliberations than the common
experiences of stigma and discrimination. But that role is still an
important one. In designing buildings, transit systems, and other
public and private facilities, and in establishing norms of conduct in
schools and workplaces, we need to know a lot about how people with
atypical functions get around and get along. It is not enough to
ensure that the width of a doorway exceeds the width of a standard
wheelchair; it is also important to find out about the preferences of
wheelchair mobilizers before and after they enter a building. This
kind of information is no different from that routinely elicited from
nondisabled people in designing facilities. But it requires the
representation of people with a wide array of impairments, and it
requires respectful attention to the minutiae of their daily
lives.</p>
