<h1>Mysticism in Arabic and Islamic Philosophy</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Sat Mar 7, 2009; substantive revision Wed Apr 13, 2016</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>

Mysticism in the Islamic context has traditionally been intertwined
with the notion of <em>Ḥikmah</em>, which is at once both wisdom
and philosophy (Nasr 1996). The source of mysticism and the mystical
elements in Islam are to be traced to the Qur’an and the Islamic
doctrine itself. Some of the Qur’anic verses have been
viewed by the mystics and philosopher-mystics of Islam as allegorical
and esoteric hints for those who can see them. “God is the
Outward and the Inward” (Qu’ran 57:3), “he for whom wisdom
is given, he truly has received abundant good” (Qu’ran
2:269), and the famous light verses</p>

<blockquote>
God is the Light of the heavens and the earth, the likeness of His
light is as a niche wherein is a lamp, the lamp is a glass, the glass
as it were a glittering star kindled from a blessed tree, an olive
that is neither of the East nor of the West, whose oil well-night
would shine, even if no fire touched it; light upon lights; God guides
to His light whom He will. And God strikes similitudes for man, and
God has knowledge of everything. (Qu’ran 24:35)</blockquote>

<p>can all be seen as containing esoteric insight. Through out the
ages, these verses have inspired a number of Muslim gnostics, some of
whom, such as Shihāb al-Dīn Suhrawardī (12<sup>th</sup>
CE) and Mullā Ṣadrā (16<sup>th</sup> CE) have written
commentaries upon them (e.g., Mullā Ṣadrā’s
<em>On the Hermeneutics of the Light Verse of the Quran</em>).</p>

<p>
From a mystical perspective, all later developments and interactions
between Islamic philosophy and other intellectual traditions should
therefore be seen as rational expressions of the mystical elements
within an Islamic milieu. Mystical elements exist in Islam in two
different and independent ways. Practically, Sufism represents the
esoteric dimension of Islam in its purest form, while theoretically
salient features of Islamic mysticism were gradually incorporated into
the Islamic philosophical tradition. Islamic mysticism, therefore,
stands on two pillars: first practical, then philosophical. That is,
esoteric wisdom can either be attained through practical wisdom, which
includes inner purification and asceticism, or through a type of
philosophy which includes, but is not limited to discursive
reasoning.</p>

<div id="main-text">

<h2 id="NeopSufi">1. Neoplatonism and Sufism</h2>

<p>
Following the early theological schools of thought in Islam, among
which were the determinists (<em>Qadarites</em>), the eschatologists
(<em>Murj‘aites</em> and <em>Wa‘idites</em>) and the faith
based theologians (<em>Ash‘arites</em>), there came the Islamic
philosophical tradition and its many different schools of
thought. Even though Al-Kindī is regarded to be the first
Muslim philosopher, the full impact of Hellenic thought on Islamic
philosophy is best seen in the philosophical edifice of Abū Nasr
Fārābī (10<sup>th</sup> CE)
Al-Fārābī, who is considered to be the father
of logic in the Islamic philosophical tradition, is also the first to
have embraced Neoplatonism, albeit in a limited sense. It was
his paradigm that paved the way for mysticism to enter Islamic
philosophy.</p>

<p>
Neoplatonism, which has remained one of the salient features of
Islamic philosophy, has performed two functions: the intellectual and
the practical, both of which have become an integral part of living a
philosophical life. Philosophically, Neoplatonism provides
answers to most major questions within the context of Islam, such as
how multiplicity came from unity and how corporality emanated from an
incorporeal God, as well as explaining the ascending and descending
order of beings.</p>

<p>
Mysticism in Al-Fārābī manifests itself in two ways,
philosophical and practical. Philosophically,
as is evident in <em>The Letter Concerning the Intellect</em> (<em>Risālah
fi’l-‘aql</em>), his interpretation of the concept of the
four intellects paved the road for his successor Avicenna (Ibn
Sīnā) (981–1037 CE), who made full use of Neoplatonism.
Al-Fārābī tries in his writings not only to
reconcile the opinions of Plato and Aristotle, with Plato seen as
somewhat of a mystical figure, but also, in his discussions of
political philosophy, he replaced Plato’s philosopher-king with
an Imam whose understanding of truth is intuitive, who knows not only
theoretical virtues but also the practical ones. However, even
though his musical compositions are sung among some Sufi orders in
Turkey and the Indo-Pakistani continent and one can see the influence
of Sufism in his <em>Bezels of Wisdom</em>
(<em>Fuṣūṣ al-ḥikam</em>), reports concerning
him having been a practicing Sufi are quite nebulous.</p>

<p>
As to the master of the Peripatetics, Avicenna (Ibn Sīnā) himself, the
consensus of scholars is that Avicenna was a rationalist who embraced
certain concepts from Plato, Aristotle and Neoplatonism and that the
salient feature of his philosophical writings are discursive in
nature. From here on, there are generally two distinct interpretations
of Avicennan philosophy: Those who see him only as a rationalist who
had nothing to do with mysticism and those who argue that later
Avicenna had embraced mysticism as is reflected in some of his later
works.</p>

<p>
Most Western scholars of Avicenna who see him only as a rationalist, similar to al-Fārābī and Averroes, (Gutas 2006, Adamson 2013) primarily rely on his discursive and rationalistic writings. Many Muslim philosophers in particular Iranian scholars of Avicenna have a more inclusive reading of his writings and tend to agree that in the later period of his life, Avicenna developed an interest in mysticism. (Nasr &amp; Leaman 1996, Inati 1996).</p>

<p>
For Avicenna, similar to many other Muslim philosophers, the ultimate philosophical endeavor was to unveil the mystery of creation in particular; how Divine unity became the multiplicity of the world of existents. To resolve this riddle, Avicenna adopts the Neoplatonic scheme of emanation which has also been used not only by Sufis and Islamic gnostics to explain the spiritual journey of man towards God but also, by almost all philosopher-mystics from  Suhrawardī and Mullā Ṣadrā to Sabziwārī and Ṭabāṭabā’ī.</p>

<p>
Avicenna was not a practicing Sufi with any known affiliation to a Sufi order. In fact, Avicenna’s meeting with the great Sufi master Abū Sa‘īd Abu’l-Khayr (d. 1049 CE) and the presence of an “oriental philosophy” <em>(al-ḥikmat al-mashraqiyyah)</em> in his writing in all likelihood are apocryphal. However, the presence of mystical elements in some of his later works is held by some to be undeniable (Aminrazavi 2003). For instance, in the ninth chapter of his philosophical masterpiece <em>Remarks and Treatments (al-Ishārāt wa’l-tanbihāt)</em>, in a section entitled <em>On the Stations of Knowers (Fī maqāmāt al-‘ārifīn)</em>, Avicenna appears to offers an explanation of the Sufi doctrine and openly to defend the gnostic and Sufi method of attaining truth. While the authorship of some of his Persian writings are subject to debate, in some of his  allegorical writings, such as <em>Treatise on Ascendance (Mi‘rāj nāmah), Treatise on Birds (Risālat al-ṭaīr)</em>, Salmān and Absāl, <em>Son of the Living Awake (Ḥayy ibn Yaqẓān)</em> and <em>Treatise on Love (Risālah fi’l-‘ishq)</em> not to mention his famous poem <em>Ode of the Soul (al-Qaṣidah al-‘ayniyyah)</em>, the presence of Sufi and gnostic elements are vividly apparent to those who follow this interpretation.</p>

<p>
With Avicenna, who represents the pinnacle of rationalistic philosophy
in Persia, came two other intellectual trends. On the one side
there was the towering figure of Abū Ḥāmid
Ghazzālī, who rejected philosophy altogether and became the
exponent of Sufism alone. On the other side, there arose
Ismā‘īlīs philosophy, which incorporated Sufi
and Hermetico-Pythagorean ideas within a philosophical
context.</p>

<p>
Ghazzālī, an orthodox jurist and a major exponent of faith
based theology (<em>Ash‘arite</em>) having studied philosophy,
thought discursive reasoning stood on a solid ground but soon turned
against philosophy, offering a devastating critique of reason in his
<em>The Incoherence of Philosophers</em> (<em>Tahāfut
al-falāsifah</em>). Having been disillusioned with
intellectual sciences, he practiced asceticism for a number of years in
seclusion and finally found his answers in the Sufi tradition. The
spiritual journey of Ghazzālī from an orthodox jurist to a
Sufi is one of the most remarkable accounts of the transformation of a
Muslim sage who turned from the outward to the inner life of Islam and
found Sufism to be the only path that leads to truth. He spent
the later part of his life teaching, writing and practicing
Sufism.</p>

<p>
Ghazzālī is one of the few mystics whose brand of Sufism
embraces religious orthodoxy, a gnostic intellectual framework, and the
more practical and ascetic dimension of the spiritual path.
Contrary to the antinomian Sufis, who violated the Islamic law
(<em>Shari‘ah</em>) and the more relaxed attitude of some of the
other Sufis, Ghazzālī was an austere and ardent observer of
Islamic law.</p>

<p>
He wrote extensively on mysticism, arguing it to be the only right path
to truth. A notable piece among his writings on mysticism is
<em>The Niche of Light</em> (<em>Mishkāt al-anwār</em>), a
significant work of an illuminationist nature and one that influenced
the formation of the doctrine of illumination (<em>ishrāq</em>)
by Suhrawardī (Aminrazavi 1996). Also, parts of his Magnum Opus,
<em>Revival of Religious Sciences</em> (<em>Iḥyā’
al-‘ulūm al-dīnī</em>), such as book
thirty-five of the <em>Iḥyā’: The Book
of Faith in Divine Unity and Trust in Divine Providence</em>, are
essentially devoted to an explication of the Sufi doctrine.
He also has written numerous shorter commentaries on the
spiritual significance of fasting, praying, invocation of divine names
and attributes, and spiritual music as instruments of the catharsis of
the soul.</p>

<h2 id="IsmaTrad">2. The Isma‘ili Tradition</h2>

<p>
On the Ismā‘īlīs side, the use of the esoteric
doctrine of Hermeticism and the Greco-Alexandrian mystical teachings
were adopted by Ismā‘īlīs philosophers.
Such concepts as emanation from the One, asceticism, the body as prison
with the soul as its inmate, initiation into the mysteries of gnosis
(<em>ma‘rifah</em>), levels of interpretations of spiritual
hermeneutics (<em>ta’wīl</em>), sacred geometry with its
mystical symbolism, cycles of prophecy, and the initiatic role of
Shi‘ite Imams are among many of the mystical themes of
Ismā‘īlī philosophical tradition. Among
the most notable Ismā‘īlī figures in the
10<sup>th</sup> and 11<sup>th</sup> century CE is Jabir Ibn
Ḥayyān, (c. 721–c. 815 CE) who was more of a scientist
and chemist and as such offered in his <em>The Book of
Stones</em> (<em>Kitāb al-aḥjār</em>) a mystical
interpretation of the science of letters and the esoteric mathematical
concepts that are influenced by Pythagorean geometry. It should
be noted that he was a figure under whose name works by many diverse
thinkers may have been collected. Abū Ya‘qub
Sijistānī was also a notable figure in the movement whose
mystical writings in <em>Unveiling of the Hidden</em> (<em>Kashf
al-maḥjūb</em>) and <em>The Book of Well Springs
(Kitāb al-yanābi‘</em>) provide an esoteric
commentary on major philosophical and religious matters (see Nasr &amp;
Aminrazavi 1999/2001). Sijistānī, whose writings should be
regarded as a spiritual commentary on the gnostic doctrine pertaining
to the flight of the soul toward its paradisal state, centers around
the oneness of God, the intellects both Divine and human, and different
types of souls together with their relationship with the body. In
the above mentioned works, Sijistānī systematically treats
notions of creation, the role of prophets as spiritual guides, and the
hidden symbolism of their teachings. As one goes from the outward
to the inward and esoteric level of Islam, one gains the consciousness
which is the key to understanding the symbolism of prophetic
teachings. Among other major figures and esoteric mystical texts
in this vein is Abū Ḥātim Rāzī’s
(811–891 CE) <em>Science of Prophecy</em> (<em>A‘lām
al-nubuwwah</em>), in which he applies the concept of emanation to the
cosmological notion of <em>Be</em> (<em>kun</em>) and offers a mystical
commentary on how human soul is a trace of the higher soul that is
perfect.</p>

<p>
Also, one must mention Ḥamīd al-Dīn
Kirmānī (d. 996–1021 CE) and his numerous writings on
Sufism and gnosticism, the most notable of which is his <em>Repose of
the Intellect</em> (<em>Rāḥat al-‘aql</em>). A
prominent Ismā‘īlī philosopher, considered by
some as the “Ismā‘īlīs’ Ibn
Sīnā,” he argued that an understanding of truth is based on
two precepts. First, one has to live a morally virtuous life and
second, the adept must prepare himself philosophically. The
chapters of <em>R</em><em>ā</em><em>ḥat
al-‘aql</em> are called <em>aswar</em> (walls) and
the paragraphs, <em>mash</em><em>ā</em><em>ri</em>‘
(paths). The novice has to travel through fifty-six paths within
seven walls in order for the soul to gain the knowledge of
Reality. Reality, according to Kirmānī, is
divided into four different levels: first is the world of Divine
creation or the incorporeal world
(<em>‘al</em><em>ā</em><em>m
al-ibd</em><em>ā</em><em>‘</em>), second, the corporeal
realm (<em>‘</em><em>ā</em><em>lam al-jism</em>), third,
the domain of religion (<em>‘al</em><em>ā</em><em>m
al-d</em><em>ī</em><em>n</em>), and finally, the return
of the world to its original unity with God (Baumstark 1932;
Corbin 1961; Corbin 1964, 130–1; Hunzai 1986).</p>

<p>
Perhaps the most important figure of the
Ismā‘īlīs tradition, one who was both poet and
philosopher, is Nāṣir-i Khusraw (1004–c.1072 CE).
Whether in his collection of mystical and didactic poems known as
<em>Divān</em>, or his mystically oriental works such as <em>The
Sum of the Two Wisdoms</em> (<em>Jāmi‘
al-ḥikmattayīn</em>) and <em>Knowledge and Liberation</em>
(<em>Gushāyesh wa rahāyesh</em>), he relentlessly offers
advice on the catharsis of the soul and the pursuing of the spiritual
journey. Nāṣir-i Khusraw’s attempt to reconcile Sufism and
reason is seen in his <em>The Sum of the Two Wisdoms</em>, where he
argues that the “sages of real religion”
(<em>ḥukamāy-i dīn-i ḥaqq</em>) and the
philosophers are in agreement. For Nāṣir-i Khusraw, the
science of the soul is the way to attain real knowledge, knowledge
which transcends the difference between the perceiver and
perception. In one poem he writes:</p>

<blockquote>

Between the knower and the known.<br />
There lies a distinction by one who<br />
Has awakened from sleep of heedlessness.
</blockquote>

<p>

Nāṣir-i Khusraw offers specific instructions how a
novice should follow the spiritual path, relying on specific ascetic
practices. Similar to the figures of St. Augustine and St.
Francis of Assisi, Nāṣir-i Khusraw pursued a hedonistic
lifestyle in the early part of his life but underwent a spiritual
metamorphosis and dedicated himself to the Sufi path. Echoes from
both phases of his life can be seen through out his works (Hunsburger
2000).</p>

<p>
There are also several encyclopedic works of the
Ismā‘īlī tradition whose authors are unknown.
Many of these deal with mystical and Sufi ideas. Among the works that
have been influential in the spread of gnostic ideas are treatises
like <em>Brethren of Purity</em> (<em>Ikhwān
al-ṣafā</em>) and <em>The Mother of Books (Umm
al-kitāb</em>) (Daftary 1990; Nasr &amp; Aminrazavi
1999/2001).</p>

<h2 id="PeriCessSchoShir">3. The “Period of Cessation” and the School of Shiraz</h2>

<p>
Traditionally, historians of philosophy have argued that after
Ghazzālī in the 11<sup>th</sup> century CE, philosophical
activity in the Persian and Eastern part of the Islamic world was
eclipsed and shifted to Islamic Spain. There are those who attribute
this to Ghazzālī’s scathing attack on the
philosophers, but this is mostly a myth. The Islamic world at the time
was so large, and the intellectual milieu so rich and diverse, that no
single book could put an end to its philosophy and discursive
reasoning.  While it is true that Peripatetic philosophy suffered a
temporary eclipse in Persia, the reason lies in the socio-political
realities of the Saljūq dynasty and the Islamic world’s
struggle with external forces like the Crusades. Recent scholarship
has revealed that the so called period of cessation was actually a
thriving era of intellectual activity in the Southern part of Persia
where the so called the “School of Shiraz” emerged. This
School whose salient feature was to synthesis rationalism, mysticism,
intellectual intuition and even popular Sufism was undoubtedly the
precursor to the School of Isfahan.</p>

<p>
Among the great masters of philosophical mysticism hailing from Spain,
Ibn Masarrah (883–931 CE) stands out. He was an ascetic whose
views on the mystic quest for unity of the soul with God comprised a
major theme in his philosophical mysticism. Others include Ibn
Ḥazm (994–1064), who emphasized mystical love, Ibn-Bājjah
(1095–1138 CE) who treated the concept of intellectual and mystical
intuition as the faculty that experiences Divine realities, Ibn Al-Sid
of Badajoz (1052–1127 CE) who developed what some have called
mathematical mysticism, and Ibn-Ṭufayl (c. 1105–1185 CE),
whose mystical allegory <em>Son of the Living Awake</em> (Ḥayy
ibn Yaqẓān) and his concept of Active Intellect, made him a
major exponent of mysticism in the Islamic philosophical
tradition. Finally there is the Sufi philosopher, Ibn
Sab‘īn (1217–1268 CE) who made an effort to bring about a
rapprochement between philosophy and Sufism in a systematic treatment
of mystical themes.</p>

<p>
Despite the significance of the above figures, none of them reached the
eminence of the greatest master of gnostic and philosophical Sufism,
Shaykh Muḥyī al-Dīn Ibn ‘Arabī
(1165–1240 CE) often referred to Shaykh al-Akbar (The Great
Master). Ibn ‘Arabī, whose encyclopedic works,
<em>The Bezels of Wisdom</em> (<em>Fuṣūṣ
al-ḥakam</em>) and <em>Meccean Victories</em>
(<em>Futuḥāt al-Makkiyah</em>), provide us with one of the
most complex mystical paradigms in the Islamic mystical genre.
Often referred to as the “Doctrine of the Unity of Being”
(<em>wahdat al-wūjūd</em>), Ibn ‘Arabī’s
philosophical mysticism offers a vast synthesis of gnostic and Sufi
ideas as well as a type of philosophical discourse which, for the first
time, formulates the Sufi doctrine. With Ibn ‘Arabī,
we see a monumental effort to comment on a full array of metaphysical,
cosmological, and psychological aspects of Gnosticism, thereby
providing a vision of reality whose attainment requires the practice of
the Sufi path. Ibn ‘Arabī’s
philosophico-mystical edifice is a process of spiritual hermeneutics
(<em>ta’wīl</em>) which relies on the language of symbolism
to guide a novice from the exterior (<em>ẓāhir</em>) to
the interior (<em>bāṭin</em>). For Ibn
‘Arabī, the entire cosmos represents signs
(<em>ayāt</em>) which lend themselves to symbolic exegesis, a
process whose pinnacle is the Universal Man (<em>al-insān
al-kāmil</em>). Ibn ‘Arabī, whose doctrine of
the Unity of Being (<em>waḥdat al-wūjūd</em>) has
been interpreted by many to be pantheism, was nevertheless careful to
argue that even though God dwells in things, but the world “is
not” in God. For Ibn ‘Arabī, humans are
microcosms and the universe is the macrocosm; the Universal Man is the
one who realizes all of his inherent potentialities, including the
Divine breath which was blown into man by God in the beginning of
creation as the Qur’an says. For Ibn ‘Arabī, it
is the spiritual realization of God within the soul that leads to union
with God (see Nasr 1964; Chittick 1989 and 2007).</p>

<p>
In the 12<sup>th</sup> century CE, during the so called “period
of cessation” of philosophical activities, the most notable
figure was the philosopher-mystic, Shaykh Shihāb al-Dīn
Suhrawardī, the founder of the School of Illumination
(<em>Ishrāq</em>). Suhrawardī, who was a Peripatetic, wrote
four major works, primarily in the Aristotelian tradition. He
also wrote a number of works in a peculiar esoteric tradition, using
what he called “the language of illumination”
(<em>lisān al-ishrāq</em>). In his illuminationist
writings, Suhrawardī relies on Neoplatonism but replaces such
concepts as being and existence with light and illumination, thus
offering what can be called a gnostic-illuminationist version of
Avicennian philosophy (Aminrazavi 2003). He offers his doctrine of
illumination in his major work, <em>The Philosophy of Illumination</em>
(<em>Ḥikmat al-ishrāq</em>).</p>

<p>
In his Sufi writings, Suhrawardī employs both allegory and
didactic language to advise the novice how to follow the Sufi path,
often with specific instructions regarding ascetic practices.
Practical wisdom constitutes an inseparable component of the
<em>ishrāqī</em> doctrine, so much so that in the
introduction to his magnum opus, <em>The Philosophy of
Illumination</em>, Suhrawardī warns the reader that the secrets
of the book will remain hidden to the reader unless he fasts for forty
days and avoids consuming meat. Suhrawardī, similar to Ibn
‘Arabī, uses symbolism from nature and animals to offer a
spiritual hermeneutic (<em>ta’wīl</em>) which begins with
discursive philosophy but ends in gnosis and the spiritual return of
man to his original abode.</p>

<p>
Suhrawardī is also credited with having advocated an
epistemological theory known as “knowledge by presence”
(‘<em>ilm al-ḥuḍurī</em>), in which knowledge
is attained directly and experientially when the knower, known, and
the epistemic relation become one and the same (Yazdi 1992).
Suhrawardī’s works on Sufism, most of which are written in
Persian, include <em>The Red Intellect</em> (<em>‘Aql-i
surkh</em>), <em>The Chant of Gabriel’s Wing</em> (<em>Āwaz-i
par-i Jibrā’īl</em>), <em>Story of the Occidental
Exile</em> (<em>Qiṣṣat al-ghurbat
al-gharbiyyah</em>), <em>Language of the Termites</em> (<em>Lughat-i
murān</em>), <em>Treatise on the State of Childhood</em>
(<em>Risālah fi ḥālat al-ṭufuliyyah</em>), <em>A
Day Among the Sufis</em> (<em>Ruzī bā jamā‘at-i
ṣufiyān</em>), <em>The Sound of the Griffin</em>
(<em>Safir-i simurg</em>), <em>Treatise of the Nocturnal Ascent</em>
(<em>Risālah fi’l-mi‘rāj</em>), and <em>Treatise
of Illumination (Partaw-nāmah</em>) (Aminrazavi 1994).</p>

<p>
Suhrawardī’s illuminationist philosophy has influenced many
philosophers who wrote major commentaries on gnostic and Sufi texts,
among whom are Qutb al-Dīn Shirāzī (1236–1311
CE), Muḥammad Shahrazurī (d. 1153 CE), and Ibn Turkah
Iṣfahānī (c. 1362–1433 CE) Following
Suhrawardī there is an even closer nexus between philosophy and
mysticism. A number of rationalistic philosophers who adhered to Sufi
ideas and often practiced Sufism, became exponents of philosophical
mysticism. The post Suhrawardīan philosopher-mystics, who
continued to refine the rapprochement between philosophy and
mysticism, have come to be known as the “School of
Shirāz.”</p>

<p>
Recent scholarship has revealed that what has traditionally been
regarded as the period of cessation of philosophical activities in
Persia was, after all, a very thriving period in philosophical
activities in the Southern part of Persia. Between
11<sup>th</sup>–16<sup>th</sup> century, Shiraz became the center of
Sufi and gnostic thought in Persia. Beginning with Quṭb
al-Dīn Shirāzī, who wrote a major commentary on
Suhrawardī’s <em>Philosophy of Illumnination</em> in
attempt to clarify Suhrawardī’s illuminative thought, the
School of Shiraz produced a number of philosopher-Sufis.
Quṭb al-Din Shirāzī’s successor, Mīr
Ṣadr al-Dīn Dashtakī (1424 CE) dealt with the
problem of existence and the question of its principality.
Jalāl al-Dīn Dawānī (1427 CE), another
philosopher of this tradition, wrote on the exoteric subjects like law
as well as esoteric matters. His work on the relationship between
Sufism, ethics, and illuminationist thought entitled <em>Sparks of
Illumination in the Virtues of Ethics (Lawāmi‘
al-ishrāq fī makārim al-akhlāq</em>), also
knows as <em>Jalalian Ethics (Akhlāq-ī
Jalālī</em> ) is of particular importance. This work
is still used today by Sufi masters as a practical guide on how
spiritual ethics can cleanse the soul. Dawānī also
wrote a number of commentaries on Suhrawardī’s philosophy
of illumination, such as <em>Forms of Brightness Concerning the Temples
of Light</em> (<em>Shawākil al-ḥur fī sharḥ
hayākil al-nūr</em>). The next philosopher-mystic
belonging to the School of Shirāz is Ghiyāth al-Dīn
Manṣur Dashtakī (b.1461), the oldest son of
Ṣadr al-Dīn Dashtakī and the greatest gnostic
philosopher of this period. Called a “one man
university,” he was well versed in law and jurisprudence as well
as theoretical Sufism. Notable among his many works is his
<em>Stations of Wisdom</em> (<em>Maqāmāt
al-‘ārifīn</em>), a profoundly gnostic work which
came to symbolize the spirit of the School of Shirāz.
Dashtakī here presents a rich esoteric commentary on the verses
of the Qur’an, the ḥadith and the sayings of such Sufi
masters as Ḥallāj (858–922 CE), Rūmī
(1207–1273 CE), and Ḥāfiz (1320–1388 CE) among others,
providing the reader with an understanding of how the love of God can
lead to the transcendental unity of being. The influence of
Ibn ‘Arabī is quite evident in this piece. Once again
rapprochement between peripatetic philosophy,
<em>ishrāqī</em> doctrine, theology, and gnosticism
(<em>‘irfān</em>) is made in order to help the seeker of
truth find his path through the maze of spiritual pitfalls.</p>

<p>
Among other philosophers of this period not necessarily affiliated with
the School of Shirāz, but interested in Sufism, are
Naṣīr al-Dīn Ṭūsī (1201–1274) who
wrote a work on Sufi ethics entitled <em>Description of Nobles</em>
(<em>Awṣāf al-ashrāf</em>), as well as Afd’al
al-Dīn Kāshānī (d. 1213), a Sufi poet and
philosopher. The latter was a strict Aristotelian who wrote
extensive commentary on logic and other aspects of Aristotelian
thought. While the majority of his fifty-two works are
philosophical in nature, Kāshānī sees the task of
philosophy to be the facilitation of “following the path of
God,” as the title of one of his works suggests. His
commentary on Ibn ‘Arabī, his references to other gnostics
and Sufis, and his mystical poetry, have identified him more as a Sufi
than a rationalistic philosopher. Writing quatrains in the style
of Omar Khayyam (1048–1131), it is in his poetry that Sufism is most
apparent. In a quatrain he says,</p>

<blockquote>

O pure Sufi seeking God,<br />
He has no place, from where do you seek him<br />
If you do know Him, why do you seek Him?<br />
If you don’t know Him, whom are you seeking? (Chittick 2001)
</blockquote>

<p>
Moving from Persia to India, in the 11<sup>th</sup> century CE., when
the Persian dynasty of Ghaznavids began to rule in India,
philosophical mysticism and the practice of Sufism became popular
among the Indian Muslim philosophers. Among the central figures of
this movement are Shaykh Yousef Gardiī Multānī, Shaykh
Ismā‘īl Lahorī, Imām Ḥasan
San‘ānī, and Shaykh Abu’l-Ḥasan
‘Alī Hujwaīrī, the philosopher-Sufi and the
author of <em>Unveiling of the Veiled</em> (<em>Kashf
al-maḥjūb</em>). At that time, the
Ismā‘īlī missionaries, who had spread the gnostic
interpretation of Islam in India had already created a receptive
intellectual milieu for the Sufi and gnostic ideas. By the
14<sup>th</sup> century CE., due to the migration of Persian
philosophers and their students to northern India, the more mystically
oriented philosophy of the above figures gained popularity in India as
well.</p>

<p>
Within the next two centuries, despite the rise and fall of several
dynasties, the patronage of philosophers in India in general did not
change. Sufi patronage reached a new high during the Mongol period,
whose rulers were particularly keen in the Sufi tradition in all its
manifestations; especially philosophy, poetry and the visual
arts. Such notable Persian philosophers as Taftazānī
(c. 1322–1390 CE) and Jurjānī (1097–1127 CE)
went to India at this time. They were followed by such figures as
Mīr Fatḥ Allāh Shirāzī, who reformed the
educational curriculums to emphasize the teachings of the mystical
philosophies of his Persian teachers.</p>

<p>
Philosophical mysticism continued in the Islamic philosophical
tradition of northern India in figures such as Khāwjah
Muḥammad Baqī bi’llāh (b.1563), a celebrated
mystic and the founder of Naqshbandī Sufi order, as well as in
his student Shaykh Aḥmad Sirhindī (1564–1624), the
proponent of the doctrine of “The Unity of Consciousness”
(<em>waḥdat al-shuhūd</em>) and the author of
<em>Epistoles</em> (<em>Maktubāt</em>). Other Muslim
philosophers from the Indo-Pakistani continent who incorporated
mysticism were Mullā ‘Abd al-Ḥakīm
Siyalkotī, Mullā Maḥmūd Junpurī
Faruqī, and Mīrzā Muḥammad Zāhid
Harawī (1603–1652), who became the proponent of
Suhrawardī’s illuminationist philosophy; and, perhaps the
most well known philosopher-mystic, Shāh Waliullāh, who
lived in the 18<sup>th</sup> century CE. Waliullāh made an
attempt to reconcile Ibn-‘Arabī’s doctrine of
“The Unity of Being” (<em>waḥdat
al-wūjūd</em>) and Sirhindī’s doctrine of
“The Unity of Consciousness” (<em>waḥdat
al-shuhūd</em>). In addition to his numerous writings on
the foundation of Sufi metaphysics, Shāh Waliullāh should
be given credit for bringing legitimacy to mystical doctrine despite
the attacks of orthodox jurists who saw Sufism as heretical.</p>

<h2 id="SchoIsfaMullSadr">4. The School of Isfahan and Mulla Sadra</h2>

<p>
Back in Persia, came the advent of the Safavid dynasty in the
16<sup>th</sup> century CE, the founders of which were
practicing Sufis affiliated with the grand Sufi master,
Ṣafī al-Dīn Ardabīlī (1252–1334
CE). There the use of Sufi doctrine, philosophy, and asceticism
within a single philosophical paradigm reached its pinnacle. The
most important issue of what came to be called the “School of
Isfahan” was the “reality of being”
(<em>ḥaqiqat al-wūjūd</em> ) as opposed to the
“concept of being” (<em>mafhūm
al-wūjūd</em>).</p>

<p>
The founder of the School of Isfahan, Mīr Dāmād
(d. 1631 or 1632 CE), was a follower of Suhrawardī’s
philosophy of illumination, even choosing the pen name
<em>ishrāq</em> (illumination). He not only wrote
extensively on the metaphysical foundation of mysticism in his major
work <em>Sparks of Fire</em> (<em>al-Qabasāt</em>), and in
his <em>Ecstasies</em> (<em>Al-Jadhawāt</em>), <em>Heavenly
Mystical States</em> (<em>Khalsat al-malakūt</em>), and his
<em>Disassociations</em> (<em>al-Khl‘iyyāt</em>), he also
wrote mystical poetry. Even though Mīr Dāmād wrote
extensively on peripatetic philosophy, and especially the concept of
time, he is to be credited with a gnostic interpretation of Avicennan
philosophy. His philosophico-mystical structure, based on the
principality of essence, provides the intellectual frame work for the
ascendance of the soul and its eventual unity with its source.</p>

<p>
It was however, his student Ṣadr al-Dīn
Shirāzī, known as Mullā Ṣadrā, who is
perhaps the greatest metaphysician of the Islamic philosophical
tradition. His grand synthesis of discursive philosophy,
intellectual intuition, and asceticism came to be known as the
“Transcendental Theo-Sophy” (<em>al-ḥikmat
al-muta‘āliyah</em>). This philosophical perspective,
according to Mullā Ṣadrā, was unveiled to him by God
after many years of inner purification. With Mullā
Ṣadrā, an attempt to offer a spiritual commentary
(<em>ta’wīl</em>) from a Shi‘ite gnostic perspective
on the Qur’an and the concept of “spiritual
guardianship” (<em>wilāyah</em>) reaches its pinnacle.</p>

<p>
His magnum opus, <em>The Four Journeys of the Intellect</em>
(<em>al-Asfār al-arba‘āt al-‘aqliyyah</em>) is
a philosophical and gnostic exposition of the highest caliber, in which
the descending and ascending journey of the soul from and to God is
treated in detail. This work, which is an encyclopedia of gnosis,
philosophy, and mysticism, incorporates much of what Ibn
‘Arabī and other philosopher-mystics had brought forth to
date. For Mullā Ṣadrā, creation represents
four journeys: the Fall, in which unity becomes multiplicity is the
first, followed by one’s earthly journey wherein the pain of
separation causes an existential yearning towards one’s original
abode. According to Mullā Ṣadrā, man’s
spiritual ascendance through the path of Sufism and
gnosticism constitutes the third part of this journey until unity once
again is accomplished. Finally there is the sojourn in the Divine
realm, from Truth (<em>ḥaqq</em>) to Truth, a station only few
of the spiritual elites may ever experience.</p>

<p>
Mullā Ṣadrā can be regarded as the reviver of the
authentic mystical wisdom to be attained through mysticism and the
intellectual intuition not divorced from rationality. Mullā
Ṣadrā makes extensive use of logical analyses and
demonstrative proofs, which rest on what he calls “illuminative
principle” (<em>qā‘idah ishraqiyyah</em>); that is,
what has entered the heart (<em>al-varidāt al-qalbiyyah</em>), or
“Divinely realized knowledge” (<em>taḥqīq
‘arshī</em>).</p>

<p>
Some works that are indicative of his commitment to philosophical
mysticism are, <em>Metaphysical Penetrations</em>
(<em>al-Mashāri‘</em>), <em>Wisdom of the Throne</em>
(<em>Ḥikmat al-‘arshiyah</em>), <em>The Unity of the
Knower and the Known</em> (<em>Ittiḥād al-‘āqil
wa’l-ma‘qūl</em>), and <em>Secrets of the
Qur’anic Verses</em> (<em>Asrār al-āyāt</em>), a
gnostic commentary on the famous light verses.</p>

<p>
Mullā Ṣadrā left an indelible mark upon Islamic
philosophy, and especially on the nexus between philosophy and
mysticism, making the integration of mysticism an assumed part of
philosophizing. His students carried out his philosophical legacy
well into the modern era. ‘Abd al-Razzāq
Lāhijī (d. 1661–1662 CE) wrote a commentary upon <em>The
Secrets of the Garden</em> (<em>Sharḥ-i gulshan-i
rāz</em>), which is a detailed exposition of the spiritual path
and one’s journey through the maze of the states and stations of
the Sufi path, Mīr Findiriskī (d. 1640–41 CE) wrote a
mystical commentary upon <em>Yoga Vaishishe</em>, and Mullā
Muḥsin Fayḍ Kāshānī (d. 1680 CE) wrote
a mystical treatise entitled <em>The Hidden Words</em>
(<em>Kalimāt-i maknunah</em>) as well as <em>Divine Gnosis</em>
(<em>al-Ma‘ārif al-ilāhiyyah</em>).
Qāḍī Sa‘id Qummī (d. 1696 CE), another
student of Mullā Ṣadrā and a stanch Neoplatonist
authored a number of mystical treatises such as the <em>Secrets of
Worships</em> (<em>Asrār al-‘ibādāt</em>) as
well as a major gnostic work titled <em>Commentary Upon The
Enneads</em> (<em>Ta‘liqāt bar
Uthūlūjiyā</em>), scil. The pseudo-Aristotelian
<em>Theology of Aristotle</em>, derived from the <em>Enneads</em> of
Plotinus. (See infra <em>The Theology of Aristotle</em> by Peter
Adamson.)</p>

<p>
The above works, all of which are continuations of Ṣadrian
philosophy, further elaborate the fine points of transcendentalist
theo-sophy, which was firmly based on the principality of existence
over essence, gradation, and the oneness that appears as
multiplicity. The question is how to transcend the world of
objects which appears as many, to see the Oneness which lies at the
heart of multiplicity. The post Suhrawardīan and Sadrian
answer is that a combination of practical wisdom and intellectual
intuition which transcends discursive reasoning, provides one with the
vision to see the Oneness lying at the heart of multiplicity.</p>

<h2 id="Conc">5. Conclusion</h2>

<p>
Even though post Sadrian philosophy in the Islamic tradition never
reached the level of accomplishment of the great masters of the Safavid
period, Sadra’s school of metaphysics found followers in the
periods that were to follow, both in and outside of Persia. While
Mullā Ṣadrā’s influence was marginal in the
Arab world, which has generally seemed to distance itself from
traditional metaphysical issues, in India, Ṣadrian philosophy
was well received and it is taught in traditional schools today.</p>

<p>
With the advent of the Qājār dynasty in Iran in the early
18<sup>th</sup> century CE., Ṣadrian philosophy once again
became the focal point of philosophical activity. The greatest
proponents of gnosis and philosophical mysticism in this period came to
be known as the “School of Tehran.” This school included
Mullā ‘Alī Nurī (d. 1830–1 CE) whose
<em>Glosses upon the Secrets of Verses</em> is an esoteric commentary
on certain verses of the Qur’an, Mullā
Ismā‘īl Khāju‘ī (d. 1759 CE), who wrote
on the concept of time within a gnostic context, and the most
celebrated figure in this period, Ḥājj Mullā
Hādī Sabziwārī (1797–1873 CE) whose
<em>Commentary on Treatises</em> (<em>Sharḥ-i
manẓumah</em>) is a compendium of philosophical gnosticism.
Sabziwārī, who also wrote mystical poetry under the
pen-name <em>Asrār</em> (<em>Secrets</em>), brought about a
rapprochement among many different strands of mystical philosophy and
considered asceticism to be a central part of living a philosophical
life. With Sabziwārī’s death in 1797 CE., Tehran
became the center of philosophical activity, much of which centered
around the philosophy of Mullā Ṣadrā and
Sabziwārī. The salient features of the School of Tehran were
that knowledge is hierarchical in essence and that discursive
philosophy, while useful, is ultimately limited. In this tradition, it
is through intellectual intuition, illumination, and inner
purification that the reality of existence can be experienced
(Sabzavārī 1969; Ashtiyānī 1973) . Among other
masters of this period are Mullā ‘Abdallāh Zunuzī
(d. 1841–42 CE), the author of <em>Divine Flashes of Light</em>
(<em>al-Lama‘āt al-ilāhiyyah</em>), and his son,
Mullā ‘Alī Zunuzī (d. 1889–1900 CE), who
authored <em>Marvels of Wisdom</em> (<em>Badāyi‘
al-ḥikam</em>). Both of their works are gnostic and mystical
commentaries upon a wide range of philosophical problems. Because the
School of Tehran was dominated by grand scholars who were also
jurists, it continued in the Ṣadrian and Sabziwārian
tradition, but distanced itself from popular Sufism, with whom they
identified relaxed attitude and even antinomian tendencies towards
Islamic law (<em>Shari‘ah</em>). Emphasis on piety, asceticism,
and cleansing of the soul within the prescribed limits of the
<em>Shari‘ah</em>, perhaps partially a reaction to modernity, is
the salient feature of the School of Tehran.</p>

<p>
The number of Muslim philosophers who became proponents of mystical
philosophy in the Islamic world are too numerous to mention here, but
clearly mysticism is a living tradition that continues to occupy center
stage in the philosophy in the Muslim world. It is virtually
impossible to fully account for all the traditions of mysticism in the
Islamic philosophical tradition, however such traditions do exist in
almost every Muslim country today (see Kiliç 1996).</p>

<p>

The impact of mysticism on Islamic philosophy has been so profound
that it has changed the very essence and definition of
philosophizing. The enterprise of philosophizing in the Islamic
tradition is seen by most not merely as an intellectual exercise but as
the intellectual dimension of the soul’s spiritual journey
towards the unveiling of truth. Authentic philosophy, according
to Muslim philosopher-mystics is therefore committed to providing a
rationalistic commentary upon those issues which traditionally belonged
to the mystical domain only.</p>
