<h1>Reichenbach’s Common Cause Principle</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Thu Sep 23, 1999; substantive revision Wed Aug 18, 2010</em></div>

<p>

Suppose that two geysers, about one mile apart, erupt at irregular
intervals, but usually erupt almost exactly at the same time. One would
suspect that they come from a common source, or at least that there is
a common cause of their eruptions. And this common cause surely acts
before both eruptions take place. This idea, that simultaneous
correlated events must have prior common causes, was first made precise
by Hans Reichenbach (Reichenbach 1956). It can be used to infer the
existence of unobserved and unobservable events, and to infer causal
relations from statistical relations. Unfortunately it does not appear
to be universally valid, nor is there agreement as to the circumstances
in which it is valid. </p>

<h2><a name="1">1. Common Cause Principles</a></h2>

<p>

There exist in the literature several, closely related, common cause
principles. In the next three subsections I describe three such common
cause principles.</p>

<h3><a name="1.1">1.1 Reichenbach's Common Cause Principle</a></h3>

<p>

It seems that a correlation between events <em>A</em> and <em>B</em>
indicates either that <em>A</em> causes <em>B</em>, or that <em>B</em>
causes <em>A</em>, or that <em>A</em> and <em>B</em> have a common
cause. It also seems that causes always occur before their effects
and, thus, that common causes always occur before the correlated
events.  Reichenbach was the first to formalize this idea rather
precisely. He suggested that when
Pr(<em>A</em>&amp;<em>B</em>) &gt;
Pr(<em>A</em>) × Pr(<em>B</em>) for simultaneous
events <em>A</em> and <em>B</em>, there exists an earlier common cause
<em>C</em> of <em>A</em> and <em>B</em>, such that
Pr(<em>A</em>/<em>C</em>) &gt;
Pr(<em>A</em>/~<em>C</em>),
Pr(<em>B</em>/<em>C</em>) &gt;
Pr(<em>B</em>/~<em>C</em>),
Pr(A&amp;<em>B</em>/<em>C</em>) =
Pr(<em>A</em>/<em>C</em>) × Pr(<em>B</em>/<em>C</em>)
and Pr(<em>A</em>&amp;<em>B</em>/~<em>C</em>) =
Pr(<em>A</em>/~<em>C</em>) × Pr(<em>B</em>/~<em>C</em>). (See
Reichenbach 1956 pp. 158–159.) <em>C</em> is said to ‘screen
off’ the correlation between <em>A</em> and <em>B</em> when
<em>A</em> and <em>B</em> are uncorrelated conditional upon
<em>C</em>. Thus Reichenbach's principle can also be formulated as
follows: simultaneous correlated events have a prior common cause that
screens off the 
 correlation.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#1" name="return-1">1</a>]</sup>
 <sup>[<a href="notes.html#2" name="return-2">2</a>]</sup>
 </p> 

<p>

Reichenbach's common cause principle needs to be modified. Consider,
for instance, the following example. Harry normally takes the 8 a.m.
train from New York to Washington. But he does not like full trains,
so if the 8 a.m. train is full he sometimes takes the next train. He
also likes trains that have diner cars, so if the 8 a.m. train does
not have a diner car he sometimes takes the next train. If the 8
a.m. train is both full and has no diner car, he is very likely to
take the next train. Johnny, an unrelated commuter, also normally
takes the 8 a.m.  train from New York to Washington. Johnny, it so
happens, also does not like full trains, and he also likes diner
cars. Whether or not Harry and Johnny take the 8 a.m. train will
therefore be correlated. But, since the probability of Harry and
Johnny taking the 8 a.m. train depends on the occurrence of two
distinct events (the train being full, the train having a diner car)
there is no single event <em>C</em>, such that conditional upon
<em>C</em> and conditional upon ~<em>C</em> we have independence. Thus
Reichenbach's common cause principle as stated above is violated. Yet
this example clearly does not violate the spirit of Reichenbach's
common cause principle, for there is a partition into four
possibilities such that conditional upon each of these four
possibilities the correlation disappears.</p>

<p>

More generally, we would like to have a common cause principle for
cases in which the common causes and the effects are sets of
quantities with continuous or discrete sets of values, rather than
single events that occur or do not occur. A natural way to modify
Reichenbach's common cause principle in order to deal with such types
of cases is as follows. If simultaneous values of quantities
<em>A</em> and <em>B</em> are correlated, then there are common causes
<em>C</em><sub>1</sub>,<em>C</em><sub>2</sub>,…,<em>C<sub>n</sub></em>,
such that conditional upon any combination of values of these
quantities at an earlier time, the values of
<em>A</em> and <em>B</em> are probabilistically independent. (For a
fuller discussion of modifications like this, including cases in which
there are correlations between more than two quantities, see Uffink
(1999)). I will continue to call this generalization
‘Reichenbach's common cause principle’, since, in spirit,
it is very close to the principle that Reichenbach originally
stated.</p>

<p>

Now let me turn to two principles, the ‘causal Markov
condition’ and the ‘law of conditional independence’,
that are closely related to Reichenbach's common cause principle.</p>

<h3><a name="1.2">1.2 The Causal Markov Condition</a></h3>

<p>

There is a long tradition of attempts to infer causal relations among
a set of quantities from probabilistic facts about the values of these
quantities. In order to be able to do so, one needs principles
relating causal facts and probabilistic facts. A principle that has
been used to great effect in Spirtes, Glymour &amp; Scheines 1993, is
the ‘causal Markov condition’. This principle holds of a
set of quantities
{<em>Q</em><sub>1</sub>,…,<em>Q</em><sub><em>n</em></sub>} if
and only if the values of any quantity <em>Q</em><sub><em>i</em></sub>
in that set, conditional upon the values of all the quantities in the
set that are direct causes of <em>Q</em><sub><em>i</em></sub>, are
probabilistically independent of the values of all quantities in the
set other than <em>Q</em><sub><em>i</em></sub>'s
 effects.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#3" name="return-3">3</a>]</sup>
 The causal Markov condition implies the following version of the
common cause principle: If <em>Q</em><sub><em>i</em></sub> and
<em>Q</em><sub><em>j</em></sub> are correlated and
<em>Q</em><sub><em>i</em></sub> is not a cause of
<em>Q</em><sub><em>j</em></sub>, and <em>Q</em><sub><em>j</em></sub>
is not a cause of <em>Q</em><sub><em>i</em></sub>, then there are
common causes of <em>Q</em><sub><em>i</em></sub> and
<em>Q</em><sub><em>j</em></sub> in the set
{<em>Q</em><sub>1</sub>,…,<em>Q</em><sub>n</sub>} such that
<em>Q</em><sub><em>i</em></sub> and <em>Q</em><sub><em>j</em></sub>
are independent conditional upon these common
 causes.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#4" name="return-4">4</a>]</sup></p>
 
<h3><a name="1.3">1.3 The Law of Conditional Independence</a></h3>

<p>

Penrose and Percival (1962), following Costa de Beauregard, have
suggested as a general principle that the effects of interactions are
felt after those interactions rather than before. In particular, they
suggest that a system that has been isolated throughout the past is
uncorrelated with the rest of the universe. Of course, this is almost
a vacuous claim, since, other than in the case of horizons in
cosmology, there would not appear to be a surfeit of systems that have
been completely isolated from the rest of the universe throughout the
past.  Penrose and Percival, however, strengthen their principle by
claiming that if one sets up a ‘statistical barrier’ that
prevents any influences from acting both upon a space-time region
<em>A</em> and a space-time region <em>B</em>, then states <em>a</em>
in <em>A</em> and <em>b</em> in <em>B</em> will be
uncorrelated. Penrose and Percival use the assumption that influences
can not travel faster than the speed of light to make this idea more
precise. Consider a space-time region <em>C</em> where there is no
point <em>P</em> to the past of <em>A</em> or <em>B</em> such that one
can travel, at a speed no faster than the speed of light, both from
<em>P</em> to <em>A</em> and from <em>P</em> to <em>B</em> without
entering <em>C</em>.</p>

<blockquote><img src="figure1.gif" alt="figure 1" width="550" />
<br />
</blockquote>

<p>

Penrose and Percival then say that one can prevent any influence from
acting on both <em>A</em> and <em>B</em> by fixing the state
<em>c</em> throughout such a region <em>C</em>. They therefore claim
that states <em>a</em> in <em>A</em> and <em>b</em> in <em>B</em> will
be uncorrelated conditional upon any state <em>c</em> in
<em>C</em>. To be precise, they suggest the ‘law of conditional
independence’: “If <em>A</em> and <em>B</em> are two disjoint
4-regions, and <em>C</em> is any 4-region which divides the union of
the pasts of <em>A</em> and <em>B</em> into two parts, one containing
<em>A</em> and the other containing <em>B</em>, then <em>A</em> and
<em>B</em> are conditionally independent given <em>c</em>.  That is,
Pr(<em>a</em>&amp;<em>b</em>/<em>c</em>) =
Pr(<em>a</em>/<em>c</em>) × Pr(<em>b</em>/<em>c</em>),
for all <em>a</em>,<em>b</em>.” (Penrose and Percival 1962, p. 611).

</p>

<p>

This is a time asymmetric principle which is clearly closely related
to Reichenbach's common cause principle and the causal Markov
condition. However one should not take states <em>c</em> in region
<em>C</em> to be, or include, the common causes of the (unconditional)
correlations that might exist between the states in regions <em>A</em>
and <em>B</em>. It is merely a region such that influences from a past
common source on both <em>A</em> and <em>B</em> must pass through it,
assuming that such influences do not travel at speeds exceeding the
speed of light. Note also that the region must stretch to the
beginning of time. Thus, one cannot derive anything like Reichenbach's
common cause principle or the causal Markov condition from the law of
conditional independence, and one therefore would not inherit the
richness of applications of these principles, especially the causal
Markov condition, even if one were to accept the law of conditional
independence.</p>

<h2><a name="2">2. Problems for Common Cause Principles</a></h2>

<p>

There are, unfortunately, many counterexamples to the above common
cause principles. The next five subsections describe some of the more
significant counterexamples.</p>

<h3><a name="2.1">2.1 Conserved Quantities, Indeterminism and Quantum Mechanics</a></h3>

<p>

Suppose that a particle decays into 2 parts, that conservation of
total momentum obtains, and that it is not determined by the prior
state of the particle what the momentum of each part will be after the
decay. By conservation, the momentum of one part will be determined by
the momentum of the other part. By indeterminism, the prior state of
the particle will not determine what the momenta of each part will be
after the decay. Thus there is no prior screener off. By simultaneity
and symmetry, it is implausible to suppose that the momentum of the one
part causes the momentum of the other part. So common cause principles
fail. (This example is from van Fraassen 1980, 29.)</p>

<p>

More generally, suppose that there is a quantity <em>Q</em>, which
is a function
<em>f</em>(<em>q</em><sub>1</sub>,…,<em>q<sub>n</sub></em>) of
quantities <em>q<sub>i</sub></em>. Suppose that some of the quantities
<em>q<sub>i</sub></em> develop indeterministically, but that quantity
<em>Q</em> is conserved in such developments. There will then be
correlations among the values of the quantities <em>q<sub>i</sub></em>
which have no prior screener off. The only way that common cause
principles can hold when there are conserved global quantities is when
the development of each of the quantities that jointly determine the
value of the global quantity is deterministic. And then it holds in the
trivial sense that the prior determinants make everything else
irrelevant. The results of quantum mechanical measurements are not
determined by the quantum mechanical state prior to those measurements.
And often there are conserved quantities during such a measurement. For
instance, the total spin of 2 particles in a quantum
‘singlet’ state is 0. This quantity is conserved when one
measures the spins of each of those 2 particles in the same direction:
one will always find opposite spins during such a measurement, i.e.,
the spins that one finds will be perfectly anti-correlated. However
what spins one will find is not determined by the prior quantum state.
Thus the prior quantum state does not screen off the anti-correlations.
There is no quantum common cause of such correlations.</p>

<p>

One might think that this violation of common cause principles is a
reason to believe that there must then be more to the prior state of
the particles than the quantum state; there must be ‘hidden
variables’ that screen off such correlations. However, one can
show, given some extremely plausible assumptions, that there can not be
any such hidden variables. Let me be a bit more precise. When two
particles are in a spin singlet state, but are spatially distant from
each other, one can choose a pair of directions in which to measure
their spins simultaneously (in some frame of reference). According to
quantum mechanics the results of such a pair of measurements will
(generically) be correlated (or anti-correlated), where the strength of
this correlation (or anti-correlation) depends on the angle between the
two directions in which the spins are measured. Moreover, one can show
that the predictions of quantum mechanics, which have been
experimentally confirmed, are inconsistent with the following three
assumptions:</p>

<ol>

<li>Given any complete prior state
λ of the pair of particles, and any direction of measurement on
one particle, the result of this measurement does not depend on the
direction of measurement on the other particle.</li>

<li>The probability distribution of
complete prior states λ of pairs of particles is independent of
the directions of subsequent measurements</li>

<li>Given any complete prior state
λ of the pair of particles, and any pair of directions of
measurement, the probabilities of the (two) possible outcomes of the
measurement on one of the particles do not depend on the outcomes of
the other measurement, i.e. the complete prior state λ
  screens off all correlations between the two outcomes.</li>

</ol>

<p>

Assumption (1) seems extremely plausible since if it fails then it
one could influence the probabilities of results of simultaneous
distant measurements by manipulating the setting of a measuring
apparatus, which appears to violate Special Relativity. Assumption (2)
seems extremely plausible since its violation would amount to a
conspiratorial initial correlation between the states of the particles
and the directions in which we choose to measure their spins. So it
seems extremely plausible that assumption 3) must fail. But condition
(3) is just a version of Reichenbach's common cause principle.
(For more detail, see van Fraassen 1982, Elby 1992, Redhead 1995,
Clifton, Feldman, Halvorson, Redhead &amp; Wilce 1998, Clifton &amp;
Ruetsche 1999, and the entries on Bell's theorem and on Bohmian
mechanics in this encyclopedia.)</p>

<p>

Hofer-Szabo <em>et al</em>. have suggested that Reichenbach's common
cause principle nonetheless is not violated since 3) is not the
correct representation of Reichenbach's common cause principle in this
context. (See Hofer-Szabo <em>et al</em>. 1999 and Hofer-Szabo <em>et
al</em>. 2002.) In particular, they claim that Reichenbach's common
cause principle merely demands that for any given pair of directions
I, J there exists a quantity <em>Q<sub>ij</sub></em> which screens off
the correlations between the results of measurements directions I and
J, rather than that there is a single quantity (the prior state
λ) which screens off all correlations between all pairs of
directions. However, it is somewhat hard to understand in which sense
the quantities <em>Q<sub>ij</sub></em> can be said to exist if they
cannot be combined into a single quantity λ which determines
the values of all the <em>Q<sub>ij</sub></em> and therefore screens
off all correlations for all pairs of directions of measurement. (But
see Grasshof, Portmann &amp; Wuthrich 2003 [in the Other Internet
Resources section], and Hofer-Szabo 2007 for more on this.)</p>

<h3><a name="2.2">2.2 Electromagnetism; Laws of Coexistence</a></h3>

<p>

Maxwell's equations not only govern the development of electromagnetic
fields, they also imply simultaneous (in all frames of reference)
relations between charge distributions and electromagnetic fields. In
particular they imply that the electric flux through a surface which
encloses some region of space must equal the total charge in that
region. Thus electromagnetism implies that there is a strict and
simultaneous correlation between the state of the field on such a
surface and the charge distribution in the region contained by that
surface. And this correlation must hold even on the space-like
boundary at the beginning of the universe (if there be such). This
violates all three common cause principles. (For more detail and
subtlety, see Earman 1995, chapter 5).</p>

<p>

More generally, any coexistence law, such as Newtonian gravitation, or
Pauli's exclusion principle, will imply correlations which have no
prior common cause conditionally upon which they disappear. Therefore,
contrary to what one might hope, there are relativistic co-existence
laws which violate common cause principles.</p>

<h3><a name="2.3">2.3 Bread and Water; Similar Laws of Evolution</a></h3>

<p>

The bread prices in Britain have been going up steadily over the last
few centuries. The water levels in Venice have been going up steadily
over the last few centuries. There is therefore a correlation between
(simultaneous) bread prices in Britain and sea levels in Venice.
However, there is presumably no direct causation involved, nor a
common cause. More generally, Elliott Sober (see Sober 1988) has
suggested that similar laws of evolution of otherwise independent
quantities can lead to correlations for which no common cause exists.</p>

<p>

There is a way of understanding common cause principles such that this
example is not a counterexample to it. Suppose that in nature there
are transition chances from values of quantities at earlier times to
values of quantities at later times. ( For more in this idea see
Arntzenius 1997). One could then state a common cause principle as
follows: conditional upon the values of all the quantities upon which
the transition chances to quantities <em>X</em> and <em>Y</em> depend,
<em>X</em> and <em>Y</em> will be probabilistically independent. In
Sober's example, there are transition chances from earlier costs of
bread to later costs of bread, and there are transition chances from
earlier water levels to later water levels.  Conditional upon earlier
costs of bread, later costs of bread are independent of later water
levels. A common cause principle formulated as above thus holds in
this case. Of course, if one looks at a collection of (simultaneous)
data for water levels and bread prices one will see a correlation due
to similar laws of development (similar transition chances). But a
common cause principle, understood in terms of transition chances,
does not imply that there should be a common cause of this
correlation. The data (which include these correlations) should be
understood as evidence for what the transition chances in nature are,
and it is those transition chances that could be demanded to satisfy a
common cause principle.</p>

<h3><a name="2.4">2.4 Markov Processes</a></h3>

<p>

Suppose a particular type of object has 4 possible states:
<em>S</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>S</em><sub>2</sub>, <em>S</em><sub>3</sub>
and <em>S</em><sub>4</sub>. Suppose that if such an object is in state
<em>S</em><sub><em>i</em></sub> at time <em>t</em>, and is not
interfered with (isolated), then at time <em>t</em>+1 it has
probability ½ of being in the same state
<em>S</em><sub><em>i</em></sub>, and probability ½ of being in
state <em>S</em><sub><em>i</em>+1</sub>, where we define 4 + 1 = 1
(i.e., ‘+’ represents addition mod 4). Now suppose we put
many such objects in state <em>S</em><sub>1</sub> at time <em>t</em> =
0. Then at time <em>t</em> = 1 approximately half of the systems will
be in state <em>S</em><sub>1</sub>, and approximately half will be in
state <em>S</em><sub>2</sub>. Let us define property <em>A</em> to be
the property that obtains precisely when the system is either in state
<em>S</em><sub>2</sub> or in state <em>S</em><sub>3</sub>, and let us
define property <em>B</em> to be the property that obtains precisely
when the system is either in state <em>S</em><sub>2</sub> or in state
<em>S</em><sub>4</sub>. At time <em>t</em> = 1 half of the systems are
in state <em>S</em><sub>1</sub>, and therefore have neither property
<em>A</em> nor property <em>B</em>, and the other half are in state
<em>S</em><sub>2</sub>, so that they have both property <em>A</em> and
property <em>B</em>. Thus <em>A</em> and <em>B</em> are perfectly
correlated at <em>t</em> = 1. Since these correlations remain
conditional on the full prior state (<em>S</em><sub>1</sub>), there
can be no quantity such that conditional upon a prior value of this
quantity <em>A</em> and <em>B</em> are uncorrelated. Thus all three
principles fail in this case. One can generalize this example to all
generic state-space processes with indeterministic laws of
developments, namely Markov processes. At least, one can do this if
one allows arbitrary partitions of state-space to count as
quantities. (In particular, therefore, Markov processes generically do
not satisfy the causal Markov condition. The similarity of names is
thus a bit misleading. See Arntzenius 1993 for more detail.)</p>

<h3><a name="2.5">2.5 Deterministic Systems</a></h3>

<p>

Suppose that the state of the world (or a system of interest) at any
time determines the state of the world (that system) at any other
time.  It then follows that for any quantity <em>X</em> (of that
system) at any time <em>t</em>, there will be at any other time
<em>t</em>′, in particular any later time <em>t</em>′, a
quantity <em>X</em>′ (to be precise: a partition of state-space)
such that the value of <em>X</em>′ at <em>t</em>′ uniquely
determines the value of <em>X</em> at <em>t</em>.  Conditional upon
the value of <em>X</em>′ at <em>t</em>′, the value of
<em>X</em> at <em>t</em> will be independent of any value of any
quantity at any time. (For more detail see Arntzenius 1993.)
Reichenbach's common cause principle thus fails in deterministic
contexts. The problem is not that there will not always be earlier
events conditional upon which the correlations disappear. Conditional
upon the deterministic causes all correlations disappear. The problem
is that there will also always be later events that determine whether
the earlier correlated events occur. Reichenbach's common cause
principle thus fails in so far as it claims that typically there are
no later events conditional upon which earlier correlated simultaneous
events are uncorrelated.</p>

<p>

This does not imply a violation of the causal Markov condition.
However, in order to be able to infer causal relations from
statistical ones, Spirtes, Glymour and Scheines in effect assume that
whenever (unconditionally correlated) quantities
<em>Q</em><sub><em>i</em></sub> and <em>Q</em><sub><em>j</em></sub>
are independent conditional upon some quantity
<em>Q</em><sub><em>k</em></sub>, then <em>Q</em><sub><em>k</em></sub>
is a cause of either <em>Q</em><sub><em>i</em></sub> or
<em>Q</em><sub><em>j</em></sub>. To be more precise they assume the
‘Faithfulness condition’, which states that there are no
probabilistic independencies in nature other than the ones entailed by
the causal Markov condition. Since the values of such quantities
<em>X</em>′ at later times <em>t</em>′ surely are not
direct causes of <em>X</em> at <em><em>t</em></em>, Faithfulness is
violated, and with it goes our ability to infer causal relations from
probabilistic relations, and much of the practical value of the causal
Markov
 condition.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#5" name="return-5">5</a>]</sup></p>

<p>

Now, of course, a quantity like <em>X</em>′ whose values at a
later time <em>t</em>′ are deterministically related to the
values of <em>X</em> at <em>t</em>, will in general correspond to a
non-natural, non-local, and not directly observable quantity. So one
might wish to claim that the existence of such a later quantity does
not violate the spirit of common cause principles. Relatedly, note
that in the deterministic case, for correlated events (or quantities)
<em>A</em> and <em>B</em> one can always find earlier events (or
quantities) <em>C</em> and <em>D</em> which occur iff <em>A</em> and
<em>B</em>, respectively, occur. Thus the conjunction of <em>C</em>
and <em>D</em> will screen off the correlation between <em>A</em> and
<em>B</em>. Again, such a conjunction is not anything one would
naturally call a common cause of the later correlated events, and
therefore is not the kind of event that Reichenbach was intent on
capturing with his common cause principle.  Both of these cases
suggest that the common cause principle should be limited to some
natural subclass of quantities. Let's examine that idea more
closely.</p>

<h2><a name="3">3. Attempts to Rescue Common Cause Principles</a></h2>

<p>

The following three subsections will examine some ways in which one
could try to rescue common cause principles from the above
counterexamples.</p>

<h3><a name="3.1">3.1 Macroscopic Quantities</a></h3>

<p>

Cleopatra is throwing a big party, and wants to sacrifice around fifty
slaves to appease the gods. She is having a hard time convincing the
slaves that this is a good idea, and decides that she ought to give
them a chance at least. She has obtained a very strong poison, so
strong that one molecule of it will kill a person. She puts one
molecule of the poison in each of a hundred goblets of wine, which she
presents to one hundred slaves. Having let the molecules of poison
move around in Brownian motion for a while, she then orders the slaves
to drink half a goblet of wine each. Let us now assume that if one
consumes the poison, then death is preceded by an ominous reddening of
the left hand and of the right hand. Then, the molecule being in the
consumed half of the wine glass will be a prior screener off of the
correlation between left hand reddening and right hand reddening.
Assuming that death occurs exactly in the cases that the poison is
swallowed, death will be a posterior screener off. If one restricts
oneself to macroscopic events, there will only be a posterior screener
off. If death is not strictly determined by the swallowing or
non-swallowing of the poison, there will be no macroscopic screener
off at any time. Thus, if microscopic events can have such macroscopic
consequences, a common cause principle cannot hold of macroscopic
events. More generally, this argument suggests that the common cause
principle cannot hold of a class of events that has causes outside
that class. This argument appears even more forceful for those who
believe that the only reason that we can acquire knowledge of
microscopic events and microscopic laws, is precisely the fact that
microscopic events, in certain situations, have effects upon
observable events.</p>

<p>

Let us now consider another type of counterexample to the idea that a
common cause principle can hold of macroscopic quantities, namely
cases in which order arises out of chaos. When one lowers the
temperature of certain materials, the spins of all the atoms of the
material, which originally are not aligned, will line up in the same
direction. Pick any two atoms in this structure. Their spins will be
correlated. However, it is not the case that the one spin orientation
caused the other spin orientation. Nor is there a simple or
macroscopic common cause of each orientation of each spin. The
lowering of the temperature determines that the orientations will be
correlated, but not the direction in which they will line up. Indeed,
typically, what determines the direction of alignment, in the absence
of an external magnetic field, is a very complicated fact about the
total microscopic prior state of the material and the microscopic
influences upon the material. Thus, other than virtually the complete
microscopic state of the material and its environment there is no
prior screener off of the correlation between the spin alignments.</p>

<p>

In general when chaotic developments result in ordered states there
will be final correlations which have no prior screener off, other
than virtually the full microscopic state of the system and its
environment.  (For more examples, see Prigogine 1980). In such cases
the only screener off will be a horrendously complex microscopic
quantity.</p>

<h3><a name="3.2">3.2 Local Quantities</a></h3>

<p>

If a common cause principle does not hold when one restricts oneself
to macroscopic quantities, perhaps it holds if one restricts oneself
to local quantities? Let me show that this is not so by giving a
counterexample. There is a correlation between the take-off time of
airplanes at airports and the time clothes take to dry on washing
lines in any city near those airports. An apparently satisfactory
common cause explanation of this phenomenon is that high humidity
causes both long drying times and long take-off times. However, this
explanation presupposes that the humidity at the airport and at nearby
houses is correlated. Now, it is not the case that the humidity in one
area directly causes the humidity in other nearby areas. Moreover,
there is no local common cause of the correlation among humidities in
nearby areas, for there is no local earlier quantity that determines
the humidity at separated locations at later times. Rather, the
explanation of the correlation between the humidities in quite widely
separated areas is that, when the total system is in (approximate)
equilibrium then the humidity in different areas is (approximately)
identical.  Indeed the world is full of (approximate) equilibrium
correlations, without local common causes conditional upon which these
correlations disappear. (For more examples of this type of case see
Forster 1986).</p>

<p>

Next consider a flock of birds that flies, more or less, like a single
unit in a rather varied trajectory through the sky. The correlation
between the motions of each bird in the flock could have a rather
straightforward common cause explanation: there could be a leader bird
that every other bird follows. But it could also be that there is no
leader bird, that each bird reacts to certain factors in the
environment (presence of predator birds, insects, etc.), while at the
same time constraining the distance that it will remove itself from
its neighboring birds in the flock (as if tied to them by springs that
pull harder the further away it gets from the other birds). In the
latter case there will be a correlation of motions for which there is
no local common cause. There will be an ‘equilibrium’
correlation that is maintained in the face of external perturbations.
In ‘equilibrium’ the flock acts more or less as a unit,
and reacts as a unit, possibly in a very complicated way, in response
to its environment. The explanation of the correlation among the
motions of its parts is not a common cause explanation, but the fact
that in ‘equilibrium’ the myriad connections between its
parts make it act as a unit.</p>

<p>

In general we have learned to divide the world into systems which we
regard as single units, since their parts normally (in
‘equilibrium’) behave in a highly correlated manner. We
routinely do not regard correlations among the motions and properties
of the parts of these systems as demanding a common cause
explanation.</p>

<h3><a name="3.3">3.3 Initial Microscopic Chaos and the Common Cause Principle</a></h3>

<p>

Many authors have noted that there are circumstances in which the
causal Markov condition, and the common cause principle that it
implies, provably hold. Roughly speaking, this is the case when the
world is deterministic, and the factors <em>A</em> and <em>B</em>
which, in addition to the common cause <em>C</em>, determine whether
effects <em>D</em> and <em>E</em> occur, are uncorrelated. Let me be
more general and precise. Consider a deterministic world and a set of
quantities <em>S</em> with certain causal relations holding between
them. For any quantity <em>Q</em>, let us call the factors not in
<em>S</em> which, when combined with the direct causes of <em>Q</em>
that are in <em>S</em>, determine whether <em>Q</em> occurs, the
‘determinants of <em>Q</em> outside <em>S</em>’. Suppose now that
the determinants outside <em>S</em> are all independent, i.e., that the
joint distribution of all determinants outside <em>S</em> is a product
of distributions for each such determinant outside <em>S</em>. One can
then prove that the causal Markov condition holds in
 <em>S</em>.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#6" name="return-6">6</a>]</sup></p>

<p>

But when should one expect such independence? P. Horwich (Horwich
1987) has suggested that such independence follows from initial
microscopic chaos. (See also Papineau 1985 for a similar suggestion.)
His idea is that if all the determinants outside <em>S</em> are microscopic,
then they will all be uncorrelated since all microscopic factors will
be uncorrelated when they are chaotically distributed. However, even if
one has microscopic chaos (i.e., a uniform probability distribution in
certain parts of state-space in a canonical coordinatization of the
state-space), it is still not the case that all microscopic factors are
uncorrelated. Let me give a generic counterexample.</p>

<p>

Suppose that quantity <em>C</em> is a common cause of quantities
<em>A</em> and <em>B</em>, that the system in question is
deterministic, and that the quantities <em>a</em> and <em>b</em>
which, in addition to <em>C</em>, determine the values of <em>A</em>
and <em>B</em> are microscopic and independently distributed for each
value of <em>C</em>. Then <em>A</em> and <em>B</em> will be
uncorrelated conditional upon each value of <em>C</em>. Now define
quantities <em>D</em>:<em>A</em>+<em>B</em> and
<em>E</em>:<em>A</em>-<em>B</em>. (“+” and “-” here
represent ordinary addition and subtraction of the values of
quantities.) Then, generically, <em>D</em> and <em>E</em> will be
correlated conditional upon each value of <em>C</em>. To illustrate
why this is so let me give a very simple example.  Suppose that for a
given value of <em>C</em> quantities <em>A</em> and <em>B</em> are
independently distributed, that <em>A</em> has value 1 with
probability 1/2 and value −1 with probability 1/2, and that <em>B</em>
has value 1 with probability 1/2 and value −1 with probability
1/2. Then the possible values of <em>D</em> are −2, 0 and 2, with
probabilities 1/4, 1/2 and 1/4 respectively. The possible values of
<em>E</em> are also −2, 0 and 2, with probabilities 1/4, 1/2 and 1/4
respectively. But note, for instance, that if the value of <em>D</em>
is −2, then the value of <em>E</em> must be 0. In general a non-zero
value for <em>D</em> implies value 0 for <em>E</em> and a non-zero
value for <em>E</em> implies value 0 for <em>D</em>.  Thus, the values
of <em>D</em> and <em>E</em> are strongly correlated for the given
value of <em>C</em>. And it is not too hard to show that, generically,
if quantities <em>A</em> and <em>B</em> are uncorrelated, then
<em>D</em> and <em>E</em> are correlated. Now, since <em>D</em> and
<em>E</em> are correlated conditional upon any value of <em>C</em>, it
follows that <em>C</em> is not a prior common cause which screens off
the correlation between <em>D</em> and <em>E</em>. And since the
factors <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> which, in addition to <em>C</em>,
determine the values of <em>A</em> and <em>B</em>, and hence those of
<em>D</em> and <em>E</em>, can be microscopic and horrendously
complex, there will be no screener off of the correlations between
<em>D</em> and <em>E</em> other than some incredibly complex and
inaccessible microscopic determinant. Thus common cause principles
fail if one uses quantities <em>D</em> and <em>E</em> rather than
quantities <em>A</em> and <em>B</em> to characterize the later state
of the system.</p>

<p>

One might try to save common cause principles by suggesting that in
addition to <em>C</em> being a cause of <em>D</em> and of <em>E</em>,
<em>D</em> is also a cause of <em>E</em>, or <em>E</em> is also a
cause of <em>D</em>. (See Glymour and Spirtes 1994, pp 277–278 for
such a suggestion). This would explain why <em>D</em> and <em>E</em>
are still correlated conditional upon <em>C</em>. Nonetheless, this
does not seem a plausible suggestion. In the first place, <em>D</em>
and <em>E</em> are simultaneous. In the second place, the situation
sketched is symmetric with respect to <em>D</em> and <em>E</em>, so
which is supposed to cause which? It seems far more plausible to admit
that common cause principles fail if one uses quantities <em>D</em>
and <em>E</em>.</p>

<p>

One might next try to defend common cause principles by suggesting
that <em>D</em> and <em>E</em> are not really independent quantities,
given that each is defined in terms of <em>A</em> and <em>B</em>, and
that one should only expect common cause principles to be true of
good, honest, independent quantities.  Although this argument is along
the right lines, as it stands it is too quick and simple. One cannot
say that <em>D</em> and <em>E</em> are not independent because of the
way they are defined in terms of <em>A</em> and <em>B</em>. For
similarly <em>A</em> = ½(<em>D</em>+<em>E</em>) and <em>B</em>
= ½(<em>D</em>−<em>E</em>), and unless there are reasons
independent of such equations to claim that <em>A</em> and <em>B</em>
are bona fide independent quantities while <em>D</em> and <em>E</em>
are not, one is stuck. For now let us therefore conclude that an
attempt to prove the common cause principle by assuming that all
microscopic factors are uncorrelated rests on a false premise.</p>

<p>

Nonetheless such arguments are pretty close to being correct:
microscopic chaos does imply that a very large and useful class of
microscopic conditions are independently distributed. For instance,
assuming a uniform distribution of microscopic states in macroscopic
cells, it follows that the microscopic states of two spatially
separated regions will be independently distributed, given any
macroscopic states in the two regions. Thus microscopic chaos and
spatial separation is sufficient to provide independence of
microscopic factors. This in fact covers a very large and useful class
of cases.  For almost all correlations that we are interested in are
between factors of systems that are not exactly in the same
location. Consider, for instance, an example due to Reichenbach.</p>

<p>

Suppose that two actors almost always eat the same food. Every now and
then the food will be bad. Let us assume that whether or not each of
the actors become sick depends on the quality of the food that they
consume and on other local factors (properties of their body etc.) at
the time of consumption (and perhaps also later), which previously
have developed chaotically. The values of these local factors for one
of the actors will then be independent of the values of these local
factors for the other actor. It then follows that there will be a
correlation between their states of health, and that this correlation
will disappear conditional upon the quality of the food. In general
when one has a process that physically splits into two separate
processes which remain separated in space, then all the
‘microscopic’ influences on those two processes will be
independent from then on.  Indeed there are very many cases in which
two processes, whether spatially separated or not, will have a point
after which microscopic influences on the processes are independent
given microscopic chaos. In such cases common cause principles will be
valid as long as one chooses as one's quantities the (relevant aspects
of the) macroscopic states of the processes at the time of such
separations (rather than the macroscopic states significantly prior to
such separations) and some aspects of macroscopic states somewhere
along each separate process (rather than some amalgam of quantities of
the separate processes).</p>

<h2><a name="4">4. Conclusions</a></h2>

<p>

Reichenbach's principle of the common cause and its cousins, insofar as
they hold, have the same origin as the temporal asymmetries of
statistical mechanics, namely, roughly speaking, initial microscopic
chaos. (I am being very rough here. There is no absolute,
dynamics-independent, distinction between microscopic and macroscopic
factors. For more detail on exactly which quantities will behave as if
they are uniformly distributed in which circumstances see, e.g., D.
Albert (1999).) This explains why the three principles we have
discussed sometimes fail. For the demand of initial microscopic chaos
is a demand that microscopic conditions are uniformly distributed (in
canonical coordinates) in the areas of state-space that are compatible
with the fundamental laws of physics. If there are fundamental (equal
time) laws of physics that rule out certain areas in state-space, which
thus imply that there are (equal time) correlations among certain
quantities, this is no violation of initial microscopic chaos. But the
three common cause principles that we discussed will fail for such
correlations. Similarly, quantum mechanics implies that for certain
quantum states there will be correlations between the results of
measurements that can have no common cause which screens all these
correlations off. But this does not violate initial microscopic chaos.
Initial microscopic chaos is a principle that tells one how to
distribute probabilities over quantum states in certain circumstances;
it does not tell one what the probabilities of values of observables
given certain quantum states should be. And if they violate common
cause principles, so be it. There is no fundamental law of nature that
is, or implies, a common cause principle. The extent of the truth of
common cause principles is approximate and derivative, not fundamental.</p>

<p>

One should also not be interested in common cause principles which
allow any conditions, no matter how microscopic, scattered and
unnatural, to count as common causes. For, as we have seen, this would
trivialize such principles in deterministic worlds, and would hide from
view the remarkable fact that when one has a correlation among fairly
natural localized quantities that are not related as cause and effect,
almost always one can find a fairly natural, localized prior common
cause that screens off the correlation. The explanation of this
remarkable fact, which was suggested in the previous section, is that
Reichenbach's common cause principle, and the causal Markov condition,
must hold if the determinants, other than the causes, are independently
distributed for each value of the causes. The fundamental assumptions
of statistical mechanics imply that this independence will hold in a
large class of cases given a judicious choice of quantities
characterizing the causes and effects. In view of this, it is indeed
more puzzling why common cause principles fail in cases like those
described above, such as the coordinated flights of certain flocks of
birds, equilibrium correlations, order arising out of chaos, etc. The
answer is that in such cases the interactions between the parts of
these systems are so complicated, and there are so many causes acting
on the systems, that the only way one can get independence of further
determinants is by specifying so many causes as to make this a
practical impossibility. This, in any case, would amount to allowing
just about any scattered and unnatural set of factors to count as
common causes, thereby trivializing common cause principles. Thus,
rather than do that, we regard such systems as single unified systems,
and do not demand a common cause explanation for the correlated motions
and properties of their parts. A fairly intuitive notion of what counts
as a single system, after all, is a system that behaves in a unified
manner, i.e., a system whose parts have a very strong correlation in
their motions and/or other properties, no matter how complicated the
set of influences acting on them. For instance a rigid physical object
has parts whose motions are all correlated, and a biological organism
has parts whose motions and properties are strongly correlated, no
matter how complicated the influences acting on it. These systems
therefore are naturally and usefully treated as single systems for
almost any purpose. The core truth of common cause principles thus in
part relies on our choice as to how to partition the world into unified
and independent objects and quantities, and in part on the objective,
temporally asymmetric, principles that lie at the foundation of
statistical mechanics.</p>
