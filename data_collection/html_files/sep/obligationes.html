<h1>Medieval Theories of <em>Obligationes</em></h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Mon Jul 14, 2003; substantive revision Tue Nov 18, 2014</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>

<em>Obligationes</em> (literally, “obligations”) or disputations
<em>de obligationibus</em> were a medieval disputation format that
became very widespread in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries.
Although their name might suggest they had something especially to do
with ethics or moral duty, they did not. The purpose of these
disputations was strictly logical. Several kinds of disputations
<em>de obligationibus</em> were distinguished in the medieval
literature. The most widely studied kind to date was called
“<em>positio</em>” (= positing). It is difficult or even impossible to
map the genre to the genres modern logic, but issues involved include
at least counterfactual and <em>per impossibile</em> reasoning, and
dynamic commitment to remain logically consistent. Disputations <em>de
obligationibus</em> appear to lay at the background of the modern
practice of the academic “thesis defense.”</p>

<h2><a name="Disputations">1. Disputations <em>de obligationibus</em></a></h2>

<p>

The medieval disputation <em>de obligationibus</em> was a highly
stylized academic disputation form between two parties, an “opponent”
(<em>opponens</em>) and a “respondent” (<em>respondens</em>). From at
least the early thirteenth century, a literature began to appear, in
independent treatises as well as discussions as part of larger works,
on how to conduct such
 disputations.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#1" name="note-1">1</a>]</sup>
 This literature was regarded as belonging to logic, and the study of
<em>obligationes</em> became part of the logic curriculum followed by
 undergraduates.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#2" name="note-2">2</a>]</sup>
 Treatises on <em>obligationes</em> are however not early
works in deontic logic.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#3" name="note-3">3</a>]</sup>
The name “<em>obligationes</em>” means in Latin as much as in English
obligation in the sense of “duty,” but what is “obligatory” is
strictly limited to the general logical obligation not to contradict
oneself in a disputation and to a specific logical obligation that the
opponent gives to the respondent in the beginning of the
disputation. Even the general moral duty to be honest and accept what
one believes to be true is limited to a very marginal role in these
highly technical disputations.</p>

<h2><a name="Origins">2. Origins</a></h2>

<p>

Some late-medieval authors claimed that the theoretical basis for
<em>obligationes</em> came from two passages in Aristotle (<em>Prior
Analytics</em> I.13.32a18–20, <em>Metaphysics</em>
IX.4.1047b10–12), both of which say merely that when something
possible is posited, nothing impossible
 results.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#4" name="note-4">4</a>]</sup>
But these Aristotelian texts may be the historical origin of the
<em>obligationes</em> literature only in a very indirect manner. The
first treatises on <em>obligationes</em> are earlier than the ready
availability of the <em>Metaphysics</em> in Latin translation, and do
not mention either passage. Moreover, while it is certainly true that
obligational disputations never require an impossibility to follow
when a possibility is posited, that fact does not by itself account
for some of the most characteristic features of
<em>obligationes</em>. Indeed, some of the earliest discussions
concern what happens not when a possibility is posited, but when an
<em>impossibility</em> is
 posited. <sup>[<a href="notes.html#5" name="note-5">5</a>]</sup></p>

<p>

It is precisely this feature, in fact, that at least two early
treatises attribute to
 Aristotle<sup>[<a href="notes.html#6" name="note-6">6</a>]</sup>:</p>

<blockquote>
 And Aristotle says this. For he says, “The impossible is to be
posited so that it may be seen what follows on that basis.”
</blockquote>

<p>

And<sup>[<a href="notes.html#7" name="note-7">7</a>]</sup>:</p>

<blockquote>
 That impossible positing has to be maintained is proved as follows:
For just as we say that the possible is to be conceded so that it may
be seen what follows on that basis, likewise we have it from Aristotle
that the impossible is to be conceded so that it may be seen what
happens on that basis.
</blockquote>

<p>

It seems thus more probable to connect obligational disputations to
 Aristotle's <em>per impossibile</em> arguments, which had been
 discussed by at least Boethius and Ibn
 Rushd.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#8" name="note-8">8</a>]</sup></p>

<p>

In any event, the prehistory of the <em>obligationes</em> literature
cannot be fully explained in terms of these possible sources. For
there were several other kinds or “species” of
<em>obligationes</em> besides “positing.” The early <em>Obligationes
Parisienses</em>, for example, distinguishes six kinds; the same six
are found also in Walter Burley and William of Ockham: positing
(<em>positio</em>), counterpositing (<em>depositio</em>), “let it be
doubted” (<em>dubitetur</em>), institution (<em>institutio</em>), the
truth of the matter (<em>rei veritas</em>), and petition
 (<em>petitio</em>).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#9" name="note-9">9</a>]</sup>
 Apart from “positing,” most of these kinds of <em>obligationes</em>
have been little studied in the modern literature.</p>

<div class="pagebreak"></div>

<h2><a name="Positio">3. <em>Positio</em></a></h2>

<p>

The most widely discussed kind of <em>obligatio</em>, both in the
medieval literature and in recent scholarship, is no doubt
<em>positio</em> or “positing.” In a <em>positio</em> the
“opponent” begins by saying “I posit that
<em>p</em>.” The proposition <em>p</em> is called the
“<em>positum</em>.” The “respondent” then says
either “I admit it” or “I deny it,” depending
on certain conditions. For example, the treatises by Roger Swyneshed,
Robert Fland, and Richard Lavenham all stipulate that in order for the
<em>positum</em> to be “admissible,” it must be a
<em>contingent</em>
 proposition.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#10" name="note-10">10</a>]</sup>
 Other authors, as we have seen above, allow the <em>positum</em> to
be an impossible proposition, provided that its impossibility is not
“manifest,” so that the proposition can be entertained and
 believed.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#11" name="note-11">11</a>]</sup>
 We shall not consider such cases here.</p>

<p>

If the respondent denies the <em>positum</em>, the disputation is
over before it really gets started. If he admits the <em>positum</em>,
the disputation is under way: The opponent then “proposes” to the
respondent a series of propositions, one after another. To each such
<em>propositum</em> the respondent must reply by saying “I concede it,”
“I deny it,” or “I doubt it,” according to certain
 rules.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#12" name="note-12">12</a>]</sup>
 The rules stipulate that the correct response depends in part on
whether the <em>propositum</em> is “relevant” or “irrelevant”
(<em>pertinens/impertinens</em>), and if it is relevant whether it is
“sequentially relevant” or “incompatibly relevant” (<em>pertinens
sequens/pertinens repugnans</em>). The specification of these notions
and of how they affect the correct response to the <em>propositum</em>
constitutes the kernel of the theory of <em>positio</em>, and varied
from author to author.</p>

<h3><a name="Burley">3.1 Walter  Burley's theory</a></h3>

<p>

Walter Burley's account represents what was perhaps the “default” or
“standard”
 theory.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#13" name="note-13">13</a>]</sup>
 According to
 him<sup>[<a href="notes.html#14" name="note-14">14</a>]</sup>:</p>

<ol>
<li>For each step <em>n</em> of the disputation, beginning with the
first <em>propositum</em> as step 1, the <em>propositum</em> is
“sequentially relevant” at step <em>n</em> if and only if it logically
follows from the conjunction of the <em>positum</em> together with any
<em>proposita</em> that have been conceded at earlier steps of the
disputation, and together with the contradictories of any <em>proposita</em>
that have been denied at earlier steps. The <em>propositum</em> is
“incompatibly relevant” at step <em>n</em> if and only if its
<em>contradictory</em> follows from that same conjunction. It is
“irrelevant” at step <em>n</em> if and only if it is neither
sequentially relevant nor incompatibly relevant there.</li>

<li>For each step <em>n</em> of the disputation, and for each
<em>propositum p</em>, the respondent must <em>concede p</em> at step
<em>n</em> if it is sequentially relevant at <em>n</em>, and must <em>deny</em>
it if it is incompatibly relevant at <em>n</em>. If <em>p</em> is
irrelevant at step <em>n</em>, the respondent must reply according to
his knowledge of the actual facts (independent of what is posited in
the disputation). Thus, if <em>p</em> is irrelevant at <em>n</em> and
the respondent knows it is true in fact, he must concede it; if
<em>p</em> is irrelevant at <em>n</em> and the respondent knows it is
false in fact, he must deny it; if <em>p</em> is irrelevant and the
respondent does not know whether it is true or false, he must doubt
it.</li>
</ol>

<p>

The disputation continues until the opponent says “<em>Cedat
tempus</em>,” which can either mean “Time is up!” (the disputation is
over) or “Time out!” In the latter case the disputation is interrupted
temporarily while the opponent points out some mistake in the
respondent's replies or makes some other observation. In both senses,
the point is the same: the respondent is not “obligated” by the rules
of <em>positio</em> except when the “game clock” is
 running.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#15" name="note-15">15</a>]</sup></p>

<p>

An example will help clarify the rules.</p>

Atlanta is south of the Mason-Dixon Line nor that it isn't. (The
<em>positum</em> says nothing at all about the location of the

respondent knows that step 1  is in fact true, he must concede it.<br /><br /></td>

step 1, step 2 follows. Hence it is sequentially relevant and must be

</tbody></table>

<p>

Several peculiar things should be noted about these rules. First,
the burden of the rules falls almost entirely on the respondent. As
long as he picks an “admissible” <em>positum</em> to begin with, the
opponent is otherwise free to propose anything he pleases at any step
of the disputation.</p>

<p>

Second, note the role of the respondent's epistemic state. It is a
factor in determining the correct replies, but only when the
<em>propositum</em> is irrelevant.</p>

<p>

Third, note that <em>order counts</em>. That is, depending on the
order in which <em>proposita</em> are proposed, different replies to them may
be required. Thus if steps 1 and 2 were reversed in the above example,
both would have to be denied:</p>

This set of rules guarantees that <em>positio</em> is “consistent”
in each of the following three, progressively stronger 
 senses<sup>[<a href="notes.html#16" name="note-16">16</a>]</sup>:</p>

<ul class="sentag tag3em">
<li id="Sense1"><span class="tag">(1)</span>
    <span class="sen">
No given disputation ever requires the respondent to concede an
impossibility at any one 
 step.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#17" name="note-17">17</a>]</sup></span></li>

<li id="Sense2"><span class="tag">(2)</span>
    <span class="sen">
No given disputation ever requires the respondent to concede
<em>proposita</em> of the form <em>p</em> and <em>not-p</em> at
different steps.</span></li>

<li id="Sense3"><span class="tag">(3)</span>
    <span class="sen">
No given disputation ever requires the respondent to concede at
different steps each member of an inconsistent set of
<em>proposita.</em></span></li>
</ul>

<p>

Yet on Burley's theory <em>positio</em> fails to be
“consistent” in another
 sense<sup>[<a href="notes.html#18" name="note-18">18</a>]</sup>:</p>

<ul class="sentag tag3em">
<li id="Sense4"><span class="tag">(4)</span>
    <span class="sen">
No given disputation ever requires the respondent to give different
replies to the same <em>propositum</em> at different steps.</span></li>
</ul>

<p>

As an example of this failure, let <em>p</em> and <em>q</em> be
contingent propositions neither of which logically implies the other,
and let the respondent know that <em>q</em> is false whereas he does
not know the truth value of <em>p</em>. Then:</p>

Clearly, <em>positio</em> on Burley's theory is a very peculiar kind
of disputation.</p>

<h3><a name="Swyneshed">3.2 Roger Swyneshed's theory</a></h3>

<p>

Burley's theory of <em>positio</em> was not the only one. Another
account seems to have originated with a certain Roger Swyneshed, who
wrote an <em>Obligationes</em> probably sometime after 1330 and
certainly before 1335 (Spade [1977]). This alternative theory was
recognized by Robert Fland, a mid-fourteenth century author about whom
very little is known. Fland reports both Burley's theory and
Swyneshed's theory, calling them the “old response” and the “new
response,” respectively. He does not choose between them, but simply
tells the respondent to pick whichever one he likes (Spade [1980],
§20). Richard Lavenham, on the other hand, a later-fourteenth
century author contemporary with John Wyclif, accepts Swyneshed's
version of <em>positio</em> outright. A certain John of Wesel from
mid-fourteenth century Paris also shows knowledge of Swyneshed's views
(John of Wesel [1996]). Nevertheless, Swyneshed's views seem to have
generated some controversy. For instance, Ralph Strode, in the
later-fourteenth century (roughly contemporary with John Wyclif), heatedly
rejected features of Swyneshed's theory, as did Peter of
Candia and the <em>Logica magna</em> attributed to Paul of Venice
(Spade [1982a], pp. 337–39).</p>

<p>

Swyneshed's theory of <em>positio</em> is in many respects like
Burley's, but differs in one major respect. For Swyneshed, in assessing
whether a <em>propositum</em> is relevant or irrelevant, the responses
to previous <em>proposita</em> do not matter. That is, for him, a
<em>propositum</em> is “sequentially relevant” if and only if it
logically follows from the <em>positum</em> alone; it is “incompatibly
relevant” if and only if its contradictory opposite follows from the
<em>positum</em> alone; it is “irrelevant” if and only if it is neither
sequentially nor incompatibly relevant.</p>

<p>

Swyneshed's “new response” greatly simplifies the task of the
respondent. He no longer has to keep track of what has previously been
conceded or denied in the disputation. The order in which <em>proposita</em>
are proposed no longer matters. All the respondent has to do is to make
sure he responds appropriately whenever the <em>propositum</em> either
follows from or is inconsistent with the <em>positum</em> alone, and
otherwise just respond according to his knowledge of the actual facts.
As long as he does that, he has performed correctly.</p>

<p>

Unlike Burley's theory, Swyneshed's guarantees that <em>positio</em>
is consistent in <a href="#Sense4">sense 4</a>
 above.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#19" name="note-19">19</a>]</sup>
 On the other hand, while for Swyneshed <em>positio</em> is consistent
in
 <a href="#Sense1">sense 1</a>
 and
 <a href="#Sense2">sense 2</a>
 above, it fails to be consistent in
 <a href="#Sense3">sense 3</a>.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#20" name="note-20">20</a>]</sup>
 For example, suppose you know you are sitting somewhere in Oxford,
and then consider the following <em>positio</em> (Spade [1977],
§100):</p>

<p>

The <em>proposita</em> in steps 1–3 form an inconsistent triad,
and yet each of them has to be conceded in accordance with Swyneshed's
rules.</p>

<p>

Burley's and Swyneshed's were not the only theories of
<em>positio</em>, although they seem to have been the most widely
discussed. Other theories were suggested too, but they are not yet
thoroughly studied or
 understood.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#21" name="note-21">21</a>]</sup></p>

<h2><a name="Purpose">4. The purpose of the disputations</a></h2>

<p>

What was the purpose of <em>positio</em>? The question is not an
easy
 one.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#22" name="note-22">22</a>]</sup>
 For, oddly, although medieval authors themselves speak of
<em>positio</em> as a kind of “disputation,” there seems at first to
be nothing really in dispute! Look back at the preceding
examples. They do not settle, or even try to settle, anything whatever
about the capital of Pennsylvania, the location of the Mason-Dixon
Line, whether you are sitting or running in Rome or in Oxford, or
anything else. Unlike the medieval <em>quaestio</em> format, where
there was a real issue being pursued and a real conflict of opposing
views, there seems to be nothing like that going on in a
<em>positio</em>. What then was its purpose?</p>

<p>

Some scholars have suggested that these disputations were
meant as “exercises” or perhaps “examinations” of students' skills. But
skills at doing what? We have just seen that it would not be their
purely logical skills that would be exercised or examined.
What other skills were they? Skills at arguing according to the rules
of <em>obligatio</em>? No doubt, but without some further explanation,
why would anyone want to do that?</p>

<h3><a name="Counterfactual">4.1 <em>Positio</em> as counterfactual reasoning</a></h3>

<p>

One suggestion is that <em>positio</em> might be viewed as something
like a theory of counterfactual
 reasoning.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#23" name="note-23">23</a>]</sup>
 On this account, a
<em>positio</em> would explore “what would happen” if the
<em>positum</em> were true but everything else stayed as much as
possible the same as it really is. This suggestion provides some
rationale for the otherwise mysterious treatment of irrelevant
<em>proposita</em>, where one looks away from the posited situation
back to reality to guide one's responses. In similar fashion, where a
counterfactual hypothesis does not require otherwise, counterfactual
reasoning typically tries to stay as close as possible to reality.</p>

<p>

Furthermore, theories of <em>positio</em> bear striking formal
similarities to modern theories of counterfactuals. Transitivity,
contraposition and strengthening the antecedent all fail, and several
other characteristics of counterfactuals seem to be mirrored in the
theory of
 <em>positio</em>.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#24" name="note-24">24</a>]</sup></p>

<p>

This suggestion has met considerable resistance (Stump [1981] and
[1985], Martin [1993]). One objection is that, at least on Burley's
“standard” theory of <em>positio</em>, if a <em>positum</em> is
possible but nevertheless known to be false, the opponent can maneuver
the respondent into having to concede <em>any</em> proposition whatever
consistent with the <em>positum</em>. Let <em>p</em> be such a
<em>positum</em>, and let <em>q</em> be consistent with
<em>p</em>. Then:</p>

<table class="two-rules centered cellpad-med-dense vert-top avoid-break">

<td class="nw"><em>I concede it.</em></td>

<tr>

<td colspan="2" class="smaller">
Comments:  If <em>p</em> logically implies <em>q</em>, then step
1 is sequentially relevant, and so has to be conceded. If <em>p</em>
does not logically imply <em>q</em>, step 1 is irrelevant, since
<em>q</em> is by hypothesis consistent with <em>p</em>. In that case,
since <em>p</em> is known to be false, <em>not-p</em> is known to be
true, and step 1 has to be conceded as an irrelevant truth.
<br /><br /></td>

<tr>
<td class="nw">Step 2:</td>

<td class="nw"><em>I concede it.</em></td>

<tr>
<td></td>
<td colspan="2" class="smaller">

<br /><br /></td>

<tr>
<td></td>
<td>Time is up!</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>

This is a very bad result if <em>positio</em> is a form of
counterfactual reasoning. For it means that, starting from any known
falsehood, one could reason counterfactually to <em>anything
whatever</em> consistent with
 it.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#25" name="note-25">25</a>]</sup></p>

<p>

Another objection might be that counterfactual reasoning, at least as
we are thinking of it today, does not incorporate epistemic factors in
the way the theory of <em>positio</em> does. It is one thing to say
that we do not know what would happen under a given counterfactual
hypothesis; it is quite another thing to say, as the
“counterfactual”-interpretation has it that the theory
of <em>obligationes</em> does say, that what would happen depends in
part on what we do know in fact.</p>

<h3>4.2 <em>Positio</em> and consistency maintainance</h3>

<p>

In more recent research (e.g. Yrjönsuuri [2009]; Catarina
Dutilh Novaes [2011]), scholars have thought that unlike twentieth
century theories of counterfactual reasoning, <em>obligationes</em> are
characteristically dynamic and dialectical. The core of the art is
that the respondent must use logical skills to keep the general
commitment to consistency. A particular bend to the art comes from the
fact that at least in the late medieval context there was no clear
universally accepted definition what it means to keep consistent in a
dynamic situation. There was, from the viewpoint of this
interpretation, agreement that the consistency at issue in
<em>obligationes</em> is connected to inferential validity. In the
early <em>Obligationes Parisienses</em> the art is explicitly
connected to “knowledge of consequences” (<em>scientia de
consequentiis</em>). Even more generally, it is clear that the kinds
of inferences employed in <em>obligationes</em> are in most cases
strictly logical.</p>

<h3><a name="ThesisDefense">4.3 <em>Positio</em> as a “thesis defense”</a></h3>

<p>

Another suggestion is that <em>positio</em> might lie at the
background of the modern academic practice of the “thesis defense.”
‘<em>Positio</em>’, after all, is just Latin for the Greek
‘<em>thesis</em>’.  Furthermore, to this day, the characteristic
terminology of “opponent” and “respondent” is preserved in some
European academic thesis-defenses. Moreover, despite our earlier sense
that there is, oddly, nothing really “in dispute” in a
<em>positio</em>, it is relatively easy to find medieval
discussions—<em>not</em> in treatises or other passages devoted
specifically to the theory of <em>obligationes</em>, but in other
texts—where the characteristic vocabulary and procedures
of <em>positio</em> are appealed to in a context where some substantive
view is being
 argued.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#26" name="note-26">26</a>]</sup>
 That view, however, is not to be found in the <em>positum</em> or in
any of the subsequent proposed steps of the <em>positio</em>. It is
rather a view that the respondent takes himself to <em>know</em> (and
so is prepared to “defend”), and that will therefore affect the
responses he gives to irrelevant <em>proposita</em>. The view being
“defended,” therefore, is not a view explicitly stated anywhere in the
disputation, but a kind of background assumption that underlies the
respondent's replies. This suggestion has some promise, but has not
yet been thoroughly explored. One objection
might be that, despite the initial attractiveness of the fact that
Latin ‘<em>positio</em>’ is the same as Greek
‘<em>thesis</em>,’ this view ends up divorcing the
“thesis” being defended by the respondent from the <em>positum</em> in
the disputation.</p>

<p>

The jury is still out. It must be admitted that no one has yet
explained <em>positio</em>, much less the
<em>obligationes-</em>literature in general, in a fully satisfactory
way. An adequate account would have to accommodate</p>

<ul>
<li>the variety of views of <em>positio</em> one finds in the medieval
literature;</li>

<li>the characteristic treatment of irrelevant <em>proposita</em>, which
brings non-logical factors into play;</li>

<li>in particular, the epistemic factors incorporated into most treatments.</li>
</ul>

<p>It may be that any adequate account would in effect reproduce the
genre with the terminology of modern logic. That is, perhaps
<em>obligationes</em> are best understood as a logical genre of its
own kind.</p>

<h2><a name="OtherKinds">5. Other kinds of <em>obligatio</em></a></h2>

<p>

Apart from <em>positio</em>, the other kinds of <em>obligatio</em>
recognized in the medieval literature have not been studied nearly so
much. One kind that perhaps <em>needs</em> little separate study is
“counterpositing” (<em>depositio</em>). In effect, if “positing”
requires the respondent to uphold the <em>positum</em> as true (by
conceding what follows from it, etc.), “counterpositing” requires the
respondent to uphold the <em>depositum</em> as false (by denying what
implies it, etc.). In other respects, counterpositing seems,
<em>mutatis mutandis</em>, to be a trivial variation on
 positing.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#27" name="note-27">27</a>]</sup>
 This itself raises an interpretive problem: why treat counterpositing
as a separate kind of <em>obligatio</em> at all?</p>

<p>

Another kind that that probably needs only cursory recognition is
“doubting.” Doubting (<em>dubitatio</em>), like counterpositing, is a
variation on positing. In this case, the respondent is required to
uphold the <em>dubitatum</em> as doubtful. (Recall the role of doubtful
irrelevant <em>proposita</em> in a <em>positio</em>.) Again, while the
complications can get get confusing in practice, theoretically this
seems a trivial variation on positing. One wonders again why some
authors singled it out as a separate kind of
 <em>obligatio</em>.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#28" name="note-28">28</a>]</sup></p>

<p>

A few words should be said about other kinds of <em>obligatio</em>.
Even apart from the context of <em>obligationes</em>, “institution”
(or “imposition”) was regarded as the assigning of meaning to
expressions of language. Within the context of <em>obligationes</em>,
the issue seems to have revolved around how institution or imposition
affected the correct responses in an obligational disputation. Suppose
we call a tail a leg (that is, “impose” the word ‘leg’ to
include tails). How many legs does a lion have? Should we say five, on
the grounds that we are calling tails legs? Or should we continue to
say four, on the grounds that our replies are to be given according to
the meanings words <em>actually</em> have, quite apart from whatever
meanings they might (counterfactually) be assumed to have in the
context of a disputation? (See Spade [1982a], pp. 339–40.)</p>

<p>

“Petition” (<em>petitio</em>) has been completely ignored in the
recent literature, and little can be said that is informative about it.
Somewhat more has been said about “the truth of the matter” (<em>rei
veritas</em>), but not much (Spade [1994–1997]).</p>

<h2><a name="Conclusion">6. Conclusion</a></h2>

<p>

The vocabulary of medieval <em>obligationes</em>-literature
(“positing,” “conceding,” “admitting,” “relevance/irrelevance”)
appears ubiquitously in late medieval scholastic writings. If not
otherwise, for this reason there is need for more study of the
literature and its role in medieval logic.</p>
