<h1>Religious Diversity (Pluralism)</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Tue May 25, 2004; substantive revision Fri Sep 4, 2015</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>

With respect to many, if not most issues, there exist significant
differences of opinion among individuals who seem to be equally
knowledgeable and sincere. Individuals who apparently have access to
the same information and are equally interested in the truth affirm
incompatible perspectives on, for instance, significant social,
political, and economic issues. Such diversity of opinion, though, is
nowhere more evident than in the area of religious thought. On almost
every religious issue, honest, knowledgeable people hold significantly
diverse, often incompatible beliefs.</p>
 
<p>

Religious diversity of this sort can fruitfully be explored in many
ways—for instance, from psychological, anthropological, or
historical perspectives. The current discussion, however, will concern
itself primarily with those key issues surrounding religious diversity
with which philosophers, especially analytic philosophers of religion,
are most concerned at present. Specifically, our discussion will focus
primarily on the following questions: How pervasive is religious
diversity? Does the reality of this diversity require a response? Can
a person who acknowledges religious diversity remain justified in
claiming just one perspective to be correct? If so, is it morally
justifiable to attempt to convert others to a different perspective?
Can it justifiably be claimed that only one religion offers a path
into the eternal presence of God? How should religious diversity be
approached in public education? The answers to such questions are not
simply academic. They increasingly have great impact on how we treat
others, both personally and corporately.</p>

<h2><a name="PerRelDiv">1. The Pervasiveness of Religious Diversity</a></h2>

<p> Religious diversity exists in a striking way between religions
that are theistic and those that are not. For instance, the
monotheistic religions Judaism, Christianity, and Islam agree that
there is a sole God.  Hinduism, by contrast, typically recognizes many
gods and goddesses, although some varieties of Hinduism, which count
these many deities as aspects of a single God, may be
monotheistic. Other strands of Hinduism are henotheistic, worshiping
one deity but recognizing many others. Another striking difference
between religions has to do with views of the human person. Within
many forms of Christianity and Islam, for example, the ultimate goal
is subjective immortality in God’s presence, while within some forms
of Eastern thought, for example, Theravada Buddhism, an important goal
is to understand that there is no essential self. However,
significant, widespread diversity also exists within basic theistic
systems. For example, within Christianity, believers differ
significantly on the nature of God. Some see God as all-controlling,
others as self-limiting, and still others as incapable in principle of
unilaterally controlling any aspect of reality. Some believe God to
have infallible knowledge only of all that has occurred or is
occurring, others claim God also has knowledge of all that will
actually occur, while those who believe God possesses middle knowledge
add that God knows all that would actually occur in any possible
context. Some believe the moral principles stipulated by God for
correct human behavior flow from God’s nature and thus that such
principles determine God’s behavior, while others believe that God
acts in accordance with a different set of moral rules, that for God
what is right is simply whatever God does. Some believe that only
those who have consciously “given their lives to Christ”
will spend eternity in God’s presence. Others believe that many who
have never even heard the name of Jesus will enter God’s presence,
while others yet do not even believe subjective immortality (a
conscious afterlife) to be a reality. Muslims also differ
significantly among themselves on these same divine attributes (Aijaz
2015).  Or consider the wide variety of Muslim perspectives on such
issues as the autonomy of the individual when interpreting the Qur’an,
how best to apply core Islamic values to modern life, and the status
of women. And we find equally pervasive, significant intra-system
diversity in Hinduism (Sharma 2011), Buddhism (Burton 2011), Judaism
(Shatz 2011), and Chinese Religions (Cheng 2011).</p>

<p>

While it is still somewhat popular in philosophical circles today to
focus on diversity among basic theistic systems, there is a growing
awareness that the same basic questions (and responses) that apply to
inter-system diversity (for example, to differing perspectives on the
most accurate basic theistic conception of God) apply just as clearly,
and in exactly the same sense, to intra-system diversity (for example,
to differing perspectives within Christianity over the extent of God’s
knowledge). And there is increasing awareness that the practical
import of intra-theistic diversity is just as significant as is that
of inter-theistic diversity. For most Christians, for instance, the
practical significance of retaining or modifying beliefs about God’s
power or knowledge is just as great as retaining or modifying the
belief that Christianity is a better theistic explanatory hypothesis
than is Islam. In fact, as Dennis Potter
points out, whether there are actually differing inter-theistic
perspectives on a given issues often depends on which intra-theistic
perspectives we are considering (Potter 2013).</p>

<h2><a name="PosResRelDiv">2. Possible Responses to Religious Diversity</a></h2>

<p>

One obvious response to religious diversity is to maintain that
since there exists no divine reality—since the referent in all
religious truth claims related to the divine is nonexistent—all
such claims are false. Another possible response, put forth by
religious relativists, is that there is no one truth when considering
mutually incompatible religious claims about reality; more than one of
the conflicting sets of specific truth-claims can be correct (Runzo
1988, 351–357). However, most current discussions of religious
diversity presuppose a realist theory of truth—that there is a
truth to the matter.</p>

<p>

When the topic is approached in this way, philosophers normally center
discussions of religious truth claims on three basic categories:
religious exclusivism, religious non-exclusivism, and religious
pluralism. For the purpose of our discussion, someone is a religious
exclusivist with respect to a given issue when she believes the
religious perspective of only one basic theistic system (for instance,
only one of the major world religions) or only one of the variants
within a basic theistic system (for instance, within Islam) to be the
truth or at least closer to the truth than any other religious
perspective on this
 issue.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-1" id="ref-1">1</a>]</sup>
 Someone is a religious non-exclusivist with
respect to a given issue when she denies that the religious
perspective of any basic theistic system or variant thereof is
superior to all other religious perspectives on this issue. Finally,
someone is a religious pluralist with respect to a given issue when
she claims not only (as a non-exclusivist) that no specific religious
perspective is superior but also makes a positive claim about the
truth of the matter.  The nature of this claim depends on the type of
issue in question.  If the issue is one on which there could be more
than one truthful perspective—for example, the sufficient
conditions for spending eternity in God’s presence—to be a
pluralist is to claim that the religious perspectives of more than one
basic theistic system or variant thereof can justifiably be considered
equally close to the truth (Marbaniang 2010). If the issue is one on
which there can be only one actual truth to the matter, but we have no
objective means of determining exactly what that truth is—for
example, the actual nature of God—to be a pluralist is to
claim that the perspectives of more than one basic theistic system or
variant thereof can justifiably be considered to reflect some aspect
of this truth (Byrne 2011, 36-7).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-2" id="ref-2">2</a>]</sup></p>

<h2><a name="RelDivEpiObl">3. Religious Diversity and Epistemic Obligation</a></h2>

<p>

No philosopher denies that the awareness of (realization of) seeming
religious diversity sometimes does in fact have an impact on an
exclusivist—from causing minor uneasiness to significantly
reducing her level of confidence in the truth of certain beliefs to
precipitating belief abandonment. This is simply an empirical claim
about psychological states and behaviors (Alston 1988, 442–446;
Plantinga 2000, 189).</p>

<p> How should, though, an exclusivist coming to an awareness of
religious diversity—the awareness that seemingly sincere,
knowledgeable individuals differ with her on an issue of religious
significance—respond to the reality of such diversity? How
should, for instance, the devout Buddhist or Hindu or Christian who
comes to realize that others who seem as knowledgeable and devout hold
incompatible religious perspectives respond? Or how should the
Christian who believes the Bible clearly portrays a God with total
control over all aspects of reality respond to the realization that
other seemingly sincere, devout, “Bible-believing”
Christians see the Bible as clearly portraying a God who has chosen
not to control what occurs in those contexts in which humans have been
granted meaningful moral freedom? Can an exclusivist justifiably
disregard such diversity?  If not, is the exclusivist under some
obligation to attempt to resolve such epistemic 
conflicts—engage in belief assessment (or reassessment) with openness to
possible revision? Or would it at least be a good idea for her to do
so?</p>

<p> Within the relevant “epistemology of disagreement
literature,” we find significantly different responses. There
are, of course, religious individuals (and groups) who believe it is
inappropriate to subject religious beliefs to assessment of any
sort. Certain individuals (sometimes called fideists) have argued, for
instance, that religious beliefs are not of a type properly subjected
to rational assessment and/or that assessing such beliefs demonstrates
a lack of faith (Peterson et al. 2013, 65–69). But few
philosophers currently hold this position. Most maintain that the
exclusivist has at least the right to assess her beliefs in the face
of religious diversity.</p>

<p>

There continues, however, to be significant debate on whether an
exclusivist is under an obligation to engage in such belief assessment.
Some philosophers agree with Robert McKim that “disagreement about an
issue or area of inquiry provides reason to think that each side has an
obligation to examine beliefs about the issue” (McKim 2001, 140). The
underlying assumption here is that when an individual’s perspective on
any issue, be it personal, social, economic, political, or religious,
has important consequences for that person or others, then that
individual is under an obligation to find the truth of the 
matter—to maximize truth. And an individual, in this case a religious
exclusivist, can only attempt to maximize truth or avoid error in the
face of diverse claims, it is argued, if she attempts to resolve the
conflict.</p>

<p>

The contention here, it must be emphasized, is not that such
resolution is always possible or that an exclusivist must necessarily
give up her belief if no resolution is forthcoming. Discussion
concerning those issues is yet to come. The claim, rather, is only that
the exclusivist is obligated at the very least to assess the evidence
for and against the beliefs in question and to try to “get a sense of
the appeal and of the concern of those who advocate them” (McKim 2001,
146).</p>

<p>

Others philosophers disagree. For example, Alvin Plantinga
acknowledges that if a proponent of a specific religious perspective
has no reason to doubt that those with whom he disagrees really are on
equal epistemic footing, then he is under a prima facie obligation to
attempt to resolve the conflict. However, Plantinga denies that the
Christian exclusivist need ever acknowledge that he is facing true
epistemic parity—need ever admit that he actually is differing
with true epistemic peers. Although the Christian exclusivist, we are
told, may grant that those with whom he is in disagreement have not
violated any epistemic duty and may know of no arguments that would
convince those with whom he is in disagreement that they are wrong and
he is right, the exclusivist is likely to believe that he “has been
epistemically favored in some way.” He might believe, for instance,
that he has been graced by “the Internal Witness of the Holy Spirit; or
perhaps he thinks the Holy Spirit preserves the Christian church from
serious error, at least with respect to the fundamentals of Christian
belief; or perhaps he thinks that he has been converted by divine
grace, so that he now sees what before was obscure to him—a
blessing not so far bestowed upon the dissenters” (Plantinga 1997,
296).</p>

<p>

Moreover, if any beliefs of this type are true, Plantinga contends,
then the Christian exclusivist is quite probably “in a better position,
epistemically speaking,” than those who reject the exclusivistic belief
in question. Therefore, since it cannot be demonstrated that Christian
belief of this sort is very likely false, the Christian remains
justified in maintaining that the proponents of other religious
perspectives are not actually on equal epistemic footing. And the same,
Plantinga acknowledges, might well be true for exclusivists in other
religious belief systems (Plantinga 1997,
 296).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-3" id="ref-3">3</a>]</sup></p>

<p>

The strength of this line of reasoning depends in part on the
debatable issue of who shoulders the burden of proof on the question
of equal epistemic footing. Those siding with Plantinga argue in
essence that unless an exclusivist must acknowledge on epistemic
grounds that are (or should be) accepted by all rational people that
those holding incompatible beliefs are actually on equal footing, the
exclusivist can justifiably deny that this is so and thus need not
engage in belief assessment (Kim 2011). Those supporting obligatory
belief assessment argue that it is the exclusivist who shoulders the
burden of proof. Unless it can be demonstrated on epistemic grounds
that are (or should be) accepted by all rational people that
proponents of the competing perspectives are not actually on equal
epistemic footing, the exclusivist must consider his challenger on
equal epistemic footing and is thus obligated to engage in belief
assessment (Basinger 2002, 26–27). Or, to state this important
distinction another way, it is Plantinga’s contention that we need not
acknowledge that those with whom we disagree are actually on equal
epistemic footing unless it can be demonstrated objectively that they
are equally knowledgeable and sincere, while his critics maintain that
we must acknowledge that those with whom we disagree are on equal
epistemic footing unless we have an objective means of demonstrating
that we are in fact more knowledgeable and/or sincere than they.  Most
philosophers of religion side with the critics and thus assume that
actual peer conflict cannot be denied (Byrne 2011, 30).

</p>

<p>

Another influential type of challenge to obligatory belief
assessment in the face of religious diversity has been raised by Jerome
Gellman. The focus of his challenge centers on what he identifies as
rock bottom beliefs. Such beliefs, as Gellman defines them, are the
epistemic givens in a religious belief system—the assumed,
foundational truths upon which all else is built. Gellman grants that
if a religious belief affirmed by an exclusivist is not rock bottom (is
not a foundational assumption), then it may well be subject to
obligatory belief assessment in the face of religious diversity.
However, he argues, since belief assessment only makes sense when one
isn’t certain that the belief in question is true, and since rock
bottom religious beliefs are among the foundational truths—the
basic, assumed truths—in an exclusivist’s epistemic system, no
assessment is necessary. Rather, when an exclusivist encounters a
challenge to such a belief—for example, a challenge to her rock
bottom belief in God’s ultimate control over all earthly 
affairs—she can, utilizing the G. E. Moore switch, justifiably maintain
that because her rock bottom belief is true, the competing belief can justifiably
be rejected (Gellman 1993, 345–364; Gellman 1998, 229–235).</p>

<p>

Furthermore, Gellman has added more recently, even if we grant that
rock bottom beliefs are at times open to belief assessment, the
exclusivist need not engage in such assessment in the face of religious
diversity unless she finds that the awareness of such diversity is causing her
to lose significant confidence in her own perspective. In the absence
of this type of internal conflict, she “may rationally invoke her
unreflective religious belief to defeat opposing religious claims,
without having to consider the question any further” (Gellman 2000,
403).</p>

<p>

It would seem, though, that even those who are sympathetic to
Gellman’s general line of reasoning would want to limit its
scope. Many religious beliefs held by exclusivists have practical
consequences. For instance, there are many theists worldwide who not
only still believe that men have some sort of God-given, inherent
authority over women, or that certain ethnic groups have God-given
superiority, or that certain sexual orientations are perversions of
God’s ideal, or that humans have God-given authority over the rest of
nature, or that God desires heretics to be silenced, they also act on
these beliefs.  However, it seems safe to assume that most
exclusivists, including Gellman, believe that some of these actions
are morally wrong and ought to be stopped to the extent possible.  And
in such cases, it is difficult to imagine many exclusivists
maintaining that those who hold the beliefs on which these acts are
based have no need to reassess these beliefs unless they personally
feel a need to do so. It seems rather that most exclusivists would
want those holding such beliefs to at the very least engage in
significant belief reassessment, even if these they don’t at present
personally feel this need be done.</p>

<h2><a name="RelDivJusBel">4. Religious Diversity and Justified Belief</a></h2>

<p>

Some philosophers/theologians assume that belief assessment, when
conducted properly, can often resolve epistemic peer conflict (Byrne
2011, 31; Aijaz, 2016).  But what if we assume that while the
consideration of criteria such as self-consistency and
comprehensiveness can rule out certain options, there exists no set of
criteria that will allow us to resolve most religious epistemic
disputes (either between or within religious perspectives) in a
neutral, nonquestion-begging fashion (Peterson et al. 2013,
69–74)? In what epistemic position does this then place the
exclusivist?  Or to use the phrasing preferred in the current
“epistemology of disagreement” debates, to what extent, if
any, is it reasonable for an exclusivist to retain her exclusivistic
beliefs when it is acknowledged that epistemic peers

The answer, as some see it, is that the exclusivist can no longer
justifiably maintain that her exclusivistic beliefs are true. J.C.
Schellenberg, for example, argues that because no more than one among
a set of incompatible truth claims can be true, a disputant in a
debate over such claims is justified in continuing to maintain that
her claim is true only if she possesses nonquestion-begging
justification for believing the incompatible claim of any competitor
to be false.  However, since no disputant in religious conflicts
possesses such justification, no disputant can be justified “in
holding her own claim to be true.” Or, as Schellenberg states
this conclusion in another context, we must conclude that in the
absence of objective, nonquestion-begging justification, none of the
disputants in religious conflicts “has justification for
supposing the others’ claims false” (Schellenberg 2000,
213). David Silver comes to a similar conclusion:
“[Exclusivists] should provide independent evidence for the
claim that they have a special source of religious knowledge …
or they should relinquish their exclusivist religious beliefs”
(Silver 2001, 11).Or stated another way yet, what the exclusivist must
do, given the lack of sufficient evidence for her perspective, is to
suspend judgment, that is, abandon her exclusivistic position and
give equal weight to all the self-consistent, comprehensive
perspectives in play (Christiansen, 2009; Feldman, 2006).</p>

<p>

Others have not gone this far, arguing rather that while the
exclusivist need not abandon religious belief in the face of
unresolved conflict, she must or at least be willing to hold her
exclusive religious beliefs more tentatively (with less
confidence). Philip Quinn argues, for instance, that acknowledged
epistemic parity necessarily has a negative (epistemically humbling)
impact on the level of justification for any religious belief
system. Such parity does not necessarily reduce justification below
a level sufficient for rational acceptability. But for those
proponents of a religion who are “sufficiently aware of
religious diversity, the justification that the [religion] receives
from its sources is a good deal less than would be the case were there
no such diversity” (Quinn, 2005a, 137).  James Kraft agrees,
arguing that when a person acknowledges that those with whom she
disagrees are equivalently informed and capable and have made no
obvious mistakes in reasoning, this person’s confidence in her
perspective is rightly reduced (Kraft, 2007).</p>

<p>

The tentativeness this reduction in confidence produces, McKim tell
us, does not entail never-ending inquiry. What it means, rather, is
that in the face of unresolved religious diversity, a person should be
open to the possibility “that one or more of the [alternatives]
may be correct … that the position one had thought to be
correct may be wrong [while] one of the other positions may be
right” (McKim 2001, 154–55). Joseph Runzo and Gary Gutting
agree. According to Runzo, “all faith commitments must be held
with the humbling recognition that they can be misguided, for our
knowledge is never sure” (Runzo 1993, 236). Gutting argues that
only interim, not decisive assent is justified in the face of
unresolved diversity and that “those who give merely interim
assent must recognize the equal value, as an essential element in the
continuing discussion, of beliefs contrary to theirs” (Gutting
1982, 108). Moreover, argues McKim, such tentativeness in the face of
diversity has an important payoff. It can lead to deep tolerance: the
allowance “that those with whom you disagree are people whom it
is worthwhile to approach with rational arguments” (McKim 2001,
178) And personal tolerance of this sort, we are told, may well lead
to a more tolerant and open society that will permit and even
encourage a diversity of opinion on all issues, including opinions on
religious matters. [Whether this is in fact the case will be considered
in detail in Section 6.]</p>

<p> William Alston represents an even more charitable response to
exclusivism. His perspective is based on what he sees as a crucial
distinction between two types of epistemic disputes: those in which
“it is clear what would constitute non-circular grounds for
supposing one of the contestants to be superior to the others”
and those in which it is not. In the former case—in those
cases in which there is a commonly accepted “procedure for
settling disputes”—it isn’t clear, he acknowledges, that
it is rational for a person to continue to maintain that her position
is superior (Alston 1988, 442–443). </p>

<p> However, as Alston sees it, there exists no such common ground for
settling basic epitemic disputes over religious truth claims, and
this, he contends, alters the situation drastically. It still remains
true, he grants, that the reality of religious diversity diminishes
justification. But the fact that “we are at a loss to specify
[common ground]” means, he argues, that with respect to those
religious perspectives that are self-consistent, it is not
“irrational for one to remain an exclusivist”—not
irrational for the proponent of any religious perspective to continue
to hold that her perspective is true.  That is, as Alston sees it,
given the absence of common ground for resolving disputes, the
proponent of any self-consistent religious perspective can justifiably
continue to believe this perspective to be true “despite not
being able to show that it is epistemically superior to the
competition” (Alston 1988, 443–446). Or, stated
differently yet, Alston grants that objective evidence is necessary
for justified belief when the debated issue is one for which such
evidence is available.  But when objective evidence is not 
available—as is the case for most important religious 
contentions—it cannot be required for justified belief.</p>

<p>

In fact, at one point he goes even further. Because there exists at
present no neutral ground for adjudicating religious epistemic
conflicts, it is not only the case, Alston argues, that an exclusivist
is justified (rational) in continuing to consider her own perspective
superior. Since we do not even know in most cases what a non-circular
reason for demonstrating superiority would look like, the “only
rational course” for an exclusivist “is to sit
tight” with the beliefs “which [have] served so well in
guiding [her] activity in the world.” Or, to generalize this
point, Alston speaks for those who maintain that, given the absence of
common ground for adjudicating disputes concerning self-consistent
religious perspectives, it is not rational for an exclusivist to stop
maintaining that her system is superior (Alston 1988,
 444).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-5" id="ref-5">5</a>]</sup></p>

<p>

Philip Quinn represents yet another, increasingly popular approach.
While he agrees with Alston that in the face of diversity an
exclusivist may well be justified in continuing to “sit 
tight”—in continuing to maintain that her religious perspective is 
true—he denies that this is the only rational course of action
available (Quinn 2000, 235–246). The basis for this position is his
distinction between a pre-Kantian and a Kantian understanding of
religious belief. To have a pre-Kantian understanding of religious
belief is to assume that we have (or at least can have) access to the
truth as it really is. It is to believe, for instance, that we do (or
at least can in principle) know what God is really like. To have a
Kantian understanding of religious belief is to assume that although
there is a literal noumenal reality, our understanding of this reality
(and thus our truth claims about this reality) will of necessity be
relative to the cultural/social/psychological lenses through which our
conceptualization of this noumenal reality is processed. It is to
believe, for instance, that although there is a divine reality about
which we can make truth claims, our understanding of (and thus our
truth claims about) this divine reality will necessarily to some extent
be conditioned by the ways in which our environment (our culture in the
broadest sense) has shaped our categories of thought (Quinn 2000,
241–242).</p>

<p>

Alston, Quinn contends, is essentially working off of a pre-Kantian
model of religious belief when he encourages religious exclusivists to
sit tight in the face of peer conflict since, in the absence of any
objective basis for determining which perspective is right, the
exclusivist has no sufficient reason not to do so. Quinn does not deny
that this pre-Kantian approach is justifiable and thus does not deny
that someone who follows Alston’s advice to sit tight is rational in
doing so. However, Quinn believes that “it should not be taken
for granted that any of the [contending perspectives] in its present
form is correct.” Hence, he believes it is equally justifiable
for an exclusivist to adopt a Kantian approach to religious belief.
Specifically, he believes it is equally justifiable for an exclusivist
to assume that whatever any of us can know about the truth of the
matter will never be a description of religious reality that is free
of significant “cultural” conditioning. Accordingly, it is
also rational, he maintains, for exclusivists encountering diverse
truth claims to “seek a more inclusivist or pluralistic
understanding of their own faith” by modifying their beliefs to
bring them “into line with such an understanding” (Quinn
2000, 242).</p>

<p>

In short, as Quinn sees it, those who hold a position such as
Alston’s have left us, at least implicitly, with a false dilemma:
either we find common ground on which we can objectively determine
which religious perspective is the truth or we sit tight with what we
have. However, Quinn holds that, once we realize it is perfectly
reasonable for a person to assume that the proponent of no religious
perspective has (or even could have) an accurate understanding of
divine reality as it really is, another rational alternative appears.
We then see that it is also perfectly rational for a person to begin to
revise her own phenomenological perspective on the truth in a way that
will allow for greater overlap with the phenomenological perspectives
of others.</p>

<p>

The approach to conflicting religious perspectives Quinn outlines has
in fact become increasingly popular in exclusivistic circles.
Consider, for example, the ongoing debate among Christians over how
God brought the rest of reality into existence. Some still claim the
Bible clearly teaches that God created the “heavens and the
earth” in six twenty-four hour periods about ten thousand years
ago. Others still maintain that the fact that “a day is to the
Lord as a thousand years” means that while God is directly
responsible for what the Bible says was created each
“day,” it is most reasonable to believe that the time
frame for each instance of creative activity could well have been
millions, or even billions, of years. And then there are those who
still hold that God’s direct creative activity consisted primarily of
orchestrating the “Big Bang.” However, more recently, many
Christians have taken a more Kantian approach. Based on their
assumption that we may well not have access, even through Scripture,
to exactly how God was involved in the creative process, they have
modified what is to be considered essential to Christianity on this
issue. Rather than affirming any of the specific explanations of how
God created all else, they affirm a more general contention compatible
with each of these specific explanations: that God is in some manner
directly responsible for the existence of all else. They have, in
Quinn’s terms, thinned their core theologies in a way that reconciles
the divergent perspectives.</p>

<p> Everyone realizes, though, that moving toward a thinner theology
can resolve the epistemic tension produced by religious diversity only
to a certain extent. Even if we assume that it is perfectly
reasonable, and possibly even preferable, for exclusivists to thin
their theologies in an attempt to minimize that core of truths that
must be accepted to remain proponents of the specific theological
perspectives in question, to be an exclusivist—even a strongly
Kantian exclusivist—is still to believe that one’s religious
perspectives on some religious beliefs are superior in the sense that
they are in some important way closer to the truth than are the
competing perspectives of others. Accordingly, while thinning her
theology may be a rational choice that can minimize conflict for the
exclusivist, no one is arguing that a certain amount of epistemic
conflict will not remain.</p>

<p> Finally, we find at the far end of the spectrum those who deny
that acknowledged peer conflict does in fact require the exclusivist
to abandon her exclusivism or even reduce confidence in her
exclusivistic perspectives.  The key to this position is a distinction
between personal (private) evidence and public evidence (evidence
available to all persons involved in the dispute). It is granted that
an individual will often find herself in epistemic disputes with
persons who are epistemic peers in the sense that they are (1) equally
intelligent, thoughtful, and free from obvious bias and (2) equally
familiar with all the relevant public evidence.  But the final
judgments made by each participant in such disputes are not made
solely on this public evidence, it is held.  Such judgments are based
also on personal beliefs to which only each participant has
access. Jennifer Lackey notes, for instance, that each person in an
epistemic dispute has greater access to the reliability of her own
belief-forming faculties than do her epistemic competitors (Lackey,
2010). Ernest Sosa talks of a gulf between the private and public
domain (Sosa 2010). Peter van Inwagen speaks of “incommunicable
insight that the others, for all their merits, lack” (van
Inwagen, 1996). And the weight of this private evidence, it is argued,
can make it reasonable for an individual to retain her beliefs
(including exclusivistic religious beliefs) with the same level of
confidence, even in the face of acknowledged peer disagreement in the
public sense.</p>

<p>
  
Some critics, of course, will maintain that this is primarily a verbal
victory.  The question, remember, is whether an exclusivist who
acknowledges that epistemic peers hold incompatible perspectives can
continue to justifiably maintain with full confidence that her
perspective is superior.  And it will seem to some that to claim that
participants in epistemic disputes have access to relevant personal
evidence not available to their epistemic competitors is in fact
simply to acknowledge that the dispute is really not among true
epistemic peers in the sense originally intended—that is, in
the sense that all parties are assessing the same body of
evidence.</p>

<h2><a name="RelDivApo">5. Religious Diversity and Apologetics</a></h2>

<p> Let us assume that an exclusivist is justified in retaining her
exclusivistic belief in the face of religious diversity. Ought she
stop there or can she justifiably go further? Can she justifiably try
to convince others that she is right—can she justifiably try
to convert others to her perspective? And if so, is she in any sense
obligated to do so?</p>

<p>

Most who believe that such proselytization is not justified challenge
the moral character of an exclusivist who attempts to convince those
with whom she differs to accept her perspective as the sole truth. For
instance, Wilfred Cantwell Smith argues that “except at the cost
of insensitivity or delinquency, it is morally not possible actually
to go out into the world and say to devout, intelligent fellow human
beings [that] we believe that we know God and we are right; you
believe that you know God, and you are totally wrong” (Smith
1976, 14).  And when Runzo claims that exclusivism can be
“highly presumptive” and “morally repugnant”
(Runzo 1988, 348) or John Hick maintains that exclusivists often
manifest a sort of arbitrariness or arrogance (Hick, 1989, 235), they
too appear to be challenging the moral character of those who attempt
to convert others to their perspective.</p>

<p>

Not surprisingly, most exclusivists deny that it is insensitive or
arrogant or presumptive for an exclusivist to attempt to convince
others that her perspective is the correct one—to tell others
that she is right and they are wrong. Since we are justified in
believing our position to be superior to others—closer to the
truth—it is difficult to see, exclusivists argue, how our
attempts to convince others that they should agree can be considered
arrogant or presumptive or insensitive, especially if we believe that
it is important for the welfare of those we are attempting to convert
that they do so. Moreover, exclusivists continue, while it is surely
true that some conversion is attempted for what we would all agree are
morally inappropriate reasons—for instance, for financial gain
or to gain power over others—there is little empirical evidence
that exclusivists in general have these motives. It is probably true,
rather, that many, if not most, exclusivists who proselytize do so
primarily because they believe they have what others need and are
willing (sometimes at great personal cost) to share it with them.</p>

<p>

Are, though, exclusivists required to proselytize? Many
exclusivistic religious systems do require proselytization, and most
philosophers who believe that exclusivists are justified in retaining
their exclusivistic beliefs in the face of religious diversity believe
also that these exclusivists can justifiably feel obligated to attempt
to “convert” their epistemic competitors. With very few exceptions,
though, philosophers deny that exclusivists are under any general
obligation to proselytize, regardless of whether the exclusivistic
system in question demands or encourages such
 proselytization.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-6" id="ref-6">6</a>]</sup></p>

<h2><a name="RelDivRelTol">6. Religious Diversity and Religious Tolerance</a></h2>

<p>

Religious intolerance, defined as the practice of keeping others from
acting in accordance with their religious beliefs, is not new.
However, there is concern world-wide over the increasing amount, and
increasingly violent nature, of such behavior.  Accordingly, there is
understandably a renewed interest in fostering religiously tolerant
environments in which individuals with differing religious
perspectives can practice their faiths unencumbered.</p>

<p>

A number of philosophers have recently turned their attention to the
relationship between religious diversity and religious tolerance, with
the main focus on whether acknowledgement of, and subsequent
reflection on, religious diversity might lead to greater religious
tolerance.  The main argument supporting the claim that acknowledged
diversity can foster tolerance was proposed by the late Philip Quinn
(Quinn, 2001, 57–80; 2002, 533–537; 2005a, 136–139).
He maintained that (1) serious reflection on the undeniable reality of
religious diversity will necessarily weaken an individual’s
justification for believing that her religious perspective is superior
to the perspectives of others and that (2) this weakened justification
can, and hopefully will for some, lead to greater religious 
tolerance—for example, will lead to a more accepting, less
confrontational attitude toward others.</p>

<p>

Both of Quinn’s contentions have been challenged.  The claim that
reflection of the acknowledged reality of religious diversity reduces
an individual’s justified confidence in the superiority of her
position has been subject to at least two types of criticism.</p>

<p>

As noted earlier in our discussion of religious diversity and
epistemic obligation (section 3), some philosophers agree with Alvin
Plantinga that the proponent of a given religious perspective need not
grant that his competitors are actually on equal epistemic footing and
is thus justified in continuing to maintain that his perspective is
superior without further reflection (Plantinga 1997, 296).</p>

<p>

Other philosophers do not deny that proponents of differing religious
perspectives are on equal epistemic footing or that reflection on
these diversity perspectives might in some cases actually cause an
individual to become less certain that her perspective is superior.
But they deny that there is any necessary epistemic connection between
acknowledged diversity and a weakening of justified personal
commitment.  That is, they argue that a proponent of a given religious
perspective can acknowledge both that those holding perspectives
differ from hers are epistemic peers and that she is not in a position
to demonstrate objectively that her position is superior and yet
justifiably continue to maintain that her perspective is in fact
superior (Hasker, 2008).</p>

<p>

Quinn’s second contention—that weakened justification in the
superiority of one’s perspective has the promising potential for
fostering religious tolerance—has also been challenged.  For
instance, William Lane Craig, Robert McKim, and Keith Yandell have all
argued that the weakening of a person’s conviction that the specific
teachings of her religion, including the relevant moral teachings that
prohibit intolerance, are correct might in turn actually make it more
likely that this person will engage in intolerant behavior as it may
well deflate the very confidence in the relevant beliefs needed for
inspiring tolerance (Craig, 2008; McKim 2008; Yandell, 2008).</p>

<p>

Others, such as William Hasker, have questioned whether Quinn’s
challenge to those who hold firmly to the superiority of their
religious perspectives—that the reality of religious diversity
requires that they hold their perspectives less firmly—will have
the effect Quinn intended.  It was his hope that those challenged in
this fashion would “soften” their exclusivistic convictions
and thus be less likely to engage in intolerant behavior.  But might
not just the opposite occur?  Might not those told that the reality of
religious diversity reduces their justified confidence in their
beliefs feel threatened and thus, in an attempt to “stand up for
the truths” they still firmly believe, become even more intolerant of those with other
perspectives (Hasker, 2008)?</p>

<p>

Those sympathetic to Quinn’s position do not deny that some who find
the justification for their religious beliefs challenged might for
that reason find themselves with a weaker basis for refraining from
intolerant behavior or become even more intolerant in defense of the
beliefs they continue to hold firmly. But those sympathetic to Quinn’s
“pathway from diversity to tolerance” maintain that
acknowledged religious diversity can, and often does, foster in a
person (1) a greater respect for her epistemic competitors and their
positions and (2) a more flexible, inclusive understanding of her own
position, and that those who respect their competitors and have a more
inclusive understanding of their own perspectives are less likely to
engage in inappropriate intolerant religious behavior (Basinger,
2008).</p>

<h2><a name="RelDivEteDesHum">7. Religious Diversity and the Eternal Destiny of Humankind</a></h2>

<p>

The discussion of religious diversity thus far has been framed in
terms of truth claims (in terms of justified belief) because it is
increasingly recognized by philosophers as the best way to access the
most important questions that the reality of such diversity forces upon
us. Historically, however, there has been one specific “diversity
issue” with which philosophers have been most concerned: the question
of the eternal destiny of humankind, that is, the question of who can
spend eternity in God’s presence—who can obtain salvation.</p>

<p>

Those who are religious exclusivists on this question claim that
those, and only those, who have met the criteria set forth by one
religious perspective can spend eternity in God’s
 presence.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-7" id="ref-7">7</a>]</sup>
 Adherents of
other religious perspectives, it is acknowledged, can affirm truth
related to some or many issues. But with respect to the question of
salvation (one’s eternal destiny), a person must come to understand
 and follow the unique way. Or, to be more specific, as
salvific exclusivists see it, the criteria for salvation specified by
the one correct religious perspective are both epistemologically
necessary in the sense that those seeking salvation must be aware of
these conditions for salvation and ontologically necessary in the sense
that these conditions must really be met (Peterson et al. 2013,
 322).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-8" id="ref-8">8</a>]</sup></p>

<p>

It is important to note, though, that not only Christians are salvific
exclusivists. For example, just as Christian salvific exclusivists
maintain that only those who respond appropriately to requirements set
for in Christian belief can spend eternity in God’s presence,
Muslim salvific exclusivists maintain that “whether a person is
‘saved’ or not is principally determined by whether he or
she responded appropriately to Islamic belief” (Aijaz 2014,
194).</p>

<p>

Also important to note is that differing, sometimes even
conflicting, exclusivistic claims can exist within the same world
religion. For instance, significant intra-Christian debate has centered
historically on the eternal fate of young children who die. For some,
the answer was (and still is) that all children who die are separated
from God eternally. Others have believed that God “elects” some for
heaven and allows the rest to spend eternity in hell, while still
others have held that only the deceased children of believers are
allowed to enter heaven or that salvation for children who die is tied
to the sacrament of baptism. A more common belief today among
Christians, though, is that all those who die in early childhood (or
die having possessed only the mental capacities of young children)
enter automatically into God’s eternal presence (Basinger 1992, 4).</p>

<p>

But what of those “adults” who die having never been
aware of the salvific conditions of the one true religion? Is it not
clearly unjust for exclusivists to claim that they cannot spend
eternity with God because they have not met the criteria for salvation
stipulated by this religion? For salvific inclusivists, the answer is
yes. Like exclusivists, inclusivists believe that eternal existence in
God’s presence is only possible because of the salvific provisions
noted in the one true religion. However, religious inclusivists allow
that some adherents of other religions can be saved because of these
provisions, even if the individuals in question haven’t made the
personal commitments normally stipulated as necessary to appropriate
these salvific provisions. Put in philosophical language, as
inclusivists see it, particular salvific events may be ontologically
necessary for salvation in the sense that salvation cannot occur
without them but not epistemically necessary in the sense that one need
not know about them to be saved or liberated (Moser 2011;Peterson et al. 2013,
334).</p>

<p>

Probably the best known Christian proponent of this inclusivist
perspective is Karl Rahner. Christianity, he argues, cannot recognize
any other religion as providing the way to salvation. However, since
God is love and desires everyone to be saved, God can apply the results
of Jesus’s atoning death and resurrection to everyone, even to those
who have never heard of Jesus and his death or have never acknowledged
his lordship. Just as adherents to pre-Christian Judaism were able,
through the redemptive acts of Jesus of which they were not aware, to
enter God’s presence, so, too, is it possible for adherents of other
religions to enter God’s presence, even though they are not aware of
the necessary redemptive acts of Jesus that makes this possible
(Peterson et al. 2013, 334–335). Inclusivists, it should be noted,
differ on the conditions such “anonymous Christians” must
meet. Some stipulate, for instance, that those who have never heard
“the gospel” still have both some innate knowledge of God and the
freedom to establish a relationship with God and, therefore, that the
eternal destiny of those in this category is dependent on the extent to
which they commit as much as they knows of themselves to as much as
they know of God through, or even apart from, a religion other than
Christianity. Other inclusivists don’t want to be as specific,
maintaining only that, because God is just, there will surely be some
adherents of other religions who will be in God’s presence because they
have met some set of divine conditions they have it within their power
to meet. But all agree these “anonymous Christians”
are the recipients of supernatural grace.</p>

<p>

Murtadha Mutahhari is a respected proponent of Muslim
inclusivism. Non-Muslims are at a disadvantage because it is the
Islamic Divine Law that leads people to God. And those who fully
understand this law (Islam) but choose not to accept the truth will be
damned. However, in accordance with Islamic jurisprudence, God will be
merciful to those who seek the truth but from whom, through no fault
of their own, the reality of Islam remains hidden. Such people cannot
be called unbelievers; they are rather “dispositional
Muslims” since it is possible to possess the requisite spirit of
submission without being Muslim in name. And these individuals will
receive the divine grace necessary to achieve salvation from Hell
(Mutahhari, 2006; Legenhausen, 1997). Others go so far as to question
whether Muslims can justifiably be exclusivists (Aijaz, 2014).</p>

<p>

Salvific pluralists, however, find such reasoning no more convincing
than that offered by exclusivists. Inclusivists are right, pluralists
grant, to say that individuals need not necessarily know of or fulfill
certain requirements normally specified in a given religion to attain
salvation. But inclusivists, like exclusivists, are wrong to argue that
this salvation is, itself, possible only because of certain conditions
or events described in the one true religion. There is no one true
religion and, therefore, no one, and only one, path to eternal
existence with God.</p>

<p>

Why, though, ought we consider this pluralistic salvific hypothesis
more plausible than that offered by the exclusivist or inclusivist?
According to Hick, the most influential proponent of pluralism, three
factors make a pluralistic perspective the only plausible option.
First, and foremost, he argues, is the reality of transformation
parity. An efficacious salvific process is not just other-world
centered—does not simply give individuals a
“ticket” to eternal existence with God. It begins
“the transformation from self-centeredness to
Reality-centeredness” in this life (Hick 1984, 229). That is, an
efficacious salvific process changes lives in the sense that it begins
to turn people from thinking about, and acting only to enhance, their
own personal well-being to viewing themselves as responsible
participants in a much greater, more expansive reality. In short, an
efficacious salvific process makes its participants better people. And
all the evidence we have, Hick maintains, shows that many religions
are equally transformational, given any general standard for positive
transformation we might want to consider (Hick 1989, chapter 3).</p>

<p>

There continues to be debate, however, over whether the same basic
personal transformation actually does occur within various 
religions—over whether there is real transformational parity. Few claim
that there is a strong experiential basis for denying such
transformational parity or that it can be demonstrated on other
objective, nonquestion-begging grounds that such parity does not exist.
However, proponents of many basic theistic systems claim that while
transformational parity may appear to be the case, this is actually not
so—that is, claim that the transformation within their systems
actually is qualitatively different than that produced by allegiance to
other systems. It is sometimes argued, for instance, that the
transformation within other systems will not last, or at least that
this transformation, while possibly real and even lasting for a given
individual, is not what it could have been for that individual within
the one true theistic system. And some exclusivists have argued that
unless it can be demonstrated in an objective, nonquestion-begging
sense that they are not justified in affirming a religious perspective
that makes such claims (which even Hick does not attempt to
demonstrate), they are justified in denying that such parity actually
exists (Clark 1997, 303–320).</p>

<p> It can also be argued that focusing on transformational parity can
be used as an argument against salvific pluralism. The basis for this
claim is the fact that people making a “secular”
(non-religious) commitment to some goal, value, or metaphysical
perspective—be it concern for the environment or world hunger
or emotional health—often appear to have their lives
transformed in ways quite similar to the ways in which the lives of
religious believers are transformed. They, too, appear to have changed
from self-centeredness to a focus on reality outside of self. If this
is so, however, then might it not be that the religious
transformational parity we observe is simply a sub-set of the general
transformational parity we find among individuals who commit
themselves to any perspective on life that centers reality outside of
self, and thus that it is just as plausible to assume that all
religious transformational parity is the result of some form of
internal conceptual realignment than the result of some form of
connection with an external divine reality? And if this is the case,
then transformational parity is at least weakened as support for any
salvific perspective, whether pluralistic, inclusivistic, or
exclusivistic.</p>

<p>

Seeming transformational parity is not, however, Hick’s only reason
for believing non-pluralistic salvific perspectives to be untenable. A
credible perspective, he tells us, must account for the fact, “evident
to ordinary people (even though not always taken into account by
theologians) that in the great majority of cases—say 98 to 99
percent—the religion in which a person believes and to which he
adheres depends upon where he was born” (Hick 1980, 44). And given this
fact—given that “religious allegiance depends in the great
majority of cases on the accident of birth”—it seems
implausible to hold that “being born in our particular part of the
world carries with it the privilege of knowing the full religious
truth” (Hick 1997a, 287).</p>

<p>

This contention, though, has also been challenged. No one denies
that the admittedly high correlation between where and when a person is
born and the religious perspective she affirms is relevant and might in
fact negatively affect an exclusivist’s confidence. But many
exclusivists deny that a pluralistic explanation should be seen as the
only plausible option. As they see it, exclusivists need not consider
the high place-time/religious allegiance correlation in question in
isolation from other relevant beliefs. For example, the Christian
exclusivist need not consider this correlation in isolation from her
basic belief that the Bible is an authoritative source of truth and
that the Bible teaches that only the Christian perspective contains a
totally accurate view of reality. And it is justifiable, some maintain,
for exclusivists to consider the plausibility of such relevant
background beliefs to outweigh the seeming counterevidence posed by the
correlation in question (Plantinga 2000, 187; Plantinga 1997, 198).</p>

<p>

Finally, Hick argues, a credible religious hypothesis must account
for the fact, of which “we have become irreversibly aware in the
present century, as the result of anthropological, sociological, and
psychological studies and the work of philosophy of language,”
that there is no one universal and invariable pattern for the
interpretation of human experience, but rather a range of significantly
different patterns or conceptual schemes “which have developed within
the major cultural streams.” And when considered in this light, a
“pluralistic theory becomes inevitable” (Hick 1984, 232).</p>

<p>

While no one denies that culture shapes reality to some extent, it can
again be argued that when comparing the plausibility of specific
beliefs, we must consider not only these specific beliefs themselves
but also the basic background beliefs in which they are
embedded. Thus, even if we grant that a pluralistic response to the
obvious shaping power of culture is preferable to any exclusivistic
response when such shaping power is considered in isolation, it isn’t
clear that exclusivists must acknowledge that Hick’s hypothesis is so
strong that it renders implausible the whole set of basic background
beliefs out of which the exclusivist’s response to the profound
shaping influence of culture on religious belief arises. Hence, it
isn’t clear that exclusivists can’t justifiably reject Hick’s
contention that a pluralistic cultural/religious interpretation of
reality must inevitably be considered superior.</p>

<p>

Hick argues for salvific pluralism on what might best be called
metaphysical or epistemological grounds. Other philosophers, however,
have attempted to make a moral case for salvific pluralism (or at least
against salvific exclusivism.) For instance, Kenneth Himma has argued
that moral considerations require Christian salvific
exclusivism to be rejected (Himma 2002, 1–33). It follows both from
God’s perfection and conceptual truths about punishment, Himma
maintains, that God would not punish individuals who are not morally
culpable for their behavior. But those with non-Christian beliefs are
generally not morally culpable for the fact that they hold these
beliefs. Not only is it not the case that any objective line of
reasoning demonstrates the Christian (or any other religious) path to
salvation to be the correct one, religious traditions are, themselves,
extremely elastic. That is, because of the shaping, foundational nature
of basic religious belief, devout proponents of any given religion are
capable of (in fact, usually simply find themselves) offering
self-consistent responses to almost any challenge to their salvific
perspective, no matter how strong or damaging this challenge might seem
on the surface. Furthermore, recent sociological, psychological, and
anthropological studies have confirmed that while one’s basic religious
beliefs are not inevitable, they are quite often to a significant
extent “beyond the direct volitional control of the believer” (Himma
2002, 18). So we must conclude, argues Himma, that it would not be
morally just for the Christian God to deny salvation to devout people
of other faiths.</p>

<p>

Not surprisingly, many nonexclusivists and pluralists will find this
basic line of reasoning persuasive. However, some (although not all)
exclusivists reject the basic moral assumption on which Himma’s
argument is based: that we are in a position to correctly identify some
of the basic moral principles that guide God’s interaction with us as
humans. Specifically, while many Christian exclusivists do believe that
God’s behavior is guided by the same basic principles of justice and
fairness that are so fundamental to our human moral thinking, this is
not true for all. There is a strong Christian tradition that holds that
God is under no obligation to treat any individual in what we would
consider a just, fair fashion. God can do what God wants (including how
God responds to those who haven’t affirmed Christian beliefs) for
whatever purposes God has. What God does is right simply because God does
 it.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-9" id="ref-9">9</a>]</sup>
 And even among those Christian exclusivists who come to acknowledge
Himma’s basic point—that a just God cannot condemn those who
aren’t culpable for their non-Christian beliefs—the response
has normally not been to reject their overall exclusivistic
perspective. It is often simply assumed, rather, that “God’s ways
are above our ways” in some manner unfathomable to the human
mind.</p>

<p>

However, even if we were to agree with pluralists that both
exclusivists and inclusivists are wrong to claim that the basis for
true salvation can be found in only one religion, the question of what
type of pluralistic hypothesis we ought to affirm remains. Hick,
himself, favors what might be called a selective pluralism that centers
on the world’s great religions. Hick has never denied that the major
world religions—Christianity, Hinduism, Buddhism, 
Islam—make conflicting truth claims. In fact, he believes that “the
differences of belief between (and within) the traditions are legion”
and has often discussed these conflicts in great detail (Hick 1983,
487). His basic pluralistic claim, rather, is that such differences are
best seen as differing ways in which differing cultures have conceived
of and experienced the one ultimate divine Reality. Each major
religious perspective “constitutes a valid context of
salvation/liberation; but none constitutes the one and only such
context” (Hick 1984, 229, 231).</p>

<p>

Why, however, select only the paths offered by the world’s great
religions as ways to salvation? For Hick the answer lies in the fact
that, unlike “Satanism, Nazism, the Order of the Solar Temple, etc.,”
the world’s great religions offer paths that lead us away from “hatred,
misery, aggression, unkindness, impatience, violence, and lack of
self-control” to love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness,
faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control (Hick 1997b, 164). Some,
though, see this sort of ethical standard for acceptable salvific
perspectives to be as arbitrary as the standard for acceptable paths to
salvation set forth by exclusivists or inclusivists (Meeker 2003, 5).
In fact, some have questioned whether, given this rather specific
ethical criterion for assessing the salvific adequacy of religions,
Hick’s perspective should actually be considered pluralistic at
all.</p>

<p>

S. Mark Heim, for instance, argues that pluralists such as Hick are
really inclusivists in disguise in that they advocate only one path to
salvation—the transformation from self-centeredness to
Reality-centeredness—and thus in essence deny that diverse
religions have real, fundamental salvific differences. A better, more
honest salvific pluralism, we are told, is to acknowledge that each
religion has its own path to salvation that may be either similar to or
different from that of other religions. That is, a more honest
pluralistic perspective is to deny that the seemingly different
salvific paths offered by various religious traditions are all just
culturally distinct manifestations of the same fundamental path and
maintain instead that salvific paths of various religions remain
incompatible, but equally valid ways to achieve salvation. This is not
to say, of course, it is acknowledged, that all the details of all the
salvific paths are actually true since some of the relevant claims are
inconsistent. But the appropriate response to this is not to claim
there is one true path to salvation. It is rather to claim that many
distinct paths, while remaining distinct, can lead to salvation (Heim
1995).</p>

<p>

Critics, however, wonder whether part of this seeming disagreement
is verbal in nature. Heim can appear to be bypassing the question of
whether there is some sort of final, ultimate eschatological salvific
state that the proponents of various religious perspectives will all
experience, emphasizing rather that many distinct religious paths can
liberate people (produce salvation) here and now (Peterson et al. 2013,
333). Hick, on the other hand, seems most concerned with the nature of
salvific reality—with what it means to experience 
salvation—while not denying that there exist in this world distinct ways
that remain distinct to access this ultimate reality.</p>

<h2><a name="RelDivPubEdu">8. Religious Diversity in Public Education</a></h2>

<p>

Public education in Western culture has always been to some extent a
“melting pot.” But the increasing number of students with
non-Western cultural values and religious traditions is causing public
school educators to grapple in new and sometimes uncomfortable ways
with the challenges such diversity poses. Some of these challenges are
practical—e.g., should Muslim girls be allowed to wear burkas,
should schools designate only Christian religious holy days as school
holidays? The focus of this section, however, will be a
pedagogical question of increasing interest in the philosophy of
education: How ought the increasing religious diversity to which
students are exposed affect public school curricula?</p>

<p>

Most public school educators agree that increasing student
understanding of diverse religious perspectives is important as this
will have positive social outcomes. It is often argued, for
instance, that helping students better understand the increasing
diversity, including religious diversity, they face will better prepare
them to live in a peaceful, productive manner with those with differing
cultural and/or religious values (Kunzman, 2006).</p>

<p>

Many educators, however, want to go further. It is also
important, they maintain, for students to clarify <em>their
feelings</em> about other religions and their followers.
Specifically, they want to foster a more empathetic understanding of
other religious perspectives, an understanding that encourages students
to <em>appreciate</em> the other religions from the perspective of an
adherent of that religion (Kunzman, 2006). While few challenge
this as a valid goal, there is, though, continuing controversy over one
common <em>method</em> by which educators attempt to engender this type
of empathy in students. As some see it, while having students
<em>think about</em> diverse religions is an important
step past the mere dissemination of factual information toward
empathetic understanding, having students <em>directly experience</em>
these religions in some way—for instance, having students visit
a local mosque or having a representative from a Buddhist Center share
with students in a class—is also necessary (or at least very
desirable). However, while no one denies that these forms of
direct experience might broaden a student’s empathetic
understanding of a religion, concerns have been raised.</p>

<p>

First, some believe that having students experience a religion, even
as “observers,” can test the limits of the separation of
church and state. While the intent of having students attend a
mosque or having a Buddhist talk with students is seldom to
“promote” a religion, the line between
“exposure” and intended or unintended promotion (and even
proselytization), they maintain, is a fine one, especially given the
widely varying communication skills and deeply embedded values and
preconceptions of the teacher and/or the representatives of a given
religion to whom students might be exposed. Second, there is
growing ethical concern that to experience a religion as an observer
might in some cases trivialize or demean the religion in
question. Some Native Americans, for instance, are becoming
increasingly concerned with the growing desire of
“outsiders” to seek understanding of their religion(s) by
watching or experiencing sacred ceremonies since such observation, they
believe, can trivialize these ceremonies (Kasprisin, 2003: 422).</p>

<p>

Is it justifiable for the public school educator to go even further
than the dissemination of accurate information and the attempted
engendering of empathetic understanding? Specifically, ought an
educator attempt to bring it about that all students affirm a core set
of “appropriate” beliefs about other religions and their
adherents?</p>

<p>

It is clearly the case that almost all public school educators
currently do attempt to bring it about that students hold certain
beliefs related to pervasive human characteristics, such as race,
gender, and disabling conditions. Students are encouraged, for
instance, to continue to believe, or come to believe, that engaging in
intolerant or discriminatory behavior is wrong and that they should
affirm, or come to affirm, the inherent worth and rights of the
disabled, those of other racial/ethnic backgrounds, etc. So if
the desire is simply to also encourage students to believe it wrong to
treat those of other religions in intolerant or discriminatory ways and
to believe it right to accept those of other religions as persons with
equal inherent value, few will object.</p>

<p>

But need teachers stop there? Might there not be other beliefs
about religions and their adherents that public school educators can
justifiably attempt to bring it about that all students accept?
We can extrapolate from some recent work on religious diversity by
Robert Wuthnow to introduce two beliefs that some might propose fit
into this category. As Wuthnow sees it, the most appropriate
response to the increasing religious diversity we face in this country
is what he labels “reflective pluralism” (Wuthnow, 2005:
286–307). To engage is this sort of reflection, he tells us, is
not simply to become better informed, or to strive to “live
peacefully with those with whom one disagrees” (be tolerant), or
even to attempt to develop an empathetic understanding of diverse
religions. It is to engage intentionally and purposefully with
“people and groups whose religious practices are fundamentally
different from one’s own” (Wuthnow, 2005: 289). And
such engagement, as he understands it, includes both (1) the
recognition that since all of our beliefs, including our religious
beliefs, depend on a point of view “shaped by the culture in
which we live,” we should not regard our “own position[s]
as inherently superior” and (2) “a principled willingness
to compromise” in the sense that we must be willing to move out
of our social and emotional comfort levels “in order to arrive at
a workable relationship with another person” (Wuthnow, 2005:
292).</p>

<p>

The benefit of this form of engagement, we are told, is not only
that it can minimize the likelihood of the sorts of “religious
tensions, conflicts, and violence [that] have been so much a part of
human history” (Wuthnow, 2005: 293). Such reflective
engagement also allows us to focus on “the shared concerns for
basic human dignity” found in the teachings of many of the
world’s religions, which can furnish a basis for inter-religious
cooperation to combat social ills and meet basic social needs (Wuthnow,
2005: 294).</p>

<p>

It is important to note that Wuthnow does not explicitly claim or
deny that encouraging students in a public school setting to become
reflective pluralists would be appropriate. But not only does he
highlight two increasingly popular pluralistic claims about 
religions—(1) that the beliefs of many religions are equally valid
expressions of faith, expressions that adherents of these religions
should be allowed or even encouraged to maintain and (2) that religious
believers of all faiths should identify and focus on what these
religions have in common—he highlights what such pluralists
often note as the main benefits of widespread affirmation of these
beliefs: a reduction in violent religious conflicts and an increase in
socially beneficial inter-religious cooperation. And these
outcomes are clearly quite compatible with what we have seen to be a
key reason why public school educators want to increase student
understanding of other religions—namely, their desire to better
prepare students to live in a peaceful, productive manner in social
contexts that will increasingly be characterized by religious
diversity. Accordingly, since it seems reasonable to believe that
widespread acceptance of the validity of diverse religious perspectives
and increased focus on the commonalities in diverse religions might
well result in more peaceful, mutually beneficial interaction among
followers of diverse religions, the question of whether public school
teachers can justifiably attempt to bring it about that students affirm
the beliefs in question appears worthy of exploration.</p>

<p>

Let’s first consider the contention that many religions
contain equally valid expressions of faith. Even if we make the
debatable assumption that this is true, it won’t be clear to many
that a public school teacher could justifiably attempt to bring it
about that her or his students believed this to be so. The
problem is that various religions affirm conflicting doctrinal beliefs
on significant issues. For example, while conservative Christians
maintain that one must affirm certain beliefs about the saving power of
Christ to spend eternity in God’s presence, conservative Muslims
strongly deny this. Orthodox Christians and Muslims are taught
not only that the sacred scriptures of other religions contain false
beliefs; they are often encouraged to try to convert those of other
religions to their religious perspective. And while many Muslims
and Christians believe in a personal supernatural creator and
personally immortality, some Buddhists deny both. This, however,
means that an educator can justifiably attempt to convince students
that all religions are equally valid expressions of faith only if she
or he can justifiably attempt to convince conservative proponents of
some of these religions that some of their core doctrinal beliefs need
to be modified or rejected. And to attempt to do this in a public
school setting will be seen by many as violating the prohibition
against both restricting the free exercise of religion and promoting a
given religion (Basinger, 2010).</p>

<p>

Might it not, though, at least be justifiable for a public school
educator to encourage students to respect the right of adherents to
other religions to retain their current religious beliefs? If we
interpret this as asking whether an educator can justifiably encourage
students not to attempt to prohibit adherents to other religions from
expressing and acting in accordance with their beliefs, a positive
response is noncontroversial since this is only to say once again that
educators should encourage students to be tolerant. However, to
encourage respect for the religious beliefs of others often carries
with it the explicit or implicit assumption that it is inappropriate,
if not unethical, to attempt to convince adherents of one religion to
convert to another. And for a public school educator to attempt
to convince all students that it is wrong to proselytize will again be
seen by some as placing this educator in the legally and morally
questionable position of attempting to convince some students to reject
or modify what for them is a very fundamental, core religious
belief.</p>

<p>

Perhaps, however, there is a different, less controversial option
for those educators who want to do more than simply encourage tolerance
of expression and empathetic understanding. Is it not at least
justifiable for the public school teacher to attempt to point out the
important common values affirmed by most of the world’s major
religions, values that we can all accept and should all desire to see
lived out? Is it not justifiable for an educator to point out,
for instance, that most of the world’s major religions prohibit
such things as killing, lying, stealing, and sexual exploitation, and
that these same religions encourage such things as helping those in
need and treating adherents of other religions with respect. To
do so, it has been argued, would not simply be of value within the
classroom or community. Since religious convictions clearly
influence social, political and economic activity on a global scale,
emphasizing the shared common values of religions has the potential to
facilitate better global relationships. And to encourage such
relationships is surely an appropriate goal of public education
(Shingleton, 2008).</p>

<p>

Some, of course, will see any focus on “positive
commonalities” as yet another thinly veiled attempt to encourage
students to modify their current religious beliefs in ways that make
such beliefs more accommodating of other religious perspectives.
However, most see no legal or ethical reason why a teacher should not
expose students to the “positive commonalities” in diverse
religious perspectives, and many see this as a helpful step.</p>

<h2><a name="Con">9. Conclusion</a></h2>

<p>

As we have seen, discussions of religious diversity lend themselves
to no easy answers. The issues are many, the arguments complex, and the
responses varied. It would be hard, though, to overstate the practical
significance of this topic. While some (many) issues that philosophers
discuss have practical implications for how we view ourselves and treat
others, none is more relevant today than the question of religious
diversity. Exclusivistic religious convictions have not only motivated
impassioned behavior in the past—behavior that has affected
significantly the lives of many—such convictions clearly
continue to do so today. So to the extent that such exclusivistic
behavior is based on inadequate conceptual tools and/or fallacious
reasoning, the continuing philosophical discussions of religious
diversity that clarify issues and assess arguments may well be of great
practical value.</p>
