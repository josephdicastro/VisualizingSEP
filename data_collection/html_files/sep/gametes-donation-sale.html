<h1>The Donation and Sale of Human Eggs and Sperm</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Thu Jun 15, 2017</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
The donation and transfer of human gametes (eggs and sperm) for
reproductive purposes raises many important and difficult questions.
Some of these relate directly to policy and practice; others are more
conceptual. Gamete donation occupies an interesting position within
bioethics, having something in common both with other forms of
<em>donation</em> (blood and organs, for example) and with
<em>reproductive technologies</em> not involving donation (ranging
from IVF through to more controversial areas like cloning, embryo
selection, and genetic modification). It also shares some features
with <em>adoption</em> and <em>surrogacy</em>, practices which also
(arguably at least) involve the transfer or delegation of parental
duties and rights. (See entries on
 <a href="../cloning/">cloning</a>,
 <a href="../eugenics/">eugenics</a>,
 <a href="../feminism-family/">feminist perspectives on reproduction and the family</a>,
 <a href="../organ-donation/">the donation of human organs</a>, and
 <a href="../parenthood/">parenthood and procreation</a>.)</p>
 
<p>
Conceptually, gamete donation provides a valuable ‘lens’
through which to re-examine questions such as:</p>

<ul>

<li>What grounds parental rights and responsibilities?</li>

<li>What rights and obligations do parents have regarding their
children (actual or future) and to what extent can these be
transferred or delegated?</li>
</ul>

<p>
It also raises questions in practical ethics and policy, such as:</p>

<ul>

<li>Should there be donor offspring limits (to prevent the same sperm
donor having hundreds of biological children)? And, if so, what is the
basis for these?</li>

<li>Do donor-conceived children have a right to know about their
origins? Should donor anonymity be permitted?</li>

<li>What ‘matching’ and selection decisions should the
prospective recipients be allowed to make? What information about
donors should they be given?</li>

<li>Is it acceptable to ‘buy and sell’ gametes? And is
that any different morally from arrangements in which women are
offered heavily discounted fertility treatment services in return for
some of their eggs?</li>
</ul>

<p>
Such questions are the subject of this entry.</p>

<p>
Before proceeding, however, two matters of definition and scope should
be noted.</p>

<p>
First, this entry focuses on the donation of human gametes <em>for
reproductive purposes</em>, as opposed to for research. The rationale
for this is that most of the interesting ethical and philosophical
issues here concern, in one way or another, the moral and social
relations between the donors, parents (recipients), and children
created, and these do not generally arise in the research context. The
main exception to this is
 <a href="#Paym">section 4 (Payment)</a>
 where similar questions of consent, exploitation, and harm have been
raised in both research and treatment contexts (Baylis &amp; McLeod
2007).</p>

<p>
Second, there is the question of what counts as (reproductive) gamete
donation. At least for the purposes of this entry, we intend the term
‘gamete donation’ to apply to those situations in which
–</p>

<ol type="i">

<li> <i>A</i> (the donor) voluntarily provides <i>B</i> (the recipient
or recipients) with gametes (paid or otherwise); <em>and</em></li>

<li> <i>A</i> expects that and/or intends that <i>B</i> will use those
gametes to create <i>C</i> (a child or some children);
<em>and</em></li>

<li> Both <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> expect that and/or intend that
<i>A</i> will <em>not</em> become a social or legal parent of
<i>C</i>.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="RighDutiGameDono">1. The Rights and Duties of Gamete Donors</h2>

<p>
Since the rights and responsibilities that attach to parenthood are
generally thought to be very weighty, determining whether or not
gamete donors are parents is a question that has attracted much
attention. While there is considerable overlap here with the
literature on the ultimate basis of parenthood more generally (see
entry on
 <a href="../parenthood/">parenthood and procreation</a>)
 questions about parenthood in the context of gamete donation have
garnered much specific attention. One important element that
distinguishes the gamete donation literature examining parenthood from
more general discussions of parental rights and responsibilities is
the debate over the <em>transferability</em> of parental
responsibilities. If transferring parental responsibility is easily
possible, then determining whether gamete donors are included amongst
their offspring’s <em>initial</em> parents might not be of great
pragmatic importance. In addition to the debate about parental
responsibilities, some others suggest that gamete donors have certain
non-parental responsibilities towards their offspring.</p>

<h3 id="ArguFavoGameDonoPare">1.1 Arguments in Favour of Gamete Donor Parenthood</h3>

<p>
A common starting point for the claim that gamete donors acquire
parental responsibilities is the intuition that individuals who
reproduce by accident, due to faulty contraception for example,
possess parental responsibilities for their genetic children (Weinberg
2008; Nelson 1999; Fuscaldo 2006; Blustein 1997). The strength of this
intuition is used as motivation for adopting a view that ascribes
parental responsibilities on the basis of causal involvement in the
creation of a child (causal views) rather than a view that ascribes
parental responsibilities only to those who voluntarily assent to them
(voluntarist views). Many authors who argue that gamete donors are
parents proceed by offering a theoretical justification for this
intuition, then apply this justification to gamete provision. </p>

<p>
For instance, Nelson argues that our common-sense understanding of
moral responsibility is what best explains our intuitions about
parenthood in unintentional pregnancy.  On this common-sense view,
individuals are morally responsible for the consequences of their free
actions when (1) their actions are sufficient to bring about those
consequences, and (2) their actions are causally proximate to the
consequence in question. Nelson further argues that gamete donors’
causal involvement in creating children does not significantly depart
from that of unintentional parents (or at least not in morally
relevant respects) and therefore that donors are equally parents
(Nelson 1999, 2014).  Fuscaldo similarly argues that parental
responsibility in cases of accidental pregnancy is best explained by
appeal to our standard account of moral responsibility, but argues
that the standard account holds individuals morally responsible for
the foreseeable consequences of their free actions. Since bringing
children into existence is a foreseeable consequence of donating
gametes, gamete donors have a moral responsibility to care for the
children they help create (Fuscaldo 2006). </p>

<p>
Another route is to argue that reproduction is an unusual kind of
case, and that special rules apply when determining what moral
responsibilities arise from involvement in it. An example is what
Benatar calls ‘reproductive autonomy’. Benatar argues that
individuals’ reproductive autonomy both entitles them to make
reproductive decisions, and requires them to take responsibility for
the consequences of those decisions. He argues that this is a special
feature of our ability to reproduce that is not reducible to genetics
or causality, and results in a presumptive duty to parent the children
created from our gametes. This, he argues, best explains why parental
responsibility arises in accidental pregnancy cases. Though in some
circumstances the presumptive duty to parent one’s genetic
children may be overridden, this is not the case for most instances of
gamete provision (Benatar 1999).</p>

<p>
One worry about Benatar’s argument is that its approach relies
too heavily on stipulating that unique moral features attach to
reproduction, and so risks begging the question. However, Rivka
Weinberg offers an argument for a similar conclusion, but on more
general grounds. Weinberg argues that when individuals exercise
control over materials that pose grave risks to others (what she calls
‘hazardous materials’) they are liable for the
consequences that arise, regardless of the precautions they take. As
an example, she argues that an owner of a pet lion is liable for
damage done by the lion, regardless of the precautions the owner takes
to keep the lion contained. Calling this the “Hazmat
Theory”, Weinberg argues that it applies to gametes because
their use can have morally weighty consequences for third
parties—namely the children that may result from the union of
gametes. Consequently, Weinberg argues that gamete providers are
obliged to care for the children that result from the voluntary use of
their gametes (Weinberg 2008).</p>

<p>
Importantly, none of the preceding arguments in favour of including
gamete donors amongst a child’s parents rely on genetic
relatedness. It is not the genetic similarity between gamete donors
and their biological offspring that is doing the work, but rather
considerations about the kind of thing gametes are (things that can
create people) and the activity that gamete donors engage in with
them.</p>

<p>
Velleman (2005, 2008), however, has argued that being parented by
close genetic relations is of great importance to the wellbeing of
children, and that for this reason we ought to be sceptical of the
ease with which society permits the separation of social from
biological parenthood. </p>

<h3 id="ArguAgaiGameDonoPare">1.2 Arguments Against Gamete Donor Parenthood</h3>

<p>
Bayne argues that gamete donors are not parents because both causal
and genetic accounts of parental responsibility suffer from a problem
of regress, and thus fail as plausible grounds for parenthood (Bayne
2003). For instance, if a person is the parent of the individuals
produced via their gametes, as they are according to Benatar, then it
is unclear why parenthood should stop at the gamete donor and not the
donor’s parents, or great grandparents etc. This because the
donor is the product of the gametes of these previous generations.
Similarly, on a causal account like the one offered by Nelson, if a
child was caused to exist by the actions of a sperm donor, then why
not think that the person whose actions are responsible for the
existence of the sperm donor is similarly a parent of the child.</p>

<p>
It is however unclear whether Bayne’s criticism in fact applies
to Nelson and Benatar’s views. Nelson does appeal to causal
proximity, but explicitly rejects the view that merely being part of
the causal chain resulting in the creation of a child is sufficient
for parenthood (Nelson 1991, 53). Benatar’s view does not rest
on the genetic similarity between gamete donors and their children,
but rather the autonomy individuals exercise over reproductive
materials. While Bayne highlights a problem that causal accounts must
resolve—namely where to draw the line in the causal
chain—he does not show that Nelson and Benatar’s view
succumbs to this problem.</p>

<p>
A better route for challenging the view that gamete donors acquire
<em>parental</em> responsibilities is to question whether
responsibilities of this kind arise from causal involvement in
procreation. For instance, Brake (2005, 2010) argues that while
certain obligations towards children might arise as a result of causal
involvement in procreation, it is a mistake to think that this
includes the particularly intimate and weighty obligations subsumed in
parenthood. More will be said about this argument in
 <a href="#NonPareResp">section 1.4</a>.</p>

<h3 id="TranPareResp">1.3 The Transferability of Parental Responsibilities</h3>

<p>
Bayne (2003), Fuscaldo (2006), and Benatar (1999) all argue that even if gamete
donors have parental responsibilities for their offspring initially,
this does not mean that these cannot be transferred to others. In
fact, there are circumstances where such transfers occur and we do not
think they are problematic at all—adoption being one example.
Fuscaldo (2006) argues that it is commonplace for parents to transfer
some of their responsibilities to others (like the responsibility to
educate their children to teachers, for example) and so we should not
think it strange for individuals who are initially parents to transfer
<em>all</em> their responsibilities to willing and competent others
(see also O’Neill 1979). Though Benatar (1999) holds that gamete donors
often fail to take sufficient care when transferring their
responsibilities to others, under the right conditions, transferring
parental responsibilities is both permissible and possible. </p>

<p>
By contrast, some authors argue that such a transfer of responsibility
is not possible, or at least not ethically permissible, at all
(Velleman 2008; Weinberg 2008; Nelson 1991; Brandt forthcoming). For
instance, Velleman (2008) argues that while adoption is acceptable
when there is no other means to provide a child with an adequate life,
this should not be confused with the intentional creation of children
whose social link to their genetic parents will be severed. Because
Velleman believes that preserving the social connection between
children and genetic parents is of great importance for the wellbeing
of children, he argues that, unless there is pressing reason to do
otherwise, children ought to be parented by their genetic
progenitors.</p>

<p>
Weinberg (2008) argues that parental responsibilities cannot be
transferred in full because certain kinds of intimate responsibilities
can only be fulfilled by particular individuals: individuals in the
right intimate relationship. For instance, a parent cannot transfer
the obligation to support her child by attending a music or dance
recital to a stranger. Since Weinberg thinks that gamete donors have a
responsibility to love their children and that, because responsibility
to love a particular person is paradigmatic of the kind that cannot be
transferred, at least some donor responsibilities are not
transferable.</p>

<p>
Taking a slightly different approach, Brandt argues that much of the
debate regarding the transferability of parental responsibilities
failed to distinguish delegation from transfer. He argues that the
important difference between the two is that in the former, delegators
remain responsible for ensuring that the responsibilities get
fulfilled, and thus are not fully alienated from them. He suggests
that, when re-examined with this distinction in mind, the main
examples offered in favour of the transfer of parental
responsibilities in fact only support the permissibility of their
delegation (Brandt forthcoming). For instance, parents have a duty to
ensure that their children are in fact receiving proper education from
their teachers, and thus Fuscaldo’s example provides a case for
the delegation but not transfer of parental responsibilities.</p>

<h3 id="NonPareResp">1.4 Non-Parental Responsibilities</h3>

<p>
Many authors argue that responsibilities arise for gamete donors that
do not rest on their status as parents. Bayne (2003) suggests that,
though gamete donors are not parents, they may have the responsibility
to prevent certain kinds of lives from coming about. For instance,
they may be obliged to refrain from creating children with severe
congenital diseases that would result in a ‘life not worth
living’. Many authors (Bayne 2003; Archard 2010; Porter 2014;
Fuscaldo 2006; O’Neill 1979) also think that gamete donors must
take steps to ensure that their offspring will be parented in at least
a minimally acceptable manner.</p>

<p>
While the responsibilities mentioned above can be fulfilled prior to
providing gametes, some authors think that certain non-parental
responsibilities continue to exist after a child has been created,
even if appropriate precautionary steps (e.g. choosing intending
parents carefully, screening gametes for congenital diseases, etc.)
were taken. For instance, Brake (2010) argues that gamete donors might
have an ongoing duty to ensure that their biological offspring receive
at least a minimum level of care (she calls these ‘procreative
costs’) but that this should not be confused with parental
responsibilities, which are more intimate and more morally weighty in
nature. However, Prusak (2011) argues that the gap between
Brake’s ‘procreative costs’ and parental
responsibility is not as pronounced as it initially appears. Like
Brake, Porter (2012, 2014) similarly argues that gamete donors must
continue to take steps to ensure that their offspring have a decent
life, though they are not necessarily obligated to parent their
offspring themselves. </p>

<p>
Another kind of non-parental obligation that gamete donors might have
is to remain open to the possibility of forming relationships with
their biological offspring, though this openness does not entail an
obligation to in fact form such relationships (Little 1999).</p>

<h3 id="OffsLimi">1.5 Offspring Limits</h3>

<p>
In addition to obligations that focus on the health of potential
offspring and the competence of intending parents, another question is
whether there ought to be limits on the number of offspring that can
be created from a single gamete provider. This question is most
significant in sperm provision because of the relative ease of
creating large numbers of children from the gametes provided by a
single individual. Three major justifications have been offered for
offspring limits: the risk of accidental consanguineous relationships,
the likelihood of convoluted social relationships with kin, and
general social discomfort with large offspring numbers (Wright 2016).
While the last might not be a plausible justification on its own, it
is worth mentioning because in practice such concerns have had an
influential role in the imposition of offspring limits (Deech 1998;
Warnock Report 1984).</p>

<p>
Limiting offspring numbers in order to reduce the likelihood of
accidental consanguineous relationships between offspring of the same
donor was initially proposed by individuals concerned about possible
health risks to subsequent generations (Curie-Cohen 1980). Recent work
has been undertaken in an attempt to quantify these risks and the
increased risk of congenital disease that such relationships pose (De
Boer et al. 1995; Wang et al. 2007). While the increased risk of
unintentional consanguinity is dependent on the size of the population
served by a sperm bank, the risk is lower than might be initially
thought. For instance, models developed by the Dutch suggest that an
offspring limit of up to 25 would not result in any significant
increased risk, given their particular demographic makeup (De Boer et
al. 1995). In addition to the increased risk of congenital disease,
there is a risk of psychological harm for individuals that discover
they have unwittingly entered into a consanguineous relationship,
given the associated social taboos (Wright 2016). Furthermore, there
may be legal complications if an accidental consanguineous marriage is
discovered after the fact (Cahn 2009a). One way to mitigate these
risks without imposing offspring limits would be to increase openness
in gamete provision, including actively informing individuals about
the identity of their genetic siblings. However, even in the absence
of such measures there is little agreement about how the risks
associated with consanguinity should be translated into offspring
limits, especially given the broad freedom individuals are generally
afforded in their reproductive decisions (Wright 2016; HFEA 2011).</p>

<p>
The main worry in relation to social relationships with kin is that
initiating and maintaining relationships with progenitors and/or
genetic siblings is made much more challenging if there are large
numbers to accommodate. The extent to which this justifies offspring
limits will depend on the importance placed on such relationships and,
as noted previously, there is much disagreement about this.
Furthermore, some empirical research into kin relationships following
gamete provision has found that having large numbers of genetic
siblings is not necessarily an impediment to the formation of
meaningful relationships (Freeman, Jadva, &amp; Slutsky 2016).</p>

<h2 id="DonoAnon">2. Donor Anonymity</h2>

<p>
There is general agreement that prospective parents ought to be able
to enter into arrangements with gamete donors that specify certain
kinds of engagement between the donor and future child, such as the
provision of detailed biographical information or even ongoing
contact. However, gamete donation arrangements in which there is an
expectation that donors remain anonymous are more contentious. While
some intending parents and donors prefer anonymous donation, there has
been much discussion about the ethical permissibility of such
arrangements. </p>

<p>
Advocates of children’s rights to access identifying information
about their donors generally defend their view by pointing to the
possible harms that might arise in the absence of such information,
and/or the purported fundamental right that individuals have to
information about their origins (Ravitsky 2010, 2012; Velleman 2005,
2008; McGee, Brakeman, &amp; Gurmankin 2001; Blyth &amp; Farrand
2004). Possible harms considered include psychological distress,
damaged familial relationships, reduced self-knowledge, and incomplete
or incorrect medical records. Those who favour permitting anonymous
donation argue that it is a mistake to place a great deal of
importance on genetic origins, and question both the severity of the
harms caused by anonymous donation and whether the existence of such
harms even constitute an argument against donor-anonymity
(Melo-Martín 2014; Haslanger 2009).</p>

<p>
The philosophical debate takes place within a background of changing
legal norms governing donor anonymity (Clark 2011; Frith 2001;
Bernstein 2010). While maintaining donor anonymity was once common
practice (and is mandatory in certain jurisdictions, such as France)
there has been a strong trend towards enshrining in law
donor-conceived children’s rights to access identifying
information about their donor, at least once they reach the age of
majority (Clark 2011; Frith 2001; Bernstein 2010; Brunet &amp;
Kunstmann 2013). </p>

<h3 id="PsycDistSelfKnow">2.1 Psychological Distress and Self-Knowledge</h3>

<p>
One reason for prohibiting anonymous gamete donation is the distress
that advocates of disclosure claim many donor-conceived children
suffer as a consequence of the absence of identifying information
about their biological progenitors. This distress is sometimes
referred to as ‘genealogical bewilderment’, a term
originally coined in reference to the distress experienced by
adoptees, and its symptoms are said to include difficulty developing a
personal identity that feels genuine, anguish about not knowing the
identity of one’s genetic relations, and an obsession with
trying to find out information about one’s genetic relations
(Sants 1964; Cahn 2009b). Advocates of the right to know point to both
scientific studies and general social observations, such as the rise
of services to help donor-conceived individuals find their biological
relations, as evidence of the severity of this harm (McWhinnie 2001;
Frith 2001; Ravitsky 2010).</p>

<p>
A related argument is that donor-conceived individuals are denied an
important good if they are not given access to detailed information
about their biological relations. More than simply satisfying
curiosity, some argue that knowledge about one’s biological
relations (especially through contact) is important for self-knowledge
(Velleman 2005, 2008). On this view, while a name and biographical
details may not replace being reared by biological relations, they do
at least provide donor-conceived individuals with <em>some</em>
information, and make contact later in life possible. </p>

<p>
However, both these arguments have been challenged on empirical and
philosophical grounds. While some studies do indeed show that a subset
of donor-conceived individuals suffer psychological distress from not
knowing the identity of their progenitors, others show that such
distress is not common, and generally not particularly severe
(Melo-Martín 2014; Haslanger 2009). Studies also show that early
disclosure helps children incorporate the fact that they were
donor-conceived into their identity and sense of self, thus helping
them avoid some of psychological harms associated with genealogical
bewilderment (Golombok et. al. 2002). Advocates of the permissibility
of donor anonymity thus argue that there is no clear evidence that
donor anonymity is likely to result in severe harm to offspring. </p>

<p>
Additionally, some argue that any psychological harm that does arise
is likely socially constructed. They point to studies showing that
individuals who are unaware that they were donor-conceived do no worse
than their peers when it comes to psychological wellbeing
(Melo-Martín 2014; Haslanger 2009). Consequently, they argue that any
psychological harms experienced by donor-conceived individuals arise
in virtue of the social importance placed on biological ties rather
than any ‘necessary’ deficit arising from being reared by
individuals who are not genetic relations. Similar arguments have also
been raised in response to Velleman’s views regarding the value
of contact with genetic relations for self-knowledge (Haslanger
2009).</p>

<p>
If the psychological harms arising as a consequence of donor-anonymity
are socially constructed, then prohibiting anonymous gamete donation
may exacerbate these harms. Such a prohibition could further reify the
importance of biological ties (sometimes referred to as
‘biologism’), which is what gives rise to the harms in the
first place (Melo-Martín 2014; Leighton 2014; Haslanger 2009).</p>

<h3 id="MediReco">2.2 Medical Records</h3>

<p>
Another reason offered for prohibiting anonymous gamete donation is
that it prevents donor-conceived individuals from making health
decisions informed by family medical history. If individuals are not
informed about being donor-conceived, they risk making medical
decisions on the incorrect assumption that their social family’s
medical background reflects their own. And even if such individuals
are informed that they are donor-conceived, they still suffer from an
absence of medical information that is generally available to others
(Ravitsky 2012). While it is true that medical information could be
provided at the time of donation in a manner that preserves the
anonymity of the donor, some argue that, as our understanding of
congenital disease changes, new information is likely to become
relevant (Leighton 2014; McGee, Brakeman, &amp; Gurmankin 2001).
Additionally, certain relevant medical conditions might only become
apparent long after the donation. While a system could be put in place
for donors to update their medical information, some argue that such a
system would likely be too cumbersome for donor-conceived individuals
to receive the medical information they need in a timely fashion
(McGee, Brakeman, &amp; Gurmankin 2001).</p>

<p>
However, those who defend the permissibility of donor anonymity argue
that the value of medical history is overstated, and will become less
important as we move towards personalized medicine (Melo-Martín
2014). In fact, in a report recommending <em>against</em> permitting
donor anonymity, the UK’s Nuffield Council on Bioethics stated
that medical interests alone were not sufficient grounds for
prohibiting donor anonymity (Nuffield Council on Bioethics 2013).</p>

<h3 id="FamiCohe">2.3 Family Cohesion</h3>

<p>
Another argument against donor anonymity is that secrecy about origins
has the potential to damage the relationships between donor-conceived
children and their social parents, especially in cases where the
social parent(s) know the identity of the gamete donor(s) Some argue
that the strain of having to ‘keep the secret’ is a cause
of stress for social parents, and that this stress has a negative
impact on familial wellbeing (Landau 1998). A potentially more
significant source of family tension is accidental disclosure,
especially when donor-conceived children are older. In this latter
case, several harms might arise, and may be greatly exacerbated if
children were not aware that they were donor-conceived. Children might
develop feelings of distrust towards their social parents, and may
have difficulty incorporating facts about their genetic history into
their personal identity (Turner &amp; Coyle 2000).</p>

<p>
While harms caused by both secrecy and accidental disclosure can be
mitigated to some extent without making identifiable information
available, by simply disclosing to children at a young age that they
are donor-conceived for example, some argue that more openness is
better for familial unity, and that providing children with an
opportunity to find out the identity of their donors (even if that is
delayed until they are older) is usually best (Nuffield Council on
Bioethics 2009).</p>

<p>
Those who favour permitting anonymous gamete donation argue that, at
best, the evidence suggests a slight improvement in familial wellbeing
when information about a donor is provided along with disclosure about
the method of their conception. Families in which children do not have
access to identifying information about their donors still report good
home-life and have positive relationships with their parents
(Melo-Martín 2014). Thus, while non-disclosure might not be optimal,
it is probably not so harmful that it falls outside of the domain of
parental discretion. Furthermore, if the harms are socially
constructed, as some have argued is the case in genealogical
bewilderment, then we may have additional reasons for concluding that
the harms to family cohesion do not justify prohibiting anonymous
donation, since doing so would only further contribute to biologism
(Melo-Martín 2014).</p>

<h3 id="FundRigh">2.4 Fundamental Rights</h3>

<p>
The arguments against donor anonymity considered thus far focus on
harms that might arise as a result of the practice. Another kind of
argument is that individuals have a fundamental right to knowledge
about their origins. In the legal literature, some have argued that
the UN’s Declaration on The Rights of The Child and the European
Convention on Human Rights establishes individuals’ rights to
information about the circumstances of their conception, including
information about their progenitors (Blyth &amp; Farrand 2004). Apart
from appeals to such declarations of rights, some attempts have been
made to motivate recognition of a fundamental right to know via appeal
to other fundamental goods.</p>

<p>
One strategy is to tie the right to know to the right to an identity.
Here the argument is that individuals require genuine facts about
their biological history in order to develop a proper personal
identity (Ravitsky 2010). However, one response is that that while
children have a right to an identity, they do not have a right to a
<em>particular kind</em> of identity, such as one based primarily on
historical biological ties (Allen 1996). Another route is to argue
that children have a right to be respected, and that hiding facts
about their origins is a form of deception that we ought not permit
(Freeman 1996). However, deception about origins is only a severe form
of disrespect if we think that biological ties are important in the
first place, and thus this argument risks begging the question.</p>

<h3 id="PoliArguAnalAdop">2.5 Policy Argument from Analogy to Adoption</h3>

<p>
Offspring’s ability to access adoption records have oscillated
quite substantially over the past century and a half, even within the
same jurisdiction (Samuels 2000). More recently, regulatory structures
have shifted in favour of providing adoptees with a legal right to
access identifying information about their progenitors (Besson 2007,
Hildebrand 1999). In such jurisdictions, some have argued that,
because gamete donation is sufficiently similar to adoption,
regulatory consistency demands that anonymous gamete donation be
prohibited as well (<em>Pratten v.  British Columbia (Attorney
General)</em> 2012 BCCA 480; Chisholm 2012; Cahn 2009c – see
Other Internet Resources). While this parity argument only goes so far
in the absence of philosophical justification for prohibiting
anonymous adoption (mere consistency could conversely be achieved by
permitting anonymous adoption) it does give pause to examine the
relevant similarities between the two practices.</p>

<p>
The core of the parity argument is that in both adoption and gamete
donation, children are reared by individuals other than their genetic
progenitors. If we think that access to information about genetic
progenitors is important enough to be elevated to the status of a
right in adoption, then we ought to extend the same right to
donor-conceived individuals as well. </p>

<p>
In response, Leighton has argued that there are important disanalogies
between adoption and gamete donation such that there may be no
inconsistency in prohibiting anonymity in one case but not the other
(Leighton 2014). For instance, adoptees are generally relinquished by
their initial parent(s), and are often not raised by either of their
genetic parents. In the case of gamete donation there is no similar
relinquishing of parenthood, and often one of the genetic parents is
also a social parent. These differences may very well result in
divergences in the experiences of adoptees and donor-conceived
individuals. For instance, adoptees might feel abandoned by their
initial parents, and be curious about why they were relinquished,
something that is unlikely to be the case in gamete donation.
Furthermore, Leighton argues that since adoption has a history of
stigmatization in the West while gamete donation has no such history,
there is good reason to think that the psychological impact of
anonymous adoption on adoptees will be different from the
psychological impact of anonymous gamete donation on donor-conceived
individuals (Leighton 2014). </p>

<p>
While simply demonstrating that there are relevant disanalogies
between adoption and gamete donation does not show that anonymity is
permissible in the latter case but not the former, it does show that
it is not outright inconsistent to have different policies governing
anonymity for each. </p>

<h2 id="DonoMatcSele">3. Donor Matching and Selection</h2>

<p>
Recipients of donated gametes often wish to have some say in what
their donor is ‘like’. The characteristics made available
to inform donor selection decisions differ greatly dependent on both
the countries and clinics in which such choices are made. However,
such information tends to include medical, morphological, and
biographical information similar to that found on dating websites,
such as hair colour, eye colour, ethnicity, educational attainment,
job type, hobbies, and religion.</p>

<p>
Few commentators suggest that recipient-parents should be barred
completely from accessing information about prospective donors, but
neither is it generally assumed that they should be afforded
unfettered liberty to choose their donors’ characteristics.
Thus, the debate in this area tends to focus on where the line between
morally acceptable and unacceptable selection practices lies.</p>

<h3 id="MotiUndeDonoSele">3.1 Motivations Underlying Donor Selection</h3>

<p>
Three main categories of motivation underlie donor selection
decisions.</p>

<p>
The first is selection against donors posing a threat to the physical
wellbeing of pregnant women. This form of selection is ubiquitous such
that the barring of donors with sexually transmissible diseases such
as HIV, hepatitis B and syphilis is mandated by national and
international guidelines on gamete donation (see, for example HFE Act
2008: s. T52 – see Other Internet Resources). This motivation for
selection is widely seen as morally unproblematic and will, for this
reason, be largely ignored here.</p>

<p>
The second and third categories of motivation, termed here, selection
for ‘matching’ and selection for ‘design’ are,
unlike the first, based on parental and/or societal preferences or
values. In practice, most donor selection decisions will fall into
both categories, but a theoretical distinction is nonetheless made
between the two in the philosophical literature. </p>

<p>
Selection for ‘matching’ is performed with the aim of
creating a child who bears a similarity to the recipient parents.
Thus, gamete donors are selected (or deselected) by reference the
extent to which their physical (and sometimes social and
psychological) characteristics match those of recipient parents. As
Braverman and Frith (2014) note, the aim of this practice is often:
</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
to enable secrecy and concealment of gamete donation. This practice
incorporates a popular knowledge of genetics and enables the child to
‘pass’ as a naturally conceived child. This is an attempt
to avoid overt ‘difference’ between child and couple and
when a good match is achieved the donor disappears from view.
(Braverman &amp; Frith 2014: 135)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
There may however, be aims other than secrecy and concealment. These
may have their basis in concerns regarding compatibility (wanting our
children to be ‘like us’ and to ‘fit in’)
(Ruddick 2000), premised on physical or psychological desire (we often
choose our reproductive partners because they possess characteristics
that please us), or even with the aim of avoiding offence - a member
of a couple may be offended if his/her partner prefers a donor with
characteristics markedly different from his/her own (Pennings 2000).
Importantly, matching motivations are distinguished from other
motivations for selection as they are limited only to desires to
select for donors with characteristics possessed by one/both intended
social parents and should be based only in a desire to attain
resemblance between parent and child.</p>

<p>
Selection motivated by design, however, is performed with the aim of
creating a child with characteristics which may or may not be
possessed by the recipient parents but which are, nonetheless, deemed
by them (and/or society) to be desirable (and often advantageous).
Such selection may thus be performed with several aims in mind. These
include but are not limited to desires to increase the life prospects
of one’s children by preventing the birth of children with
disadvantageous or without advantageous characteristics, to satisfy
preferences for a particular ‘kind of child’, or with the
eugenic aim of improving the gene pool through the selection of donors
deemed to possess ‘superior’ heritable traits.</p>

<p>
Of these two categories, a desire for <em>matching</em> is generally
thought to be less morally problematic than a desire for
<em>design</em>, since desires for familial resemblance, secrecy
(within limits), and to avoid offence are often considered relatively
benign. This is not, however, to say that no critical work has been
done on this topic as shall be seen in
 <a href="#CharRelaRace">subsection 3.3</a> which looks to the
question of whether race-based matching and selection practices are
morally permissible.</p>

<p>
Design-based motivations for selection, however, have been the subject
of a great deal more debate. This discussion largely mirrors (or is
subsumed by) many of the discussions had regarding the ethics of
selective reproductive technologies, such as pre-implantation and
pre-natal genetic diagnosis, and such topics as sex selection and
human enhancement (see entries on
 <a href="../ethics-pregnancy/">pregnancy, birth &amp; medicine</a>,
 and
 <a href="../eugenics/">eugenics</a>).
 For, although in the context of gamete donor selection there are no
embryos or fetuses involved, nor genetic manipulation performed, there
has been much focus on questions of:</p>

<ul>

<li>Whether it might be obligatory for recipient parents and/or
clinics to select against ‘disadvantageous’ genetic
characteristics in their future offspring via donor selection.</li>

<li>Whether selection for/against certain characteristics may be
impermissible on grounds that it explicitly or implicitly expresses
misinformed or ‘ugly’ and discriminatory attitudes towards
existing persons with ‘deselected’ characteristics. </li>

<li>Whether the desire to influence children’s genetic
constitutions through gamete donor selection represents troubling
parental attitudes which may be contrary to common conceptions of the
good parent and parental virtues such as ‘unconditional
love’ and ‘openness to the unbidden’</li>
</ul>

<p>
With this in mind, throughout the following subsections such debates
will be explored in turn.</p>

<h3 id="SeleAgaiDisaDisa">3.2 Selection against Disability and Disadvantage</h3>

<p>
The desire to have a child free from disability and disease is often
considered the least contentious ground for gamete donor selection.
Parents and prospective parents, after-all, tend to want the best for
their children and diseases and disabilities can make the attainment
of a ‘good life’ life harder. Given this, and the fact
that donor selection, unlike other forms of selective reproduction,
raises few thorny questions regarding women’s rights over their
own bodies and the moral permissibility of abortion or the destruction
of embryos, the dominant position among philosophers regarding gamete
selection for the purpose of disability avoidance is one of
permissiveness (see for example: Robertson 1994; Glover <i>et
al</i>. 1989; Glover 2006; Strong 1997; Bennett 2001; Wilkinson
2010). Robertson (1994) sums up this view well when he states:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The desire not to have a child with serious defects is not itself
immoral, and actions to avoid such a reproductive outcome should be
respected as an important aspect of procreative liberty. The question
then is what means to achieve that goal are acceptable…
Preconception selection by voluntary selection of mates or gametes
raises the fewest problems… Concern with the genetic fitness of
a mate may not be romantic but it is rational if one is concerned
about the health of spouse and offspring. Mate selection should thus
be left to the individual. Similarly, the selection of a gamete donor
should be left to the couple that needs this service. (Roberson 1994:
154)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Some go further, arguing that donor selection for the purpose of
disability-avoidance is not merely permissible but, in certain
circumstances, obligatory (see, for example: Savulescu 2001; Savulescu
&amp; Kahane 2009; Harris 1985, 2002; Buchanan et al 2000; Glover
1989; Glover 2006). Discussions regarding this matter have tended to
focus less on gamete donor selection and more on the selection of
embryos and fetuses through pre-implantation and pre-natal genetic
diagnosis. However, as Holm and Bennett (2014) and Williams (2017)
note, arguments suggesting a moral obligation to select against
disability in these contexts apply to gamete donor selection too.</p>

<p>
Indeed, that this is the case can be seen clearly in the negative
media reaction and public outrage directed towards a deaf couple who,
after deliberately conceiving a deaf child in the early 2000s via the
use of a 5<sup>th</sup> generation deaf sperm donor, were vilified by
the tabloid media and condemned by the US National Association of the
Deaf. (For interesting and insightful commentaries on this case see
Savulescu 2002; Spriggs 2002; Fahmy 2011.) It can also be seen in
the fact that many countries <em>require</em> that clinics screen out
potential donors for heritable diseases prior to their inclusion on
the donor register. A notable example of this is the UK’s Human
Fertilisation and Embryology Act which, since 2008, has included a
clause prohibiting the selection of gamete donors and embryos </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
that are known to have a gene, chromosome, or mitochondrion
abnormality involving a significant risk that a person with the
abnormality will have or develop: (a) a serious physical or mental
disability, (b) a serious illness, or (c) and other serious medical
condition. (HFE Act 2008, s. 14(4)(9) – see Other Internet
Resources)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Yet on what grounds might such an obligation be based? Some suggest
that <em>a moral basis for such an obligation may be found by focusing
on the interests of and/or the rights of the children that will result
from our procreative decisions</em> (see Davis 2001 for a
rights-focused approach). Arguments falling into this category thus
focus on person-affecting reasons, picking out the harms or limits to
opportunity associated with certain disabilities as providing good
reason to select against donors with traits liable to result in such
harms and limits to opportunity. Such an approach is intuitive.
However, given the conclusions of the Non-Identity Problem (see entry
on
 <a href="../nonidentity-problem/">the non-identity problem</a>),
 many question the logic of appeals to the interests of the child
created in all but cases of the most severe disabilities. For, as it
is generally held that a life with a disease or disability is better
than no life at all, and selection decisions alter who it is that
comes to exist rather than the prospects of determinate future
persons, a focus on the interests of future children cannot ground
such an obligation (Bennett 2009; Parfit 1984; Parker 2007; Robertson
1994).</p>

<p>
Others suggest that although the objects of our procreative efforts
may not be harmed by being born with a disability prospective parents
may nevertheless have good moral reason to select against disability
in their offspring on the basis of other considerations. These include
appeals to the interests of others whose interests may be affected by
our reproductive decisions such as existing children and other
dependents (Roberts 2009) and taxpayers in countries with socialized
medical and welfare systems (Heyd 1995; Fahmy 2011; Rakowski 2002;
Williams 2017); appeals
to the claim that to fail to take reasonable steps to prevent
disability in one’s future children is contrary to common
conceptions of the good parent (Steinbock &amp; McClamrock 1994); and
to the suggestion that that those who fail to avoid disability in
their offspring act wrongly as they deliberately or negligently choose
to create a state of affairs that is strictly worse (in terms of some
particular value such as happiness/preference satisfaction) than the
state of affairs that could have been created had they chosen
differently (Harris 1985; Parfit 1984; Glover 1989; Glover 2006). (See entry on
 <a href="../eugenics/">eugenics</a>
 for a more detailed treatment and criticisms of different arguments
in support of an obligation to select against disability.)</p>

<p>
Such arguments have been criticized by many who suggest that parental
obligations to their offspring cannot be so strong as to ground an
obligation to select against disability (Williams 2017); that </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
complex concepts such as the good life, the best life, and human
flourishing, are not reducible to simple elements or constituent parts
which might be identified by the testing of embryos [and selection of
sperm donors]; (Parker 2007: 281) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
and that appealing to impersonal harms devalues those with
disabilities by suggesting that their lives are worth less than those
without disabilities (Asch 2003; Bennett 2009). Yet, whilst such
authors tend to suggest that there cannot be an obligation to select
against disability, they also suggest that prospective parents should
be at liberty to do so. Among a number of authors associated with the
disability rights movement however, a different claim is made. For,
such authors suggest that not only can there be no moral obligation to
select against disability, parental preferences to screen out disabled
donors are morally problematic for two reasons.</p>

<p>
The first regards the messages that such preferences send about and
towards persons living with disabilities, ones which may be seen as
discriminatory and offensive: “express[ing] a hurtful attitude
about and a hurtful message to people who live with
[disabilities]” (Parens &amp; Asch 1999: S2).</p>

<p>
The second is that the desire to select against disabling genetic
traits is based on misinformation regarding both the severity and true
nature of disability. In terms of severity, for example, it has been
widely reported that persons with disabilities tend to report good
quality of life despite the fact that most (non-disabled) observers
suggest the opposite (for work on the disability paradox see Albrecht
&amp; Devieger 1999). Regarding the true nature of disability, it is
claimed that contrary to the views of many, who hold that disability
is inherently disadvantageous, many (and, for those who take an
extreme approach, all) of the harms associated with disability are
socially constructed. That is, they are often not the result of
failures in functioning but society’s failing to account for
everyone when designing physical, economic, and social institutions
(Glackin 2010). Thus, it is suggested that as disability is often not
a feature intrinsic to those who suffer it, to attempt to prevent
disability by preventing the existence of persons with inabilities is
very much akin to attempts to prevent sexism or racism by preventing
the births of black people and women: an inappropriate response to a
social problem (Asch 2003). Taken to extremes, however, social
constructivism is often viewed as irredeemably flawed by the academic
community and a great number of able bodied and disabled persons
alike. Robert Kitcher expresses this well when he notes that if we
take a wholly social constructivist view </p>

attempts to decrease the incidence of Tay-Sachs will be no different
from Northern Indian sex selection or from anticipated future efforts

<h3 id="CharRelaRace">3.3 Characteristics Related to ‘Race’</h3>

<p>
Questions and concerns have also been raised regarding the
appropriateness of selection on the basis of characteristics related
to ‘race’, such as skin, eye, and hair colour. Had gamete
donor selection been well known in the 1980s when discussion raged
concerning whether trans-racial adoption practices constituted a step
in the right direction towards the social ideal of colour-blindness, a
form of racial and cultural genocide, or something in between the two,
one might have expected to see similar discussions regarding donor
selection. This however has not been the case and instead, the
philosophical literature on race-based selection has tended to focus
on the question of whether selection of race-based characteristics is
appropriate at all.</p>

<p>
For the most part this focus is due to contemporary debates regarding
the question of whether the concept of race is philosophically and
scientifically defensible. Thus, work suggesting the removal of racial
identifiers on donor catalogues seems to owe a great deal to authors
such as K. Anthony Appiah (1995, 1996) and Naomi Zack (1993, 2002) who both deny
that race is a coherent concept and recommend discarding it entirely
(see entry on
 <a href="../race/#DoRacExiConPhiDeb">race</a>).</p>
 
<p>
Fogg-Davis (2001), for example, suggests that both the practice of
reproducing race through assisted reproduction and selecting donors on
the basis of different race-linked characteristics are problematic as
they raise two major linked ethical issues: </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
one is the harm that racial stereotyping causes to individuals, and
the second is the public awareness that racial stereotyping is an
accepted feature of this largely unregulated market. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
She suggests that those who use racial classification to inform donor
selection decisions are saying that </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
race is heritable and relevant to their vision of family
structure… that a person’s gametes are transmitters of
racial meaning that can and should be selectively transmitted to their
child through the use of reproductive technologies. (Fogg-Davis 2001:
18)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Harris (1998) too questions the legitimacy of the desire to match
donors to recipient parents on the basis of race-linked
characteristics such as skin tone, and hair and eye colour. He
notes:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Why do so many people firmly believe that children should be like
their parents, particularly in terms of their general colour and
racial characteristics? It is difficult not to view this desire, and
attempts to implement it, as a form of ‘ethnic cleansing.’
It smacks very much of the pressure that so many societies and
cultures have put upon their members not to ‘marry out’ or
to put it more bluntly, not to mate with somebody of another tribe or
race. (Harris 1998: 21)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Others however suggest that there is </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
no evidence to suggest that racial prejudice accounts for why sperm
banks sort sperm donors according to race or why many prospective
parents hope for a child of a particular race. (Fox 2009: 1860) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Such authors suggest instead that racial preferences in gamete
donation are more likely to stem from a desire to replicate the family
structure of the biological family, to avoid deficient access to
racial culture and consciousness, to increase their children’s
prospects in unjust social contexts, or premised on a desire “to
make the donor invisible and to conform the new-founded family to the
ideal of the natural family” (Pennings 2000: 508). With this in
mind, Fox suggests that although race-based selection should not be
condemned in all cases it is important to “soften the prominence
of race in donor selection by taking measures to frustrate wholesale
filtering of sperm donors on the basis of race” (Fox 2009:
1893).</p>

<p>
Others still note that those who desire to select for race-linked
characteristics for these ‘less objectionable’ reasons
must still consider the wider consequences of doing so. Agar (2004),
for example, when considering the question of selection for race and
sexual orientation in the context of genetic engineering, suggests
that whilst the aim of increasing the life prospects of one’s
children in racist and homophobic societies by selecting for
heterosexual and light skinned offspring is not objectionable, such
practices should not be permitted. Not only would such selection
collude with prejudice, constituting an inappropriate response to a
social problem, but it would likely also undermine attempts to change
racist and homophobic social attitudes and practices.</p>

<h3 id="PareVirtExpeOpenUnbi">3.4 Parental Virtues, Expectations, and Openness to the Unbidden</h3>

<p>
Gamete donor selection may also be motivated by a desire to parent a
‘particular kind of child’ such as where a music lover
seeks out a concert pianist in order to increase the likelihood that
the future child will possess such talents, or where a couple seek out
gamete donors with genius level IQ in order to increase the likelihood
of rearing an academically gifted child (as with the couples who
purchased sperm in the 1990s from the ‘repository of germinal
choice’) (Plotz 2006) .</p>

<p>
Such cases raise a different kind of concern about whether selection,
when performed in order to satisfy these kinds of preferences,
encourages and facilitates the development of ethically troubling
attitudes on the part of prospective parents.</p>

<p>
This concern has been expressed in various different ways. Some, for
example, suggest that selection motivated by such desires is
incompatible with parental virtues such as ‘acceptingness’
(McDougall 2007), ‘openness to the unbidden’ (Sandel
2007), and ‘unconditional love’ (Herrisone-Kelly 2007).
Those who take this view hold onto the traditional notion of the child
as a gift and correspondingly suggest that parents ought to care, not
about the traits that their children possess, but about developing a
loving relationship with and raising whatever child they receive.
Others take a more Kantian line, suggesting that such these parents
are wrongfully instrumentalising their children: treating them as a
means of fulfilling parental hopes and dreams rather than as entities
who, once born, exist for their own sake (Davis 1997).</p>

<p>
Yet the suggestion that a selective mentality is incompatible with
important parental virtues or problematically instrumentalises
one’s future children has been the subject of some debate.
Authors such as Ruddick (2000) and Green (2008), challenge the
‘maternalist assumption’ that parents </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
who want a child should accept and welcome any child they happen to
receive, prepared to appreciate the child’s developing
individuality, however different from their own. (Ruddick 2000: 102)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
They hold instead that other conceptions of parenthood can, provided
they are not taken to extremes, be perfectly adaptive, and crucially,
do not require parents to refrain from all attempts to shape the
characteristics of their prospective children. They suggest that
parents should rightly be viewed as both guardians of the
children’s future interests, and ‘gardeners’ who may
shape and raise children in line with their own preferences and
priorities.</p>

<p>
Others question whether the virtues of the prospective parent are the
same as those of an existing parent. For, although some hold that a
desire to have a hand in the characteristics of one’s future
children is part of a broader desire to parent and thus requires
“committing oneself to acting and evaluating one’s actions
and decisions in light of the project of parenthood” (Vehmas
2001: 439), others argue that a desire to select is not incompatible
with such a commitment. Kamm argues, for example, that a distinction
can be made between ‘caring to have’ a particular child
and ‘caring about’ one’s future children once born
and suggests that there is little reason to assume that the desire to
seek out certain attributes in one’s children is incompatible
with parental virtues or common conceptions of the good parent. She
notes </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
one can know that one will care about someone just as much whether or
not she has certain traits and yet care to have someone that has,
rather than lacks such traits. (Kamm 2009: 113) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This is echoed by Wilkinson who, discussing a hypothetical example of
two prospective parents who seek to ensure the birth of a blue eyed
child and agree that they will put it up for adoption after birth
should it not possess such characteristics, notes </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
it is not the desire to select that violates the principle of
unconditional love [or other parental virtues], but rather the plan to
reject the child if it does not live up to expectations… it is
entirely possible to want to select characteristics while not having
this problematic attitude of rejection. (Wilkinson 2010: 29)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Some suggest however that, although selection is not necessarily
morally problematic, we should still be concerned that a selective
mentality may be a precursor of conditional, as opposed to
unconditional, love once the child is born, or to unrealistic
expectations and feelings of entitlement. Thus, the suggestion here is
that people who go to great lengths and incur great expense in
procuring what are, for them, the ‘perfect’ gametes, may
be more likely to reject or otherwise mistreat their children should
they fail to develop the ‘right’ capacities and interests
(see, for example: Kass 2003; Sandel 2007). Again, however, it is not
at all clear that the link between a selective mentality in
reproduction and overzealous and unforgiving parenting styles is a
necessary one, as the majority of parents are not liable to be so
naïve to “presume to know what they are getting simply
because they had a hand in selecting some of their child’s
genetic features” (Fahmy 2011: 7), or indeed that gamete donor
selection is <em>as likely</em> as other <em>more expensive</em> and
<em>effective</em> forms of selective reproduction (such as genetic
engineering) to produce such problematic expectations and
attitudes.</p>

<h2 id="Paym">4. Payment</h2>

<p>
Should gamete providers be paid? If so, should such payments be
limited to compensation (possibly including compensation for time and
inconvenience)? Or is incentivising or rewarding providers also
morally acceptable?</p>

<p>
In favour of payment, the main reason cited is increased supply, thus
enabling recipients to have children that they wouldn’t
otherwise have had—or, where scarcity <em>per se</em> is not an
issue, giving recipients more choice. In addition, supporters of
payment cite justice (gamete providers deserve to be rewarded) and
autonomy (providers and recipients should be allowed to contract with
each other as they see fit). Finally, pragmatic arguments are
sometimes offered, such as the cost of prohibition or the possibility
of its leading to an unregulated ‘black’ or
‘grey’ market in gametes (Resnick 2001; Steinbock 2004;
Wilkinson 2013)</p>

<h3 id="FamiArguOtheCont">4.1 Familiar Arguments from Other Contexts</h3>

<p>
Some of the arguments and issues concerning payment for gametes
closely resemble ones arising in other areas such as organ sale, sex
work, and commercial surrogacy (see entries on
 <a href="../exploitation/">exploitation</a>,
 <a href="../feminism-family/">feminist perspectives on reproduction and the family</a>,
 <a href="../feminist-sex-markets/">feminist perspectives on sex markets</a>,
 <a href="../parenthood/">parenthood and procreation</a>, and
 <a href="../organs-sale/">the sale of human organs</a>).
 We deal with these briefly here before moving on to consider in
greater detail some of the more distinctive issues raised by paying
gamete providers. The focus here is on gametes for clinical use in
human reproduction, rather than gametes for research purposes,
although many of the same issues also arise in a research setting.</p>

<h4 id="HarmRiskDono">4.1.1. Harm and/or Risk to Donors</h4>

<p>
One of the most obvious issues is harm or risk to the providers
(Resnick 2001; Steinbock 2004).</p>

<p>
In the case of sperm, the physical risks of donating are negligible,
but concerns have been raised about psychosocial risks, especially if
one man is permitted to generate numerous offspring. What happens, for
example, if a single sperm donor produces hundreds of children and a
significant proportion of those contact him years later? That could
have a significant impact on the man’s life (and on the welfare
of the children, discussed below). One way of containing this risk
would be to limit donor offspring numbers; another would be to allow
donor anonymity, although that may be objectionable on other grounds
(see our earlier discussions of donor anonymity and donor offspring
limits).</p>

<p>
Producing hundreds of children is unlikely to be a problem for egg
donors but, unlike sperm donors, these women do face non-negligible
physical risks: notably OHSS (Ovarian Hyper Stimulation Syndrome).</p>

<p>
As with the organ sale debate, though, it is not clear why the
existence of these risks constitutes an objection to <em>payment</em>,
as opposed to an objection to <em>the whole practice of gamete
donation</em> (paid or otherwise) since the risks don’t increase
as a result of payment (Wilkinson 2013). In response to this, in the
case of sperm donation, it could be argued that the scenario where one
man produces hundreds of children is much more likely to happen if
payment is allowed, as some men seek to become ‘professional
sperm donors’. As has been noted however it should be possible
to neutralise this risk by enforcing donor offspring limits.</p>

<h4 id="ConsExplIndu">4.1.2. Consent, Exploitation, and Inducements</h4>

<p>
Another set of issues is the negative effect that payments, or
payments above a certain level, are supposed to have on the quality of
consent—a concern that is closely linked to worries about
exploitation. Financial incentives, it is argued, encourage people to
do things that they would not otherwise do, encourage them to do
things that are harmful, and make their actions, consents, and
decisions less likely to be autonomous and voluntary (Resnick 2001;
Steinbock 2004; Wilkinson 2013). These arguments are more often
directed at paid egg donation than paid sperm donation, because the
direct physical risks and the sums of money involved for eggs tend to
be much greater. Thus, people have been concerned that vulnerable
young egg donors might be lured into the egg market and then exploited
by clinics, egg banks, or recipients. These concerns structurally
parallel ones that people often have about commercial surrogacy and
sex work.</p>

<p>
Arguments of this kind are dealt with in much more detail in the
entries on
 <a href="../exploitation/">Exploitation</a>,
 <a href="../feminist-sex-markets/">Feminist Perspectives on Sex Markets</a>,
 <a href="../parenthood/">Parenthood and Procreation</a>,
 <a href="../informed-consent/">Informed Consent</a>, and
 <a href="../organs-sale/">The Sale of Human Organs</a>.
 For the present, we simply note that, while the possibility of
defective consent and exploitation must be taken seriously in any
system of paid gamete donation, there seems no reason in principle why
paying for gametes must be exploitative, nor why it cannot be validly
consented to. Provided that the payment-levels are fair, and that the
provider’s situation, mental capacities, and access to
information are all sufficiently favourable, it is hard to see
why—in common with other financial transactions—gamete
provision can’t be validly consensual and non-exploitative.</p>

<h4 id="CommSele">4.1.3. Commercialisation and Selection</h4>

<p>
Finally, we note here that there is a connection between remuneration
arrangements and selection practices (discussed above). In particular,
one objection to allowing payment—or at least to the unfettered
commercialisation of gametes—is that it may encourage a market
in which particular traits can, for those willing to pay a high price,
be aggressively selected for. For example, in the USA, young
attractive white female egg donors attending ‘Ivy League’
universities can command a higher fee for their eggs than other
donors—and anyone who is willing to pay can have access to those
eggs. So, anyone who regards selection practices like this as
problematic may also regard the commercialisation of gametes as
problematic inasmuch as it underpins and enables fine-grained
selection by ‘gamete consumers’ to take place.</p>

<h3 id="PaymWelfChil">4.2 Payment and the Welfare of the Child</h3>

<p>
We turn now to some of the more ‘distinctive’ issues
relating to paying gamete donors. The first of these is the welfare of
the child created. While this issue is ‘distinctive’
inasmuch as it applies only in the reproductive sphere (and so not to,
for example, organ sale) it does arise in other reproductive areas,
notably commercial surrogacy (Harris 2000).</p>

<p>
The main worry here is that when donor-conceived children find out
that money is what primarily motivated the donor then, in some cases,
this will have adverse psychological effects; in the most extreme,
they may come to feel that they were ‘bought’ (HFEA 2011).
What follows from this possibility, however, is unclear.</p>

<p>
To start with, there are empirical questions about how many
donor-conceived people will feel this way and about how severe their
negative feelings (if any) are. Not all donor-conceived people have
negative feelings about donor motives and financial reward; some may
not care what their donors’ motives were. So, if this concern is
going to ground an ethical argument against paying donors, a solid
evidence base will be needed to underpin its empirical premises.</p>

<p>
Similarly, there is a set of questions not so much about donors’
<em>actual</em> motives are, but about what they write on their
donation papers, and about how and when information is conveyed to
their offspring. One view is that, for the sake of the welfare of the
child, it would be better for donors to ‘tell a story’
(even if not wholly accurate) that donor-conceived children will find
more palatable than the bare truth that the donor simply needed money.
Another is that if donor-conceived children are communicated with
appropriately, honestly, and sensitively, and at an early stage then
any problems associated with donor motives will be minimal (Nuffield
Council on Bioethics 2013).</p>

<p>
Still, let’s allow (at least for the sake of argument) that
these problems are insurmountable: that—whatever we do—a
significant number of donor-conceived children will be substantially
harmed by the knowledge that their donors were paid. What follows from
this?</p>

<p>
First, we should note that this area is subject to the implications of
the Non-Identity Problem (Parfit 1984). In particular, given that
(let’s assume) many paid sperm donors <em>would not have donated
but for the money</em>, it is plausible to supposed that children who
suffer psychological harm when they find out about their donors
<em>would not have existed if there hadn’t been payments</em>.
Therefore, for standard reasons relating to the Non-identity Problem,
they may not be <em>harmed</em> by the practice of payment—or at
least not in the usual comparative harm-to-interests sense (worse off
than they would otherwise have been). (See entry on the
 <a href="../nonidentity-problem/">non-identity problem</a>.)
 So, while there may still be a child welfare argument against
payment, it must rely not on harm-avoidance but rather on impersonal
welfare considerations.</p>

<p>
Given this, a lot hinges on whether payment is required to ensure an
adequate supply of donor gametes. If it is not (if, for example, the
reasons for paying people are quite trivial ones, such as
administrative convenience, or even allowing recipients more choice)
then the fact that payment will adversely affect donor welfare does
looks like a good (albeit <em>prima facie</em>) reason to prefer
altruistic donation. Imagine that we have a choice between creating a
population of donor-conceived children using paid donors or a
different but equally large population using altruistic donors. If (as
we’re allowing) the latter will have a higher quality of life
then there is a strong ‘impersonal’ reason, other things
being equal, to prefer the latter: altruistic donation. Things look
rather different though if the choice is instead between a population
of donor-conceived children using paid donors or a different <em>and
significantly smaller</em> population, for then it would be necessary
to ‘trade off’ a higher average quality of life against
both (a) the fact that there are fewer lives overall and (b) any harm
done to prospective parents who are denied the opportunity to raise a
donor-conceived child. Any such moral calculation will be complex and
this goes to show that, in cases where payment is required to secure
an adequate supply of gametes, this is not obviously wrong (all things
considered) even if there are detrimental effects on donor-conceived
people’s quality of life (Wilkinson 2016).</p>

<h3 id="EggShar">4.3 Egg Sharing</h3>

<p>
Some countries (notably the United Kingdom) either prohibit or
strictly limit payments to egg donors but allow an exception whereby
‘egg sharers’ (women who are themselves undergoing
infertility treatment and wish to donate in return for reduced fees)
can receive unlimited benefits-in-kind in the form of cut-price
infertility treatment services. The UK, for example, limits payments
to egg donors to £750 (approx. US$900) and yet egg sharers can
have their own treatment costs reduced by many thousands of pounds
(HFEA 2017: guidance note 13).</p>

<p>
This raises the question of whether <em>ethically</em> egg sharing is
preferable to egg selling and, if so, why—along with the closely
related question of whether egg sharing should be treated more
favourably in law and professional regulation (Blyth &amp; Golding
2008).</p>

<p>
The main reason offered in favour of egg sharing is that
‘sharers’ are exposed to less additional harm and/or risk
than donors (paid or otherwise), since they are <em>already</em>
undergoing most of the required interventions as part of ongoing
treatment. It is supposed to follow from this that incentivising egg
sharing (other things being equal) is less morally problematic than
incentivising egg donation: either because of the putative wrongness
of encouraging people to take ‘excessive’ risks, or
because financial incentives may vitiate consent to those risks
(Wilkinson 2013).</p>

<p>
This does seem like a sound <em>prima facie</em> reason to prefer egg
sharing although several caveats must be noted. First, some special
types of risk may apply to egg sharers: for example, older women who
don’t have many viable eggs left might reduce their chances of
having a child by giving away ‘surplus’ eggs (Scott,
Williams, Ehrich, &amp; Farsides 2012). Second, and similarly,
concerns about consent may apply just as forcefully to egg sharers as
to egg sellers, especially if some of these are
‘desperate’ to have a child and egg sharing is their only
way of paying for infertility treatment services (Blyth &amp; Golding
2008). Thirdly, as already mentioned, this argument—if it
worked—would show egg sharing to be superior not only to paid
donation but also to altruistic donation, since the additional risks
are the same whether paid or not (Wilkinson 2013).</p>

<p>
A different kind of reason for treating egg sharing more favourably
than egg selling is based on the idea that egg sharers’ motives
will typically by morally preferable to those of egg sellers. In
particular, it has been claimed that whereas egg sellers are typically
motivated by the desire for money, egg sharers act partly out of a
sense of solidarity with potential recipients—in particular
because both the sharer and the recipient are in similar positions.
Both need, or want, infertility treatment services in order to have a
child (HFEA 2011; Prainsack &amp; Buyx 2011).</p>

<p>
However, whether this really justifies the differential treatment of
benefits-in-kind (treatment services) and monetary reward is far from
clear. One reason for doubt is that, as the HFEA notes:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
What is known about donor motivation … is that it is
multifaceted. People make decisions for a range of reasons, and
competent adults are capable of assessing the relative benefits,
burdens and likely impact of a range of options available to them. An
incentive to donate does not necessarily mean people will do so purely
because of that incentive. Indeed, the literature suggests that both
donors and sharers have mixed motives for donating. (HFEA 2011:
section 2, 4.4 [p. 8])</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This suggests that, in relation to solidarity, there is no categorical
difference between payment and benefits-in-kind. While some egg
sharers may be motivated mainly by feelings of solidarity, others may
be more interested simply in saving money. Conversely, while some paid
donors would be ‘in it just for the money’, others
(perhaps those whose close friends or relatives have fertility
problems, or who have experienced health problems of their own) could
be moved to donate because of feelings of solidarity (the fact that
they are financially rewarded notwithstanding). As such, it is by no
means obvious that all egg sharers are motivated by feelings of
solidarity, or that all paid donors would fail to have this feeling.
Indeed, it is by no means obvious even that <em>most</em> egg sharers
are motivated by feelings of solidarity and there is empirical
evidence suggesting that the number of sharers significantly decreases
when state funded treatment is made widely available (Pennings
2009).</p>

<p>
Finally, and more fundamentally, <em>even if</em> donations motivated
by altruism or solidarity were morally preferable to more
self-interested ones (donations motivated purely by the desire for
money, for example) it would not necessarily follow that the latter
are wrong or should be prohibited. For, it may just be that the former
are <em>supererogatory</em>: that while paid donation is merely
permissible, unpaid donation is an act of generosity or solidarity
goes beyond what is morally permitted or required (Wilkinson &amp;
Garrard 1996).</p>
