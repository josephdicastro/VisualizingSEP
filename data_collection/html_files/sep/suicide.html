<h1>Suicide</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Tue May 18, 2004; substantive revision Fri Jul 21, 2017</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
Throughout history, suicide has evoked an astonishingly wide range of
reactions—bafflement, dismissal, heroic glorification, sympathy,
anger, moral or religious condemnation—but it is never
uncontroversial. Suicide is now an object of multidisciplinary
scientific study, with sociology, anthropology, psychology, and
psychiatry each providing important insights into suicide.
Particularly promising are the significant advances being made in our
scientific understanding of the neurological and genetic bases of
suicidal behavior (Stoff and Mann 1997, Jamison 2000, Joiner 2010,
228–236) and the mental conditions associated with it.
Nonetheless, many of the most controversial questions surrounding
suicide are philosophical. For philosophers, suicide raises a host of
conceptual, moral, and psychological questions. Among these questions
are: What makes a person’s behavior suicidal? What motivates
such behavior? Is suicide morally permissible, or even morally
required in some extraordinary circumstances? Is suicidal behavior
rational? This article will examine the main currents of historical
and contemporary Western philosophical thought surrounding these
questions.</p>

<h2><a name="ChaSui">1. Characterizing Suicide</a></h2>

<p>
Surprisingly, philosophical difficulties emerge when we attempt to
characterize suicide precisely, and attempts to do so introduce
intricate issues about how to describe and explain human action. In
particular, identifying a set of necessary and sufficient conditions
for suicide that fits well with our typical usage of the term is
especially challenging. A further challenge is that due to
suicide’s strong negative emotional or moral connotations,
efforts to distinguish suicidal behavior from other behavior often
clandestinely import moral judgments about the aims or moral worth of
such behavior. That is, views about the nature of suicide often
incorporate, sometimes unknowingly, views about the prudential or
moral justifiability of suicide and are therefore not value-neutral
descriptions of suicide (Paterson 2003, 353, Cholbi 2011,
17–20). For example, Hitler, most people contend, was clearly a
suicide, but Socrates and Jesus were not (though on Socrates, see Frey
1978). This illustrates that suicide still carries a strongly negative
subtext, and on the whole, we exhibit a greater willingness to
categorize self-killings intended to avoid one’s just deserts as
suicides than self-killings intended to benefit others (Beauchamp
&amp; Childress 1983, 93–94). </p>

<p>
Such conceptual slipperiness complicates moral arguments about the
justifiability of suicide by permitting us to ‘define
away’ self-killings we believe are justified as something other
than suicide, whereas it would be desirable to identify first a
defensible non-normative conception of suicide and then proceed to
discuss the moral merits of various acts of suicide (Stern-Gillett
1987, Kupfer 1990). In other words, ‘suicide’ should not
be equatable with <em>wrongful self-killing</em> in the way that
‘murder’ is equated with <em>wrongful killing of
another</em>, lest we render ourselves unable to refer even to the
possibility of a morally justified self-killing. </p>

<p>
If a purely descriptive account of suicide is possible, where should
it begin? While it is tempting to say that suicide is any self-caused
death, this account is vulnerable to obvious counterexamples. An
individual who knows the health risks of smoking or of skydiving, but
willfully engages in these behaviors and dies as a result, could be
said to be causally responsible for her own death but not to have died
by suicide. Similarly, an individual who takes a swig of hydrochloric
acid, believing it to be lemonade, and subsequently dies causes her
own death but does not engage in suicidal behavior. Moreover, not only
are there self-caused deaths that are not suicides, but there are
behaviors that result in death and are arguably suicidal in which the
agent is not the cause of her own death or is so only at one remove.
This can occur when an individual arranges the circumstances for her
death. A terminally ill patient who requests that another person
inject her with a lethal dose of tranquilizers has, intuitively, died
by suicide. Though she is not immediately causally responsible for her
death, she appears morally responsible for her death, since she
initiates a sequence of events which she intended to culminate in her
death, a sequence which cannot be explained without reference to her
beliefs and desires. (Such a case exemplifies
 <a href="../euthanasia-voluntary/">voluntary euthanasia</a>.)
 Likewise, those who die via ‘suicide by cop,’ where an
armed crime is committed in order to provoke police into killing its
perpetrator, are responsible for their own deaths despite not being
the causes of their deaths. In these kinds of cases, such agents would
not die, or would not be at an elevated risk for death, were it not
for their initiating such causal sequences. (See Brandt 1975, Tolhurst
1983, Frey 1981, but for a possible objection see Kupfer 1990.)</p>

<p>
Furthermore, many philosophers (Fairbairn 1995, chapter 5) doubt
whether an act’s actually resulting in death is essential to
suicide at all. Just as there can be attempted murders or attempted
acts of deception, so too can there be ‘attempted’
suicides, instances where because of agents’ false beliefs
(about the lethality of their behavior, for example), unforeseen
factual circumstances, others’ interventions, etc., an act which
might have resulted in an agent’s death does not.</p>

<p>
Hence, suicidal behavior need not result in death, nor must the
condition that hastens death be self-caused. Definitions according to
which suicide occurs when a person acts knowing that her act will
cause her own death (Durkheim (1897)) thus fail to capture how death
is in some respect an <em>aim</em> of suicidal behavior. Second, what
appears essential for a behavior to count as suicide is that the
person in question <em>chooses</em> to die. Suicide is an attempt to
<em>inflict</em> death upon oneself and is “intentional rather
than consequential in nature” (Fairbairn 1995, 58). These
conditions imply that suicide must rest upon an individual’s
<em>intentions</em>, where an intention implicates an
individual’s beliefs and desires about her action. (See Brandt
1975, Graber 1981 Tolhurst 1983, Frey 1978, O’Keeffe 1981,
McMahan 2002, 455, Paterson 2003, Cholbi 2011, 20–31, Hill 2011)
An intention-based account of suicide would say, roughly, that</p>

<ol>

<li>A person <em>S</em>’s behavior <em>B</em> is suicidal iff

<ol type="a">

<li><em>S</em> believed that <em>B</em>, or some causal consequence of
<em>B</em>, would make her death at least highly likely, and</li>

<li><em>S</em> intended to die by engaging in <em>B</em>.</li>
</ol> </li>
</ol>

<p>
This account renders the notion of suicide as self-inflicted attempted
death more precise, but it is not unproblematic.</p>

<p>
Condition (a) is a <em>doxastic</em> condition. It is meant to show
that deaths (or increased risks for death) resulting from an
individual’s act that causes death (or the risk thereof) are not
suicides if the individual acts in ignorance of the relevant risks of
her behavior (for example, when an individual accidentally takes a
lethal dose of a prescription drug). At the same time, (a) accounts
for cases such as the aforementioned terminally ill patient whose
death is caused only indirectly by her request to die. Condition (a)
does not require that <em>S</em> <em>know</em> that <em>B</em> will
put her at a significantly greater risk for death, nor even that
<em>S</em>’s beliefs about <em>B</em>’s lethality be true
or even justified. Suicidal individuals sometimes have false beliefs
about the lethality of their chosen suicide methods, greatly
overestimating the lethality of over the counter painkillers while
underestimating the lethality of handguns, for instance. An individual
could believe falsely, or on the basis of inadequate evidence, that
placing one’s head in an electric oven significantly increases
one’s chances of dying, but that behavior is nonetheless
suicidal. The demand that <em>S</em> believe that <em>B</em> makes
death highly likely is admittedly inexact, but it permits us to
navigate between two extreme and mistaken views. On the one hand, it
implies that behavior which is in fact only marginally more likely to
cause a person’s death is not suicidal (you are more likely to
die driving your car than in your living room, but driving your car
hardly qualifies as ‘suicidal’). On the other hand, to
demand that S believe that <em>B</em> certainly or almost certainly
will cause <em>S</em>’s death is too strict, since it will
rarely be the case (given the possibility of intervening conditions,
etc.) that <em>B</em> will necessarily cause <em>S</em>’s death,
and in fact many suicidal individuals are ambivalent about their
actions (Cholbi 2011, 31–35), an ambivalence which is in turn
reflected in their selecting suicide methods that are far from certain
to cause death. It also allows us to distinguish genuinely suicidal
behavior from suicidal <em>gestures</em>, in which individuals engage
in behavior they believe is <em>not</em> likely to cause their death
but is nonetheless associated with suicide attempts, while in fact
having some other intention (e.g., gaining others’ sympathy) in
mind.</p>

<p>
Condition (b), however, is far more knotty. For what is it to intend
that death result from one’s behavior? There are examples in
which condition (a) is clearly met, but whether (b) is met is more
problematic. For instance, does a soldier who leaps upon a live
grenade tossed into a foxhole in order to save his comrades engage in
suicidal behavior? Many, especially partisans of
 <a href="../double-effect/">the doctrine of double effect</a>
 would answer ‘no’: Despite the fact that the soldier knew
his behavior would likely cause him to die, his intention was to
absorb the blast so as to save the other soldiers, whereas his death
was only a foreseen outcome of his action. Needless to say, whether a
clear divide exists between foreseen and intended outcomes is
controversial, and critics raise the worry that almost any outcome can
be described as foreseen (Glover 1990, ch. 6). (It is of course
possible that whether death is foreseen or intended has no bearing on
whether an act counts as suicide but still bears on whether that
suicide is justified.) Some would argue that given the near certainty
of his dying by jumping on the grenade, his death was intended, for
even though death is not the justifying aim of his action and he may
prefer not to die, his dying nevertheless has his endorsement in the
circumstances in which he acts (Tolhurst 1983, Cholbi 2011,
26–31). A further complication is that current psychological
evidence suggests that suicide is often an ambivalent act in which
individuals who wish to die must nevertheless overcome the ordinary
human fear of death (Cholbi 2011, 31–34, Joiner 2010,
62–70). Given this ambivalence, it may be difficult to determine
precisely whether an act that poses an apparently lethal threat to the
agent who performs it was in fact an act in which death was intended.
When a person dies in such circumstances, it may prove difficult
whether to classify the death as resulting from suicide (i.e.,
intentional self-killing) or as accidental. Such cases might indicate
the need for a third category besides intentional suicide and
accidental death (Cholbi 2007). </p>

<p>
The essential logical difficulty here resides in the notion of
intending to die, for acting so as to produce one’s death nearly
always has some <em>other</em> aim or justification. That is, death is
generally not chosen for its own sake, or is not the end of suicidal
behavior. Suicidal behavior can have any number of objectives: the
relief of physical pain, the relief of psychological anguish,
martyrdom in the service of a moral cause, the fulfillment of
perceived societal duties (e.g., <em>suttee</em> and
<em>seppuku</em>), the avoidance of judicial execution, revenge on
others, protection of others’ interests or well-being. (See
Fairbairn 1995, ch. 9, for a taxonomy of the varieties of suicide.)
Therefore, it is not the case that suicidal individuals intend death
per se, but rather that death is perceived, rightly or wrongly, as a
means for the fulfillment of another of the agent’s aims (Graber
1981, 56). In short, there do not appear to be any compelling examples
of “noninstrumental” self-killings in which “the
overriding intention is simply to end one’s life and there is no
further independent objective involved in the action”
(O’Keeffe 1981, 357). Nor does requiring that the individual
<em>wish</em> to be dead (Fairbairn 1995, ch. 6) address this issue,
since again, what one wishes is presumably not death itself but some
outcome of death. Both the grenade-jumping soldier and the depressed
individual may wish not to die insofar as they might prefer that their
desires could be satisfied without dying or without putting themselves
at the risk thereof. However, this is consistent with their willingly
choosing to die in order to satisfy their aims.</p>

<p>
Some (e.g., Beauchamp 1992, Cholbi 2011, 35–37) might wish to
add a further condition to (a) and (b) above:</p>

<ol type="a" start="3">

<li><em>S</em> was not coerced into <em>B</em>-ing.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Yet again, both the concept of coercion and its applicability to
instances of risky or self-harming behavior is unclear. Typically,
coercion denotes interference by others. So, according to condition
(c), a spy threatened with torture lest he relinquish crucial military
secrets who then poisons himself did not die by suicide, some would
contend, since the spy’s captors compelled him to take his life.
However, one can imagine a similar situation in which the agent of
“coercion” is not another person. An extremely ill patient
may opt to take his own life rather than face a future fraught with
physical pain. But why should we not say that this patient was
‘coerced’ by his situation and therefore did not die by
suicide? Because of their desires, loyalties, and values, both the spy
and the ill patient saw themselves as having no other alternative,
given their ends, but to cause their own deaths. In both instances,
what the individual has reason to do was modified by circumstances
outside their control so as to make death a rational option where it
previously was not. Thus, there does not appear to be grounds for
restricting coercion only to interference by other people, since
factual circumstances can be similarly coercive. Either <em>any</em>
factor, natural, human, or otherwise, that influences an
individual’s reasoning so as to make death the most rational
option counts as coercion, at which point condition (c) hardly
functions as a restriction at all, or cases such as the spy facing
torture are suicides too and (c) is unnecessary. (See Tolhurst 1983,
113–115.) Nor is it obvious that coercion necessarily changes
the nature of a coerced act. A person coerced into singing is
nevertheless singing. Hence, an act that is otherwise suicidal remains
suicidal even if it is coerced (Paterson 2003). </p>

<p>
This brief attempt at conceptual analysis of suicide illustrates the
frustrations of such a project, as the unclear notion of suicide is
apparently replaced by equally unclear notions such as intention and
coercion. We may be attracted to increasingly convoluted analyses of
suicide (Donnelly 1998, 20) or accept that suicide is an ‘open
textured’ concept instances of which are bound together only by
weak Wittgensteinian family resemblance and hence resistant to
analysis in terms of necessary and sufficient conditions (Windt
1981).</p>

<p>
An alternative to providing necessary and sufficient conditions for
suicidal behavior is to view it along a continuum. In the
psychological sciences, many suicidologists view suicide not as an
either/or notion but as a gradient notion, admitting of degrees based
on individuals’ beliefs, strength of intentions, and attitudes.
The Beck Scale for Suicidal Ideation is perhaps the best example of
this approach. (See Beck 1979.)</p>

<h2><a name="HigHisTho">2. Highlights of Historical Western Thought</a></h2> This section outlines the main currents of historical
philosophical thought about suicide in ‘the West’ (Europe,
the Middle East, and North America). Such an emphasis should not
obscure the rich traditions of thought originating outside those
geographical confines, however. Important thinkers from Africa, Asia,
and the indigenous populations of the Western hemisphere took a
philosophical interest in suicide. Little appears to unite
philosophical thinking about suicide from these traditions aside from
the fact that they are far less influenced by monotheism than is the
Western tradition. Some of the ethical considerations concerning
suicide raised in these traditions are also found in Western thought.
For instance, the claim that suicide may violate ethical duties to
others is addressed by Confucius, who primarily views the matter
through the lens of filial piety (Confucius 2003). Others, for example
the Jain practice of <i>sallekhana</i>, a type of spiritual fasting
intended to hasten death, do not seem to have correlates in the
Western tradition (Umaswati 1992). Unfortunately, the diversity of
positions within the non-Western traditions preclude easy summation.
Those interested in these traditions are urged to consult Battin
(2015). (The

<h3><a name="AncClaVieSui">2.1 Ancient and Classical Views of Suicide</a></h3>

<p>
Western philosophical discourse about suicide stretches back at least
to the time of Plato. Still, prior to the Stoics at least, suicide
tended to get sporadic rather than systematic attention from
philosophers in the ancient Mediterranean world. As John Cooper has
noted (Cooper 1989, 10), neither ancient Greek nor Latin had a single
word that aptly translates our ‘suicide,’ even though most
of the ancient city-states criminalized self-killing.</p>

<p>
Plato explicitly discussed suicide in two works. First, in
<em>Phaedo</em>, Socrates expresses guarded enthusiasm for the thesis,
associated with the Pythagoreans, that suicide is always wrong because
it represents our releasing ourselves (i.e., our souls) from a
“guard-post” (i.e., our bodies) the gods have placed us in
as a form of punishment (<em>Phaedo</em> 61b-62c). Later, in the
<em>Laws</em>, Plato claimed that suicide is disgraceful and its
perpetrators should be buried in unmarked graves. However, Plato
recognized four exceptions to this principle: (1) when one’s
mind is morally corrupted and one’s character can therefore not
be salvaged (<em>Laws</em> IX 854a3–5), (2) when the
self-killing is done by judicial order, as in the case of Socrates,
(3) when the self-killing is compelled by extreme and unavoidable
personal misfortune, and (4) when the self-killing results from shame
at having participated in grossly unjust actions (<em>Laws</em> IX
873c-d). Suicide under these circumstances can be excused, but,
according to Plato, it is otherwise an act of cowardice or laziness
undertaken by individuals too delicate to manage life’s
vicissitudes. Aristotle’s only discussion of suicide
(<em>Nicomachean Ethics</em> 1138a5–14) occurs in the midst of a
discussion of the possibility of treating oneself unjustly. Aristotle
concludes that self-killing does not treat oneself unjustly so long as
it is done voluntarily because the harm done to oneself is consensual.
He concludes that suicide is somehow a wrong to the state or the
community, though he does not outline the nature of this wrong or the
specific vices that suicidal individuals exhibit.</p>

<p>
To contemporary readers, the most striking feature of Plato’s
and Aristotle’s texts on suicide is their relative absence of
concern for individual well-being or rights. Both limit the
justifications for suicide largely to considerations about an
individual’s social roles and obligations. In contrast, the
Stoics held that whenever the means to living a naturally flourishing
life are not available to us, suicide may be justified, regardless of
the character or virtue of the individual in question. Our natures
require certain “natural advantages” (e.g., physical
health) in order for us to be happy, and a wise person who recognizes
that such advantages may be lacking in her life sees that ending her
life neither enhances nor diminishes her moral virtue.</p>

<blockquote>
When a man’s circumstances contain a preponderance of things in
accordance with nature, it is appropriate for him to remain alive;
when he possesses or sees in prospect a majority of the contrary
things, it is appropriate for him to depart from life…. Even
for the foolish, who are also miserable, it is appropriate for them to
remain alive if they possess a predominance of those things which we
pronounce to be in accordance with nature (Cicero, III, 60–61).
</blockquote>

<p>
Hence, not only may concerns related to one’s obligations to
others justify suicide, but one’s own private good is relevant
too. The Roman Stoic Seneca, who was himself compelled to engage in
suicide, was even bolder, claiming that since “mere living is
not a good, but living well”, a wise person “lives as long
as he ought, not as long as he can.” For Seneca, it is the
quality, not the quantity, of one’s life that matters.</p>

<h3><a name="ChrPro">2.2 The Christian Prohibition</a></h3>

<p>
The advent of institutional Christianity was perhaps the most
important event in the philosophical history of suicide, for Christian
doctrine has by and large held that suicide is morally wrong, despite
the absence of clear Scriptural guidance regarding suicide. Although
the early church fathers opposed suicide, St. Augustine is generally
credited with offering the first justification of the Christian
prohibition on suicide (Amundsen 1989). He saw the prohibition as a
natural extension of the fifth commandment:</p>

<blockquote>
God’s command ‘Thou shalt not kill,’ is to be taken
as forbidding self-destruction, especially as it does not add
‘thy neighbor’, as it does when it forbids false witness,
‘Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor.’
(Augustine, book I, chapter 20)
</blockquote>

<p>
Suicide, Augustine determined, was an unrepentable sin. St. Thomas
Aquinas later defended this prohibition on three grounds. (1) Suicide
is contrary to natural self-love, whose aim is to preserve us. (2)
Suicide injures the community of which an individual is a part. (3)
Suicide violates our duty to God because God has given us life as a
gift and in taking our lives we violate His right to determine the
duration of our earthly existence (Aquinas 1271, part II, Q64, A5).
This conclusion was codified in the medieval doctrine that suicide
nullified human beings’ relationship to God, for our control
over our body was limited to <em>usus</em> (possession, employment)
where God retained <em>dominium</em> (dominion, authority). Law and
popular practice in the Middle Ages sanctioned the desecration of the
suicidal corpse, along with confiscation of the individual’s
property and denial of Christian burial.</p>

<p>
The rediscovery of numerous texts of classical antiquity was one of
the spurs of the Renaissance, but for the most part, Renaissance
intellectuals generally affirmed the Church’s opposition to
suicide and were not sympathetic to the more permissive attitudes
toward suicide found among the ancient pagans. Two intriguing
sixteenth century exceptions were Thomas More and Michel de Montaigne.
In his <em>Utopia</em>, More appears to recommend voluntary suicide
for those suffering from painful and incurable diseases, though the
satirical and fantastical tone of that work makes it doubtful that
More supported this proposal in reality. In his <em>Essais</em>,
Montaigne relates several anecdotes of individuals taking their own
lives and intersperses these anecdotes with quotations from Roman
writers praising suicide. While his general skepticism prevented
Montaigne from staking out a firm moral position on suicide, he gives
only a nod to the orthodox Christian position and conceptualizes the
issue not in traditional theological terms but as a matter of personal
judgment or conscience (Minois 1999, 89–92). </p>

<p>
The Protestant Reformers, including Calvin, condemned suicide as
roundly as did the established Church, but held out the possibility of
God treating suicide mercifully and permitting repentance. Interest in
moral questions concerning suicide was particularly strong in this
period among England’s Protestants, notably the Puritans (Sprott
1961). Nonetheless, the traditional Christian view prevailed well into
the late seventeenth century, where even an otherwise liberal thinker
such as John Locke echoed earlier Thomistic arguments, claiming that
though God bestowed upon us our natural personal liberty, that liberty
does not include the liberty to destroy oneself (Locke 1690, ch. 2,
para. 6).</p>

<p>
In all likelihood, the first comprehensive modern defense of suicide
was John Donne’s <em>Biathanatos</em> (c. 1607). Not intended
for publication, <em>Biathanatos</em> drew upon an array of classical
and modern legal and theological sources to argue that Christian
doctrine should not hold that suicide is necessarily sinful. His
critique is in effect internal, drawing upon the logic of Christian
thought itself to suggest that suicide is not contrary to the laws of
nature, of reason, or of God. Were it contrary to the law of nature
mandating self-preservation, all acts of self-denial or privation
would be similarly unlawful. Moreover, there may be circumstances in
which reason might recommend suicide. Finally, Donne observes, not
only does Biblical Scripture lack a clear condemnation of suicide,
Christian doctrine has permitted other forms of killing such as
martyrdom, capital punishment and killing in wartime (Minois 1999,
20–21).</p>

<h3><a name="EnlModDev">2.3 The Enlightenment and Modern Developments</a></h3>

<p>
Donne’s casuistical treatise was an early example of the
liberalized Enlightenment attitudes of the 1700s. The Thomistic
natural-law stance on suicide came under increasing attack as suicide
was examined through the lens of science and psychology. Where
Christian theology has understood suicide as “an affair between
the devil and the individual sinner” (Minois 1999, 300),
Enlightenment philosophers tended to conceive of suicide in secular
terms, as resulting from facts about individuals, their natural
psychologies, and their particular social settings. David Hume gave
voice to this new approach with a direct assault on the Thomistic
position in his unpublished essay “Of suicide” (1783).
Hume saw traditional attitudes toward suicide as muddled and
superstitious. According to the Thomistic argument, suicide violates
the order God established for the world and usurps God’s
prerogative in determining when we shall die. Hume’s argument
against this thesis is intricate and rests on the following
considerations:</p>

<ol>

<li>If by the ‘divine order’ is meant the causal laws
created by God, then it would always be wrong to contravene these laws
for the sake of our own happiness. But clearly it is not wrong, since
God frequently permits us to contravene these laws, for he does not
expect us not to respond to disease or other calamities. Therefore,
there is not apparent justification, as Hume put it, for God’s
permitting us to disturb nature in some circumstances but not in
others. Just as God permits us to divert rivers for irrigation, so too
ought he permit us to divert blood from our veins.</li>

<li>If by ‘divine order’ is meant the natural laws God has
willed for us, which are (a) discerned by reason, (b) such that
adherence to them will produce our happiness, then why should not
suicide conform to such laws when it appears rational to us that the
balance of our happiness is best served by dying?</li>

<li>Finally if by ‘divine order’ is meant simply that
which occurs according to God’s consent, then God appears to
consent to <em>all</em> our actions (since an omnipotent God can
presumably intervene in our acts at any point) and no distinction
exists between those of our actions to which God consents and those to
which He does not. If God has placed us upon the Earth like a
“sentinel,” then our choosing to leave this post and take
our lives occurs as much with his cooperation as with any other act we
perform.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Furthermore, suicide does not necessarily violate any duties toward
other people, according to Hume. Reciprocity may require that we
benefit society in exchange for the benefits it provides, but surely
such reciprocity reaches its limit when by living we provide only a
“frivolous advantage” to society at the expense of
significant harm or suffering for ourselves. In more extreme
situations, we are actually burdens to others, in which case our
deaths are not only “innocent, but laudable.”</p>

<p>
Finally, Hume rejects the thesis that suicide violates our duties to
self. Sickness, old age, and other misfortunes can make life
sufficiently miserable that continued existence is worse than death.
As to worries that people are likely to attempt to take their lives
capriciously, Hume replies that our natural fear of death ensures that
only after careful deliberation and assessment of our future prospects
will we have the courage and clarity of mind to kill ourselves.</p>

<p>
In the end, Hume concludes that suicide “may be free of
imputation of guilt and blame.” His position is largely
utilitarian, allied with a strong presumption of personal liberty. The
Enlightenment was of course not univocal in its comparatively
permissive attitudes toward suicide. The most noteworthy opponent of
suicide in this period was Immanuel Kant. Kant’s arguments,
though they reflect earlier natural law arguments, draw upon his view
of moral worth as emanating from the autonomous rational wills of
individuals (Cholbi 2000, 2010). For Kant, our rational wills are the
source of our moral duty, and it is therefore a kind of practical
contradiction to suppose that the same will can permissibly destroy
the very body that carries out its volitions and choices. Given the
distinctive worth of an autonomous rational will, suicide is an attack
on the very source of moral authority.</p>

<blockquote>
To annihilate the subject of morality in one’s person is to root
out the existence of morality itself from the world as far as one can,
even though morality is an end in itself. Consequently, disposing of
oneself as a mere means to some discretionary end is debasing humanity
in one’s person… (Kant 423)
</blockquote>

<p>
(For a contemporary expression of this Kantian view of suicide, see
Velleman 1999.)</p>

<p>
The nineteenth and early twentieth centuries brought several
developments that, while not explicitly philosophical, have shaped
philosophical thought about suicide. The first was the emergence, in
novels by Rousseau, Goethe, and Flaubert, of a Romantic idealized
‘script’ for suicide, according to which suicide was the
inevitable response of a misunderstood and anguished soul jilted by
love or shunned by society (Lieberman 2003). The second was the
emergence of psychiatry as an autonomous discipline, populated by
experts capable of diagnosing and treating melancholy, hysteria and
other ailments responsible for suicide. Lastly, largely thanks to the
work of sociologists such as Durkheim and Laplace, suicide was
increasingly viewed as a social ill reflecting widespread alienation,
anomie, and other attitudinal byproducts of modernity. In many
European nations, the rise in suicide rates was thought to signal a
cultural decline. These latter two developments made suicide
prevention a bureaucratic and medical preoccupation, leading to a wave
of institutionalization for suicidal persons. All three conspired to
suggest that suicide is caused by impersonal social or psychological
forces rather than by the agency of individuals.</p>

<h2><a name="MorRatSui">3. The Morality and Rationality of Suicide</a></h2>

<h3><a name="MorPer">3.1 Moral Permissibility</a></h3>

<p>
The principal moral issue surrounding suicide has been </p>

<ol>

<li>Are there conditions under which suicide is morally justified, and
if so, which conditions?</li>
</ol>

<p>
Several important historical answers to (1) have already been
mentioned.</p>

<p>
This question should be distinguished from three others:</p>

<ol>

<li>Should other individuals attempt to prevent suicide?</li>

<li>Should the state criminalize suicide or attempt to prevent
it?</li>

<li>Is suicide ever rational or prudent? </li>
</ol>

<p>
Obviously, answers to any one of these four questions will bear on how
the other three ought to be answered. For instance, it might be
assumed that if suicide is morally permissible in some circumstances,
then neither other individuals nor the state should interfere with
suicidal behavior (in those same circumstances). However, this
conclusion might not follow if those same suicidal individuals are
irrational and interference is required in order to prevent them from
taking their lives, an outcome they would regret were they more fully
rational. Furthermore, for those moral theories that emphasize
rational autonomy, whether an individual has rationally chosen to take
her own life may settle all four questions. In any event, the
interrelationships among suicide’s moral permissibility, its
rationality, and the duties of others and of society as a whole is
complex, and we should be wary of assuming that an answer to any one
of these four questions decisively settles the other three.</p>

<h3><a name="DeoArgSanLif">3.2 The Deontological Argument from the Sanctity of Life</a></h3>

<p>
The simplest moral outlook on suicide holds that it is necessarily
wrong because human life is sacred. Though this position is often
associated with religious thinkers, especially Catholics, Ronald
Dworkin (1993) points out that atheists may appeal to this claim as
well. According to this ‘sanctity of life’ view, human
life is inherently valuable and precious, demanding respect from
others and reverence for oneself. Hence, suicide is wrong because it
violates our moral duty to honor the inherent value of human life,
regardless of the value of that life to others or to the person whose
life it is. The sanctity of life view is thus a deontological position
on suicide.</p>

<p>
The great merit of the sanctity of life position is that it reflects a
common moral sentiment, namely, that killing is wrong in itself. The
chief difficulties for the sanctity of life position are these:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
First, its proponents must be willing to apply the position
consistently, which would also morally forbid controversial forms of
killing such as capital punishment or killing in wartime. But it would
also forbid forms of killing that seem intuitively reasonable, such as
killing in self-defense. To accept the sanctity of life argument seems
to require endorsing a thoroughgoing pacifism.</p>

<p>
Secondly, the sanctity of life view must hold that life itself, wholly
independent of the happiness of the individual whose life it is, is
valuable. Many philosophers reject the notion that life is
intrinsically valuable, since it suggests, e.g., that there is value
in keeping alive an individual in a persistent vegetative state simply
because she is biologically alive. It would also suggest that a life
certain to be filled with limitless suffering and anguish is valuable
just by virtue of being a human life. Peter Singer (1994) and others
have argued against the sanctity of life position on the grounds that
the value of a continuing life is not intrinsic but extrinsic, to be
judged on the basis of the individual’s likely future quality of
life. If the value of a person’s continued life is measured by
its likely quality, then suicide may be permissible when that quality
is low (see
 <a href="#SocUtiRolBasArg">section 3.5</a>)
 (This is not to suggest that quality of life assessments are
straightforward or uncontroversial. See Hayry 1991 for
discussion).</p>

<p>
Finally, it is not obvious that adequate respect for the sanctity of
human life prohibits ending a life, whether by suicide or other means.
Those who engage in suicidal behavior when their future promises to be
extraordinarily bleak do not necessarily exhibit insufficient regard
for the sanctity of life (Dworkin 1993, 238). To end one’s life
before its natural end is not necessarily an insult to the value of
life. Indeed, it may be argued that suicide may be life-affirming in
those circumstances where medical or psychological conditions reduce
individuals to shadows of their former fully capable selves (Cholbi
2002).</p>
</blockquote>

<h3><a name="RelArg">3.3 Religious Arguments</a></h3>

<p>
Two general categories of arguments for the moral impermissibility of
suicide have emerged from the Christian religious tradition. The first
of these is the aforementioned Thomistic natural law position,
critiqued by Hume (see
 <a href="#EnlModDev">section 2.3</a>)
 According to this tradition, suicide violates the natural law God has
created to govern the natural world and human existence. This natural
law can be conceived of in terms of (a) natural causal laws, such that
suicide violates this causal order, (b) teleological laws, according
to which all natural beings seek to preserve themselves, or (c) the
laws governing human nature, from which it follows that suicide is
‘unnatural’ (Pabst Battin 1996, 41–48). These
natural law arguments are no longer the main focus of philosophical
discussion, as they have been subjected to strenuous criticism by Hume
and others (though see Gay-Williams 1996). These criticisms include
the following: (1) the natural law arguments cannot be disentangled
from a highly speculative theistic metaphysics; (2) the claims of
natural law are confuted by observations of human nature (e.g., the
existence of self-destructive human behaviors casts doubt on the claim
that we “naturally” preserve ourselves); and (3) other
acts (e.g., religious martyrdom) which God is assumed not to condemn,
also violate these natural laws, making the prohibition on suicide
appear arbitrary.</p>

<p>
The second general category of religious arguments rest on analogies
concerning the relationship between God and humanity. For the most
part, these arguments aim to establish that God, and not human
individuals, has the proper moral authority to determine the
circumstances of their deaths. One historically prominent analogy
(suggested by Aquinas and Locke) states that we are God’s
property and so suicide is a wrong to God akin to theft or destruction
of property. This analogy seems weak on several fronts. First, if we
are God’s property, we are an odd sort of property, in that God
apparently bestowed upon us free will that permits us to act in ways
that are inconsistent with God’s wishes or intentions. It is
difficult to see how an autonomous entity with free will can be
subject to the kind of control or dominion to which other sorts of
property are subject. Second, the argument appears to rest on the
assumption that God does not wish his property destroyed. Yet given
the traditional theistic conception of God as not lacking in any way,
how could the destruction of something God owns (a human life) be a
harm to God or to his interests (Holley 1989, 105)? Third, it is
difficult to reconcile this argument with the claim that God is
all-loving. If a person’s life is sufficiently bad, an
all-loving God might permit his property to be destroyed through
suicide. Finally, some have questioned the extent of the duties
imposed by God’s property right in us by arguing that the
destruction of property might be morally justified in order to prevent
significant harm to oneself. If the only available means to saving
myself from a ticking bomb is to stash it in the trunk of the nearest
car to dampen the blast, and the nearest car belongs to my neighbor,
then destroying his property appears justified in order to avoid
serious harm to myself. Likewise, if only by killing myself can I
avoid a serious future harm to myself, I appear justified in
destroying my life even if it is God’s property.</p>

<p>
Another common analogy asserts that God bestows life upon us as a
gift, and it would be a mark of ingratitude or neglect to reject that
gift by taking our lives. The obvious weakness with this “gift
analogy” is that a gift, genuinely given, does not come with
conditions such as that suggested by the analogy, i.e., once given, a
gift becomes the property of its recipient and its giver no longer has
any claim on what the recipient does with this gift. It may perhaps be
imprudent to waste an especially valuable gift, but it does not appear
to be unjust to a gift giver to do so. As Kluge (1975, 124) put it,
“a gift we cannot reject is not a <em>gift</em>”. A
variation of this line of argument holds that we owe God a debt of
gratitude for our lives, and so to kill ourselves would be
disrespectful or even insulting to God, (Ramsey 1978, 146) or would
amount to an irresponsible use of this gift. Yet this variation does
not really evade the criticism directed at the first version: Even if
we owe God a debt of gratitude, disposing of our lives does not seem
inconsistent with our expressing gratitude for having lived at all
(Beauchamp 1992). Furthermore, if a person’s life is rife with
misery and unhappiness, it is far from clear that she owes God much in
the way of gratitude for this apparently ill-chosen “gift”
of life. Defenders of the gift analogy must therefore defend the claim
that life, simply because it is given to us by a loving God, is an
expression of God’s benevolent nature and is therefore
necessarily a benefit to us (Holley 1989, 113–114).</p>

<p>
In addition, there is a less recognized undercurrent of religious
thought that <em>favors</em> suicide. For example, suicide permits us
to reunite with deceased loved ones, allows those who have been
absolved of sin to assure their entrance to heaven, and releases the
soul from the bondage of the body. In both Christian and Asian
religious traditions, suicide holds the promise of a vision of, or
union with, the divine (Pabst Battin 1996, 53–64).</p>

<h3><a name="LibVieRigSui">3.4 Libertarian Views and the Right to Suicide</a></h3>

<p>
For libertarians, suicide is morally permissible because individuals
enjoy a <em>right</em> to suicide. (It does not of course follow that
suicide is necessarily rational or prudent.) Libertarianism, which has
historical precedent in the Stoics and in Schopenhauer, is strongly
associated with the ‘anti-psychiatry’ movement of the last
half century. According to that movement, attempts by the state or by
the medical profession to interfere with suicidal behavior are
essentially coercive attempts to pathologize morally permissible
exercises of individual freedom (Szasz 2002).</p>

<p>
Libertarianism typically asserts that the right to suicide is a
<em>right of noninterference</em>, to wit, that others are morally
barred from interfering with suicidal behavior. Some assert the
stronger claim that the right to suicide is a <em>liberty right</em>,
such that individuals have no duty to forego suicide (i.e., that
suicide violates no moral duties), or a <em>claim right</em>,
according to which other individuals may be morally obliged not only
not to interfere with a person’s suicidal behavior but to assist
in that behavior. (See the entry on
 <a href="../rights/">rights</a>.)
 Our having a claim right to suicide implies that we also have rights
of noninterference and of liberty and is a central worry about
physician-assisted suicide (Pabst Battin 1996, 163–164). Since
whether we have a liberty right to suicide concerns whether it
violates other moral obligations, including obligations to other
people, I shall leave discussion of that issue to
 <a href="#SocUtiRolBasArg">section 3.5</a>
 and focus here on whether there is a right of noninterference.
(Whether suicidal individuals have a claim right to others’
assistance is addressed in
 <a href="#DutTowSui">section 3.8</a>.)
 </p>

<p>
A popular basis supporting a right to suicide is the idea that we own
our bodies and hence are morally permitted to dispose of them as we
wish. (Recall from
 <a href="#RelArg">section 3.3</a>
 that some religious arguments for the impermissibility of suicide
depend on God’s ownership of our bodies.) On this view, our
relationship to our bodies is like that of our relationship to other
items over which we enjoy property rights: Just as our having a right
to a wristwatch permits us to use, improve, and dispose of it as we
wish, so too does our having a right to our bodies permit us to
dispose of them as we see fit. Consequently, since property rights are
exclusive (i.e., our having property rights to a thing prohibits
others from interfering with it), others may not interfere with our
efforts to end our lives. The notion of self-ownership invoked in this
argument is quite murky though. What enables us to own ordinary
material items is their metaphysical distinctness from us (Cholbi
2011, 84–86). We can own a wristwatch only <em>because</em> it
is distinct from us. Materialist philosophers, who hold that we are
identical to our bodies, would deny that our bodies are distinct from
ourselves, and even under the most dualistic views of human nature,
our selves are sufficiently dependent upon our bodies to make
ownership of the body by the self an implausible notion. Indeed, the
fact that certain ways of treating ordinary property are not available
to us as ways of treating our bodies (we cannot give away or sell our
bodies in any literal sense) suggests that self-ownership may be only
a metaphor meant to capture a deeper moral relationship (Kluge 1975,
119). In addition, uses of one’s property, including its
destruction, can be harmful to others. Thus, in cases where suicide
may harm others, we may be morally required to refrain from suicide.
(See
 <a href="#SocUtiRolBasArg">section 3.5</a>
 for arguments concerning duties to others.)</p>

<p>
Another rationale for a right of noninterference is the claim that we
have a general right to decide those matters that are most intimately
connected to our well-being, including the duration of our lives and
the circumstances of our deaths. On this view, the right to suicide
follows from a deeper right to self-determination, a right to shape
the circumstances of our lives so long as we do not harm or imperil
others (Cholbi 2011, 88–89). As presented in the “death
with dignity” movement, the right to suicide is the natural
corollary of the right to life. That is, because individuals have the
right not to be killed by others, the only person with the moral right
to determine the circumstances of a person’s death is that
person herself and others are therefore barred from trying to prevent
a person’s efforts at self-inflicted death.</p>

<p>
This position is open to at least two objections. First, it does not
seem to follow from having a right to life that a person has a right
to death, i.e., a right to take her own life. Because others are
morally prohibited from killing me, it does not follow that I am
permitted to kill me. This conclusion is made stronger if the right to
life is inalienable, since in order for me to kill myself, I must
first renounce my inalienable right to life, which I cannot do
(Feinberg 1978). It is at least possible that <em>no one</em> has the
right to determine the circumstances of a person’s death!
Furthermore, as with the property-based argument, the right to
self-determination is presumably circumscribed by the possibility of
harm to others.</p>

<h3><a name="SocUtiRolBasArg">3.5 Social, Utilitarian, and Role-Based Arguments</a></h3>

<p>
A fourth approach to the question of suicide’s permissibility
asks not whether others may interfere with suicidal behavior but
whether we have a liberty right to suicide, whether, that is, suicide
violates any moral duties to others. Those who argue that suicide can
violate our duties to others generally claim that suicide can harm
either specific others (family, friends, etc.) or is a harm to the
community as a whole.</p>

<p>
No doubt the suicide of a family member or loved one produces a number
of harmful psychological and economic effects. In addition to the
usual grief, suicide “survivors” confront a complex array
of feelings. Various forms of guilt are quite common, such as that
arising from (a) the belief that one contributed to the suicidal
person’s anguish, or (b) the failure to recognize that anguish,
or (c) the inability to prevent the suicidal act itself. Suicide also
leads to rage, loneliness, and awareness of vulnerability in those
left behind. Indeed, the sense that suicide is an essentially selfish
act dominates many popular perceptions of suicide (Fedden 1938, 209).
Still, some of these reactions may be due to the strong stigma and
shame associated with suicide, in which case these reactions cannot,
without logical circularity, be invoked in arguments that suicide is
wrong because it produces these psychological reactions (Pabst Battin
1996, 68–69). Suicide can also cause clear economic or material
harm, as when the suicidal person leaves behind dependents unable to
support themselves financially. Suicide can therefore be understood as
a violation of the distinctive “role obligations”
applicable to spouses, parents, caretakers, and loved ones. However,
even if suicide is harmful to family members or loved ones, this does
not support an absolute prohibition on suicide, since some suicides
will not leave survivors, and among those that do, the extent of these
harms is likely to differ such that the stronger these relationships
are, the more harmful suicide is and the more likely it is to be
morally wrong. Besides, from a utilitarian perspective, these harms
would have to be weighed against the harms done to the would-be
suicide by continuing to live a difficult or painful life. At most,
the argument that suicide is a harm to family and to loved ones
establishes that it is sometimes wrong (Cholbi 2011, 62–64).
</p>

<p>
A second brand of social argument echoes Aristotle in asserting that
suicide is a harm to the community or the state. One general form such
arguments take is that because a community depends on the economic and
social productivity of its members, its members have an obligation to
contribute to their society, an obligation clearly violated by suicide
(Pabst Battin 1996, 70–78, Cholbi 2011, 58–60). For
example, suicide denies a society the labor provided by its members,
or in the case of those with irreplaceable talents such as medicine,
art, or political leadership, the crucial goods their talents enable
them to provide. Another version states that suicide deprives society
of whatever individuals might contribute to society morally (by way of
charity, beneficence, moral example, etc.) Still, it is difficult to
show that a society has a moral claim on its members’ labor,
talents, or virtue that <em>compels</em> its members to contribute to
societal well-being no matter what. After all, individuals often fail
to contribute as much as they might in terms of their labor or special
talents without incurring moral blame. It does not therefore seem to
be the case that individuals are morally required to benefit society
in whatever way they are capable, regardless of the harms to
themselves. Again, this line of argument appears to show at most only
that suicide is sometimes wrong, namely, when the benefit (in terms of
future harm not suffered) the individual gains by dying is less than
the benefits she would deny to society by dying.</p>

<p>
A modification of this argument claims that suicide violates a
person’s duty of reciprocity to society (Cholbi 2011,
60–62). On this view, an individual and the society in which she
lives stand in a reciprocal relationship such that in exchange for the
goods the society has provided to the individual, the individual must
continue to live in order to provide her society with the goods that
relationship demands. Yet in envisioning the relationship between
society and the individual as quasi-contractual in nature, the
reciprocity argument reveals its principal flaw: The conditions of
this “contract” may not be met, and also, once met, impose
no further obligations upon the parties. As Baron d’Holbach
(1970, 136–137) pointed out, the contract between an individual
and her society is a conditional one, presupposing “mutual
advantages between the contracting parties.” Hence, if a society
fails to fulfill its obligations under the contract, namely to provide
individuals with the goods needed for a decent quality of life, then
the individual is not morally required to live in order to reciprocate
an arrangement that society has already reneged on. Moreover, once an
individual has discharged her obligations under this societal
contract, she no longer is under an obligation to continue her life.
Hence, the aged or others who have already made substantial
contributions to societal welfare would be morally permitted to engage
in suicide under this argument.</p>

<h3><a name="SuiMorDut">3.6 Suicide as a Moral Duty?</a></h3>

<p>
To this point, we have addressed arguments that concern whether a
moral <em>permission</em> to engage in suicidal behavior exists, and
indeed, it is this question that has dominated ethical discussion of
suicide. Yet the social arguments against suicide are fundamentally
consequentialist, and some act-utilitarians have discussed the
correlative possibility that the good consequences of suicide might so
outweigh its bad consequences as to render suicide admirable or even
morally <em>obligatory</em> (Cosculluela 1995, 76–81). In fact,
in some cases, suicide may be honorable. Suicides that are clearly
other-regarding, aiming at protecting the lives or well-being of
others, or at political protest, may fall into this category (Kupfer
1990, 73–74). Examples of this might include the grenade-jumping
soldier mentioned earlier, or the spy who takes his life in order not
to be subjected to torture that will lead to his revealing vital
military secrets. Utilitarians have given particular attention to the
question of end-of-life euthanasia, suggesting that at the very least,
those with painful terminal illnesses have a right to voluntary
euthanasia (Glover 1990, chs. 14–15, Singer 1993, ch. 7). Yet
utilitarian views hold that we have a moral duty to maximize
happiness, from which it follows that when an act of suicide will
produce more happiness than will remaining alive, then that suicide is
not only morally permitted, but morally required.</p>

<p>
However, the thesis that there may exist a “duty to die”
need not be defended by appeal to overtly consequentialist or
utilitarian reasoning. In the course of articulating what he terms a
“family-centered” approach to bioethics, the philosopher
John Hardwig (1996, 1997) has argued that sometimes the burdens that a
person imposes on others, particularly family members or loved ones,
by continuing to live are sufficiently great that one may have a duty
to die in order to relieve them of these burdens. Hardwig’s
argument thus seems to turn not on the overall balance of costs and
benefits that result from a person living or dying, but on the
fairness of the burdens that a person imposes on others by continuing
to live.</p>

<p>
While generally acknowledging Hardwig’s suggestion that duties
to others have been neglected in discussion of the ethics of suicide,
critics of morally required suicide raise a number of objections to
his proposal. (See Hardwig et al. 2000, Humber &amp; Almeder 2000.)
Some doubt that the duty of beneficence to which Hardwig appeals
justifies anything stronger than a permission to take one’s own
life when continuing to live is burdensome to others (Cholbi 2010b).
Others worry that a moral requirement to engage in suicide raises the
sinister and totalitarian prospect that individuals may be obliged to
engage in suicide against their wishes (Moreland &amp; Geisler 1990,
94, Pabst Battin 1996, 94–95). This worry may reflect an
implicit acceptance of a variation of the sanctity of life view (see
 <a href="#DeoArgSanLif">section 3.2</a>)
 or may reflect concerns about infringements upon individual’s
autonomy (see
 <a href="#SuiMorDut">section 3.6</a>).
 Other critics suggest that even if there is a duty to die, this duty
should not be understood as a duty that entails that others may compel
those with such a duty to take their lives (Menzel 2000, Narveson
2000). Questions about social justice and equality (whether, for
example, especially vulnerable populations such as women or the poor
might be more likely to act on such a duty) are also raised. One
utilitarian response to these objections is to reject a duty to die on
rule utilitarian grounds: Suicide would be morally forbidden because
general adherence to a rule prohibiting suicide would produce better
overall consequences than would general adherence to a rule permitting
suicide (Brandt 1975, Pabst Battin 1996, 96–98).</p>

<h3><a name="AutRatRes">3.7 Autonomy, Rationality, and Responsibility</a></h3>

<p>
A more restricted version of the claim that we have a right to
noninterference regarding suicide holds that suicide is permitted so
long as—leaving aside questions of duties to others—it is
rationally chosen. In a similar vein, Kantians might claim that
suicidal choices must be respected if those choices are
<em>autonomous</em>, that is, if an individual chooses to end her life
on the basis of reasons that she acknowledges as relevant to her
situation. Such positions are narrower than the libertarian view, in
that they permit suicide only when it is performed on a rational basis
(or a rational basis that the individual acknowledges as relevant to
her situation) and permits others to interfere only when it is not
performed on that basis.</p>

<p>
One initial challenge to the possibility of rational suicide rests on
the notion that suicide, being a choice to end one’s life, is
<em>necessarily</em> irrational. The thought here is that any coherent
judgment of suicide’s rationality requires comparing the state
of being alive (or continuing to live) with being dead. But either
because no one has sufficient knowledge of the state of being dead
(Devine 1978) or because suicide ensures that the suicidal person has
no future to look forward to (Cowley 2006), judgments that ending
one’s life is rational are incoherent or misplaced.</p>

<p>
In recent years, this ‘two-state’ requirement (that death
can only be judged rational or irrational if it is possible to compare
the state of being alive with the state of being dead) has been widely
rejected. In particular, the rationality of the decision to end
one’s life need not be construed in terms of the value of being
alive versus the value of being dead (Luper 2009, 82–88). What
those contemplating ending their lives are considering are different
durations of their lives, or as Richard Brandt put it:</p>

<blockquote>
The person who is contemplating suicide is obviously making a choice
between future world-courses: the world-course that includes his
demise, say, an hour from now, and several possible ones that contain
his demise at a later point… The basic question a person must
answer in order to determine which world-course is best or rational
for him to choose, is which he <em>would</em> choose under conditions
of optimal use of information, when <em>all</em> of his desires are
taken into account. (Brandt 1975)
</blockquote>

<p>
Hence, on this view, a rational judgment about one’s own death
requires a comparison between the overall goodness of one’s life
as it would be if it continued on its present course and the overall
goodness of one’s life if that life ended before its present
course. This view has given rise to a rich philosophical literature
trying to identify the conditions under which a person’s
decision to die is rational. For the most part, this literature
divides the conditions for rational suicide into <em>cognitive
conditions</em>, conditions ensuring that individuals’
appraisals of their situation are rational and well-informed, and
<em>interest conditions</em>, conditions ensuring that suicide in fact
accords with individuals’ considered interests.</p>

<p>
Examples of this approach include Glenn Graber, who states that a
suicide is rationally justified “if a reasonable appraisal of
the situation reveals that one is better off dead.” (Graber
1981, 65). An appraisal is reasonable, according to Graber, if it
results from a clearheaded assessment of how suicide would further or
impede one’s overall interests, including one’s present
and probable future values and preferences. Margaret Battin identifies
three cognitive conditions for rational suicide (a facility for causal
and inferential reasoning, possession of a realistic world view, and
adequacy of information relevant to one’s decision), along with
two interest conditions (that dying enables one to avoid future harms,
and that dying accords with one’s most fundamental interests and
commitments) (Pabst Battin 1996, 115).</p>

<p>
For the most part, suicidal individuals do not manifest signs of
<em>systemic</em> irrationality, much less the signs of legally
definable insanity, (Radden 1982) and engage in suicidal conduct
voluntarily. However, these facts are consistent with the choice to
engage in suicidal behavior being irrational, and serious questions
can be raised about just how often the conditions for rational suicide
are met in actual cases of self-inflicted death. Indeed, the
possibility of rational suicide requires that certain assumptions
about suicidal individuals’ rational autonomy be true which may
not be in many cases. A person’s choice to undertake suicidal
behavior may not be a reflection of her considered interests and her
self-inflicted death could be an act that she would, in calmer and
clearer moments, recoil at. In other words, even if there is a right
to suicide rooted in the value of rational autonomy, it seems to imply
a right to suicide only when one makes that determination on
<em>minimally</em> rational grounds, and there are numerous factors
that may compromise a person’s rational autonomy and hence make
the decision to engage in suicidal behavior not a reflection of
one’s considered values or aims. Some of these factors
cognitively distort agents’ deliberation about whether to engage
in suicide. Though many suicidal persons engage in extensive planning
for their own deaths, the final determination to end one’s life
is often impulsive, reflecting the intense psychological vulnerability
of suicidal persons and their proclivity toward volatility and
agitation (Cholbi 2002, Joiner 2010, 70–84). Suicidal persons
can also have difficulty fully acknowledging the finality of their
death, believing that (assuming there is no afterlife) they will
somehow continue to be subjects of conscious experience after they
die.</p>

<p>
Particularly worrisome is the evident link between suicidal thoughts
and mental illnesses such as depression. While disagreement continues
about the strength of this link (Pabst Battin 1996, 5) little doubt
exists that the presence of depression or other mood disorders greatly
increases the likelihood of suicidal behavior. Some studies of suicide
indicate that over 90% of suicidal persons displayed symptoms of
depression before death, while others estimate that suicide is at
least 20 times more common among those with clinical depression than
in the general population. In cases of suicide linked with depression,
individuals’ attitudes toward their own death are colored by
strongly negative and occasionally distorted beliefs about their life
situations (career prospects, relationships, etc.). As Brandt (1975)
observed, depression can “primitivize one’s intellectual
processes,” leading to poor estimation of probabilities and an
irrational focus on present suffering rather than on possible good
future states of affairs. The suicidally depressed can also exhibit
romanticized and grandiose beliefs about the likely effects of their
deaths (delusions of martyrdom, revenge, etc.) Furthermore, suicidal
persons are often hesitant about their own actions, hoping that others
will intervene and signaling to others the hope that they will
intervene (Shneidman 1985). Finally, although repeated suicide
attempts by the same individual are common, the impulse to suicidal
behavior is often transient and dissipates of its own accord (Blauner
2003). Taken together, these considerations indicate that the scope of
suicidal conduct that genuinely manifests fully informed and rational
self-evaluation may be rare and so only occasionally will suicide be
rational or morally permissible. Moreover, if suicide is frequently
not an expression of individuals’ rational appraisal of their
own well-being, that suggests that others may have a <em>prima
facie</em> reason to interfere with suicidal behavior and so is there
is no general right to noninterference. (See
 <a href="#AutRatRes">section 3.7</a>.)</p>
 
<h3><a name="DutTowSui">3.8 Duties Toward the Suicidal</a></h3>

<p>
With the exception of the libertarian position that each person has a
right against others that they not interfere with her suicidal
intentions (Szasz 2002) each of the moral positions on suicide we have
addressed so far would appear to justify others intervening in
suicidal plans, at least on some occasions. Little justification is
necessary for actions that aim to prevent another’s suicide but
are non-coercive. Pleading with a suicidal individual, trying to
convince her of the value of continued life, recommending counseling,
etc. are morally unproblematic, since they do not interfere with the
individual’s conduct or plans except by engaging her rational
capacities (Cosculluela 1994, 35; Cholbi 2002, 252). The more
challenging moral question is whether more coercive measures such as
physical restraint, medication, deception, or institutionalization are
ever justified to prevent suicide and when. In short, the question of
suicide intervention is a question of how to justify paternalistic
interference (Kleinig 1983, 96–104).</p>

<p>
As mentioned in
 <a href="#SuiMorDut">section 3.6</a>,
 the impulse toward suicide is often sporadic, ambivalent, and
influenced by mental illnesses such as depression, all indicators that
suicide may be undertaken with less than full rationality. And while
individuals usually have the right to make bad or irrational decisions
on their own behalf, these indicators, when juxtaposed with the stakes
of the decision to end one’s life (that death is irreversible,
that continued life is a condition of all other goods, etc.), justify
intervention in others’ suicidal plans on the ‘soft’
paternalist grounds that suicide is not in the individual’s
interests as they would rationally conceive those interests. We might
call this the ‘no regrets’ or ‘err on the side of
life’ approach to suicide intervention (Martin 1980; Pabst
Battin 1996, 141; Cholbi 2002). Since most situations in which another
person intends to kill herself will be ones where we are unsure of
whether she is rationally choosing to die, it is better to temporarily
prevent “an informed person who is in control of himself from
committing suicide” than to do “nothing while, say, a
confused person kills himself, especially since, in all likelihood,
the would-be suicide could make another attempt if this one were
prevented and since the suicidal option is irreversible if
successful” (Cosculluela 1994, 40). Further psychiatric or
medical examinations may settle the matter regarding the rationality
of the suicidal individual’s decision. The coerciveness of the
measures used should be proportional to the apparent seriousness of
the suicidal person’s intention to die (Cholbi 2011,
122–129).</p>

<p>
Lastly, if there is sometimes a duty to prevent acts of suicide, is it
ever morally permissible, or even morally obligatory, to aid others in
ending their lives? (This possibility is directly related to
physician-assisted suicide and the larger question of whether the
right to suicide is a claim right.) If there are circumstances that
justify our intervening to prevent suicide undertaken irrationally or
contrary to a person’s self-interest, then the same
paternalistic rationale would justify our helping to promote or enable
those suicides that are rational and in accordance with a
person’s self-interest.</p>

<p>
Critics of a duty to assist in suicide assert that the widespread
moral acceptance of aiding others in suicide invites the prospect of a
‘slippery slope,’ wherein assisted suicide becomes so
commonplace that individuals (particularly members of vulnerable
populations such as the aged, the disabled, or socially marginalized
populations) for whom suicide is not rational could nevertheless be
susceptible to various forms of abuse, manipulation, or undue
pressure, By giving license for others to assist in suicides, critics
allege, we may unwittingly permit them to encourage suicides not
because those suicides are in fact in the best interests of the
individual in question, but because those suicides advance the
interests of other people or of institutions.(Pabst Battin 1996,
145–157). Whether such ‘slippery slope’ worries are
warranted is an empirical matter, and existing studies of societies
that have legalized assisted suicide by medical personnel do not
provide unequivocal support for these worries (Cholbi 2011,
148–157). </p>

<h3><a name="">3.9 Suicide, Virtue, and Life’s Meaning</a></h3>

<p>
Sections 3.1-3.8 largely address suicide as a question of
interpersonal morality, that is, as a question about our duties to one
another (though it should be noted that Kant’s opposition to
suicide was rooted in his belief that it violates duties we owe to
ourselves rather than duties we owe to others). However, suicide also
raises what might be termed ethical questions, such as whether suicide
exemplifies virtue. Bogen (1980) observes that even when we have
adequately determined that a given act of suicide is morally
permissible, questions remain about whether that act represents
“the best way to live and to end one’s life.” A full
normative account of suicide may thus require us to supplement the
language of interpersonal obligation and rights with the language of
virtues and vices: Under what conditions does an act of suicide
exhibit such virtues as courage, generosity, or justice? Conversely,
under what conditions does an act of suicide exhibit such vices as
cowardice, selfishness, or rashness? While such questions are germane
to whether suicide is defensible all things considered, they are
infrequently addressed in the philosophical literature (though see van
Zyl 2000; Hardwig 1997 can plausibly be read as claiming that
continuing to live is sometimes selfish). </p>

<p>
Suicide also raises other normative questions that are not obviously
moral, such as how suicide may contribute to or detract from the
meaningfulness of an individual’s life. For the twentieth
century existentialists, suicide was not a choice to be made mainly by
appeal to moral considerations but by analyzing whether suicide is an
appropriate response to the absurdity or meaninglessness of the world
and of human endeavor. Albert Camus illustrated this absurdity in his
philosophical essay <i>The Myth of Sisyphus</i>. For Camus, Sisyphus
heroically does not try to escape his absurd task of endlessly and
futilely pushing a rock up a mountain, but instead perseveres and in
so doing resists the lure of suicide. Suicide, Camus contends, tempts
us with the promise of an illusory freedom from the absurdity of our
existence, but is in the end an abdication of our responsibility to
confront or defy that absurdity head on (Campbell and Collinson 1988,
61–70). Jean-Paul Sartre was likewise struck by the possibility
of suicide as an assertion of authentic human will in the face of
absurdity. Suicide represents, according to Sartre, an opportunity to
stake out our understanding of our essence as individuals in a godless
world. Questions of whether a life saturated with pain or suffering
can be meaningful have also played a part in recent debates about the
justification of assisted suicide (Little 1999, Varelius 2013).</p>

<h2><a name="Con">4. Conclusion</a></h2>

<p>
As the foregoing discussion indicates, suicide has been and continues
to be a rich field of philosophical investigation. Recent advances in
medical technology are responsible for the extensive philosophical
attention paid to one kind of suicide, euthanasia or
physician-assisted suicide (PAS), while more
“run-of-the-mill” suicide motivated by psychological
anguish is somewhat overlooked. This is somewhat unfortunate:
Euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide raise issues beyond those
associated with other suicides, including the allocation of health
care resources, the nature of the medical profession, the
patient-physician relationship, and the prospect that allowing
relatively benign forms of killing such as voluntary euthanasia of PAS
will lead down a “slippery slope” to more morally
worrisome killings. However, many of the same issues and concerns that
surround PAS and euthanasia also surround run-of-the mill suicide, and
many writers who address the former often disregard the vast
literature on the latter. (In addition to the entry on voluntary
euthanasia, Dworkin <em>et al</em>. 1998, Barry 2007, Pabst Battin
2003, and Cholbi 2011, 139–61, provide overviews of the moral
debates surrounding euthanasia and PAS.)</p>

<p>
Not only is suicide worthy of philosophical investigation in its own
right, it is a source of insight for various philosophical
subdisciplines: moral psychology, ethical theory, social and political
philosophy, the metaphysics of personhood, and action theory. Suicide
is also an area where philosophical interests intersect with those of
the empirical sciences. The collective efforts of philosophers and
others continue to illuminate one of the most enigmatic of human
behaviors.</p>
