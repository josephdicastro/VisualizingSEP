<p>

Robert Alyngton was one of the most important authors of the
generation after John Wyclif. He was deeply influenced by Walter
Burley’s logico-ontological system and Wyclif’s metaphysics. His major
extant work, a commentary on the <em>Categories,</em> heavily depends
on Burley’s last commentary on the <em>Categories</em> and Wyclif’s
<em>De ente praedicamentali</em>. Yet he was able to develop new
logical and semantic theories as well as the general strategy adopted
by the Oxford Realists, as he methodically substituted reference to
external objective realities for reference to linguistic and/or mental
activities.</p>

<h2 id="LifeWork">1. Life and Works</h2>

<p>

Not a great deal is known of Robert Alyngton’s life. Most of the
information about him comes from Emden 1957–59. From 1379 until 1386,
he was fellow of Queens College (the same Oxonian college where Wyclif
started his theological studies in 1363 and Johannes Sharpe taught in
the 1390s); he became <em>Magister Artium</em> and, by 1393, doctor of
theology. He was chancellor of the University in 1393 and 1395. In 1382
he preached Wyclif’s religious and political ideas in Hampshire
(McHardy 1987). He was rector of Long Whatton, Leicestershire, where he
died by September 1398. </p>

<p>

According to Emden 1957–59 and Ashworth &amp; Spade 1992, Alyngton
was of considerable repute as a logician. Among his extant works, the
following can be mentioned (the most complete list of his writings is
found in Bale 1557–59 [pp. 519–20]):</p>

<ul>
<li>A commentary on Aristotle’s <em>Categories</em> (<em>Litteralis
sententia super Praedicamenta Aristotelis</em> [henceforward <em>In
Cat</em>.]), partially edited in Conti 1993 (pp. 242–306). (All
references are to the pages of this edition or, for the unedited
portions, to the ms. London, Lambeth Palace 393.)</li>

<li>A treatise on the supposition of terms (<em>Tractatus de
suppositionibus terminorum</em>).</li>

<li>A commentary on the <em>Liber sex principiorum</em>.</li>

<li>A treatise on the genera of being (<em>Tractatus
generum</em>).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="BeinCate">2. Being and Categories</h2>

<p>

The point of departure of every realist interpretation of
the <em>Categories</em> is the notion of being (<em>ens</em>) in its
relationship to the ten categories, as Realists considered the
categorial table to be a division of beings.  Like Burley, Alyngton
affirms that (i) the division into categories is first of all a
division of things existing outside the mind, and only secondarily of
the mental concepts and spoken or written terms which signify them,
and (ii) things belonging to one categorial field are really distinct
from those belonging to another—for instance, substances are
really distinct from quantities, qualities, and relations, quantities
are really distinct from substances, qualities, and relations, and so
on (<em>In Cat</em>., cap. <em>de numero et sufficientia
praedicamentorum</em>, Conti pp. 251, 252–53).</p>

<p>

Unfortunately Alyngton does not define being; yet, what he says about
(1) the subject of the <em>Categories</em> (the real categorial being
which can be signified by simple expressions, namely terms (<em>In
Cat</em>., cap. <em>de numero et sufficientia praedicamentorum </em>,
p. 252), and (2) analogy (<em>In Cat</em>., cap. <em>de
aequivocis</em>, ms. London, Lambeth Palace 393, fol. 70r–v) seems to
entail that, like Wyclif, he also thinks of being as a sort of an
extramental reality proper to everything (God and creatures;
substances and accidents; universal and individual items; things,
collections of things, and states of affairs) according to different
modes and degrees.</p>

<p>

In the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, all the realist authors,
with the only notable exception of Duns Scotus, regarded categorial
items as composed of two main aspects: the inner nature or essence,
and their peculiar mode of being or of being predicated (<em>modi
essendi vel praedicandi</em>). They maintained that the categorial
table divides categorial items according to their modes of being
(or of being predicated) and not according to their inner natures (or
essences). In particular, Thomas Aquinas (<em>Sententia super Metaphysicam</em>, liber V, lectio 9) based his method of finding the ten Aristotelian categories on the differences
of modes of being predicated, and recognized three fundamental
modes of being predicated: essentially, proper to substances, when
the predication indicates what a given thing is; accidentally, proper to
quantities, qualities, and relatives, when the predication indicates that
something inheres in a subject; and externally, proper to the remaining
six categories, when the predication indicates that something which
does not inhere in the subject nevertheless affects it. On the contrary Albert the Great (<em>Liber de praedicamentis</em>, tr. I, cap. 7) and Simon of Faversham (<em>Quaestiones super librum Praedicamentorum</em>, q. 12) based their method of finding the categories on the differences of modes of being. They admitted two fundamental modes of being: being by itself, proper to substance; and being in something else, proper to the nine genera
of accidents. The latter was subdivided into being in something else
absolutely, proper to quantities and qualities, and being in something
else in virtue of a relation to a third thing (<em>esse ad aliud</em>), proper to the remaining seven categories. Walter Burley, whose last commentary on
the <em>Categories</em> is, along with Wyclif’s <em>De ente
praedicamentali</em>, the main source of Alyngton’s commentary on
the <em>Categories</em>, recalled two ways of deducing the ten
Aristotelian categories, both based on the various levels of
similarity among their own modes of being. Alyngton follows very
closely Burley’s first way of deriving the ten categories. In his
opinion, there are two fundamental modes of being proper to things:
being by itself, which characterizes substances, and being or inhering
in something else, which characterizes accidents. The latter is
subdivided into three less general modes: being in something else in
virtue of its matter; being in something else in virtue of its form;
and being in something else in virtue of the whole
composite. Something can inhere in something else in virtue of its
matter, form, and composite according to three different ways: from
inside (<em>ab intrinseco</em>), from outside (<em>ab
extrinseco</em>), and partially from inside and partially from outside
(<em>partim ab intrinseco et partim ab extrinseco</em>). If something
is in something else in virtue of its matter and from inside, then it
is a quantity; if from outside, it is a where; if partially from
inside and partially from outside, it is an affection. If something is
in something else in virtue of its form and from inside, then it is a
quality; if from outside, it is when (<em>quando vel
quandalitas</em>); if partially from inside and partially from
outside, it is an action. If something is in something else in virtue
of the whole composite and from inside, then it is a relation; if from
outside, it is a possession (<em>habitus</em>); if partially from
inside and partially from outside, it is a position (<em>In Cat</em>.,
cap. <em>de numero et sufficientia praedicamentorum</em>,
pp. 252–53).</p>

<p>

Alyngton’s choice implies an anti-reductionist approach to the matter,
which is confirmed by the solution of the problem of what properly
falls into the categorial fields. According to the standard realist
conception, not only the accidental forms, such as whiteness, but also
the compounds they cause when inhering in substances, such as a
white-thing (<em>album</em>), fall into the categories. Burley thought
that whilst the accidental forms properly fall into the categories,
the aggregates made up from a substance and an accidental form do not,
since they are beings <em>per accidens</em>, wanting in real unity. In
his opinion, such an aggregate may be said to fall into a certain
category, the category into which its accidental form falls, only by
reduction, in virtue of the accidental form itself.  On the contrary,
Wyclif maintained that the aggregates built up by a substance and an
accidental form fall <em>per accidens</em> into both the category of
substance and the category which the accidental form at issue belongs
to (cf. Wyclif, <em>De ente praedicamentali</em>, cap. 1,
pp. 3–4).  Alyngton combines in an original way the two slightly
different opinions of Burley and Wyclif. He affirms that a thing can
be said to belong to a category in a threefold way: by itself, by
accident (<em>per accidens</em>), and by reduction (<em>per
reductionem</em>).  Something is in a category by itself if and only
if the highest genus of that category is predicated by itself and and
directly (<em>in recto</em>) of it (<em>In Cat</em>., cap. <em>de
numero et sufficientia praedicamentorum</em>, p. 259). In other words,
if and only if the highest genus of that category is one of the
constitutive elements of the essence of the thing at issue. Accidental
forms belong <em>per se</em> to the nine categories of accidents
(<em>In Cat</em>., cap. <em>de relativis</em>, p. 300). Something is
in a category by accident if and only if it is an aggregate from a
substance and an accidental form. Such aggregates belong per accidens
both to the category of substance and to the category in which its
accidental form is by itself (<em>In Cat</em>., cap. <em>de numero et
sufficientia praedicamentorum</em>, p. 259; and cap. <em>de
relativis</em>, p. 300).  Something can be in a category by reduction
in two different ways: in a broad sense (<em>large</em>) and in a
strict sense (<em>stricte</em>). Something is in a category by
reduction <em>large</em> if and only if it is an aggregate, and the
highest genus of a certain category is predicated only indirectly of
it. Something is in a category by reduction
<em>stricte</em> if and only if it is not an aggregate, and, (a) like
differences, it is a component of the reality of a thing which is in a
category by itself, but the highest genus of that category is not
predicated of it; or (b) it is the privation correlated to a certain
property which, in turn, is in a category by itself; or (c), like
extra-categorial principle such as God, the unity, and the point, it
somehow instantiates the mode of being proper to a certain categorial
field, but the highest genus of that category is not one of the
constitutive elements of the essence of that thing (<em>In Cat</em>.,
cap. <em>de numero et sufficientia praedicamentorum</em>,
pp. 259–60).</p>

<p>

Fundamental to Alyngton’s deduction of the categories and solution of
the problem of what falls into the categorial fields (and how) is a
close isomorphism between language (mental, written, and spoken) and
the world. Like Burley and Wyclif, he was firmly convinced that our
thought is modelled on reality itself, so that it reproduces reality
in all its elements, levels, and inner relations. Therefore, one of
the best ways of understanding the world lay for him in an accurate
investigation of our notions and conceptual schemes, as they show the
structure of the world. A logical consequence of this conviction was
his strong propensity towards reification: he hypostatises the notion
of being and considers equivocity, analogy, and univocity not only as
semantic relations between terms and things, but also as real
relations between extra-mental items (<em>In Cat</em>., cap. <em>de
aequivocis</em>, ms. London, Lambeth Palace 393, fols. 69v–70r).</p>

<p>

According to the common interpretation of the opening passage of the
<em>Categories</em>, equivocal terms are correlated with more than one
concept and refer to a multiplicity of things sharing different
natures, whereas univocal terms are correlated with only one concept
and refer to a multiplicity of things sharing one and the same nature.
In his last commentary on the <em>Physics</em> (after 1324), Burley
had maintained that the term ‘being’ is at the same time univocal and
equivocal with respect to the categories, as a single concept
corresponds to it (broadly speaking univocity), but the categorial
items share it in different ways, according to a hierarchy of value
(broadly speaking equivocity)—see his <em>Expositio in libros octo
Physicorum</em>, lib. I, tr. 2, cap. 1, ed. Venice 1501,
fols. 12vb-13ra. In turn, Wyclif had admitted three main types of
equivocity: by chance (<em>a casu</em>), analogical, and generic, the
second of which applies to the relationship between being and
categories (<em>De ente praedicamentali</em>, cap. 2). Alyngton
recognises four main kinds of equivocity: by chance; deliberate (<em>a
consilio</em>); analogical; and generic. Equivocals by chance are
those things that just happen to have the same name, but with
different meanings and/or reasons for imposing the name. Those things
are deliberate equivocals which have distinct natures but the same
name, and are subordinated to different but correlated concepts. Those
things are analogical which share the nature signified by their
common name in various degrees and/or ways. Generic equivocals are
those things which share the same generic nature in the same way, but
have distinct specific natures of different absolute value (<em>In
Cat</em>., cap. <em>de aequivocis</em>, fol. 70r-v). So, within
Alyngton’s system, what differentiates analogy from univocity is the
way in which a certain nature (or property) is shared by a set of
things: analogous things share it according to different degrees
(<em>secundum magis et minus</em>, or <em>secundum prius et
posterius</em>), univocal things share it all in the same manner and
to the same degree (<em>In Cat</em>., cap. <em>de univocis</em>,
fol. 71v). Alyngton argues that being is not a sort of genus in
relation to the ten categories, since it does not manifest their
essence, nor is it predicated univocally of them; being is analogous
in relation to the ten categories. It is the basic stuff of the
metaphysical structure of each reality, which possesses it in
accordance with its own nature and level in the hierarchy of essences
(<em>In Cat</em>., cap. <em>de numero et sufficientia
praedicamentorum</em>, pp. 255–56).</p>

<h2 id="UnivPred">3. Universals and Predication</h2>

<p>

Among the many kinds of beings (<em>entia</em>) that Alyngton admits, the most important set is that consisting of universal items. Universals are among the most disputed topics in Medieval philosophical literature. Like Wyclif and the other Oxford Realists, Alyngton claims that universals fully exist outside the mind and are really identical-to and formally distinct-from the individuals which instantiate them. Like Albert the Great whom he quotes by name, Alyngton recognizes three main kinds of universals:</p>

<ol>
<li><em>ante rem</em> or ideal universals—that is, the ideas in God,
the archetypes of all that is;</li>

<li><em>in re</em> or formal universals—that is, the common natures
shared by individual things; and</li>

<li><em>post rem</em> or intentional universals—that is, mental
signs of the formal universals.</li>
</ol>

<p>

The ideas in God are the causes of formal universals, and formal
universals are the causes of intentional universals. Furthermore, like
Burley and Wyclif, Alyngton holds that formal universals actually
exist (<em>in actu</em>) outside our minds, and not potentially only
(<em>in potentia</em>) as moderate realists thought (<em>In Cat</em>.,
cap. <em>de substantia</em>, p. 279)—even if, unlike Burley, he maintains they are really
identical with their individuals, for otherwise it would be impossible
to explain, against the Nominalists, why and how individual substances
show different and more or less close kinds of similarity among
themselves (<em>In Cat</em>., cap. <em>de substantia</em>, pp.
267–68).</p>

<p>

According to Alyngton, who depends here on Avicenna and Wyclif, formal
universals are common natures in virtue of which the individuals that
share them are exactly what they are—as the human species is the
form by which every man formally is a man. <em>Qua</em> natures, they
are prior, and so indifferent, to any division into universals and
individuals. Universality (<em>universalitas</em> or
<em>communicabilitas</em>) is as it were their inseparable property,
but not a <em>constitutive</em> mark of the nature itself (<em>In
Cat</em>., cap. <em>de substantia</em>, fol. 101v). As a consequence,
formal universals can be conceived of in two different manners: as
first intentions or as second intentions. In the former case, they are
natures of a certain kind and are identical with their individuals
(for example, man is the same thing as Socrates). In the latter case,
they are properly universals (that is, something that can exist in
many things and can be shared by them), and are distinct from their
individuals considered <em>qua</em> individuals, because of opposite
constitutive principles (<em>In Cat</em>., cap. <em>de
substantia</em>, p. 268). Therefore, universals are really
(<em>realiter</em>) identical to, but formally (<em>formaliter</em>)
distinct from their individuals. In fact, universals are formal causes
in relation to their individuals, and individuals are material causes
in relation to their universals. Thus three different kinds of
entities can be qualified as formal universals:</p>

<ol>

<li>the common natures instantiated by individuals—which are
things of first intention;</li>

<li>the form itself of universality, which belongs to a certain common
nature when seen in its relation to the individuals—which is a
thing of second intention; and</li>

<li>the thinkability proper to the common nature, by which it is a
possible object of our mind—that is, the real principle that
connects formal universals with mental universals (<em>In Cat</em>.,
cap. <em>de substantia</em>, p.  277).</li>

</ol>

<p>

Alyngton accepts the traditional realistic account of the
relationship between formal universals and individuals, and, like
Wyclif, improves it by defining its logical structure more accurately, in order to avoid the inconsistencies stressed by Ockham and his followers.
Alyngton thought that a universal of the category of substance could
directly receive only the predications of substantial forms more common
than itself. On the other hand, accidental forms inhering in
substantial individuals could be predicated only indirectly
(<em>essentialiter</em>) of the substantial form itself that those
individuals instantiate, predicated indirectly through and in virtue of
the individuals of that substantial form. So his description of the
logical structure of the relationship between universals and
individuals demanded a redefinition of predication. Alyngton was
probably the first to ameliorate Wyclif’s theory of predication by
dividing predication into formal predication (<em>praedicatio
formalis</em>) and remote inherence (<em>inhaerentia remota</em>) or
predication by essence (<em>praedicatio secundum essentiam</em>).
Remote inherence is grounded in a partial identity between subject and
predicate, which share some but not all metaphysical constituents, and
does not demand that the form signified by the predicate term be
directly present in the entity signified by the subject term. On the
other hand, such a direct presence is needed by formal predication.
“Man is an animal” and “Socrates is white” are instances of formal
predication; “(What is) singular is (what is) common” (<em>singulare
est commune</em>) and “Humanity is running” (<em>humanitas est
currens</em>) are instances of remote inherence, as according to
Alyngton it is possible to attribute the property of being running to
the form of humanity if at least one man is running. However, he makes
sure to use as a predicate term a substantival adjective in its neuter
form, because only in this way can it be made apparent that the form
signified by the predicate term is not directly present in the subject,
but is indirectly attributed to it, through its individuals (<em>In
Cat</em>., cap. <em>de substantia</em>, pp. 288–90).</p>

<h2 id="TheoSubs">4. The Theory of Substance</h2>

<p>

These remarks on the relations between forms and substances bring us
to the core of Alyngton’s ontology: the doctrine of substance,
developed in the fifth chapter of his commentary on the
<em>Categories</em>. Alyngton’s treatment can be divided into two main
parts. (i) The first attempts to clarify what characterizes substance,
and therefore what falls by itself into that category; (ii) the second
is concerned with the distinction between primary (or individual) and
secondary (or universal) substances.</p>

<p>

Alyngton lists seven opinions about the nature and mode of being of
substance, the last of which he supports.</p>

<ol>

<li>According to the first one, proper to grammarians, substance is
what the term ‘substance’ refers to when utilized in a
broad sense, that is, the quiddity (<em>quidditas</em>) or essence
(<em>essentia</em>) of anything. In this case, substance is not a
category, since the items which fulfil this description do not share
any common nature (<em>In Cat</em>., cap. <em>de substantia</em>,
p. 263).</li>

<li>The second opinion is that of Avicenna, who affirms that any
entity which does not inhere in something else is a substance
(cf. <em>Liber de philosophia prima</em>, tr. 8, cap. 4, S. Van Riet
ed., 2 vols., Louvain-Leiden: Peeters-Brill, 1977–80, vol. 2,
pp. 403–404). According to this view, God, substantial differences,
and negative truths can be said to be substances, even though only in
an analogical way (<em>In Cat</em>., cap. <em>de substantia</em>,
pp. 263–264).</li>

<li>A third meaning of the term ‘substance’ can be drawn
from the use (of that term) proper to common people and theologians:
everything which plays the role of foundation (<em>fundamentum</em>)
in relation to something else is a substance. In this sense, the
surface is the foundation (and therefore the substance) of the
whiteness (<em>In Cat</em>., cap. <em>de substantia</em>,
p. 264).</li>

<li>The fourth opinion seems to be the same as the anonymous one
discussed and partially criticized by Burley in his last commentary on
the <em>Categories</em> (C.E. 1337, cap. <em>de substantia</em>,
ed. Venetiis 1509, fol. 22rb–va). Substance would be (i) a positive
being, which (ii) does not inhere in something else, and (iii) is
naturally apt to play the role of subject in relation to absolute
accidents (that is, quantities and qualities). According to this view,
matter, form, the composite made up of matter and form, and the
angelic intelligences are substances, whereas substantial differences
and negative truths are not, since the former do not satisfy the third
requisite, nor the latter the first one (<em>In Cat</em>., cap. <em>de
substantia</em>, p. 264).</li>

<li>The fifth opinion is that of Boethius (cf. <em>In Categorias
Aristotelis libri quattuor</em>, PL, vol. 64, 184A–B), according to
whom substance is (i) a positive being, which (ii) does not inhere in
something else, and (iii) is a compound of matter and form (<em>In
Cat</em>., cap. <em>de substantia</em>, p. 264).</li>

<li>The sixth opinion is that of Burley (cf. <em>Expositio super
Praedicamenta Aristotelis</em>, cap. <em>de substantia</em>,
fol. 24ra.), to whom Alyngton refers by the expression
‘<em>moderni logici</em>’. According to Burley, (i) not
being in a subject, (ii) having an essence, (iii) autonomy and
independent existence, and (iv) the capacity of underlying accidental
forms are the main aspect of substances. This means that primary
substances alone are substances properly speaking, while matter and
form, and substantial differences are not (<em>In Cat</em>.,
cap. <em>de substantia</em>, p. 265).</li>

<li>The last opinion is that of Wyclif (cf. <em>De ente
praedicamentali</em>, cap. 5, pp. 36–39), quoted extensively and
almost verbatim. Alyngton claims that it is superior to the preceding
ones (<em>septima est expositio metaphysica et altior ad intelligendum
quam praenominatae</em>). According to this view, the constitutive
principle of the substance is not the capacity of underlying absolute
accidents, but it is the capacity of underlying potency and act, which
are its inner foundations—the capacity of underlying accidents being
only a derivative property (<em>In Cat</em>., cap. <em>de
substantia</em>, p. 267).</li>

</ol>

<p>

Wyclif’s position about the nature of substance implies that the
distinction between potency and act is, from the point of view of
metaphysics, the most fundamental distinction, of which that between
form and matter is but one example. As (i) prime matter is pure
potentiality, while form is act, and (ii) the distinction between
potency and act is wider than that between matter and form, the latter
is a particular case of the former. In fact, according to Wyclif, the
distinction between potency and act runs though the whole of creation,
since it applies also to any kinds of spiritual creatures, whereas the
distinction between matter and form is found only in the corporeal
creatures. On the contrary, Alyngton seems to interpret the
distinction between potency and act as a particular case of the
distinction between matter and form, since he constantly explains the
meaning of the opposition potency-act in terms of the opposition
between matter and form in a crucial passage that he quotes from
Wyclif’s <em>De ente praedicamentali</em> (<em>In Cat</em>.,
cap. <em>de substantia</em>, p. 267 [= Wyclif, <em>De ente
praedicamentali</em>, cap. 5, pp. 38–39]).  The result is a sort of
universal hylemorphism, since in this way matter and form serve as
principles in the order of being as well as in the order of
becoming. All the more so because Alyngton seems to accept the thesis
that (angelic) intelligences are not pure forms existing by
themselves, but formal principles necessarily joined to the matter of
the heavens in such a way as to make up living beings (<em>In
Cat</em>., cap. <em>de substantia</em>, p. 264).</p>

<p>

A second consequence of this approach to the problem of the nature of
substance is that, within his system, primary substances alone are
substances properly speaking. This conclusion is confirmed by his
analysis of the distinctive mark (<em>proprium</em>) of substance:
while remaining numerically one and the same, being capable of
admitting contrary properties, the modification taking place through a
change in the subject itself of the motion at issue. Alyngton appears
to think that this description is satisfied only by primary (that is,
individual) substances (<em>In Cat</em>., cap. <em>de substantia</em>,
fol. 104v). Secondary substances therefore are <em>per se</em> in the
category of substance only insofar as they are constitutive parts of
primary substances. Thus, secondary substances belong to the category
of substance by virtue of the individual substances that instantiate
them, since they are not formally substances. In fact, unlike primary
substances, secondary substances are forms, and consequently
incomplete entities with an imperfect and dependent mode of
existence. They require composite substances in order to properly
exist. No form as such, not even the substantial ones, is formally a
substance, since no form as such has (i) the capacity of underlying
potency and act, and (ii) matter and form as its inner
constituent. Secondary substances are related to primary substances as
formal principles of the latter. It is in this way that humanity and
(say) Socrates are linked together. For this reason no secondary
substances as such are totally identical with primary substances
(<em>In Cat</em>., cap. <em>de substantia</em>, p. 280; see also
pp. 281 and 282–283). As a consequence, while ‘man is
animal’ (‘<em>homo est animal</em>’) is a sentence
to which a formal predication corresponds in the world, a predication
by essence matches ‘humanity is animality’
(‘<em>humanitas est animalitas</em>’). Any (individual)
man is an animal because of the form of humanity present in him <em>qua</em>
its essential constituent, albeit the form of humanity as such is not
the principle of animality. Therefore, humanity is not formally
animality nor rationality, even though it is animality plus
rationality (<em>In Cat</em>., cap. <em>de substantia</em>,
pp. 283–284; see also cap. <em>de quantitate</em>,
fols. 106v–107r).</p>

<p>

Primary substances are the substrate of existence of any other kinds
of categorial being, as nothing exists in addition to primary
substances but secondary substances and accidents, which both are
forms present in individual substances. Like Aristotle
(<em>Categories</em> 5, 2b5–6), Alyngton can therefore affirm that
primary substances are the necessary condition of existence for any
other items of the world: nothing could exist, if primary substances
stopped existing (<em>In Cat</em>., cap. <em>de substantia</em>,
p. 286). This does not mean, however, that it would be possible to
find in the world a primary substance (i) that would not belong to a
certain species, and (ii) without any accident inhering in it. It
means that, from the point of view of full existence, accidents and
secondary substances always presuppose primary substances, as to be a
primary substance is to be an autonomous singular existing item
(<em>hoc aliquid</em>), whilst (i) to be a secondary substance is to
be a <em>quale quid</em>, that is, an inner and essential
determination (or form) of a primary substance, and (ii) to be an
accident is to be an outer determination or aspect of a primary
substance (<em>In Cat</em>., cap. <em>de substantia</em>,
fol. 101v).</p>

<h2 id="MainCateAcci">5. The Main Categories of Accidents</h2>

<p>

Since Alyngton thinks of primary substances as the ultimate substrates
of existence in relation to anything else, the only way to safeguard
the reality of accidents as well as their distinction from substance
and from each other, while at the same time, to affirm their
dependence on substance in existence, was to conceive of them as forms
of the substance itself, and therefore as something existentially
incomplete. Accordingly, like Wyclif, he insists that quantity,
quality, and relations, considered as abstract accidents, are forms
inherent in primary substances, whereas, if considered from the point
of view of their actual existence as concrete items, they are not
really distinct from the substance in which they are present, but only
formally, as they are modes of substances. So, the chief features of
Alyngton’s treatment of accidents are his twofold consideration of
them as abstract forms and as concrete properties as well as his
commitment to their objective reality, since, in his opinion, they are
mind-independent items of the world in both cases. Hence, the main
goals of his reading of the chapters 6–8 of the Aristotelian treatise
are showing the ordered internal structure of the chief categories of
accidents, and reasserting their reality and real distinction from the
category of substance, against those thinkers, like Ockham and his
followers, who had attempted to reduce quantity and relations to mere
aspects of material substances.</p>

<p>

1. (<em>Quantity</em>) According to the standard realist
interpretation of the Aristotelian doctrine of the categories,
followed also by Alyngton among the nine genera of accidents, quantity
is the most important one, as it is the basis of all further
accidents, since quantity orders material substances for receiving
quality and the other accidental forms (<em>In Cat</em>., cap. <em>de
quantitate</em>, fol. 106r). On the contrary, Ockham had claimed that
it was superfluous to posit quantitative forms really distinct from
substance and quality, since quantity presupposes what it is intended
to explain, that is, the extension of material substances and their
having parts outside parts. As an accident, quantity needs substance
as its substrate of inherence (cf. Ockham, <em>Expositio in librum
Praedicamentorum Aristotelis</em>, cap. 10.4, in <em>Opera
philosophica</em>, vol. 2, pp. 205–24). Like Burley and Wyclif,
Alyngton denies that material substance can be actually extended
without the presence of the general form of quantity in it, thereby
affirming its necessity. Hence, he tries to confute Ockham’s
argumentation. He thinks that the existence of quantity always implies
that of substance, but he also believes that the actual existence of
parts in a substance necessarily implies the presence of a general
form of quantity in it, really distinct from the substance (say
Socrates) in which it inheres, and formally distinct from the fact,
grounded on the substance at issue, that this same substance is a
quantified thing. For Alyngton, what characterizes quantity and
differentiates it from the other accidental forms, and in particular
from quality, are the following features: (1) being the appropriate
measure of anything, and (2) being an absolute entity which makes it
possible that material substances actually have parts outside parts
(<em>In Cat</em>., cap. <em>de quantitate</em>, fols. 106v, 107r,
114v).</p>

<p>

If the highest genus of the category of quantity is a form, the seven
species Aristotle enumerates (line, surface, solid, time, place,
number, and speech) clearly are not. Alyngton tries to meet this
difficulty by reformulating the notion of quantified-thing
(<em>quantum</em>), and by proposing a method for deducing the seven
species of quantity from the highest genus (a sort of <em>sufficientia
quantitatum</em>). He considers the seven species Aristotle lists not
as quantitative forms, but as the most proper and primary bearers of
the quantitative nature, revealed by the highest genus of the
category. In fact, encouraged by the Aristotelian distinction between
strict and derivative quantities (<em>Categories</em> 6,
5a38–b10), like Burley, he distinguishes two different ways of
being quantified: by itself and accidentally (<em>per
accidens</em>). Only the seven species of quantity would
be <em>quanta</em> by themselves, while any other <em>quantum</em>
would be such <em>per accidens</em>, and so indirectly, because of its
connection to one (or more) of the seven <em>quanta per se</em>
(<em>In Cat</em>., cap. <em>de quantitate</em>, fol. 116r).</p>

<p>

In Alyngton’s view, the seven species of quantity correspond to the
seven possible ways of measuring the being (<em>esse</em>) of the
material substance. In fact, substance has two main kinds of being:
permanent and in succession. And both of them can be either discrete
or continuous. In turn, the being permanent and continuous of material
substance can be measured either from inside or from outside. If from
inside, then in three different modes: according to one, two or all
the three dimensions proper to material substances. In the first case,
the measure is line, in the second surface, and in the third solid. If
it is measured from outside, then it is place. The being of material
substance which is permanent and discrete is measured by numbers. The
being which is in succession and continuous is measured by time. And
finally, the being of substance which is in succession and discrete is
measured by the quantity called ‘speech’ (<em>oratio</em>)
(<em>In Cat</em>., cap. <em>de quantitate</em>,
fol. 107r–v).</p>

<p>

Alyngton’s derivation of the seven species of quantity from a unique
principle common to them is unconvincing, but extremely interesting,
nonetheless, as it clearly shows that he wants to stress the unity of
the category of quantity, which at first appears heterogeneous, and
to trace the problem of reality and real distinction of quantities
back to that of the nature and status of its distinctive mark.</p>

<p>

2. (<em>Relations and Relatives</em>) Aristotle’s treatment of
relations in the <em>Categories</em> and in the <em>Metaphysics</em>
is opaque and incomplete. Because of this fact, in Late Antiquity and
the Middle Ages many authors tried to reformulate the doctrine of
relatives. Alyngton’s attempt is the most interesting among those of
the Late Middle Ages, as he was the only one able to work out a
concept of relation conceived of as an accidental form which is in
both the relatives at once, even if in different ways (<em>In
Cat</em>., cap. <em>de relatione</em>, p. 296). Consequently his
notion of relation can be considered the ontological equivalent to our
modern functions with two variables, or two-place predicates, whereas
all other authors of the Middle Ages had thought of relations in terms
of monadic functions.</p>

<p>

According to Alyngton, whose account partially differs from those of
Burley and Wyclif, in the act of relating one substance to another four
distinct constitutive elements can be singled out:</p>

<ol>
<li>the relation itself—for instance, the form of paternity;</li>

<li>the substrate of the relation, that is, the substance that
denominatively receives the name of the relation—for instance, the
(substance that is the) father;</li>

<li>the object of the relation, that is, the substance the substrate of
the relation is connected with—for instance, the (substance that is
the) son; and</li>

<li>the foundation (<em>fundamentum</em>) of the relation, that is,
the absolute entity in virtue of which the relation inheres in the
substrate and in the object (<em>In Cat</em>., cap. <em>de
relatione</em>, p. 299).</li>

</ol>

<p>

The foundation is the main component, since it (i) joins the relation
to the underlying substances, (ii) lets the relation link the
substrate to the object, and (iii) transmits some of its properties to
the relation. Unlike Burley and Wyclif, Alyngton affirms that not only
qualities and quantities, but substances too can be the foundation of
a relation (<em>In Cat</em>., cap. <em>de relatione</em>, p. 291).</p>

<p>

On this basis, Alyngton can define relations of reason while
eliminating from their description any reference to our mind and using
objective criteria only, based on the framework of reality itself. In
fact, he maintains that what characterizes relations of reason is the
fulfillment of at least one of these conditions: (i) either the
relation’s subject of inherence or its object is not a substance;
(ii) the object is not an actual entity; (iii) the foundation of the
relation is not an absolute being—that is. a substance, a quantity,
or a quality (<em>In Cat</em>., cap. <em>de relatione</em>,
pp. 291–92, and 294–95).</p>

<p>

3. (<em>Quality</em>) The chapter on quality is the least complex and
interesting part of the whole commentary, since Alyngton is faithful
to Aristotle’s text and doctrine, and sometimes even offers rather
unproblematic analyses and elucidations. The main general topic he
deals with is the internal structure of the category.</p>

<p>

In the first lines of the eighth chapter of the <em>Categories</em>
(8a25–26) Aristotle observes that quality is among those things
that are spoken of in a number of ways—an affirmation which seems to
imply that quality is not a highest genus, as, according to Aristotle
himself, what is spoken of in a number of ways always gathers in
several different natures. Furthermore, the Stagirite speaks of four
species of quality (habits and dispositions, natural capacities and
incapacities, affective qualities and affections, figures and
shapes), without explaining how they are related to one another and to
the highest genus of the category.  No Aristotelian commentator had
ever thought that quality was spoken of in many ways purely
equivocally. Therefore no Aristotelian commentator had ever presumed
that the term ‘quality’ could have several different (but connected)
meanings. On the contrary, they unanimously took for granted that it
had a unique <em>ratio</em>, common to all the items belonging to the
category. They disagreed, however, about the status and hierarchical
order of the four species mentioned by Aristotle. For example, Albert
the Great held that quality at once and directly splits up into the
four species, which would all be equally far from the highest
genus. Duns Scotus, Ockham, and Walter Burley maintained that the so
called ‘species’ of the quality were not properly species (or
intermediate genera), but modes of quality, since many singular
qualities would belong to the first three species at the same time,
as, unlike species, modes are not constituted by opposite
properties. Alyngton rejected both opinions. The latter because it
compromises the actual goal of a correct categorial theory, and the
former because it does not fit in with the standard infracatagorial
structure described by Porphyry in his Isagoge. Consequently, he
inserts an intermediate level between the highest genus of the
category and the four species by claiming that quality is first of all
divided into perceptible (<em>sensibilis</em>) and non-perceptible
(<em>insensibilis</em>) qualities. Affective qualities and affections,
figures and shapes stem from the former kind of quality, while habits
and dispositions, natural capacities and incapacities derive from the
latter. In fact, (1) figures and shapes are those perceptible
qualities which inhere in substances because of the mutual position of
its quantitative parts, while affective qualities and affections
inhere in substances because of the form itself of the substantial
composite. (2) Natural capacities and incapacities are inborn
non-perceptible qualities, while habits and dispositions are due to
the activity, both physical and, if it is the case, intellectual, of
the substance in which they inhere (<em>In Cat</em>., cap. <em>de
qualitate</em>, fol. 130r).</p>

<h2 id="SemaSecoInte">6. The Semantics of Second Intentions</h2>

<p>

Not until the end of the fourteenth century did anyone claim
extramental reality for second intentions, not even Walter Burley.
According to him, second intentions are concepts that have a
foundation in the extramental world, but are not “things” in the
proper sense of the term. This account implied that the keystone of
medieval realism, the principle of one-to-one correspondence between
language and the world, has to suffer an exception, since no common
nature matches second intention terms. It was just in order to do away
with this exception that Alyngton (then followed by William Penbygull,
Roger Whelpdale, and John Tarteys) hypostatized second intentions,
heavily modifying the standard theory of the status of second
intentions. In fact, Alyngton not only considers second intentions as
objective, but clearly hypostatizes them, speaking of them in terms of
real determinations joined to the modes of being of extramental things
and directly inhering in them (<em>In Cat</em>., cap. <em>de
substantia</em>, pp. 268–69). As a consequence, he conceives of logic
as an analysis of the general framework of reality, since according to
him logic turns on structural forms (aimed at building up semantic
contents), which are, as forms, independent of both such contents and
of the mental acts by which they are learned. It is through these
forms that the network connecting the basic constituents of the world
(individuals and universals, substances and accidents) is disclosed to
us (<em>In Cat</em>., cap. <em>de substantia</em>, pp. 278–79). The
strategy that supports this choice is evident: as in the case of
relations of reason, Alyngton is trying to substitute references to
external reality for references to mental activity. In other words, he
seeks to reduce epistemology to ontology. From a logical point of
view, this means that the same interpretative pattern is employed in
order to account for both the semantic power of proper names and
common terms (that is, those expressions that refer to a class of
individuals), and first and second intentions. Like proper names,
common terms also primarily signify and label a unique object—that
is, a common nature. But unlike the object signified by a proper name,
the reality of the common nature is distributed among many individuals
as their main metaphysical constituent, since it determines the
typical features of the individuals themselves. By associating common
terms with such objects as their main referent, Alyngton thinks he can
explain the fact that a common term can stand for and label many
individuals at once.  Only in this way does he believe we can grant
the value of our knowledge, which otherwise lacks an adequate
foundation (<em>In Cat</em>., cap. <em>de substantia</em>,
fols. 101v–102v).</p>

<p>

Still, this procedure, so strong and powerful, leads to a paradox when
applied to terms of second intention by which we speak of singular
objects considered as such—that is, terms (or expressions) like
‘first substance’ (<em>substantia prima</em>),
‘individual’ (<em>individuum</em>), and so on. In fact,
according to Alyngton (and many other Realists of that period), a
common term is always matched by a common nature really existing in
the world. Therefore, as the term ‘individual’ appears to
be common, since it can stand for a multiplicity of things, it should
signify an extramental common nature shared by them. As a consequence,
we would have to admit the existence of an <em>individual common
nature</em>, that is a (self-contradictory) entity present in all the
individuals as the cause of their being individuals. Alyngton, who
would not give up the principle of the one-to-one relation between
philosophical language and the world, could remove this paradox only
by classifying this kind of term among atomic (<em>discreti</em>)
terms—that is, terms or nominal syntagms, like
‘Socrates’ or ‘this man’ (<em>hic homo</em>),
that refer to individuals and not to sets of individuals. According to
Alyngton, there are three main kinds of atomic terms:</p>

<ol>

<li>personal pronouns, which identify a singular definite referent by
means of an ostensive definition (<em>a demonstratione</em>);</li>

<li>proper names; and</li>

<li>range-narrowed expressions (<em>a limitatione intellectus</em>)—that is, expressions, like ‘this man’, that identify a
singular referent as a member of a given (manifested) set of
individuals. Also expressions like ‘first substance’ and
‘individual’ belong to this third type, since they
presuppose a general concept (substance and being, in the example),
the range of which is narrowed to a unique object among substances and
beings by an act of our intellect—to one object that is not common
(<em>In Cat</em>., cap. <em>de substantia</em>, pp. 270–71).</li>

</ol>

<p>

The rule that terms can be listed as common ones if and only if they
signify a common nature is safe, but at the cost of a counterintuitive
categorization of their semantic power. In fact, according to
Alyngton’s account, saying that Socrates and Plato are first
substances simply means that (i) each one is what he is, and that (ii)
what each one is is a non-universal substance. This is a solution that
entails that to be an individual is not a positive state of affairs,
but a negative one, and therefore connects Alyngton’s ontology with
Henry of Ghent’s theory of individuation.</p>

<h2 id="AlynHistMediThou">7. Alyngton in the History of Medieval Thought</h2>

<p>

Alyngton’s metaphysics is an interesting example of that partial
dissolution of the traditional doctrine which took place in between
the end of the fourteenth and the beginning of the fifteenth
centuries. Within Alyngton’s ontology, the relationships between
primary (or individual) substances and secondary (or universal)
substances, and between substances and accidents (both abstract and
concrete) as well as the inner natures of essential and accidental
predications are so different from their Aristotelian originals that
the general meaning of the categorial doctrine is deeply
modified. According to Alyngton, formal-and-essential predication and
formal-and-accidental predication would correspond to Aristotle’s
essential and accidental predications respectively. But he regards
remote inherence as more general than formal predication. Therefore,
in his system formal predication is a sort of sub-type of remote
inherence. This means that he recognises a single ontological pattern,
founded on a partial identity, as the basis of every kind of
predicative relation. Thus, formal-and-essential predication and
formal-and-accidental predication are very different from their
Aristotelian models, as they express degrees in identity as well as
remote inherence. As a consequence, the relationships between
substance and accidents and between individuals and universals (and
hence the ontological status of universal substances and that of
accidents) are completely changed. In Alyngton’s view, both concrete
accidents, qua modes of individual substances, and universal
substances, qua the main components of the natures of individual
substances, are really identical-to and formally distinct-from primary
substances. Moreover, in the <em>Categories</em> Aristotle
characterizes primary substances as those beings which are neither
present in a subject nor predicable of a subject, and considers the
capacity of underlying accidents as the constitutive principle of
substance, while Alyngton defines primary substance as what (i) is apt
to underlie potency and act, and (ii) has matter and form as its inner
foundations, and explicitly affirms that underlying accidents is only
a derivative property of substance. Finally, because of his strong
propensity towards hypostatization, he interprets Aristotle’s theory
of homonymy, synonymy, and paronymy as an ontological theory about
real items and not as a semantic one about the relations between terms
and things. Alyngton conflates the real and logical levels into one:
like Burley and Wyclif, he considers logic as the theory of the
discourse on being (<em>ens</em>), turning on structural forms and
relations that exist in the world and are totally independent of the
