<h1>Existence</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Wed Oct 10, 2012</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>Existence raises deep and important problems in metaphysics,
philosophy of language, and philosophical logic. Many of the issues can
be organized around the following two questions: <em>Is existence a
property of individuals?</em> and <em>Assuming that existence is a
property of individuals, are there individuals that lack it?</em></p>

<p>

What does it mean to ask if existence is a property? A full answer
to this question requires a general theory of properties, which is well
beyond the scope of this article. I briefly sketch the landscape to set
up our discussion of existence. (See the entries on
 <a href="../properties/">properties</a> and
 <a href="../substance/">substance</a>
 for deeper discussion.) Properties contrast with individuals.
This distinction can be explicated using the instantiation relation. My
cat instantiates the property of being hungry, as that is a way he is,
and, being an individual, is not himself instantiated by anything.
While properties also instantiate—the property of being red, for
example, has the property of being a color—only properties are
instantiated; individuals only instantiate. So, our first question is
whether existence is instantiated and, if so, whether it is
instantiated by individuals like Obama, my chair, and the fig tree in
my backyard. Do individuals, in addition to ordinary properties like
being human, being comfortable to sit in, and needing more water,
instantiate a property expressed by the English verb
‘exists’? </p>
<p>

There is a debate in the literature on properties between the abundant
conception of properties, according to which there is a property
corresponding to every natural language predicate and, more generally,
every class of individuals, and the sparse conception of properties,
according to which a predicate expresses a property only if the
objects that predicate is true of resemble one another in an intrinsic
way. If the abundant conception is true, then our first question may
seem trivial: Existence is a property of individuals because sentences
like ‘Bill Gates exists’ are grammatical and there is a
class of all individuals and hence a corresponding property of
existing. It seems, then, that our first question has bite only if the
sparse conception is true. But appearances deceive. As we will see in
section 1, there is a controversy as to whether the logical form of a
sentence like ‘Bill Gates exists’ is really
subject-predicate in structure and so whether the English verb
‘exists’ really is predicated of individuals. The question
whether existence is a property of individuals is perhaps more
straightforward on the sparse conception of properties. But the
question can still be raised even on the abundant conception as the
question whether existence is a property of individuals involved in
our talk of what exists and what does not, which is then a question
about the logical form of the sentences used in our existential
discourse. </p>

<p>

We can trace the issue of whether existence is a property to a
disagreement between the ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle and some
of his medieval followers over the relationship between an
individual's essence and its existence. The debate requires some
background. We begin with the distinction between accident and essence
and that distinction's relation to contingency and necessity. Some of
a thing's properties are contingent, in the sense that the thing might
not have had them. I am writing right now, but I might have been out
for a run instead. So working on a paper right now is one of my
contingent properties. Contingent properties contrast with necessary
properties. I am necessarily human, in the sense that it is impossible
that I am a nonhuman. All contingent properties are accidents and all
essences are necessary but, according to the Aristotelian, some
necessary properties are accidents. A thing's essential properties are
inseparable from the bearer, not only in the sense that the property
is necessarily had by that object but in the deeper sense that any
adequate account of what that object is involves that property; they
are part of any adequate definition of the thing or answer to the
question ‘What is it?’. I am essentially a human and
perhaps essentially the person I in fact am, if there are individual
essences in addition to general essences. I am necessarily identical
to something and necessarily such that 2+2=4, but these properties are
among my accidents, as they are not part of any adequate account of
what I am and what distinguishes me from others. While this
distinction between a thing's necessary properties and its essential
properties is controversial, there is no doubt that it was Aristotle's
view, shared by most of his medieval followers, and so informed the
first historical occurrence of the debate about existence under
discussion. Aristotle seems to have seen nothing more to existence
than essence; there is not a space between an articulation of what a
thing is and that thing's existing. Saint Thomas Aquinas, on the other
hand, famously distinguished a thing's essence from its
existence. Aquinas argued something as follows, in chapter 4 of
his <em>On Being and Essence</em>. One can have an understanding of
what a man or a phoenix is without knowing whether it exists. So,
existence is something in addition to essence. In short, Aquinas
argued that existence is a separate property as existence is not part
of most objects's natures and so those objects can be conceived or
thought of separately from their existing.</p>

<p>

There is a long and distinguished line of philosophers, including
David Hume, Immanuel Kant, Gottlob Frege, and Bertrand Russell, who
followed Aristotle in denying that existence is a property of
individuals, even as they rejected other aspects of Aristotle's
views. Hume argued (in <em>A Treatise of Human Nature</em> 1.2.6) that
there is no impression of existence distinct from the impression of an
object, which is ultimately on Hume's view a bundle of qualities.
As all of our contentful ideas derive from impressions, Hume concluded
that existence is not a separate property of an object. Kant's
criticism of the ontological arguments for the existence of God rested
on a rejection of the claim that existence is a property of an object.
Proponents of the ontological argument argue that the concept of God as
an entity with all perfections or a being of which no greater can be
conceived entails God's existence, as existence is a perfection
and a being that exists is greater than a being that does not exist.
Kant objected (in his <em>Critique of Pure Reason</em>,
A596/B624-A602/B630) that existence is not a property. “Thus when
I think a thing, through whichever and however many predicates I like
(even in its thoroughgoing determination), not the least bit gets added
to the thing when I posit in addition that this thing is. For otherwise
what would exist would not be the same as what I had thought in my
concept, but more than that, and I could not say that the very object
of my concept exists” (A600/B628). Finally, both Frege and
Russell maintained that existence is not a property of individuals but
instead a second-order property—a property of concepts, for Frege,
and of propositional functions, for Russell. Crudely, to say that
dinosaurs do not exist is to say that the property of being a dinosaur
is not instantiated; to say that Jean-Baptiste Botul does not exist is
to say that some property—say, the property of being a unique
post-war critic of Kant and father of Butolism—is not instantiated.
In neither case is it to say of some individual that it does not exist,
which neither Frege nor Russell thought made sense.</p>

<p>

The view that existence is not a property of individuals became the
common view in the early 20th Century. While Aristotle, Hume, and
Kant's related reasons for the thesis have persuaded some, the
dominant force behind this agreement is the thought, developed most
forcefully in [Russell 1905b], that denying that existence is a
first-order property is the only way to avoid the consequence that
there are things that do not exist and thus that there is a
distinction between being and existing, our second framing question
from above. The thesis that there are things that do not exist was
held by the Austrian philosopher Alexius Meinong. Existence is a
genuine property of individuals, Meinong maintained, but not
universally had. While there are many ways to motivate Meinongianism,
a primary motivation is the puzzle of negative singular
existentials—sentences that seem to truly assert the
nonexistence of an individual, such as the sentence
‘Jean-Baptiste Botul does not exist’. In order to be true,
it seems, the subject position must designate some entity of which
nonexistence is truly predicated, in which case there are
things—the designation of these singular terms—that do not
exist. Frege and Russell, by contrast, take the same sentences to
demonstrate that those expressions are not genuine singular terms at
all and that negative existentials all have a general form, asserting
the noninstantiation of a property. In the following section I discuss
Frege and Russell's account of true negative existentials. In the
second section I discuss Meinongianism, comparing the account of true
negative existentials on offer by the Meinongian with the Russellian
account discussed in the first section. The article ends with a
discussion of an anti-Meinongian account according to which existence
is a universal property of individuals and a discussion of the related
issues of existence in the context of quantified tense and modal
logics.</p>

<h2><a name="FreRusExiNotProInd">1. Frege and Russell: Existence is not a Property of Individuals</a></h2>
<p>

There are two sets of reasons for denying that existence is a
property of individuals. The first is Hume and Kant's puzzlement
over what existence would add to an object. What is the difference
between a red apple and a red existing apple? To be red (or even to be
an apple) it must already exist, as only existing things instantiate
properties. (This principle—that existence is conceptually prior to
predication—is rejected by Meinongians.) Saying it is red and an
apple and furthermore exists is to say one thing too many. The thought
seems to be that instantiating any property whatsoever presupposes
existence and so existence is not a further property over and above a
thing's genuine properties. The thought is not merely that
everything that instantiates any property exists, as the same is true
of being self-identical, being either human or not human—assuming
the law of excluded middle—and being such that 2+2=4, all of which
seem to be unproblematic properties of individuals even if that
status is denied of existence. Instead the thought is that
instantiating any property whatsoever <em>conceptually presupposes</em>
the existence of a subject in a way that makes it incoherent to then
think of existence as a further property of that thing. The
thing's existence is prior to any predication to it and so it is
incoherent to think of existence as a property had by the thing. This
thought is behind Aristotle's thesis that existence is not a
further feature of a thing beyond its essence.</p>
<p>

The second consideration favoring the thesis that existence is not a
property of individuals concerns the puzzle of negative singular
existentials. Suppose that existence is a property of the designation
of the subject term in a singular existential sentence. Then
‘Ronald McDonnald does not exist’ predicates nonexistence
of the designation of the subject term, in which case reality includes
an entity—the designation of the singular term and subject of
predication—that has the property of not existing. That, Russell
complained, runs contrary to a robust sense of reality, according to
which everything exists. So, we should reject the claim that existence
is a property of the designation of subject terms in existential
sentences.</p>
<p>

To appreciate Russell's alternative account, consider first
general nonexistence claims. To say that foxes exist is to say that
there are some things that are foxes; that is, the property of being a
fox is instantiated. This is reflected in the standard regimentation of
the sentences ‘Foxes exist’ and ‘There are
foxes’ in first-order quantificational logic as
∃<em>xFx</em>, where <em>Fx</em> is the translation for the
predicate ‘is a fox’. General kind terms do not, then,
designate individuals, which we then (redundantly) say exist when using
the predicate ‘exists’ or (paradoxically) say are not when
using the predicate ‘does not exist’. Instead, kind terms
designate properties and simple seeming subject-predicate sentences
like ‘Foxes are carnivores’ are claimed to possess a more
complicated logical form, ∀<em>x</em>(<em>Fx</em>→
<em>Cx</em>), where <em>Cx</em> translates the predicate ‘is a
carnivore’. (I ignore the difficult question whether generics are
really quantifiers at all, made more troubling by the fact that some
generics seem to admit of exceptions—‘Birds fly’ is
true, even though penguins are birds and don't fly; ‘Cats
have four legs’ is true, even though there is a three-legged cat
wandering my neighborhood.) Given this analysis, general nonexistence
claims are unproblematic. The sentence ‘Dragons do not
exist’ says, on this analysis, that the property of being a
dragon is not instantiated. Take the most inclusive class of what there
is; nothing in that class has the property of being a dragon. That is
what ¬∃<em>xDx</em> says, letting <em>Dx</em> translate the
predicate ‘is a dragon’. This is significant because it
does not require identifying some entity to then predicate of that
thing the property of nonexistence.</p>

<p>

The Frege-Russell view that existence is a second-order property is
based on the idea that seemingly singular existential and negative
existential sentence like ‘Bill Gates exists’ and
‘Ronald McDonnald does not exist’ are, in their deeper
logical form, general existential and negative existential claims. I
focus on Russell's version of the view.</p>
<p>

Russell claimed that ordinary proper names like ‘Bill
Gates’ are disguised definite descriptions, something like
‘the richest man in the world’. And definite descriptions,
given Russell's view of definite descriptions, are not genuine
referring terms but are instead quantificational expressions. The
sentence ‘The richest man in the world lives in Washington’
has, as its logical form, a quantificational structure and not a
subject-predicate structure, equivalent to something like the
following: There is a unique richest person who lives in Washington.
Individuals do not enter directly into the proposition expressed by the
sentence and are not part of the sentence's truth conditions.</p>
<p>

These features of Russell's account of definite descriptions
are significant for the treatment of seemingly singular existential and
negative existentials as they remove the need for entities to serve as
the designation of the singular terms for the meaningfulness and truth
of negative existentials. Seemingly singular existentials like
‘Bill Gates exists’ are assimilated to general existentials
like ‘Foxes exist’. Assuming the proper name ‘Bill
Gates’ is analyzed as the definite description ‘the richest
person alive’, the sentence ‘Bill Gates exists’ has a
logical form that can be more accurately expressed as <em>There is
someone that is uniquely richer than anyone else alive</em>. This is
neither redundant nor uninformative, assuming that we can grasp in
thought properties while coherently and rationally wondering whether or
not they are instantiated. Russell's account similarly dissolves
the problems generated by seemingly singular negative existentials like
‘Ronald McDonald does not exist’. The truth of this
sentence does not require a designation for the term of which
nonexistence is then predicated. ‘Ronald McDonald’ is short
for a definite description, say, ‘the happy hamburger
clown’. The sentence ‘Ronald McDonald does not exist’
expresses a proposition of the form <em>It is not the case that there
is a unique happy hamburger clown</em>. This proposition is true even
if absolutely everything there is exists. The proposition concerns the
property of being a happy hamburger clown and says of that property
that it is not uniquely instantiated. As the property—the true
subject of predication—exists, however, we are not forced to
countenance the reality of entities that do not exist in order to
recognize this sentence as saying something true.</p>

<p>

Russell's strategy depends on two claims. The first is that
the negation in a negative existential takes wide scope, applying to
the whole sub-sentence and not just the predicate. So, ‘Ronald
McDonald does not exist’ does not involve ascribing the predicate
‘is nonexistent’ to the subject ‘Ronald
McDonald’. Instead, it is more faithfully represented as
‘It is not the case that [Ronald McDonald exists]’. The
second is that ‘Ronald McDonald’ is not a genuine referring
expression and the predicate ‘exists’ really means
something like <em>is instantiated</em>. Notice that the first in
solitude is not sufficient to overcome the problems generated by
seemingly singular negative existentials. Even if the deep form of
‘Ronald McDonald does not exist’ is  ‘It is not
the case that [Ronald McDonald exists]’, assuming that
‘Ronald McDonald’ is a genuine singular term, the problem
remains of finding in reality some entity to serve as the designation
of ‘Ronald McDonald’. That entity is then part of reality
and so, assuming that Meinongianism is false, is existent. In that
case, the sub-proposition <em>Ronald McDonald exists</em> is true and
so its negation false. The problem of true singular negative
existentials does not rest on the supposition that they involve
ascribing the property of nonexistence. So, it is the second of the
above claims that carries the weight of Russell's solution to the
problem of singular negative existentials.</p>
<p>

The second component of the Russellian solution—the claim that
ordinary proper names like ‘Bill Gates’ are disguised
definite descriptions—faces a number of objections. One is the
semantic argument. (See [Kripke 1972].) Suppose that the descriptive
equivalent of the name ‘Bill Gates’ is ‘the richest
living person in the world’. An adequate semantic understanding
of the sentence ‘Bill Gates is richer than everyone else
alive’ would then be sufficient for recognition of its truth.
(More precisely, the sentence, ‘If anyone is richer than everyone
else alive, then Bill Gates is richer than everyone else alive’
has this feature.) But that seems implausible. Surely we must collect
empirical data to determine its truth. One who wonders whether someone,
say, Warren Buffett, is wealthier than Bill Gates does not display
irrationality or semantic ignorance, comparable to one who wonders
whether a fortnight is longer than 14 nights.</p>
<p>

Perhaps these considerations should motivate the descriptivist to
abandon “great deeds” descriptions in favor of
metalinguistic descriptions like ‘the person named ‘Bill
Gates’’ or causal descriptions like ‘the person that
stands at the origin of this chain of uses of the name ‘Bill
Gates’’. It is plausible that semantic competence suffices
to know that the sentence ‘Bill Gates is named ‘Bill
Gates’’ is true and, while perhaps importing extra-semantic
facts about language use, it is plausible that any reflective speaker
of English knows that any token of ‘Bill Gates is the person that
stands at the origin of this chain of uses of the name ‘Bill
Gates’’ is true. So these descriptions seem to survive the
semantic argument presented in the previous paragraph. But they face
another objection, also facing simpler versions of descriptivism:
Namely, the modal objection ([Kripke 1972]). While it is absolutely
impossible that Bill Gates is not Bill Gates, it is, it seems
metaphysically possible that Bill Gates is not the richest person
alive, instead being a middle American, and it seems metaphysically
possible that he is not named ‘Bill Gates’ and does not
stand at the causal origin of any particular chain of uses of the name
‘Bill Gates’. This suggests that ordinary proper names and
their alleged descriptive equivalents considered above are not, in
fact, semantically equivalent, as they embed differently under modals
like ‘it is necessary that’. [See the entry on
 <a href="../names/">names</a> 
 for further discussion of these problems.]</p>

<p>

In response to the modal argument, the descriptivist might avail
herself of individual essence descriptions like ‘the person
identical to Bill Gates’, ‘the person that
Bill-Gatizes’, or rigidifications of the above descriptions,
‘the person actually named ‘Bill Gates’’ and
‘the person that actually stands at the origin of this chain of
uses of the name ‘Bill Gates’’, all of which
designate the same person in every possible world in which they
designate anything. It is plausible that semantic competence suffices
for recognition of the truth of the sentence ‘Bill Gates is the
person identical to Bill Gates’ and that that sentence expresses
a necessary truth. So these versions of descriptivism seem to escape
the problems discussed in the previous paragraphs. The first two
candidates, however, do not hold much promise for solving the problem
of apparently true singular negative existentials. We know what the
property of being identical to Bill Gates is, but only because we know
the result of plugging up one of the relata in the two-place relation
<strong>is identical to</strong> with the individual Bill Gates.
Insofar as we think that reality does not include any entity identical
to Ronald McDonald, however, we are then left to wonder what the
property of being identical to Ronald McDonald is. Because the contents
of these properties are derivative from the individuals that serve as
the referents of their names, they are poor candidate descriptive
equivalences for a robust version of descriptivism and unlikely to shed
light on the truth of seemingly singular negative existentials like
‘Ronald McDonald does not exist’. Similar considerations
apply to the predicating view. </p>
<p>

The last candidates, rigidified metalinguistic and causal
descriptions, are the most promising. But some have claimed to discern
important differences in the functioning of a name and its alleged
semantically equivalent rigidified description, of any flavor. First,
some have claimed that the name ‘Bill Gates’ designates
Bill Gates with respect to every possible world, including worlds at
which Bill Gates does not exist; otherwise the sentence ‘Bill
Gates does not exist’ would not be true with respect to those
worlds. But the rigidified description ‘the person actually named
‘Bill Gates’’, for example, does not designate
anything with respect to such a world, as nothing in the domain of that
world satisfies the condition being named ‘Bill Gates’ at
the actual world. That is because it is only Bill Gates that satisfies
that condition and he is not a member of the domain of the possible
world in question. So, differences in how a name and a rigidified
description embed under modal operators can still be discerned. (See
[Salmon 1981] for further discussion.) This objection assumes that the
domain of quantification varies from world to world and that
individuals that serve as the designation of ordinary names are genuine
contingent existents, which some may deny. The objection also assumes
that the range of the description is the domain of the world with
respect to which the description is being evaluated, the actuality
operator rigidifying only the condition of the description, which may
also be denied. The second objection to rigidified descriptivism
concerns the differences some have claimed between how names and
rigidified descriptions embed under propositional attitude verbs.
Intuitively, Jones would have still believed that Bill Gates is wealthy
even if things had been ever so slightly different than they actually
are—say, I bought a poppy bagel instead of a sesame bagel this
morning. But if the content of Jones's belief concerns the actual
world, as rigidified descriptivism dictates, then, to retain his actual
belief in that counterfactual situation, he would have to believe
something about another possible world—the actual world. But it is
implausible that Jones would have a belief about another possible
world. So, the content of Jones's belief does not concern the
actual world and so one can believe what is expressed by ‘Bill
Gates is wealthy’ without believing what is expressed by
‘The person that actually stands at the origin of this chain of
uses of the name ‘Bill Gates’ is wealthy’. (See
[Soames 1998].) </p>

<p>

In this section I examined the thesis that seemingly singular
existential and negative existential sentences are really general
existentials, which are then treated as ascribing the property of being
instantiated or not instantiated to some property. The need to grant
being to entities that do not exist in order to account for the truth
of sentences like ‘Ronald McDonald does not exist’ is then
avoided, which is no small victory. The success of that proposal,
however, was seen to rest on the claim that ordinary proper names have
descriptive equivalences, which many philosophers of language
reject.</p>

<h2><a name="Mei">2. Meinongianism</a></h2>

<p>

Perhaps, then, we should reject descriptivism and accept that
ordinary proper names are devices of direct reference, that there are
true genuinely singular negative existentials, and so that there are
nonexistent objects. ‘Ronald McDonald’ seems like a
referring term, open to existential generalization, in the sense that a
sentence like ‘Ronald McDonald does not exist’ entails
‘There is something that does not exist’, and
‘exists’ seems like a predicate that applies or fails to
apply to the designation of subject-place terms. The Meinongian accepts
these appearances and concludes that reality includes referents for
empty names and those referents do not exist. The Meinongian trades
logical and semantic simplicity for metaphysical abundance.</p>
<p>

Meinongianism is the thesis that there are objects that do not exist,
nonexistent entities being included in the most unrestricted domain of
quantification and discourse. One immediate challenge to the
Meinongian is to offer individuating conditions for nonexistents. The
most straightforward comprehension principle is the naive principle
that, for any condition on objects, there is a unique object
satisfying exactly that condition. For our purposes, we can conceive
of a condition as determining a set of properties; crudely, the
properties expressed by the predicates composing the condition. In
that case, condition <em>C</em> is the same condition
as <em>C</em>′ when they determine the same set of
properties. It follows that corresponding to any set of properties,
there is exactly one object with exactly those properties. The naive
comprehension principle faces several problems.  In what remains of
this section, I survey these problems and distinguish different
versions of Meinongianism in terms of the devices employed to develop
a restricted comprehension principle for objects that avoids them.</p>
<p>

The first is the problem of incomplete objects. Conditions need not
be total; that is, we do not require that the set of properties a
condition determines is such that, for every property, either it or its
complement is a member of that set. So, by the naive comprehension
principle, the condition of being a singer defines an object with
exactly that property—being a singer—and no other properties. A
set with other properties as well is a distinct set of properties and
so corresponds to a different condition and hence a different object.
Some find incomplete objects problematic in themselves, as they are
counterexamples to bivalence: Our singer, for example, is neither
wearing a dress nor not wearing a dress. But they also lead to more
general threats of paradox. Our singer is an object with exactly one
property: That of being a singer. This is its sole defining
characteristic. So having a exactly one property is also a property of
our singer and that property is distinct from the property of being a
singer, which our singer also has. So, the singer has two properties
Contradiction. One simple solution is to restrict the comprehension
principle to total conditions. The resulting proposal, however, leads
to a questionable application of Meinongian metaphysics to problems of
fictional truth, as many want to claim that there is simply no fact of
the matter as to whether or not Sherlock Holmes has a mole on his left
shoulder, as that is left underdetermined by the Holmes stories and
there are no deeper grounds for either predication. The promise of
employing nonexistent objects in explaining apparent truths about
fiction is one of the theory's main virtues. Relatedly, this
solution undermines a primary motivation for Meinongianism—namely,
the idea that there is a subject of predication corresponding to any
object of thought, as we certainly do not think only of complete
objects.</p>

<p>

The second is the problem of contradiction. A naive comprehension
principle generates objects that violate the principle of
noncontradiction. Consider the condition of being taller than
everything. By the naive comprehension principle, this condition
determines an object and so there is an object that has exactly the
property of being taller than everything. But then it is taller than
itself, which is a contradiction given the irreflexivity of the taller
than relation.  The irreflexivity of the taller than relation is
nonlogical. But not so with the identity relation, as = is typically
taken to be a logical predicate. It is a logical truth that everything
is self-identical; i.e., the sentence ∀<em>x x=x</em> is true
under every interpretation. But consider the property of being
self-distinct. By the naive comprehension principle this condition
determines an object and that object is self-distinct. But then that
object does not satisfy the condition <em>x=x</em>. So our logically
true sentence has a counterinstance. Contradiction.</p>
<p>

A third problem, one of Russell's objections to Meinongianism
(see [Russell 1905a, 1907]), turns on the fact that existence is, on
Meinongianism, a property and hence figures into the base of the naive
comprehension principle. So, consider the condition of being winged,
being a horse, and existing. By the naive comprehension principle,
there is an object with exactly these features. But then this object
exists, as existing is one of its characterizing features. Intuitively,
however, there is no existent winged horse; existing seems to require a
bit more substance. Indeed, for every intuitively nonexistent object
that motivates Meinongianism—Zeus, Pegasus, Santa Clause, and
Ronald McDonald—there is, by the naive abstraction principle, an
object just like it but with additional the property of existing. But
then there is an existing Zeus, an existing Pegasus, etc.. This is
overpopulation not of being but of existence as well.</p>
<p>

The naive comprehension principle, then, must be rejected and a
restricted principle connecting sets of properties with objects found.
The principle should generate enough objects to serve the Meinongian
purpose of ensuring a corresponding object for every thought while
avoiding the problems discussed above. We can distinguish two
strategies, both suggested by Meinong's student Ernst Mally
[Mally 1912]. The first distinguishes two kinds of properties, what,
following Terence Parsons [Parsons 1980], we shall call nuclear and
extra-nuclear properties. While the distinction remains ultimately
unclear, the key idea is that nuclear properties are part of a
thing's nature, broadly construed, and extra-nuclear properties
are external to a thing's nature; more precisely, nuclear
properties, but not extra-nuclear properties, are part of the
characterization of what the object is. The comprehension principle is
then restricted to conditions involving only nuclear predicates.
Problematic properties, like existing, etc., are deemed extra-nuclear
and beyond the scope of the comprehension principle, not determining
the objects that there are. Nuclear, not extra-nuclear, properties
individuate objects. The second Meinongian camp distinguishes two modes
of predication: What Mally called determining and satisfying,
Hector-Neri Castañeda [Castañeda 1974] called internal
and external predication, William Rapaport [Rapaport 1978] called
constituency and exemplification, Kit Fine [Fine 1982] called implicit
and explicit, and Edward Zalta [Zalta 1983, 1988] called encoding and
exemplifying. There is, on this view, a single class of properties that
the comprehension principle ranges over, but the principle determines
the properties encoded not exemplified (to follow Zalta's
terminology). For every condition, there is a unique object that
encodes just those properties. An object may or may not exemplify the
properties it encodes. Sherlock Holmes encodes the properties of being
a detective and living at 221B Baker Street, etc., but he does not
exemplify those properties. He exemplifies (but does not encode) the
properties of being a fictional character and being the hero of Arthur
Conan Doyle's Holmes stories.</p>

<p>

How do these distinctions solve the problems raised above for the
naive comprehension principle? I begin with Parsons's view.
Parsons focuses on the problems of contradiction and of the existent
winged horse. Following Russell's discussion of Meinong, in
[Russell 1905a, 1907], Parsons considers the threat of contradiction
generated by impossible objects like the round square. Meinong claimed
that there is a round square, but that, complained Russell, leads to
violations of the principle of noncontradiction, as that entity is then
both round and not round, in light of the fact that it is square, which
entails that it is not round. Parsons's response (see [Parsons
1980], 38-42) seems to be to deny that being square entails not being
round, in which case it is simply false that the round square is not
round. He thinks that that implication holds only for
“real” objects. He claims that there are counterexamples to
the claim that all square objects are not round; after all, the round
square is a square object that is round! This solution, however, does
not seem to solve the more general threat of contradiction, as
discussed above. Indeed, Parsons himself recognizes the limited success
of his response (see [Parsons, 1980, 42n8]). He allows that being
non-squared is a nuclear property. But then his comprehension principle
entails that there is an object corresponding to the condition of being
a non-squared square, where that object instantiates the incompatible
properties of being a square and being a non-square.</p>
<p>

Let's turn to Parsons's response to the existence
problem. The naive comprehension principle faced the problem of
generating an existent winged horse. Because existence is an
extra-nuclear property, however, Parsons's version of the
comprehension principle, which correlates sets of only nuclear
properties to objects, avoids this problem. The condition of being an
existent winged horse is not composed solely of nuclear properties and
so Parsons's principle does not correlate it to an object.
Parsons's distinction between nuclear and extra-nuclear
properties similarly promises to solve the problem of incomplete
objects. Recall our singer from above. That object does not have
exactly one property; instead, it has exactly one nuclear property. As
having exactly one nuclear property is itself an extra-nuclear
property, much as being a complete object is on Parsons's view,
the threat of contradiction is avoided. </p>
<p>

The distinction between nuclear and extra-nuclear properties remains
unclear. Parsons introduced the distinction with lists of nuclear
predicates (‘is blue’, ‘is tall’, ‘kicked
Socrates’, ‘is a mountain’) and extra-nuclear
predicates (‘exists’, ‘is thought about by
Meinong’, ‘is complete’). He then tells us that the
extra-nuclear are those that do not stand for properties of individuals
([Parsons 1980, 24]). And, of course, it is nuclear and not
extra-nuclear properties by which objects are individuated.
Parsons's individuation principle for objects is the following:
“(1) No two objects (real <em>or</em> unreal) have exactly the
same nuclear properties; and (2) For any set of nuclear properties,
some object has all the properties in that set and no other nuclear
properties” ([Parsons 1980, 19]). But it is not clear what status
individual identity properties—properties like <strong>being
identical to A</strong>, where <strong>A</strong> is an individual
substance like, say, Parsons himself—have with respect to this
distinction. He sometimes claims that they are extra-nuclear properties
([Parsons 1980, 28]). In that case, however, Parsons is committed to
the problematic thesis of the identity of indiscernibles and so the
impossibility of two primitively distinct but qualitatively identical
objects. (For further discussion, see the entry on
 <a href="../identity-indiscernible/">the identity of indiscernibles</a>.)
 Most contemporary philosophers agree that objects are
not individuated qualitatively, their identity and diversity being
primitive. Max Black's two qualitatively indiscernible spheres
are primitively distinct, in virtue of which one has the property of
being that very thing and the other lacking that property (see [Black
1953]). Furthermore, it is hard to see why identity properties are not
properties of individuals. Suppose, then, that we count individual
identity properties like <strong>being identical to A</strong> as
nuclear properties, those properties entering the range of
Parsons's restricted comprehension principle. Then the nuclear
negations of those properties are also nuclear. But then we can take
the set of all objects, construct the individual identity property for
each, construct the nuclear negation of each of those properties, and
then construct a condition from those properties that, by
Parsons's comprehension principle, corresponds to an object. Then
there is an object that is distinct from every object that there is,
which is a contradiction. It is unclear, then, that the distinction
between nuclear and extra-nuclear properties and the restriction of the
comprehension principle to nuclear properties solves the problems
facing the naive comprehension principle. (For further discussion of
Parsons's view, see [Fine 1982, 1984] and [Zalta 1992].)</p>

<p>

Earlier I distinguished two versions of sophisticated Meinongianism.
The first, based on the distinction between nuclear and extra-nuclear
properties, was found lacking. I turn now to the second, based on the
distinction between encoding and exemplifying a property, focusing on
Zalta's version. Whereas Parsons distinguishes different kinds of
properties, restricting the comprehension principle to only nuclear
properties in the hope of thereby avoiding the problems plaguing the
naive comprehension principle, Zalta distinguishes two different modes
of having a property for the same effect. Exemplifying a property is
the familiar way in which an individual has a property; it is what I
called instantiation above.  Obama exemplifies humanity, my chair
exemplifies being comfortable, and the fig tree in my backyard
exemplifies needing water. What the comprehension principle does is
say not what properties object exemplify, in this sense, but rather
what properties they encode. So, for any condition <em>C</em> on
properties, there is an object that encodes exactly those properties,
which leaves open whether or not those objects also exemplify those
properties.</p>
<p>

Let's apply this distinction to the problems facing
Meinongianism presented earlier in this section. By the comprehension
principle, the condition of being a singer determines an object with
exactly that property. The object does not exemplify the property of
being a singer but rather encodes it. Indeed, exemplifying the property
of being a singer requires exemplifying other properties like having a
spatial location, having a voice box, etc., all properties our singer
does not have, neither encoding nor exemplifying these further
properties. That object does exemplify some properties: Like the
property of encoding exactly one property. There is no contradiction
here, as the singer <em>encodes</em> exactly one property—the
property of being a singer—and <em>exemplifies</em> multiple
properties, including the property of encoding exactly one property,
being self-identical, etc.. More generally, Zalta's comprehension
principle correlates sets of properties with objects that encode, not
(necessarily) exemplify, those properties. Insofar as the set of
properties characterizing an object are not complete, the resulting
object will be incomplete with respect to the properties it encodes.
But it need not be incomplete with respect to the properties it
exemplifies. While our singer encodes neither the property of wearing
blue shoes nor the property of not wearing blue shoes, we can say that
it exemplifies the property of not wearing blue shoes. Restricting the
comprehension principle to the properties encoded also promises to
avoid the other threats of contradiction presented above. Recall the
logically impossible condition of being self-distinct. The principle of
noncontradiction concerns the properties objects exemplify, not the
properties objects encode (assuming our Meinongian is going to account
for impossible objects). Because an object can encode inconsistent
properties without exemplifying them, impossible objects do not violate
the principle of noncontradiction. Finally, Russell's worry that
a Meinongian comprehension principle generates existent winged horses
can be answered. There is an object correlated to the condition of
being an existent winged horse, but that object encodes and does not
exemplify the property of existing. Being existent can characterize an
object without that object exemplifying existence. So we do not need to
worry about an overpopulation of existent beings, as existent beings
exemplify existence, which the existent winged horse does
not. </p>
<p>

A view based on the distinction between encoding and exemplifying
avoids the standard objections to Meinongianism while promising to
deliver that view's many benefits. The semantics and logic is
straightforward and simple and surface forms of the natural language
sentences of interest in this article match their deep logical forms.
But the ontological costs are evident. There is semantic and logical
simplicity at a metaphysical price.</p>

<h2><a name="AntMeiFirOrdVie">3. An Anti-Meinongian First-Order View</a></h2>

<p>

In the previous two sections I discussed views that deny that
existence is a property of individuals and views that deny that
existence is a universal property. In this section I consider views
according to which existence is a universal property of individuals, in
the hope of reaping the benefits of both the earlier views. I then
explore the interaction between quantifiers, tense operators, modal
operators, and a universal, first-order existence predicate in an
attempt to expose some difficulties such a view faces.</p>
<p>

For both the Meinongian and the proponent of the proposal under
consideration, proper names are directly referential and simple
sentences in which they occur express singular propositions. However,
unlike the Meinongian, a proponent of this view insists that absolutely
everything exists. In that case, a sentence like ‘Ronald McDonald
does not exist’ either expresses a fully articulate singular
proposition and so is false, as in that case there is a referent of the
subject-place singular term which exists, or does not express a truth
evaluative proposition at all, as the singular term lacks a semantic
content. In neither case is the sentence true. Avoiding that
consequence was a primary motivation behind all of the alternative
accounts discussed in the previous two sections. Our first challenge,
then, is to explain how sentences like ‘Ronald McDonald does not
exist’ are both meaningful and sometimes apparently true without
abandoning the theses that absolutely everything exists and all names
are devices of direct reference.</p>
<p>

One important suggestion, adopted by Saul Kripke [Kripke 1973],
Peter Inwagen [van Inwagen 1977, 1983, 2003], Nathan Salmon [Salmon
1998], David Braun [Braun 1993, 2005], and Amie Thomasson [Thomasson
1999, 2003, 2009], among others, is that seemingly empty names like
‘Ronald McDonald’ refer to existent, albeit abstract,
fictional characters. Fictional characters have both being and
existence. As we don't run into them on the street, see them on
the bus, or feel them in our beds, given their lack of spatiotemporal
location, it is plausible that what a speaker <em>means</em> when she
utters the sentence ‘Ronald McDonald does not exist’ is not
the false proposition that that sentence expresses but instead the true
proposition that (the fictional character) Ronald McDonald is not a
real person or is not concrete. Indeed, this is suggested by the
natural amendment, ‘‘Ronald McDonald does not exist;
he's a creation of advertisement!’’ On this view,
then, there are no genuinely true singular negative existentials. All
meaningful singular existentials are true and their negations false. We
mistakenly take some singular negative existentials to be true because
we conflate or do not sharply distinguish existing from being concrete.
(Edward Zalta suggests the possibility of reinterpreting his Meinongian
object theory along similar lines, trading his primitive nonuniversal,
sometimes contingent existence predicate <em>E!x</em> in for a
primitive nonuniversal, sometimes contingent concreteness predicate
<em>C!x</em>. I discuss this version of object theory view below.) The
benefit of this account is the simple semantics of proper names and the
sparse metaphysics. The cost is revisionism regarding what we mean when
we use apparently true singular negative existentials.</p>

<p>

I end this section by briefly discussing issues that arise with the
interaction between quantifiers, tense and modal operators, and a
universal, first-order existence predicate, as this interaction is the
source of another important cost of this account of existence. There
are two sets of intuitions that seem to pull in opposite directions.
The first concerns the transience and contingency of existence. Things
come in and go out of existence through time. While Plato and
Descartes used to exist, they no longer do; when Plato existed,
Descartes did not yet exist; and right now the first child to be born
in 2150 does not exist, but that individual will. So, it seems,
different things exist at different times. Likewise, of the things
that in fact exist, some of them might not have and different
things—things that in fact do not exist—might have existed
instead or in addition. So, it seems, different things exist at
different worlds. These intuitions are quite robust.  The second set
of intuitions concern the ontological status of nonactual and
nonpresent objects. Many philosophers are drawn to the thesis of
actualism: The thesis that absolutely everything is actual and how an
object is <em>simpliciter</em> is how it actually is, unactualized
possibilities for an object being in some sense hypothetical ways of
being for that object. While less popular, many philosophers accept
the temporal analog of actualism, the thesis of presentism, according
to which absolutely everything is present and how an object
is <em>simpliciter</em> is how it presently is, how an object was and
will be are in some sense hypothetical ways of being for that
object. These two sets of intuitions combined with the view of
existence under consideration in this section lead to
difficulties.</p>
<p>

Let's begin with the modal problem. There could have been an
object distinct from all actually existing objects. For example, I
could have had a brother and, given origin essentialism, if I had a
brother, he would have been distinct from every actually existing
objects, as no actually existing thing could have been my brother. Our
intuitions concerning how things might have been lead us to accept this
claim as true. But, by the thesis of actualism, absolutely everything
is actual and, by our view of existence, exists and so actually exists.
So, it seems that actualism and our view of existence are incompatible
with the intuitive possibility of there being an object distinct from
all existing objects and the intuition that I might have had a
brother.</p>
<p>

We can regiment the contingency of existence intuition as followings,
letting <span class="scriptuc">A</span> be the actuality operator,
where <span class="scriptuc">A</span>φ is true with respect to a
world <strong>w</strong> under an interpretation <strong>I</strong>
just in case φ is true with respect to the distinguished world
of <strong>I</strong>: 
 ◊∃<i>x</i>¬<span class="scriptuc">A</span>∃<i>y</i>(<i>y</i>=<i>x</i>). 
 Call this sentence
<em>Alien</em>. The worry is that the truth of Alien carries
ontological commitment to merely possible individuals and so the
falsity of the thesis of actualism. One way to substantiate this worry
is to invoke the Barcan Formula, or one of the mixing axioms proposed
for modal operators and quantifiers in Ruth Barcan Marcus's
groundbreaking work in quantified modal logic [Marcus 1946], according
to which all instances of the sentence
◊∃<i>x</i>φ(<i>x</i>)
→∃<i>x</i>◊φ(<i>x</i>) are logical true.  (In the
foregoing formulas, φ(<i>x</i>) stands for any formula in which
the variable <i>x</i> may or may not be free.) We can then transpose
the modal and quantifier in Alien to derive
∃<i>x</i>◊¬<span class="scriptuc">A</span>∃<i>y</i>(<i>y</i>=<i>x</i>).
The truth of this second sentence evidently requires that there is
something that is not actual, contrary to the dictates of
actualism. The Barcan Formula, and in part for this very reason, is
controversial and rejected by those that subscribe to a varying
domains possible worlds semantics for modal discourse. So this line of
argument is not likely to convince everyone that our modal intuitions
lead to problems. </p>

<p>

There is, however, a second line of argument that does not rest on
the validity of the Barcan Formula, relying instead on combining
standard truth definitions for quantified and modal sentences in the
most straightforward way. Alien is true under an interpretation
<strong>I</strong> just in case there is a world <strong>w</strong>
accessible from the distinguished world of <strong>I</strong> with an
object in its domain that is not in the domain of the distinguished
world of <strong>I</strong>. This is because its truth requires that
∃<i>x</i>¬<span class="scriptuc">A</span>∃<i>y</i>(<i>y</i>=<i>x</i>)
is true with respect to
<strong>w</strong> and so, it is tempting conclude, that there is a
witness that satisfies the condition 
¬<span class="scriptuc">A</span>∃<i>y</i>(<i>y</i>=<i>x</i>) 
at <strong>w</strong>. But that is the rub. If actualism is true, then
there is no such witness, although there could have been. If we are
realistic about possible worlds semantics, the model theory for modal
talk itself does not contain primitive modality, instead containing
worlds as points of evaluation and the notion of truth at a world, in
which case ‘there is’ in the above truth recursion does not
occur inside the scope of a possibility operator. So, if Alien is true,
there is some object <strong>o</strong> and accessible possible world
<strong>w</strong> such that <strong>o</strong> satisfies 
¬<span class="scriptuc">A</span>∃<i>y</i>(<i>y</i>=<i>x</i>)
at <strong>w</strong>, which seems to run contrary to
the thesis of actualism, as that witness does not actually exist. (For
further discussion of this problem and some of the solutions considered
below, see the entry on
 <a href="../actualism/">actualism</a>.)</p>
<p>

One solution is to abandon actualism and accept that there are
merely possible objects. According to this possibilist position, merely
possible objects are among the most unrestricted domain of
quantification, being constituents of fundamental reality. It is simply
false, then, that absolutely everything is actual. While this position
deserves serious consideration, I propose to set it aside and explore
only actualist solutions. A second solution rests on the Meinongian
distinction between being, in the sense of being a member of the most
inclusive domain of quantification and discourse, and existing and the
claim that there are objects that do not exist. Armed with a Meinongian
metaphysics, we can reject Alien as capturing the intuition that
<em>existence</em> is contingent, opting instead for the following
sentence as doing that, where <i>E</i>!<i>x</i> is the Meinongian logically
primitive existence predicate: ∃<i>x</i>(¬<i>E</i>!<i>x</i> ∧
◊<i>E</i>!<i>x</i>). The Meinongian can then deny Alien and appeal to the
truth of this sentence to explain our intuitions concerning the
contingency of existence. Everything is actual, on this view, although
some of those actual things do not exist but could have. This solution
to our problems, however, is unavailable to a proponent of the view
that existence is a universal property of individuals.</p>

<p>

Bernard Linsky and Edward Zalta [Linsky and Zalta 1994] present a
novel solution to this problem that promises to be consistent with the
tenets of the view of existence under consideration in this
section. (A similar account is defended by Timothy Williamson
[Williamson 1998, 1999, 2000, 2002].) I begin with the intuitive
possibility that I have a brother. An entity that encodes the property
of being my brother actually exists, but as a nonconcrete object. That
object is only contingently nonconcrete; it could have been concrete,
and had it been concrete, it would have exemplified the property of
being my brother (along with the other properties that it encodes and
the necessary consequences thereof). On this view, my possible brother
(as well as any alleged merely possible object) actually exists, just
as a nonconcrete individual that could have been concrete. The view is
both actualistic, as absolutely everything is actual, and
anti-Meinongian, as absolutely everything exists. Note, however, that
Alien, the sentence two paragraphs above purported to capture our
intuitions concerning the contingency of existence, is false on this
view, as every individual is a necessary existent. Instead, our
intuition that what there is is contingent is to be explained in terms
of the contingency of what is concrete and nonconcrete. So,
where <i>C</i>!<i>x</i> is a logically primitive predicate of concreteness,
it is the truth of the following sentence, not Alien, that explains
those intuitions: ∃<i>x</i>(¬<i>C</i>!<i>x</i> ∧
◊<i>C</i>!<i>x</i>). While the explanation of the contingency of
existence bears a structural similarity to the Meinongian explanation
discussed in the previous paragraph, the metaphysics is importantly
different and so the two views should not be collapsed.</p>
<p>

Linsky and Zalta's view requires that concreteness is an
accidental property. The self-same individual that is nonconcrete (my
possible brother, for example) could have been concrete and the
self-same individual that is concrete (me, for example) could have been
nonconcrete. This is problematic and becomes more problematic, I
believe, when one considers its temporal analog. To see, we turn from
the modal problem of contingent existents to its temporal analogy, the
problem of temporary existents. While one's accounts of the two
problems do not need to swing together (Linsky and Zalta, for example,
do not offer the temporal analog of their account of contingent
existents), as there are differences between alethic modality and
temporality, it is useful to consider them as a pair for our purposes.
Intuitively things come in and go out of existence; what exists at one
time does not exist at another. The temporal analog of Linsky and
Zalta's view of contingent existents entails that everything
always exists. What there is and what exists at one time is the same as
what is and what exists at any other time; the domain of quantification
is fixed across all times. What varies from time to time is which of
those individuals are concrete. Socrates still exists now, although as a
nonconcrete individual, who was concrete in 450 BCE, and similarly for
the first child to be born in 2150. This view requires that a thing can
survive the change from being nonconcrete to concrete, intuitive
generation, and the change from being concrete to nonconcrete,
intuitive destruction. On this view, then, seeming generation and
destruction or substantial change are really forms of qualitative
change; a change in the quality of concreteness. This runs contrary to
the common conception that concreteness is necessary and eternal to any
object that instantiates it, the divide between concrete and
nonconcrete individuals marking a divide between categories of being
that an individual cannot migrate across. Just as one and the same
thing cannot go from being an individual to being a property, so too
one and the same thing cannot go from being nonconcrete to being
concrete. Suppose then that this view of the transience of existence is
rejected. What account can be given to ground the asymmetry between the
permanence of concreteness and its contingency? The above explanation,
that concreteness marks a category of being, explains the permanence of
concreteness, but entails its necessity as well. While not conclusive,
this suggests that we look for an alternative solution to our
problem.</p>

<p>

I now turn to the prospects of a theory according to which existence
is a universal, genuinely contingent and transient property of
individuals. Such a view requires that the domain of quantification
varies from world to world and time to time, as everything that is
exists but different individuals exist at different possible worlds
and at different times. In that case, Alien is true. What, though, of
the earlier argument that the truth of Alien is inconsistent with the
thesis of actualism? One response rejects the last step, insisting
that there are general claims that could have been true, and so are
true at some accessible possible world, without there being specific
instances of those claims that are true at those accessible worlds. In
nonmodal environments, the quantified sentence
∃<i>x</i>φ(<i>x</i>) is true just in case there is some
witness <strong>o</strong> that satisfies the condition
φ(<i>x</i>). The argument that the truth of Aliens requires that
there are merely possible individuals quite naturally imports this
truth definition to the truth of a quantified sentence at a merely
possible world. And that is the step I am proposing rejecting. The
model theory for a model language—with its space of possible
worlds and individuals populating the domains of possible
worlds—contains, like everything else if actualism is true, only
actually existing entities. Still, sentences like Alien are true and
so there are merely possible worlds at which 
 ∃<i>x</i>¬<span class="scriptuc">A</span>∃<i>y</i>(<i>y</i>=<i>x</i>)
 is true.  There is no individual of which 
 ¬<span class="scriptuc">A</span>∃<i>y</i>(<i>y</i>=<i>x</i>)
 is true in virtue of which the quantified sentence is true,
although there would have been had that merely possible world been
actual. This is perhaps more clear when we turn from sentences being
true with respect to merely possible worlds to propositions being true
at merely possible worlds. There is a world <strong>w</strong> at
which the existential proposition [there is something such that there
is no actual thing identical to it] is true but there is no singular
proposition [there is no actual thing identical to <strong>o</strong>]
true at
<strong>w</strong> as there is no such entity <strong>o</strong>. Had
<strong>w</strong> been actual, however, then there would have been
such an entity and it is this fact that grounds the truth of the
existential proposition at <strong>w</strong>. (See [Adams 1981].) This
suggestion, then, runs contrary to the standard semantics for
quantificational sentences, which reduces the truth or falsity of
existential and universal sentences to the truth or falsity of their
instances, when extending that semantics to truth at a world. The
suggestion also requires a distinction between truth at a world, in
terms of which the model theory for modal operators is given, and truth
in a world, which involves the notion of considering what would have
been had a nonactual world been actual. </p>

<h2><a name="Con">4. Conclusion</a></h2>

<p>

I began by saying that existence raises a number of deep and
important problems in metaphysics, philosophy of language, and
philosophical logic. I have examined some of those problems and
surveyed a number of different accounts of existence. None of the
theories surveyed is wholly satisfying and without cost. The first
view proposed by Frege and Russell treats existence as a second-order
property and assimilates seemingly singular existentials to general
existentials. The proposal requires descriptivism, the thesis that
ordinary proper names have descriptive equivalences, which many find to
be a problematic thesis. The second Meinongian view requires
countenancing individuals that do not exist. We have seen the view face
challenges in giving coherent and yet informative and compelling
individuation principles for nonexistent individuals and all versions
of the view suffer from the problem of metaphysical overpopulation.
Finally I presented the naive view that existence is a universal
property of individuals. That view faced the problem of having to
reject the truth of highly intuitively true singular negative
existential sentences like ‘Ronald McDonald does not
exist’. The view also faces difficulties in properly accounting
for the interaction of quantifiers and modal and tense operators.
Existence remains, then, itself a serious problem in philosophy of
language, metaphysics, and logic and one connected to some of the
deepest and most important problems in those areas.</p>
