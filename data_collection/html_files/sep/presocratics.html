<h1>Presocratic Philosophy</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Sat Mar 10, 2007; substantive revision Mon Apr 4, 2016</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
The Presocratics were 6<sup>th</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> century BCE
Greek thinkers who introduced a new way of inquiring into the world
and the place of human beings in it. They were recognized in antiquity
as the first philosophers and scientists of the Western tradition.
This article is a general introduction to the most important
Presocratic philosophers and the main themes of Presocratic thought.
More detailed discussions can be found by consulting the articles on
these philosophers (and related topics) in the SEP (listed below). The
standard collection of texts for the Presocratics is that by H. Diels
revised by W. Kranz (abbreviated as DK). In it, each thinker is
assigned an identifying chapter number (e.g., Heraclitus is 22,
Anaxagoras 59); then the reports from ancient authors about that
thinker's life and thought are collected in a section of
“testimonies” (A) and numbered in order, while the
passages the editors take to be direct quotations are collected and
numbered in a section of “fragments” (B). Alleged
imitations in later authors are sometimes added in a section labeled
C. Thus, each piece of text can be uniquely identified: DK 59B12.3
identifies line 3 of Anaxagoras fragment 12; DK 22A1 identifies
testimonium 1 on Heraclitus.</p>

<h2><a name="WhoWerPrePhi">1. Who Were the Presocratic Philosophers?</a></h2>

<p>
Our understanding of the Presocratics is complicated by the incomplete
nature of our evidence. Most of them wrote at least one
“book” (short pieces of prose writing, or, in some cases,
poems), but no complete work survives. Instead, we are dependent on
later philosophers, historians, and compilers of collections of
ancient wisdom for disconnected quotations (fragments) and reports
about their views (<em>testimonia</em>). In some cases, these sources
had direct access to the works of the Presocratics, but in many
others, the line is indirect and often depends on the work of Hippias,
Aristotle, Theophrastus, Simplicius, and other ancient philosophers
who did have such access. The sources for the fragments and testimonia
made selective use of the material available to them, in accordance
with their own special, and varied, interests in the early thinkers.
(For analyses of the doxographic tradition, and the influence of
Aristotle and Theophrastus on later sources, see Mansfeld 1999, Runia
2008, and Mansfeld and Runia 1997, 2009a, and 2009b.) Although any
account of a Presocratic thinker has to be a reconstruction, we should
not be overly pessimistic about the possibility of reaching a
historically responsible understanding of these early Greek
thinkers.</p>

<p>
Calling this group “Presocratic philosophers” raises
certain difficulties. The term, coined in the eighteenth century, was
made current by Hermann Diels in the nineteenth, and was meant to mark
a contrast between Socrates who was interested in moral problems, and
his predecessors, who were supposed to be primarily concerned with
cosmological and physical speculation. “Presocratic,” if
taken strictly as a chronological term, is not accurate, for the last
of them were contemporaneous with Socrates and even Plato. Moreover,
several of the early Greek thinkers explored questions about ethics
and the best way to live a human life. The term may also suggest that
these thinkers are somehow inferior to Socrates and Plato, of interest
only as their predecessors, and its suggestion of archaism may imply
that philosophy only becomes interesting when we arrive at the
classical period of Plato and Aristotle. Some scholars now
deliberately avoid the term, but if we take it to refer to the early
Greek thinkers who were not influenced by the views of Socrates,
whether his predecessors or contemporaries, there is probably no harm
in using it. (For discussions of the notion of Presocratic philosophy,
see Long's introduction in Long 1999, Laks 2006, and the articles in
Laks and Louguet 2002.) </p>

<p>
A second problem lies in referring to these thinkers as philosophers.
That is almost certainly not how they could have described themselves.
While it is true that Heraclitus says that “those who are lovers
of wisdom must be inquirers into many things” (22B35), the word
he uses, <em>philosophos</em>, does not have the special sense that it
acquires in the works of Plato and Aristotle, when the philosopher is
contrasted with both the ordinary person and other experts, including
the sophist (particularly in Plato), or in the resulting modern sense
in which we can distinguish philosophy from physics or psychology; yet
the Presocratics certainly saw themselves as set apart from ordinary
people and also from others (certain of the poets and historical
writers, for example, as we can see from Xenophanes and Heraclitus)
who were their predecessors and contemporaries. As the fragment from
Heraclitus shows, the early Greek philosophers thought of themselves
as inquirers into many things, and the range of their inquiry was
vast. They had views about the nature of the world, and these views
encompass what we today call physics, chemistry, geology, meteorology,
astronomy, embryology, and psychology (and other areas of natural
inquiry), as well as theology, metaphysics, epistemology, and ethics.
In the earliest of the Presocratics, the Milesians, it can indeed be
difficult to discern the strictly philosophical aspects of the views
in the evidence available to us. Nevertheless, despite the danger of
misunderstanding and thus underestimating these thinkers because of
anachronism, there is an important sense in which it is quite
reasonable to refer to them as philosophers. That sense is inherent in
Aristotle's view (see, e.g., <em>Metaphysics</em> I, <em>Physics</em>
I, <em>De Anima</em> I, <em>On Generation and Corruption</em> I):
these thinkers were his predecessors in a particular sort of inquiry,
and even though Aristotle thinks that they were all, for one reason or
another, unsuccessful and even amateurish, he sees in them a
similarity such that he can trace a line of continuity of both subject
and method from their work to his own. The questions that the early
Greek philosophers asked, the sorts of answers that they gave, and the
views that they had of their own inquiries were the foundation for the
development of philosophy as it came to be defined in the work of
Plato and Aristotle and their successors. Perhaps the fundamental
characteristic is the commitment to explain the world in terms of its
own inherent principles.</p>

<p>
By contrast, consider the 7<sup>th</sup> century BCE poem of Hesiod,
his <em>Theogony</em> (genealogy of the gods). Hesiod tells the
traditional story of the Olympian gods, beginning with Chaos, a vague
divine primordial entity or condition. From Chaos, a sequence of gods
is generated, often by sexual congress, but sometimes no cause for
their coming to be is given. The divine figures that thus arise are
often connected with a part of the physical universe, or with some
aspect of human experience, so his theogony is also a cosmogony (an
account of the generation of the world). The divinities (and the
associated parts of the world) come to be and struggle violently among
themselves; finally Zeus triumphs and establishes and maintains an
order of power among the others. Hesiod's world is one in which the
major divinities are individuals who behave like super-human beings
(Gaia or earth, Ouranos or sky, Cronos — an unlocated regal
power, Zeus); some of the others are personified characteristics
(e.g., Momus, blame; and Dusnomia, lawlessness). For the Greeks, the
fundamental properties of divinity are immortality (they are not
subject to death) and great power (as part of the cosmos or in
managing events), and each of Hesiod's characters has these properties
(even though in the story some are defeated, and seem to be
destroyed). Hesiod's story is like a vast Hollywood-style family
history, with envy, rage, love, and lust all playing important parts
in the coming-to-be of the world as we know it. The earliest rulers of
the universe are violently overthrown by their offspring (Ouranos is
overthrown by Cronos, Cronos by Zeus). Zeus insures his continued
power by swallowing his first consort Metis (counsel or wisdom); by
this he prevents the predicted birth of rivals and acquires her
attribute of wisdom (<em>Theogony</em> 886–900). In a second
poem, <em>Works and Days</em>, Hesiod pays more attention to human
beings, telling the story of earlier, greater creatures who died out
or were destroyed by themselves or Zeus. Humans were created by Zeus,
are under his power, and are subject to his judgment and to divine
intervention for either good or ill. (A good discussion of the
Hesiodic myths in relation to Presocratic philosophy can be found in
McKirahan 2011. Burkert 2008 surveys influence from the east on the
development of Presocratic philosophy, especially the myths,
astronomy, and cosmogony of the Babylonians, Persians, and Egyptians.)
</p>

<p>
Hesiod's world, like Homer's, is one that is god-saturated, where the
gods may intervene in all aspects of the world, from the weather to
mundane particulars of human life, acting on the ordinary world order,
in a way that humans, limited as they are by time, location, and
narrow powers of perception, must accept but cannot ultimately
understand. The Presocratics reject this account, instead seeing the
world as a <em>kosmos</em>, an ordered natural arrangement that is
inherently intelligible and not subject to supra-natural intervention.
A striking example is Xenophanes 21B32: “And she whom they call
Iris, this too is by nature cloud / purple, red, and greeny yellow to
behold.” Iris, the rainbow, traditional messenger of the gods,
is after all, not supra-natural, not a sign from the gods on Olympus
who are outside of and immune from the usual world order; rather it
is, in its essence, colored cloud. </p>

<p>
Calling the Presocratics <em>philosophers</em> also suggests that they
share a certain outlook with one another; an outlook that can be
contrasted with that of other early Greeks. Although scholars disagree
about the extent of the divergence between the early Greek
philosophers and their non-philosophical predecessors and
contemporaries, it is evident that Presocratic thought exhibits a
difference not only in its understanding of the nature of the world,
but also in its view of the sort of explanation of it that is
possible. This is clear in Heraclitus. Although Heraclitus asserts
that those who love wisdom must be inquirers into many things, inquiry
alone is not sufficient. At 22B40 he rebukes four of his predecessors:
“Much learning does not teach understanding; else it would have
taught Hesiod and Pythagoras, and again Xenophanes and
Hecataeus.” Heraclitus' implicit contrast is with himself; in
22B1 he suggests that he alone truly understands all things, because
he grasps the account that enables him to “distinguish each
thing in accordance with its nature” and say how it is. For
Heraclitus there is an underlying principle that unites and explains
everything. It is this that others have failed to see and understand.
According to Heraclitus, the four have amassed a great deal of
information — Hesiod was a traditional source of information
about the gods, Pythagoras was renowned for his learning and
especially views about how one ought to live, Xenophanes taught about
the proper view of the gods and the natural world, Hecataeus was an
early historian — but because they have failed to grasp the
deeper significance of the facts available to them, their unconnected
bits of knowledge do not constitute understanding. Just as the world
is a <em>kosmos</em>, an ordered arrangement, so human knowledge of
that world must be ordered in a certain way.</p>

<h2><a name="Mil">2. The Milesians</a></h2>

<p>
In his account of his predecessors' searches for “causes and
principles” of the natural world and natural phenomena,
Aristotle says that Thales of Miletus (a city in Ionia, on the west
coast of what is now Turkey) was the first to engage in such inquiry.
He seems to have lived around the beginning of the 6<sup>th</sup> c.
BCE. Aristotle mentions that some people, before Thales, placed great
importance on water, but he credits Thales with declaring water to be
the first cause (<em>Metaphysics</em> 983b27–33), and he then
later raises the question of whether perhaps Hesiod was the first to
look for a cause of motion and change (984b23ff.). These suggestions
are rhetorical: Aristotle does not seriously imply that those he
mentions are engaged in the same sort of inquiry as he thinks Thales
was. Two other Greek thinkers from this very early period, Anaximander
and Anaximenes, were also from Miletus, and although the ancient
tradition that the three were related as master and pupil may not be
correct, there are enough fundamental similarities in their views to
justify treating them together. </p>

<p>
The tradition claims that Thales predicted a solar eclipse in 585 BC
(11A5), introduced geometry into Greece from Egypt (11A11), and
produced some engineering marvels. Anaximander is reported to have
invented the gnomon (the raised piece of a sundial whose shadow marks
time); to have created a sphere of the heavens serving as an
astronomical and cosmological model (12A1); and to have been the first
to draw a map of the inhabited world (12A6). Regardless of whether
these reports are correct (and in the case of Thales' prediction they
almost certainly are not), they indicate something important about the
Milesians: their interests in measuring and explaining celestial and
terrestrial phenomena were as strong as their concern with the more
abstract inquiries into the causes and principles of substance and
change attributed to them by Aristotle (Algra 1999, White 2002 and
2008). They did not see so-called “scientific” and
“philosophical” questions as belonging to separate
disciplines, requiring distinct methods of inquiry. The assumptions
and principles that we (along with Aristotle) see as constituting the
philosophical foundations of their theories are, for the most part,
implicit in the claims that they make. Nevertheless, it is legitimate
to treat the Milesians as having philosophical views, even though no
clear statements of these views or specific arguments for them can be
found in the surviving fragments and testimonia. </p>

<p>
Aristotle's comments do not sound as if they were based on first-hand
knowledge of Thales' views, and the doxographical reports say that
Thales did not write a book. Yet Aristotle is confident that Thales
belongs, even if honorifically, to that group of thinkers that he
calls “inquirers into nature” and distinguishes him from
earlier poetical “myth-makers.” In Book I of the
<em>Metaphysics</em>, Aristotle claims that the earliest of these,
among whom he places the Milesians, explained things only in terms of
their matter (<em>Met</em>. I.3 983b6–18). This claim is
anachronistic in that it presupposes Aristotle's own novel view that a
complete explanation must encompass four factors: what he called the
material, efficient, formal, and final causes. Yet there is something
in what Aristotle says. Aristotle links Thales' claim that the world
rests on water with the view that water was the <em>archē</em>,
or fundamental principle, and he adds that “that from which they
come to be is a principle of all things” (983b24–25;
11A12). He suggests that Thales chose water because of its fundamental
role in coming-to-be, nutrition, and growth, and claims that water is
the origin of the nature of moist things. </p>

<p>
Aristotle's general assertion about the first thinkers who gave
accounts of nature (and his specific discussion of Thales' reliance on
water as a first principle) brings out a difficulty in interpreting
the early Presocratics. According to Aristotle's general account, the
Presocratics claimed that there was a single enduring material stuff
that is both the origin of all things and their continuing nature.
Thus, on this view, when Thales says that the first principle is
water, he should be understood as claiming both that the original
state of things was water and that even now (despite appearances),
everything is really water in some state or another. The change from
the original state to the present one involves changes in the material
stuff such that although it may not now appear to be water everywhere
(but seems to be airier or earthier than water in its usual state, or
its original one), there is no transformation of water into a
different kind of stuff (air or earth, for instance). Yet, when
Aristotle comes to give what details he can of Thales' view, he
suggests only that for Thales, water was the first principle because
everything comes from water. Water, then, was perhaps the original
state of things for Thales, and water is a necessary condition for
everything that is generated naturally, but Aristotle's summary of
Thales' view does not imply that Thales claimed that water endures
through whatever changes have occurred since the original state, and
now just has some new or additional properties. Thales may well have
thought that certain characteristics of the original water persisted:
in particular its capacity for motion (which must have been innate in
order to generate the changes from the original state). This is
suggested by Thales' reported claims that the lodestone (with its
magnetic properties) and amber (which when rubbed exhibits powers of
attraction through static electricity) have souls and that all things
are full of gods. Aristotle surmises that Thales identified soul (that
which makes a thing alive and thus capable of motion) with something
in the whole universe, and so supposed that everything was full of
gods (11A22)—water, or soul, being a divine natural principle.
Certainly the claim that the lodestone has soul suggests this account.
Given that the analysis of change (both qualitative and substantial)
in terms of a substratum that gains and loses properties is
Aristotelian (although perhaps foreshadowed in Plato), it is not
surprising that the earlier views were unclear on this issue, and it
is probable that the Milesian view did not clearly distinguish the
notions of an original matter and an enduring underlying stuff (Graham
2006). </p>

<p>
The reports about Thales show him employing a certain kind of
explanation: ultimately the explanation of why things are as they are
is grounded in water as the basic stuff of the universe and the
changes that it undergoes through its own inherent nature. In this,
Thales marks a radical change from all other previous sorts of
accounts of the world (both Greek and non-Greek). Like the other
Presocratics, Thales sees nature as a complete and self-ordering
system, and sees no reason to call on divine intervention from outside
the natural world to supplement his account—water itself may be
divine, but it is not something that intervenes in the natural world
from outside (Gregory, 2013). While the evidence for Thales'
naturalistic account is circumstantial, this attitude can be directly
verified for Anaximander. </p>

<p>
In the one fragment that can be securely attributed to Anaximander
(although the extent of the implied quotation is uncertain), he
emphasizes the orderly nature of the universe, and indicates that the
order is internal rather than imposed from outside. Simplicius, a
6<sup>th</sup> c. CE commentator on Aristotle's <em>Physics</em>,
writes: </p>

<blockquote>
Of those who say that [the first principle] is one and moving and
indefinite, Anaximander, son of Praxiades, a Milesian who became
successor and pupil to Thales, said that the indefinite (<em>to
apeiron</em>) is both principle (<em>archē</em>) and element
(<em>stoicheion</em>) of the things that are, and he was the first to
introduce this name of the principle. He says that it is neither water
nor any other of the so-called elements, but some other indefinite
(<em>apeiron</em>) nature, from which come to be all the heavens and
the worlds in them; and those things, from which there is coming-to-be
for the things that are, are also those into which is their
passing-away, in accordance with what must be. For they give penalty
(<em>dikê</em>) and recompense to one another for their
injustice (<em>adikia</em>) in accordance with the ordering of
time—speaking of them in rather poetical terms. It is clear that
having seen the change of the four elements into each other, he did
not think it fit to make some one of these underlying subject, but
something else, apart from these. (Simplicius, <em>Commentary on
Aristotle's Physics</em> 24, lines 13ff. = 12A9 and
 B1)<sup>[<a href="notes.html#1" name="note-1">1</a>]</sup>
 </blockquote>

<p>
Thus, there is an original (and originating) indefinite stuff, from
which all the heavens and the worlds in them come to be. This claim
probably means that the original state of the universe was an
indefinitely large mass of stuff that was also indefinite in its
 character.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#2" name="note-2">2</a>]</sup>
 This stuff then gave rise through its own inherent power to the
ingredients that themselves constitute the world as we perceive it.
</p>

<p>
A testimony about Anaximander from Pseudo-Plutarch (12A10) says that
“Something productive of hot and cold was separated off from the
eternal at the genesis of this world and from this a sphere of flame
grew around the air around the earth like the bark around a
tree.” Neither the cause nor the precise process of separation
is explained, but it is probable that Anaximander would have thought
of motion as innate and so that the original source of change was part
of the character of the indefinite itself. The passage from Simplicius
shows that Anaximander does not think that the eternal indefinite
stuff gives rise directly to the cosmos as we know it. Rather, relying
on a semi-biological model, Anaximander claims that the
<em>apeiron</em> somehow generates the opposites hot and cold. Hot and
cold are themselves stuffs with powers; and it is the actions of these
stuffs/powers that produce the things that come to be in our world.
The opposites act on, dominate, and contain each other, producing a
regulated structure; thus things pass away into those things from
which they came to be. It is this structured arrangement that
Anaximander refers to when he speaks of justice and reparation. Over
the course of time, the cycles of the seasons, the rotations of the
heavens, and other sorts of cyclical change (including coming-to-be
and passing-away) are regulated and thus form a system. This system,
ruled by the justice of the ordering of time is in sharp contrast with
the chaotic and capricious world of the personified Greek gods who
interfere in the workings of the heavens and in the affairs of human
beings (Kahn 1985a, Vlastos 1947, Guthrie 1962). </p>

<p>
The pattern that can be seen in Thales and Anaximander of an original
stuff giving rise to the phenomena of the cosmos continues in the
views of the third of the Milesians, Anaximenes. He replaces
Anaximander's <em>apeiron</em> with air, thus eliminating the first
stage of the coming-to-be of the cosmos (the something productive of
hot and cold). Rather, he returns to an originating stuff more like
Thales' water. In 13A5, Aristotle's associate Theophrastus, quoted by
Simplicius, speculates that Anaximenes chose air because he agreed
that a basic principle must be neutral (as Anaximander's
<em>apeiron</em> is) but not so lacking in properties that it seems to
be nothing at all. Air can apparently take on various properties of
color, temperature, humidity, motion, taste, and smell. Moreover,
according to Theophrastus, Anaximenes explicitly states the natural
mechanism for change; it is the condensation and rarefaction of air
that naturally determine the particular characters of the things
produced from the originating stuff. Rarified, air becomes fire; more
and more condensed, it becomes progressively wind, cloud, water,
earth, and finally stones. “The rest,” says Theophrastus,
“come to be from these.” Plutarch says that condensation
and rarefaction are connected with cooling and heating, and he gives
the example of breath (13B1). Releasing air from the mouth with
compressed lips produces cool air (as in cooling soup by blowing on
it), but relaxed lips produce warm air (as when one blows on cold
hands to warm them up). </p>

<p>
Does the originating stuff persist through the changes that it
undergoes in the generating processes? Aristotle's account suggests
that it does, that Anaximenes, for instance, would have thought that
stone was really air, although in an altered state, just as we might
say that ice is really water, cooled to a point where it goes from a
liquid to a solid state. Because the water does not cease to be water
when it is cooled and becomes ice, it can return to a liquid when
heated and then become a gas when more heat is applied. On this view,
the Milesians were material monists, committed to the reality of a
single material stuff that undergoes many alterations but persists
through the changes (Barnes 1979, Guthrie 1962, Sedley 2007 and 2009).
Yet there are reasons to doubt that this was actually the Milesian
view. It presumes that the early Greek thinkers anticipated
Aristotle's general theory that change requires enduring underlying
substances that gain and lose properties. The earliest Greeks thought
more in terms of powers (Vlastos 1947, Heidel 1906), and the
metaphysical problem of what it is to be a substance was yet to be
formulated. Clearly the Milesians were interested in the originating
stuff from which the world developed (Anaximander and Anaximenes are
explicit about transformations of such an eternal originating stuff),
but the view that this endured as a single substratum may not have
been theirs. Rather, it has been suggested by Graham (1997 and 2006;
Mourelatos 2008) that the Milesians were not, in Aristotle's sense,
material monists. On this view, the original/originating stuff is
transformed into other substances. Anaximenes, for instance, may have
thought that the change from air to water does not involve the
persistence of air as any sort of substratum. There is no special role
that air plays in the theory except that it is the originating stuff
and so first in an analysis of the law-like cyclical changes that
produce various stuffs as the cosmos develops (Graham 2006, ch. 4).
Such an interpretation suggests how different the Milesian conception
of the world is from Aristotle's.</p>

<h2><a name="XenColHerEph">3. Xenophanes of Colophon and Heraclitus of Ephesus</a></h2>

<p>
Living in the last years of the 6<sup>th</sup> c. and the beginning of
the 5<sup>th</sup>, Xenophanes and Heraclitus continue the Milesian
interest in the nature of the physical world, and both offer
cosmological accounts; yet they go further than the Milesians not only
through their focus on the human subject and the expanded range of
their physical explanations, but by investigating the nature of
inquiry itself. Both explore the possibility of human understanding
and question its limits. Recent work on Xenophanes' epistemology and
his cosmology has made much of his scientific work clearer and more
impressive (Lesher 1992, Mourelatos 2008). He has, to a great extent,
been rescued from his traditional status as a minor traveling
poet-sage who railed against the glorification of athletes and made
some interesting comments about the relativity of human conceptions of
the gods. Instead, he has come to be seen as an original thinker in
his own right who influenced later philosophers trying to characterize
the realms of the human and the divine, and exploring the possibility
that human beings can gain genuine knowledge and wisdom, i.e., are
able to have a god's eye view of things and understand them (Curd
2013, Mogyoródi 2002 and 2006). </p>

<p>
Xenophanes claims that all meteorological phenomena are clouds,
colored, moving, incandescent: rainbow, St. Elmo's Fire, the sun, the
moon. Clouds are fed by exhalations from the land and sea (mixtures of
earth and water). The motions of earth and water, and hence of clouds,
account for all the things we find around us. His explanations of
meteorological and heavenly phenomena lead to a naturalistic
science:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
She whom they call Iris, this too is by nature (<em>pephuke</em>)
cloud
<br />
purple, and red, and greeny-yellow to behold. (21B32)</p>

<p>
Xenophanes says that the star-like phenomena seen when aboard ship,
which some call the Dioscuri, are cloudlets, glimmering because of
their kind of motion. (A39)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In the 1980's Alexander Mourelatos argued that Xenophanes employs an
important new pattern of explanation: <em>X</em> is really <em>Y</em>,
where <em>Y</em> reveals the true character of <em>X</em>. Xenophanes
signals this by the use of <em>pephuke</em> in B32, and no doubt it
(or some word like it) was there in the original of A39 as well.
Xenophanes thus provides an account of a phenomenon often taken to be
a sign from the divine—Iris as the messenger; the Dioscuri (St.
Elmo's fire) as comfort for sailors—that reduces it to a natural
occurrence. </p>

<p>
That meteorological phenomena are not divine is not all that
Xenophanes has to say about the gods. He notes anthropomorphic
tendencies in conceptions of the gods (B14: “Mortals suppose
that the gods are born, and have their own dress, voice, and
body;” B16: “Ethiopians say that their gods are snub-nosed
and dark, Thracians, that theirs are grey-eyed and red-haired”).
He also famously suggests that horses, oxen, and lions would have
equine, bovine, and leonine gods (B15). Yet Xenophanes also makes
positive claims about the nature of the divine, including the claim
that there is a single greatest god:</p>

<blockquote>
One god greatest among gods and men,
<br />
Resembling mortals neither in body nor in thought.
<br />
… whole [he] sees, whole [he] thinks, and whole [he] hears,
<br />
but completely without toil he agitates all things by the
<br />
   thought of his mind.
<br />
… always he remains in the same (state), agitated not at all,
<br />
nor is it fitting that he come and go to different places at different
times. (B23, 24, 25, 26)
</blockquote>

<p>
While indifferent to the affairs of human beings, Xenophanes' divine
being comprehends and controls a cosmos that is infused with thinking:
it is understood, organized, and managed by divine intellection.
Having removed the gods as bearers of knowledge to humans, and denied
that the divine takes an active interest in what mortals can or cannot
know, Xenophanes asserts the conclusion to be drawn from his
naturalistic interpretation of phenomena: the gods are not going to
reveal anything to us; we are epistemologically autonomous and must
rely on our own capacity for inquiry. That way, we “discover
better,” as he says in B18, a fragment that is optimistic about
the capacities of human intelligence (see Lesher 1991):</p>

<blockquote>
Indeed not even from the beginning did the gods indicate all things to
mortals, but, in time, inquiring, they discover better.
</blockquote>

<p>
This suggests that human thought can mimic divine understanding, at
least to some degree. Xenophanes' own practice seems consistent with
the claims of B18; his own inquiries and explanations led him to
unified explanations of terrestrial and celestial phenomena. Yet B34
suggests skepticism: </p>

<blockquote>
And of course the clear and certain truth no man has seen,
<br />
nor will there be anyone who knows about the gods and what I say about
all things;
<br />
for even if, in the best case, he should chance to speak what is the
case,
<br />
all the same, he himself does not know; but opinion is found over all.
</blockquote>

<p>
Whether this is global or limited skepticism is controversial (Lesher
1992 and 1994 argues for a limited interpretation). Xenophanes
stresses the difficulty of coming to certainty, particularly about
things beyond our direct experience. Nonetheless, in B35 (a
tantalizingly short fragment), Xenophanes says, “Let these thing
be accepted to be like the truth” (see Bryan 2012 for a full
discussion).</p>

<p>
Famously obscure, accused by Plato of incoherence and by Aristotle of
denying the law of non-contradiction, Heraclitus writes in an
aphoristic style. His apparently paradoxical claims present
difficulties to any interpreter. Nevertheless, he raises important
questions about knowledge and the nature of the world. The opening of
Heraclitus' book refers to a “<em>logos</em> which holds
 forever.”<sup>[<a href="notes.html#3" name="note-3">3</a>]</sup>
 There is disagreement about exactly what Heraclitus meant by using
the term <em>logos</em>, but it is clear from 22B1 and B2 as well as
B50 and other fragments that he refers to an objective law-like
principle that governs the cosmos, and which it is possible (but
difficult) for humans to come to understand. There is a single order
that directs all things (“all things are one” B50); this
order is divine, and is sometimes connected by humans with the
traditional gods (it is “both unwilling and willing to be called
by the name of Zeus” B32). Just as Zeus, in the traditional
view, controls everything from Olympus with a thunderbolt, so this
single ordered system also steers and controls the whole cosmos, but
from within. The sign of the unchanging order of the eternal
system is fire—just as fire is always changing and always the
same, the <em>logos</em>, itself permanent, contains the unchanging
account that explains the alterations and transformations of the
cosmos.</p>

<p>
This plan or order that steers the cosmos is, itself, a rational
order. This means not only that it is non-capricious and so
intelligible (in the sense that humans can, at least in principle,
come to understand it), it is also an intelligent system: there is an
intelligent plan at work, if only in the sense of the cosmos working
itself out in accordance with rational
 principles.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#4" name="note-4">4</a>]</sup>
 Consider B114:</p>

<blockquote>
Those who would speak with understanding must ground themselves firmly
in that which is common to all, just as a city does in its law, and
even more firmly! For all human laws are nourished by one law, the
divine; for it rules as far at it wishes and suffices for all, and is
still more than enough.
</blockquote>

<p>
Heraclitus is not only claiming that human prescriptive law must
harmonize with divine law, but he is also asserting that divine law
encompasses both the universal laws of the cosmos itself and the
particular laws of humans. The cosmos itself is an intelligent,
eternal (and hence divine) system that orders and regulates itself in
an intelligent way: the <em>logos</em> is the account of this
self-regulation. We can come to grasp and understand at least part of
this divine system. This is not merely because we ourselves are part
of (contained in) the system, but because we have, through our
capacity for intelligent thinking, the power to grasp the system as a
whole, through knowing the <em>logos</em>. How this grasping is
supposed to work is tantalizingly obscure. </p>

<p>
Heraclitus regards the cosmos as an ordered system like a language
that can be read or heard and understood by those who are attuned to
it. That language is not just the physical evidence around us
(“Eyes and ears are bad witnesses to those with barbarian
souls” B107); the sheer accumulation of information is not the
same as wisdom (see the rebuke in 22B40, quoted above). Although the
evidence of the senses is important (see B55 and other fragments on
direct experience vs. hearsay), careful and thoughtful inquiry is also
necessary. Those who are lovers of wisdom must be good inquirers into
many things (B35; also B101: “I enquired into myself”),
and must be able to grasp how the phenomena are signs or evidence of
the larger order; as Heraclitus notes in B123, “nature is
accustomed to hide itself,” and the evidence must be interpreted
carefully. That evidence is the interplay of opposing states and
forces, which Heraclitus points to by claims about the unity of
opposites and the roles of strife in human life as well as in the
cosmos. There are fragments that proclaim the unity or identity of
opposites: the road up and down are one and the same (B60), the path
of writing is both straight and crooked (B59), sea water is very pure
and very foul (B61). The famous river fragments (B49a, B12, B91a)
question the identity of things over time, while a number of fragments
point to the relativity of value judgments (B9, B82, B102).
Anaximander's orderly arrangement of just reciprocity governed by time
is replaced by a system ruled by what Heraclitus calls war: “It
is right to know that war is common and justice strife, and that all
things come to be through strife and are so ordained” (B80).
This strife or war is the set of changes and alterations that
constitute the processes of the cosmos. These changes are regular and
capable of being understood by one who can speak the language of the
<em>logos</em> and thus interpret it properly (see Long, 2009).
Although the evidence is confusing, it points to the deeper
regularities that constitute the cosmos, just as Heraclitus' own
remarks can seem obscure yet point to the truth. Heraclitus surely has
his own message (and his delivery of it) in mind in B93, “The
lord whose oracle is at Delphi neither speaks nor conceals, but gives
a sign.” </p>

<p>
One of the earliest of the Greek philosophers to discuss the human
soul, Heraclitus' claims about it, like his other views, are expressed
enigmatically. Yet it seems fairly clear that he treats soul as the
seat of emotion, movement, and intellect. B107 (quoted above)
indicates that understanding is a function of soul, and in B117, the
drunken man who must be led by a boy because he has lost control of
his legs, and also does not know where he goes or what he does.
Drunkenness is the cause of all this: because his soul has become wet
its powers are dampened down and become ineffective. B118 asserts
“gleam of light: dry soul, wisest and best.” This suggests
that for Heraclitus, soul is a stuff that is affected by changes along
the hot/cold and wet/dry continua (the gleam of light suggests a
fiery, i.e., hotter soul is best). Indeed in B36, soul is listed as
one of the stages of transformation of the cosmic stuffs: “it is
death to souls to become water, and to water death to become earth;
from earth water comes to be, from from water, soul.” Although
Heraclitus says that it is only divine nature that has complete
understanding (B78), his linking of fire with the <em>logos</em> and
the divine, along with his view that the best and wisest soul is hot
and dry, suggests that humans who care for their souls and search for
the truth contained in the <em>logos</em> can overcome human ignorance
and approach the understanding that Heraclitus himself has obtained.
(Betegh 2007, 2009, 2013 and Dilcher 1995 both discuss the nature and
importance of soul for Heraclitus; see also Granger 2000 and Kahn
1979.)</p>

<h2><a name="ParEle">4. Parmenides of Elea</a></h2>

<p>
Parmenides, born ca. 510 BCE in the Greek colony of Elea in southern
Italy (south of Naples, and now known as Velia), explores the nature
of philosophical inquiry, concentrating less on knowledge or
understanding (although he has views about these) than on what can be
understood. Xenophanes identified genuine knowledge with the grasping
of the sure and certain truth and claimed that “no man has
seen” it, at least with respect to some topics (21B34);
Heraclitus had asserted that divine nature, not human, has right
understanding (22B78), although he implies that some humans can
acquire divine-like understanding. Parmenides argues that human
thought can reach genuine knowledge or understanding, and that there
are certain marks or signs that act as guarantees that the goal of
knowledge has been reached. A fundamental part of Parmenides' claim is
that what <em>must</em> be (cannot not-be, as Parmenides puts it) is
more knowable than what is merely contingent (what may or may not be),
which can be the object only of belief. </p>

<p>
Parmenides gives us a poem in Homeric hexameters, narrating the
journey of a young man (a <em>kouros</em>, in Greek) who is taken to
meet a goddess who promises to teach him “all things”
(28B1). The content of the story the goddess tells is not the
knowledge that will allow humans, by having it, to know. Rather, the
goddess gives the <em>kouros</em> the tools to acquire that knowledge
himself:</p>

<blockquote>
It is right that you learn all things,
<br />
Both the unshaking heart of well-persuasive truth,
<br />
and the beliefs of mortals, in which there is no true trust.
<br />
But nevertheless, you shall learn these things too, how it were right
that the things that seem be reliably, being indeed the whole of
things. (B1.28–32)
</blockquote>

<p>
The goddess does not provide the <em>kouros</em> with a list of true
propositions, as a body of knowledge for him to acquire, and false
ones to be avoided. Rather, in teaching him how to evaluate claims
about what-is, the goddess unleashes the <em>kouros'</em> own
cognitive powers to know everything, by testing and evaluation,
accepting or rejecting claims about the ultimate nature of
things— for that alone is capable of being known. For
Parmenides, the mark of what is known is that it is something that
genuinely is, with no taint of what-is-not. That is why, for him,
what-is not only is, but must be and cannot not-be. He sets this out
in the key passages of B2 and
 B3:<sup>[<a href="notes.html#5" name="note-5">5</a>]</sup></p>
 
<blockquote>
Come now, and I will tell you, and you, hearing, preserve the story,
<br />
the only routes of inquiry there are for thinking;
<br />
the one that it is and that it cannot not be
<br />
is the path of Persuasion (for it attends upon truth)
<br />
the other, that it is not and that it is right that it not be,
<br />
this I point out to you is a path wholly inscrutable
<br />
for you could not know what is not (for it is not to be accomplished)
<br />
nor could you point it out… For the same thing is for thinking
and for being.
</blockquote>

<p>
The routes are methods of inquiry: keeping on the correct route will
bring one to what-is, the real object of thought and understanding.
Although what the goddess tells the <em>kouros</em> has divine
sanction (hers), that is not why he should accept it. Rather, the
truth she tells reveals a mark of its own truth: it is testable by
reason or thought itself. In B7 the goddess warns that we must control
our thought in the face of the ever-present seductions of
sense-experience:</p>

<blockquote>
For never shall this be forced through: that things that are not are;
<br />
but restrain your thought from this route of inquiry,
<br />
nor let much-experienced habit force you along this path,
<br />
to ply an aimless eye and resounding ear
<br />
and tongue, but judge by reasoning (<em>logos</em>) the much-battled
testing
<br />
spoken by me.
</blockquote>

<p>
The <em>kouros</em> himself can reach a decision or determination of
the truth solely through use of his <em>logos</em>. <em>Logos</em>
here means thinking or reasoning (Parmenides probably means the human
capacity for thought in general). The test (restated at
B8.15–16), is “is or is not?” This is not just a
question of non-contradiction (which would give us coherence), but an
inquiry whether or not the supposition that something is would entail,
on further examination, the reality of what-is-not (which is
impossible). </p>

<p>
The arguments of B8 demonstrate <em>how</em> what-is must be. In
applying these arguments as tests against any suggested basic entity
in the Presocratic search for ultimate causes or principles, the
<em>kouros</em> can determine whether or not a proposed theory is
acceptable. For Parmenides <em>noos</em> is not itself an infallible
capacity. One can think well or badly; correct thinking is that which
takes the correct route and so reaches what-is. The mortals on the
incorrect route are thinking, but their thoughts have no real object
(none that is real in the appropriate way), and so cannot be completed
or perfected by reaching the truth. In B8 Parmenides sets out the
criteria for the being of what-is, and then the arguments for those
criteria:</p>

<blockquote>
… a single account still
<br />
remains of the route that it is; and on this route there are
<br />
very many signs, that what-is is ungenerable and imperishable,
<br />
a whole of a single kind, and unshaking and complete;
<br />
nor was it nor will it be, since it is now all together
<br />
one, cohesive. (B8.1–6)
</blockquote>

<p>
Any thing that genuinely is cannot be subject to coming-to-be or
passing-away, must be of a single nature, and must be complete, in the
sense of being unchangeably and unalterably what it is. These are
signs for what any ultimate cause or principle must be like, if it is
to be satisfactory as a principle, as something that can be known. The
signs are adverbial, showing how what-is is (Mourelatos 2008). Only an
entity which is in the complete way can be grasped and understood in
its entirety by thought. McKirahan (2008) provides a thorough analysis
of the arguments of B8, as does Palmer (2009).</p>

<p>
After laying out the arguments about what-is, the goddess turns to the
route of mortals, in an account which she calls
“deceptive.” Although Parmenides has been read as thus
rejecting any possibility of cosmological inquiry (Barnes 1979, Owen
1960), there are persuasive interpretations that allow for justified
belief about the contingent world, a world that may or may not be, and
is not such that it must be (Nehamas 2002, Curd 2004, Palmer 2009).
The problem of mortals is that they mistake what they perceive for
what there is (and must be). As long as one realizes that the world of
perception is not genuinely real, and cannot therefore be the object
of knowledge, it may be possible for there to be justified belief
about the cosmos. Some details of Parmenides' own cosmology are given,
arguably as justified belief, in the <em>Doxa</em> section of the
poem, and more in the testimonia from later authors. Parmenides seems
to have been the first Presocratic to claim that the moon gets its
light from from the sun and that the earth is spherical. Recently
scholars have focused on these claims about the natural world, and
have argued that Parmenides should be understood as offering an
account of appearances that can and should be deemed acceptable
(Palmer 2009, Cordero 2010, Graham 2013, Mourelatos 2013, Bryan 2012,
Johansen forthcoming). Nevertheless, Parmenides marks a sharp
distinction between being (what-is and must be) and becoming, and
between knowledge and perception-based belief or opinion.</p>

<h2><a name="PytTra">5. The Pythagorean Tradition</a></h2>

<p>
In the last quarter of the sixth century, before Parmenides' birth,
Pythagoras of Samos (an Aegean island) arrived in Croton, in southern
Italy. He established a community of followers who adopted his
political views, which favored rule by the “better
people,” and also the way of life he recommended on what seem to
have been more or less philosophical bases. The traditional view has
been that the aristocracy, the “better people,” generally
meant the rich. But Burkert notes that as early as the 4<sup>th</sup>
c. BCE there were two traditions about Pythagoras, one that meshes
with the traditional view and associates Pythagoras with political
tyrants, and another that credits him with rejecting tyrannies for
aristocracies that might not have been grounded in wealth (Burkert
1972, 119). The Pythagorean Archytas (born late 5<sup>th</sup>
century) lived in a democracy (Tarentum in southern Italy), and seems
to have argued for fair and proportionate dealings between rich and
poor (Huffman 2005). The Pythagorean way of life included adherence to
certain prescriptions including religious rites and dietary
restrictions (there is a general discussion in Kahn 2001). Detailed
treatment of Pythagoras and Pythagoreanism can be found in Zhmud (2012
and 2013); an excellent collection of articles on Pythagoreanism is in
Huffman (ed.) 2014. </p>

<p>
Like Socrates, Pythagoras wrote nothing himself, but had a great
influence on those who followed him. He had a reputation for great
learning and wisdom (see Empedocles 31B129), although he was treated
satirically by both Xenophanes (21B7) and Heraclitus (22B40, B129). We
do not know to what extent this included knowledge of mathematics, as
would be suggested by the attribution to him of the famous Pythagorean
theorem of geometry (Rowett 2013). The details of Pythagoras' views
are unclear, but he seems to have advocated the reincarnation of the
soul (a novel idea among the Greeks, also developed in Orphic
religion) and the possibility of the transmigration of the human soul
after death into other animal forms. Pythagorean writers after his own
time stressed the mathematical structure and order of the universe.
This is often attributed directly to Pythagoras (primarily because of
the geometrical theorem that bears his name), but recent scholarship
has shown that the evidence for attributing this mathematically-based
cosmology to Pythagoras himself is convoluted and doubtful (Burkert
1972, Huffman 1993 and 2005; but see Zhmud 1997). </p>

<p>
What seems clear is that the early Pythagoreans conceived of nature as
a structured system ordered by number (see the SEP entry on
Pythagoras), and that such post-Parmenidean Pythagoreans as Philolaus
(last half of the 5<sup>th</sup> century, more than a generation after
Pythagoras' death) and Archytas (late 5<sup>th</sup> to early
4<sup>th</sup> century) held more complicated views about the relation
between mathematics and cosmology than it is reasonable to suppose
Pythagoras himself could have advanced. The Pythagorean tradition thus
includes two strains. There are reports of a split in the period after
Pythagoras' death between what we would term the more philosophically
inclined Pythagoreans and others who primarily adopted the Pythagorean
ethical, religious and political attitudes. The latter, called the
<em>acusmatici</em>, followed the Pythagorean precepts, or
<em>acusmata</em> (which means “things heard”). The
former, the philosophical Pythagoreans (including Philolaus and
Archytas), were the so-called <em>mathematici</em>, and while they
recognized that the <em>acusmatici</em> were indeed Pythagoreans by
virtue of accepting Pythagorean precepts, they claimed that they
themselves were the true followers of Pythagoras.</p>

<p>
Philolaus of Croton seems to have blended the Pythagorean life with an
awareness of and appreciation for the arguments of Parmenides (Huffman
1993). According to Philolaus, “Nature in the cosmos was fitted
together out of unlimiteds and limiters” (44B1). These limiters
and unlimiteds play the role of Parmenidean basic realities—they
are and unchangingly must be what they are, and so can be known; they
are joined together in a harmonia (literally, a carpenter's joint;
metaphorically, a harmony), and “it was not possible for any of
the things that are and are known by us to come to be, without the
existence of the being of things from which the cosmos was put
together” (44B6). The unlimiteds are unstructured stuffs and
continua; the limiters impose structure (shape, form, mathematical
structure) on the unlimiteds. Things become knowable because they are
structured in this way; the structure can apparently be expressed in a
numerical ratio that allows for understanding: “All things that
are known have number; for without this nothing whatever could
possibly be thought of or known” (44B4). Philolaus also
developed a theory of the cosmos that displaced the earth from the
center, replaced by what he called Hestia, the central fire (Graham
2013, 2014), and offered novel accounts of eclipses. </p>

<h2><a name="OthEleZenMel">6. Other Eleatics: Zeno and Melissus</a></h2>

<p>
Parmenides had argued that there were strict metaphysical requirements
on any object of knowledge; the later Eleatics (named for following
Parmenidean doctrines rather than for strictly geographical reasons),
Zeno of Elea (born ca. 490) and Melissus of Samos (fl. ca. 440),
extended and explored the consequences of his arguments. Zeno paid
particular attention to the contrast between the requirements of
logical argument and the evidence of the senses (Vlastos 1967 is a
masterly treatment of Zeno; see also McKirahan 1999 and 2005). The
four famous paradoxes of motion, for which he is now and in antiquity
best known, purported to show that, despite the evidence all around
us, the ordinary motion of everyday experience is impossible. The
paradoxes claim that motions can never be begun (the Achilles) or be
completed (the Dichotomy), entail contradictions (the Moving Blocks),
or are altogether impossible (the
 Arrow).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#6" name="note-6">6</a>]</sup>
 Recent philosophers of space and time (see Grünbaum 1967,
articles in Salmon 2001, Huggett 1999, SEP entry on Zeno's Paradoxes)
hold that the arguments are reductios of the theses that space and
time are continuous (the Achilles and the Dichotomy) or discrete (the
Moving Blocks and the Arrow). Consider the Dichotomy: a runner can
never complete a run from point A to point B. First, the runner must
move from A to a point halfway between A and B (call it C). But
between A and C there is yet another halfway point (D), and the runner
must first reach D. But between A and D there is yet another halfway
point … and so on, ad infinitum. So the runner, starting at A,
can never reach B. The argument assumes that it is impossible to pass
an infinite number of points in a finite time. Similarly, Zeno
produced paradoxes showing that plurality is impossible: if things are
many, contradictions follow (Plato's <em>Parmenides</em> 127e1ff.;
Zeno in 29B1, 29B2, and 29B3); there were also purported proofs that
place is impossible (29A24) and that things cannot have parts (the
Millet Seed, 29A29).</p>

<p>
Melissus, dismissed as a simple-minded thinker by Aristotle (and by
some contemporary scholars as well but see Makin 2005), expands
Parmenides' arguments about the nature of what-is (Palmer 2004). It is
Melissus who explicitly claims that only one thing can be: if what-is
is unlimited (as he thinks it is), it must be one and all alike (if
there were two [in number or in character] they would be
“limited against each other” 30B6). Melissus specifically
argues against the empty (the void), and rejects the possibility of
rearrangement (which would allow for the appearance of coming-to-be
and passing-away, and of movement)—all these characteristics are
incompatible with the unity of what-is (i.e., the One). Melissus thus
claims that what is real is completely unlike the world that we
experience: the split between appearance and reality is complete and
unbridgeable.</p>

<h2><a name="PluAnaClaEmpAcr">7. The Pluralists: Anaxagoras of Clazomenae and Empedocles of Acragas</a></h2>

<p>
While Zeno and Melissus reinforced Parmenides' distinction between
what-is (i.e., what must be) and what appears, other post-Parmenidean
thinkers accepted Parmenides' arguments against coming-to-be and
passing-away (as characterizing what-is), and about the stable nature
of what is ultimately real, and argued that these arguments did not
rule out the possibility of metaphysically-based (or rational)
cosmology. Both Anaxagoras and Empedocles worked within the
Parmenidean pattern while developing distinct cosmological systems
that addressed their own particular concerns (especially in the case
of Empedocles, concerns about the proper way to live). </p>

<p>
Anaxagoras (writing in the mid-5<sup>th</sup> c.) claims, “The
Greeks [i.e., ordinary people] do not think correctly about
coming-to-be and passing-away; for no thing comes to be or passes
away, but is mixed together and dissociated from the things that are.
And thus they would be correct to call coming-to-be mixing-together
and passing-away dissociating” (59B17). What seem to be
generated objects (human beings, plants, animals, the moon, the stars)
are instead temporary mixtures of ingredients (such as earth, air,
fire, water, hair, flesh, blood, dense, dark, rare, bright, and so
on). Recent treatments of Anaxagoras (Marmodoro 2015) have suggested
that the ingredients are primarily powers that manifest themselves in
the mixtures
 produced.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#7" name="note-7">7</a>]</sup>
 The original state was universal mixture: “All things were
together, unlimited both in amount and in smallness, for the small,
too, was unlimited. And because all things were together, nothing was
evident” (59B1). This mixture is set into rotary motion by the
operation of Mind (<em>Nous</em> – B12, B13, B14; see
discussions in Laks 1993, Lesher 1995, Menn 1995, Curd 2007), a
separate cosmic entity that does not share in such mixture. As the
rotation spreads out through the unlimited mass of indistinguishably
intermingled ingredients, the rotation causes a winnowing or
separating effect, and the cosmos as we know it emerges from the
mixture. Moreover, not only <em>were</em> all things together, they
are <em>even now</em> all together, in a different way, despite the
differentiations now achieved. Everything is in everything (59B5, B6,
B11), in some proportions, however small or great – this is a
move to prevent even the appearance of coming-to-be from what-is-not.
</p>

<p>
Anaxagoras marks an important theoretical step in attributing the
motion of his ingredients to an independent, intelligent force
(although both Plato and Aristotle were disappointed that his theory
was not properly—from their point of view—teleological; on
this see Sedley 2007, Curd forthcoming). The rotation begun by Mind is
causally responsible for the formation of the heavens and the
activities of the great masses of the earth and the water on the
earth, as well as all meteorological phenomena. Insofar as the causes
of the operations of the heavens and the phenomena apparent to us from
day to day are the same at both the macro- and micro-level (the
rotations that cause the apparent motions of the stars are the same as
those that govern the cycles of weather and life and death on earth),
we can infer the nature of what is real from what is apparent
(Anaxagoras' scientific views are treated in Graham 2006 and 2013).
Although we do not perceive all things as being together, and the move
to the ultimate explanations is an inference, it is a legitimate one
(“owing to their [the senses’] feebleness, we are not able
to determine the truth” yet “appearances are a sight of
the unseen” 59B21 and 21a).</p>

<p>
A younger contemporary of Anaxagoras, Empedocles, who lived in Sicily,
also recognized the force of Parmenides' arguments against
coming-to-be and passing-away. (Empedocles also adopts Parmenides'
poetic meter in order to tell his story.) Empedocles proposes a cosmos
formed of the four roots (as he calls them), earth, water, air, and
fire along with the motive forces of Love and Strife. It is often
claimed that, for Empedocles, Love simply produces mixture and Strife
only causes separation. Empedocles' view is more complicated, for both
forces mix and separate. Love unites opposed (unlike) things by
pulling apart and then mixing these unlikes, while Strife sets unlikes
in opposition and segregates them, hence Strife mixes like with like.
Just as painters can produce fantastically lifelike scenes just by
mixing colors, so the operations of Love and Strife, using just the
four roots can produce “trees and men and women, and beasts and
birds and water-nourished fish, and long-lived gods best in
honors” (31B17). These are the things that Empedocles calls
“mortal,” and he even provides recipes. 31B73 tells how
Kypris (the goddess Aphrodite, i.e. love) fashions shapes (or kinds):
“she moistened earth in rain, and gave it to quick fire to
harden.” B96 gives a recipe for bones, while in B98 flesh and
blood have the same recipe (earth, water, air, and fire in equal
proportions), but differ in the refinement of the mixture. </p>

<p>
Like the other Presocratics, Empedocles has a cosmological theory, in
his case, an unending cycle involving the competition between Love and
Strife. Love overcomes the separating influence of Strife, bringing
together unlikes and so preventing the clinging together of likes. The
triumph of Love results in the Sphere, which is a complete mixture
because the four unlike roots are as mixed (integrated) as possible.
Strife breaks up the sphere by beginning to attract like to like and
so pulling the mixture apart, until, when it triumphs, there is
complete segregation of the roots. Love resists the separation of
unlikes and the clinging together of likes, by trying to keep unlike
things mixed. The cosmos as we know it is a result of intermediate
phases between the two extremes of the triumph of one of the
 forces.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#8" name="note-8">8</a>]</sup>
 </p>

<p>
Although Empedocles gives an account of the cosmos, cosmology is not
his sole interest. Both fragments and testimonia show his keen
attention to questions about perception and its role in knowledge, the
workings of the body, and psychology. Like the Pythagoreans,
Empedocles thought that how one lived was as important as one's
theoretical commitments (and that the two were intimately connected).
The ancient evidence seems to suggest that Empedocles was the author
of two works, commonly called in modern scholarship the
<em>Physics</em> and the <em>Purifications</em>, one cosmological and
the other ethico-religious. The relation between the two works has
been a matter of some controversy. In the 1990s new evidence from the
Strasbourg Papyrus showed unequivocally that the cosmological and
ethico-religious aspects of Empedocles' thought are inextricably
intertwined (Martin and Primavesi 1999, Primavesi 2008, Kingsley
1995), although commentators still disagree about whether this new
evidence supports the conclusion that there was a single poem
combining
 both.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#9" name="note-9">9</a>]</sup>
 The correct philosophical understanding of the physical world and the
correct way to live cannot be separated from one another in
Empedocles' thought (a similar attitude appears in Heraclitus); one
cannot fully understand the world without living
 correctly.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#10" name="note-10">10</a>]</sup>
 Like the Pythagorean, the Empedoclean way of life included dietary
restrictions and a story of transmigrating <em>daimōns</em> who
seem to have some kind of personal identity.</p>

<h2><a name="PreAto">8. Presocratic Atomism</a></h2>

<p>
The pluralism of Anaxagoras and Empedocles maintained the Eleatic
strictures on metaphysically acceptable basic entities (things that
are and must be just what they are) by adopting an irreducible
pluralism of stuffs meeting these standards that could pass on their
qualities to items constructed from them. Ancient atomism responded
more radically: what is real is an infinite number of solid,
uncuttable (<em>atomon</em>) units of matter. All atoms are made of
the same stuff (solid matter, in itself otherwise indeterminate),
differing from one another (according to Aristotle in Metaphysics
985b4-20=DK67A6) only in shape, position, arrangement. (Later sources
say that atoms differ in weight; this is certainly true for
post-Aristotelian atomism, but less likely for Presocratic atomism.)
In addition, the Presocratic atomists, Leucippus and Democritus
(Democritus was born in about 460 BCE in Abdera in Northern Greece,
shortly after Socrates was born in Athens), enthusiastically endorsed
the reality of the empty (or
 void).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#11" name="note-11">11</a>]</sup>
 The void is what separates atoms and allows for the differences noted
above (except weight, which could not be accounted for by void, since
void in an atom would make it divisible and, hence, not an atom)
(Sedley 1982; see also Sedley 2008). </p>

<p>
Like Anaxagoras, the atomists consider all phenomenal objects and
characteristics as emerging from the background mixture; in the case
of atomism, the mix of atoms and void (Wardy 1988). Everything is
constructed of atoms and void: the shapes of the atoms and their
arrangement with respect to each other (and the intervening void) give
physical objects their apparent characteristics. As Democritus says:
“By convention sweet and by convention bitter, by convention
hot, by convention cold, by convention color: in reality atoms and
void” (68B125 = B9). For example, Theophrastus says that the
flavors differ according to the shapes of the atoms that compose
various objects; thus “Democritus makes sweet that which is
round and quite large, astringent that which large, rough, polygonal
and not rounded” (<em>de Caus. Plant</em>. 6.1.6 = 68A129).
Simplicius reports that things composed of sharp and very fine atoms
in similar positions are hot and fiery; those composed of atoms with
the opposite character come to be cold and watery (<em>in Phys.</em>
36.3–6 = 67A14). Moreover, Theophrastus reports that the
atomists explain why iron is harder than lead but lighter; it is
harder because of the uneven arrangements of the atoms that make it
up, lighter because it contains more void than lead. Lead, on the
other hand, has less void than iron, but the even arrangement of the
atoms makes lead easier to cut or to bend (<em>de Sens.</em> 61-63 =
68A135). </p>

<p>
Adopting a strong distinction between appearance and reality, and
denying the accuracy of appearances, as we see him do in the above
quotation, Democritus was seen by some ancient sources (especially
Sextus Empiricus) as a sort of skeptic, yet the evidence is unclear.
It is true that Democritus is quoted as saying, “In truth we
know nothing; for truth is in the depths” (68B117). So for him,
the truth is not given in the appearances. Yet, even Sextus seems to
agree that Democritus allows for knowledge:</p>

<blockquote>
But in the <em>Rules</em> [Democritus] says that there are two kinds
of knowing, one through the senses and the other through the
understanding. The one through the understanding he calls genuine,
witnessing to its trustworthiness in deciding truth; the one through
the senses he names bastard, denying it steadfastness in the
discernment of what is true. He says in these words, “There are
two forms of knowing, one genuine and the other bastard. To the
bastard belong all these: sight, hearing, smell, taste, touch. The
other, the genuine, has been separated from this” [68B11]. Then
preferring the genuine to the bastard, he continues, saying,
“Whenever the bastard is no longer able to see more finely nor
hear nor smell nor taste nor perceive by touch, but something
finer…”
</blockquote>

<p>
Thus Sextus suggests that the evidence of the senses, when properly
interpreted by reason, can be taken as a guide to reality (the claim
that “appearances are a sight of the unseen” is attributed
to Democritus as well as to Anaxagoras). We just need to know how to
follow this guide, through proper reasoning, so as to reach the
truth—i.e., the theory of atoms and void (Lee 2005).</p>

<p>
In addition to fragments advancing these metaphysical and physical
doctrines, there are a number of ethical fragments attributed to
Democritus (but the question of authenticity looms large here);
although a passage reported in John Stobaeus seems to link moderation
and cheerfulness with small measured movements in the soul and says
that excess and deficiencies give rise to large movements (68B191), it
is unclear whether or how these claims are related to the metaphysical
aspects of atomism (Vlastos 1945 and 1946, Kahn 1985b). Democritus was
identified in antiquity with the idea of “good cheer”
(<em>euthumiē</em>) as the proper guiding objective in living
one's life. In this, as in other aspects of his philosophy, he may
have had some influence on the formation of Epicurus' philosophy a
century later.</p>

<h2><a name="DioApoSop">9. Diogenes of Apollonia and the Sophists</a></h2>

<p>
In the last part of the 5<sup>th</sup> century, Diogenes of Apollonia
(active after 440 BCE) revived and revised the Milesian system of
cosmology, claiming that “all the things that are are
alterations from the same thing and are the same thing” (64B2);
he identified this single basic substance with air, like Anaximenes
more than a century before (Graham 2006, Laks 2008, 2008a). Diogenes
takes care to give arguments for the reality and properties of his
basic principle. In B2 he says that only things that are alike can
affect one another. If there were a plurality of basic substances,
each differing in what Diogenes calls their “own proper
nature,” there could be no interaction between them. Yet the
evidence of the senses is clear: things mix and separate and interact
with one another. Thus, all things must be forms of some one single
thing. Like Anaxagoras, Diogenes claims that the cosmic system is
ordered by intelligence, and he argues that that “which
possesses intelligence (<em>noēsis</em>) is what human beings
call air” (B5). Humans and animals live by breathing air, and
are governed by it —in them air is both soul and intelligence,
or mind (B4). Moreover, Diogenes argues, air governs and rules all
things and is god (B5). Thus, like Anaxagoras, Diogenes has a theory
grounded in intelligence, although Diogenes is more fully committed to
teleological explanations, insofar as he states explicitly that
intelligence (<em>noēsis</em>) orders things in a good way (B3).
In presenting his arguments, Diogenes fulfills his own requirement for
a philosophical claim. In B1 he says, “In my opinion, anyone
beginning a <em>logos</em> (account) ought to present a starting
principle (<em>archē</em>) that is indisputable and a style that
is simple and stately.” He notes that his theory that air is
soul and intelligence “will have been made clearly evident in
this book” (B4). </p>

<p>
Theophrastus says that Diogenes was the last of the physical
philosophers, the <em>physiologoi</em>, or “inquirers into
nature,” as Aristotle called them; Diogenes Laertius gives that
title to Archelaus, saying that he was the teacher of Socrates
(<em>Lives</em> II.16-17). There was also another group of thinkers
active about this time: the Sophists. Many of our views about this
group have been shaped by Plato's aggressively negative assessment of
them: in his dialogues Plato expressly contrasts the genuine
philosopher, i.e., Socrates, with the Sophists, especially in their
role as teachers of young men growing into their maturity (youths at
the age when Socrates, too, engaged with them in his discussions).
Modern scholarship (Woodruff and Gagarin 2008, Kerferd 1981, Guthrie
1969) has shown the diversity of their views. They were not completely
uninterested in the theoretical problems that concerned others of the
Presocratics. Gorgias of Leontini questioned the possibility of the
certainty that Parmenides sought. In his <em>On Nature</em>, or <em>On
what-is-not</em>, Gorgias claims that nothing satisfies Parmenides'
requirements for what-is (Mansfeld 1985, Mourelatos 1987b, Palmer
1999, Caston 2002, Curd 2006). Protagoras, too, doubted the
possibility of the strong theoretical knowledge that the Presocratics
championed. The Sophists raised ethical and political questions: Does
law or convention ground what is right, or is it a matter of nature?
They traveled widely, sometimes serving as diplomats, and they were
both entertainers and teachers. They gave public displays of rhetoric
(this contrasts with Diogenes of Apollonia's comments about his book,
which seems to imply a more private
 enterprise)<sup>[<a href="notes.html#12" name="note-12">12</a>]</sup>
 and took on students, teaching both the art of rhetoric and the
skills necessary for succeeding in Greek political life. With the
Sophists, as with Socrates, interest in ethics and political thought
becomes a more prominent aspect of Greek philosophy.</p>

<h2><a name="PreLeg">10. The Presocratic Legacy</a></h2>

<p>
The range of Presocratic thought shows that the first philosophers
were not merely physicists (although they were certainly that). Their
interests extended to religious and ethical thought, the nature of
perception and understanding, mathematics, meteorology, the nature of
explanation, and the roles of matter, form, causal mechanisms, and
structure in the world. Almost all the Presocratics seemed to have
something to say about embryology, and fragments of Diogenes and
Empedocles show a keen interest in the structures of the body; the
overlap between ancient philosophy and ancient medicine is of growing
interest to scholars of early Greek thought (Longrigg 1963, van der
Eijk 2008). Recent discoveries, such as the Derveni Papyrus (Betegh
2004, Kouremenos et al. 2006, Janko 2001, Laks and Most 1997), show
that interest in and knowledge of the early philosophers was not
necessarily limited to a small audience of rationalistic
intellectuals. They passed on many of what later became the basic
concerns of philosophy to Plato and Aristotle, and ultimately to the
whole tradition of Western philosophical thought.</p>
