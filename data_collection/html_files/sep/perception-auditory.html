<h1>Auditory Perception</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Thu May 14, 2009; substantive revision Thu Apr 24, 2014</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>

Auditory perception raises a host of challenging philosophical 
questions. What do we hear? What are the objects of hearing? What is 
the content and phenomenology of audition? Is hearing spatial? How 
does audition differ from vision and other sense modalities? How does
the perception of sounds differ from that of colors and ordinary 
objects? This entry presents the main debates in this developing area
and discusses promising avenues for future inquiry. It discusses the 
motivation for exploring non-visual modalities, how audition bears on
theorizing about perception, and questions concerning the objects, 
contents, varieties, and bounds of auditory perception.</p>

<h2><a name="Introduction">1. Other Modalities and the Philosophy of Perception</a></h2>

<p>

The philosophy of sounds and auditory perception is one emerging area
of the philosophy of perception that reaches beyond vision for 
insights about the nature, objects, contents, and varieties of 
perception. This entry characterizes central issues in the 
philosophy of auditory perception, many of which bear upon theorizing about 
perception more generally, and it mentions outstanding questions and 
promising future areas for inquiry in this developing literature. 
Before beginning the substantive discussion of audition itself, it is
worthwhile to discuss the motivation and rationale for this kind of 
work.</p>

<p>

Philosophical thinking about perception has focused predominantly on
vision. The philosophical puzzle of perception and its proposed
solutions have been shaped by a concern for visual experience and
visual illusions. Questions and proposals about the nature of
perceptual content have been framed and evaluated in visual terms, and
detailed accounts of what we perceive frequently address just the
visual case. Vision informs our understanding of perception's
epistemological role and of its role in guiding action. It is not a
great exaggeration to say that much of the philosophy of perception
translates roughly as philosophy of visual perception.</p>

<p>

Recently, however, other perceptual modalities have attracted
attention. In addition to auditory perception and the experience of
sound, touch and tactile awareness have generated philosophical
interest concerning, for instance, the tactile and proprioceptive
experience of space, the objects of touch, whether contact is required
for touch, and whether distinct modalities detect pressure, heat, and
pain (see, e.g., O'Shaughnessy 1989, Martin 1993, Scott 2001,
Fulkerson 2013). The unique phenomenology of olfaction and smells has
been used to argue that vision is atypical in supporting the
transparency of perceptual experience (Lycan 2000, 282; cf. Batty
2010) and that perceptual objectivity does not require spatiality
(Smith 2002, ch 5). Lycan (2000) even suggests that the philosophy of
perception would have taken a different course had it focused upon
olfaction instead of vision (see also Batty 2011).</p>

<p>

This kind of work is philosophically interesting in its own right.
But it is also worthwhile because theorizing about perception commonly
aims to address general questions about perception, rather than
concerns specific to vision. Hope for a comprehensive and general
understanding of perception rests upon extending and testing claims,
arguments, and theories beyond vision. One might view work on
non-visual modalities as filling out the particulars required for a
thoroughly detailed account of perceiving that applies not just to
vision but across the modalities. At least three approaches might be
adopted, with potential for increasingly revisionist outcomes.</p>

<p>

First, one might take work on non-visual modalities as
<i>translating</i> what we have learned from the visual case into
terms that apply to other modalities. This approach is relatively
conservative. It assumes that vision is representative or paradigmatic
and that we have a good understanding of perception that is derived
from the case of vision. One example of this kind of approach would be
to develop an account of the representational content of auditory
experience.</p>

<p>

Second, considering other modalities might <i>extend</i> our
vision-based understanding of perception. Non-visual cases might draw
attention to new kinds of phenomena that are missing from or not
salient in vision. If so, a vision-based account of perception is
satisfactory as far as it goes, but it leaves out critical pieces. For
example, speech perception, multimodal perception, and flavor
perception might involve novel kinds of perceptual phenomena absent
from the visual case.</p>

<p>

Third, considering other modalities might <i>challenge</i>
vision-based claims about perception. If falsifying evidence is
discovered in non-visual cases, then theorizing beyond vision may
force revision of general claims about perception that are supported
by vision. For example, if olfactory experience is not diaphanous, the
transparency thesis for perceptual experience fails.</p>

<p>

Finally, we might attempt to determine whether any <i>unified</i>
account exists that applies generally to all of the perceptual
modalities. We can ask this question either at the level of quite
specific claims, such as those concerning the objects of perception or
the nature and structure of content. We can ask it about the
relationships among perceiving, believing, and acting. Or we can ask
it about the general theory of necessary and sufficient conditions for
perceiving. Some philosophers, impressed by their findings concerning
non-visual modalities, express skepticism whether a unified theory
exists (e.g., Martin 1992).</p>

<p>

Whatever the approach, extending our knowledge about perception beyond
the visual requires systematic attention to individual modalities as
well as careful accounting in order to determine how the results bear
on general questions about perception. Whatever the outcome, audition
is a rich new subject matter in its own right, and developing this
subject matter is crucial to our overall understanding of
perception.</p>

<h2><a name="Objects">2. The Objects of Auditory Perception</a></h2>

<p>

What do we hear? One way to address this question concerns the 
<i>objects</i> of auditory perception.</p>

<h3><a name="Sounds">2.1 Sounds</a></h3>

<p>

In the first instance, it is plausible that <i>sounds</i> are what we
hear. Sounds are <i>direct</i> or <i>immediate</i> objects of auditory
perception.</p>

<p>

What are sounds? Sounds traditionally have been counted with colors,
smells, and tastes as <i>secondary</i>, <i>sensible</i>, or
<i>sensory</i> <i>qualities</i> (see, e.g., Locke 1689/1975, Pasnau
1999, 2000). Recently, however, it has been proposed that sounds are
<i>individuals</i> to which sensible features are attributed. In
particular, several philosophers recently have proposed that sounds
are public, distally-located, event-like individuals (Casati and Dokic
1994, 2005, O'Callaghan 2007, Matthen 2010).</p>

 <p>

Four questions about audition's objects define the debate and 
constrain theories of sound (see also the entry on
 <a href="../sounds/">sounds</a>,
 for extensive discussion).</p>

<h4><a name="Public">2.1.1 Private or Public?</a></h4>

<p>

Are sounds private or public? Maclachlan (1989) argues that the sounds
we hear are <i>sensations</i> (rather than, for instance, the pressure
waves that cause auditory experiences).  Such sensations are internal
and private, and we experience them directly, or without apparent
mediation. On Maclachlan's account, we hear the ordinary things and
happenings that are the <i>sources</i> of sounds only
<i>indirectly</i>, by means of inference from auditory data.</p>

<p> Maclachlan's story is noteworthy partly because he uses hearing
and sounds to motivate a general claim about perception. He claims
that what seems perfectly intuitive and obvious in the case of sounds
and hearing—that something other than material objects are the
direct objects of hearing; that the direct objects of audition are
internal; and that we indirectly hear things in the world by hearing
their sounds—helps us to discover what is true of all
perception. According to Maclachlan, for instance, seeing involves
direct awareness of sensations of patterns of light, while surfaces
and ordinary objects figure only indirectly and thanks to inference
among the intentional objects of sight. The case of sounds and
audition is important because it reveals that perceiving involves
awareness of sensations in the first instance, and of the external
world only indirectly.</p>

<p>

Maclachlan's description of sounds and auditory experience has some
attractions. First, sounds are among the things we hear. And sounds
are among the direct or immediate objects of audition in the
relatively innocuous sense that hearing a sound does not seem to
require hearing as of something else. Hearing a collision, on the
other hand, may seem to require awareness as of a sound. Furthermore,
sounds are unlike the ordinary material objects (e.g., bottles and
staplers) we see. You cannot reach out and grab a sound, or determine
its temperature. Instead, sounds may strike us as byproducts or
effects of such ordinary things and their transactions. Sounds result
from activities or interactions of material bodies and thus are
experienced as distinct or independent from them (cf. Nudds
2001). Nevertheless, audition does afford some variety of awareness of
the sources of sounds, or at least provides information about
them.</p>

<p>

However, the claim that sounds are sensations is unattractive.  Good
reasons suggest that sounds are public rather than private, even if
sounds are not identical with ordinary objects and events such as
clothespins and collisions. Suppose I am near the stage in a hall
listening to some music, and that I have a headache.  It is a
confusion to think you could feel my headache, but I assume you hear
the sounds I hear.  Suppose I move to the back of the hall, and the
headache then gets better. My experience of the sounds of the music
differs once I am at the back of the room, and my experience of the
headache differs. The sound of the music itself need not differ (the
musicians could make the same sounds), but the headache itself
changes. The sounds can continue once I leave the room, but if I stop
experiencing the headache, it is gone. Moreover, the notion of an
unfelt headaches is puzzling, but it makes good sense to say that a
tree makes a sound when it falls in the woods without being
heard. Finally, tinnitus, or ringing of the ears, is an illusory or
hallucinatory experience as of a sound, but there are no illusory
headaches.</p>

<p>

This suggests that audition does not provide <i>special</i> reasons to
believe that the objects of perception are private sensations.
Sounds, construed as objects of auditory perception, plausibly inhabit
the public world. (See the section
 <a href="#Spatial">3.1 Spatial Hearing</a> 
 for further discussion.)</p>

<h4><a name="Distal">2.1.2 Proximal or Distal?</a></h4>

<p>

Are sounds proximal or distal? The customary science-based view holds
that sounds are pressure waves that travel through a medium. On this
account, sounds are caused by objects and events such as collisions,
and sounds cause auditory experiences. However, sounds are not
auditorily experienced to travel through the surrounding medium as
waves do. Thus, if sounds are waves, then the sounds we hear may be
proximal, located at the ear of the hearer.</p>

<p> Alternatively, some have argued that audition presents sounds as
being located in some direction at a distance (Pasnau 1999,
O'Callaghan 2007, ch. 3, 2010). On such an account, sounds commonly
appear auditorily to be in the neighborhood of their sources and
thereby furnish useful information about the locations of those
sources. The sound of the drumming across the street seems to come
from across the street but does not seem audibly to travel. When
sounds do appear to fill a room, sound seems located all
around. Sounds that seem to “bounce” around a room appear
intermittently at different locations rather than as traveling
continuously from place to place.  Experiencing a missile-like sound
speeding towards your ears illustrates the contrast with ordinary
hearing (O'Callaghan 2007, 35). Sounds, according to this conception,
ordinarily appear to have distal locations and to remain stationary
relative to their sources.</p>

 <p>

If sounds are not usually experienced to travel, then unless auditory
experience is illusory with respect to the apparent locations of
sounds, sounds themselves do not travel. Sounds thus are not identical
with and do not supervene upon the waves, since waves travel (Pasnau
1999). Several philosophers have argued on these and related grounds
that sounds are located distally, near their sources (Pasnau 1999,
Casati and Dokic 2005, O'Callaghan 2007). On this view, pressure waves
bear information about sounds and are the proximal causes of auditory
experiences, but are not identical with sounds.</p>

<p>

One might object by resisting the phenomenological claim that
we experience sounds as distally located, for instance by suggesting 
that audition is aspatial, or that audition is spatial but sound 
<i>sources</i> rather than sounds are auditorily localized (see 
section 
 <a href="#Spatial">3.1 Spatial Hearing</a>
 for further discussion). Or, one might accept some measure of 
illusion. Another possibility is that we experience only a small
subset of the locations sounds occupy during their lifetimes (for
instance, while at their sources), and simply fail to experience where
they are at other times. This avoids ascribing illusion. Finally,
Fowler (2013) argues indirectly on the basis of echoes against distal
theories of sound.</p>

<h4><a name="Individuals">2.1.3 Properties or Individuals?</a></h4>

<p>

Are sounds properties or individuals? Among both proximal and distal 
theories, disagreement exists concerning the ontological category to 
which sounds belong. Philosophers traditionally have understood 
sounds as properties—either as sensible or secondary qualities,
or as the categorical or physical properties that ground powers to 
affect subjects. Commonly, sounds are attributed to the medium that 
intervenes between sources and perceivers. More recently, however, 
some distal theorists have argued that sounds are properties of what 
we ordinarily understand as sound sources—bells and whistles 
<i>have</i> or <i>possess</i> rather than <i>make</i> or 
<i>produce</i> sounds. Pasnau (1999), for instance, claims that 
sounds are transient properties that are identical with or supervene 
upon vibrations of objects. Kulvicki (2008) argues against transience
in an attempt to subsume sounds to the model of colors, and claims 
that sounds are persistent, stable dispositional properties of 
objects to vibrate in response to being “thwacked”. He 
distinguishes “having” a stable sound from 
“making” a sound on some occasion (manifesting the stable
disposition). This account implies that sounds sometimes make sounds 
they do not have, and that they have sounds when silent.</p>

<p>

One might ask property theorists whether events such as collisions 
and strummings, rather than objects, bear sounds. A more serious 
challenge comes from those who argue that sounds are 
<i>individuals</i> rather than properties. Several arguments support 
this understanding. First, empirical work on <i>auditory scene 
analysis</i> suggests that one primary task of audition is to carve 
up the acoustic scene into distinct sounds, each of which may possess
its own pitch, timbre, and loudness (Bregman 1990). Multiple distinct
sounds with different audible attributes can be heard simultaneously.
An analog of Jackson's (1977, see also Clark 2000) <i>many 
properties</i> problem thus arises for audition since feature 
awareness alone cannot explain the bundling or grouping of audible 
attributes into distinct sounds. Such bundling or grouping of audible
features suggests that sounds are perceptible individuals to which 
these features are attributed.</p>

<p>

Furthermore, the temporal characteristics of experienced sounds 
suggest that sounds are not simple qualities. Sounds audibly seem to 
persist through time and to survive change. A particular sound, such 
as that of an emergency siren, might begin high-pitched and loud and 
end low-pitched and soft. This suggests that sounds are individuals 
that bear different features at different times, rather than sensible
qualities (cf. Cohen 2009).</p>

 <p>

Several responses to these arguments are available. One might argue 
that sounds are complex properties, such as pitch-timbre-loudness 
complexes, instantiated at a time. To account for feature binding, 
one might hold that such complex properties are ascribed to ordinary 
objects such as bells and whistles. Or, one might hold that they are 
particularized properties, such as tropes. To accommodate sounds that
survive change through time, a property account could hold that 
sounds are yet more complex properties that have patterns of change 
built into their identity conditions. Any such view differs a great 
deal from the familiar secondary or sensible quality view pioneered 
by Locke. Pitch, timbre, and loudness are better candidates for 
simple sensible features in audition (see section 
 <a href="#Qualities">3.2 Audible Qualities</a>).
 </p>

<h4><a name="Events">2.1.4 Objects or Events?</a></h4>

<p>

If sounds are individuals, are they object-like or event-like
individuals? Intuitively, the material objects we see are capable of
existing wholly at any given moment, and all that is required to
perceptually recognize such individuals is present at a moment. On the
other hand, event-like individuals occupy time and need not exist
wholly at any given moment. Their individuation and recognition
frequently appeal to patterns of features over time. Event-like
individuals intuitively comprise temporal parts, while object-like
individuals intuitively do not. The issue here is not the truth of
endurantism or perdurantism as an account of the persistence of
objects or events. Instead, the issue concerns a difference in how we
perceptually individuate, experience, and recognize individuals.</p>

<p>

No contemporary philosopher has yet claimed that sounds are objects
<i>in the ordinary sense</i>. Those who argue that sounds are
individuals commonly point out that sounds not only persist and
survive change (as do ordinary material objects), but also
<i>require</i> time to occur or unfold. It is difficult to imagine an
instantaneous sound, or one that lacks duration. Sounds are not
commonly treated as existing wholly at a given moment during their
duration. Indeed, the identities of many common sounds are tied to
patterns of change in qualities through time. The sound of an
ambulance siren differs from that of a police siren precisely because
the two differ in patterns of qualitative change through time. The
sound of the spoken word ‘team’ differs from that of
‘meat’ because each instantiates a common set of audible
qualities in a different temporal pattern. These considerations
support the view that sounds are event-like individuals (see Casati
and Dokic 1994, 2005, Scruton 1997, O'Callaghan 2007, Matthen
2010).</p>

<p>This may bear on debates about persistence in the following
way. Differences in the intuitive plausibility of endurantism and
perdurantism may be grounded in facts about perception. In particular,
vision may treat objects as persisting by enduring or being wholly
present at each time at which they exist, while audition may treat its
objects as persisting by perduring or having temporal parts. This may
stem from differences in perceptual organization. For instance,
displaying a visible property profile at a time may suffice for being
a visual object of a given sort, while being an audible object of a
given sort may require displaying an audible property profile over
time.</p>

<h3><a name="Auditory">2.2 Auditory Objects</a></h3>

 <p>

Though most philosophers construe sounds either as properties or as
event-like individuals (see section <a href="#Sounds">2.1 Sounds</a>),
much recent discussion among psychologists has concerned <i>auditory
objects</i> (see, e.g., Kubovy and Van Valkenburg 2001, Griffiths and
Warren 2004). The target of such discussion is not simply audition's
<i>intentional</i> objects or <i>proper</i> (specific to audition)
objects. The intended analogy is with <i>visual objects</i>. Talk of
auditory objects gestures at the visual processes involved in
perceptually discriminating, attentively tracking, recognizing and
categorizing ordinary material objects. What justifies talk of
<i>object perception</i> in audition?</p>

<h4><a name="OP">2.2.1 Object Perception in Audition</a></h4>

<p>

First of all, humans typically do not auditorily perceive
three-dimensional, bounded material objects <i>as such</i>, though it
is plausible to think we visually perceive them. Hearing does not
resolve the edges, boundaries, and filled volumes in space that I see,
and I do not hear audible items to complete spatially behind occluders
as do visible surfaces of objects. If perceiving a three-dimensional
object requires awareness of its edges, boundaries, and extension,
perhaps in order to discriminate it from its surroundings, humans
typically do not auditorily perceive such objects.</p>

<p>

Nevertheless, striking and illuminating parallels do exist between 
the perceptual processes and experiences that take place in vision 
and audition. Such parallels may warrant talk of object perception in
a more general sense that is common to both vision and audition (and 
perhaps touch, though I don't pursue that here).</p>

 <p>

Perceiving objects requires parsing a perceptual scene into distinct
<i>units</i> that one can attend to and distinguish from each other
and from a background. In vision, bounded, cohesive collections of
surfaces that are extended in space and that persist through time play
this role (see, e.g., Spelke 1990, Nakayama et al. 1995, Leslie et
al. 1998, Scholl 2001, Matthen 2005). In audition, as in vision,
multiple distinct perceptible individuals might exist simultaneously,
and each might persist and survive change (see the discussion of
auditory scene analysis in section <a href="#Sounds">2.1 Sounds</a>).
A critical difference, however, is that while vision's objects are
extended in space, and are individuated and recognized primarily in
virtue of spatial characteristics, audible individuals are extended in
time, and are perceptually individuated and recognized primarily in
virtue of pitch and temporal characteristics (see, e.g., Bregman 1990,
Kubovy and Van Valkenburg 2001). For instance, audible individuals
have temporal edges and boundaries, and boundary elements can belong
only to a single audible individual. They also are susceptible to
figure-ground effects over time. One can, for instance, shift
attention among continuous audible individuals that differ in
pitch. Furthermore, they are susceptible to completion effects over
time in much the same way that visible objects are perceptually
completed in space. Seeing a single visible region to continue behind
a barrier is analogous to hearing a sound stream to continue through
masking noise, which may take place even when there is no
corresponding signal (Bregman 1990, 28). Finally, multiple distinct,
discrete audible individuals, such as the temporally bounded notes in
a tune, can form audible <i>streams</i> that comprise a single
perceptible unit. Such streams are subject to figure-ground shifts,
and, like collections of surfaces, they can be attentively tracked
through changes to their features and to one's perspective. Though
such complex audible individuals include sounds, they comprise
temporally unified collections of sounds and silence that are
analogous to spatially complex visible objects, such as tractors.</p>

<p>

Such audible individuals are temporally extended and bounded, serve as
the locus for auditory attention, prompt completion effects, and are
subject to figure-ground distinctions in pitch space. For these
reasons, the auditory processes involved in their perception parallel
those involved in the visual perception of ordinary three-dimensional
objects. The parallels suggest a shared sense in which vision and
audition involve a more general form of object perception (see, e.g.,
Kubovy and Van Valkenburg 2001, Scholl 2001, Griffiths and Warren
2004, O'Callaghan 2008a, Matthen 2010).</p>

<h4><a name="WAO">2.2.2 What is an Auditory Object?</a></h4>

<p>

What is the shared sense in which both visible and audible individuals
deserve to be called ‘objects’? Kubovy and Van Valkenburg
(2001, 2003) define objecthood in terms of figure-ground segregation,
which requires perceptual grouping. They propose the <i>theory of
indispensable attributes</i> as an account of the necessary conditions
on perceptual grouping (see also Kubovy 1981). Indispensable
attributes for a modality are those without which perceptual
numerosity is impossible. They claim that while space and time are
indispensable attributes for vision (and color is not), pitch and time
are indispensable attributes for auditory objects. Though they are
more skeptical about whether audition parallels vision, Griffiths and
Warren (2004) sympathize with a figure-ground characterization but
suggest a working notion of an auditory object defined in terms of
“an acoustic experience that produces a two-dimensional image
with frequency and time dimensions” (Griffiths and Warren 2004,
891).</p>

<p>

O'Callaghan (2008a) proposes that 
both visible and audible objects are mereologically complex 
individuals, though their mereology differs in 
noteworthy respects. While vision's objects possess a spatial 
mereology and are individuated and tracked in terms of spatial 
features, audition's objects have a temporal mereology and are 
individuated and tracked in terms of both pitch and temporal 
characteristics. Discussion of auditory objects thus draws attention to 
two roles that space plays in vision. First, there is the role of 
space in determining the structure internal to visible objects, which
facilitates identifying and recognizing visible objects. Second, 
space serves as the external structure among visible objects, and is 
critical in distinguishing objects from each other. In audition, time
plays a role similar to space in vision in determining the structure 
internal to auditory objects. Pitch, on the other hand, serves as an 
external structural framework, along with space, that helps to 
distinguish among audible individuals.</p>

<p>Why is it useful to perceive such individuals in audition? One 
promising account is that they provide useful information about the 
happenings that produce sounds. Carving the acoustic world into 
mereologically complex individuals informs us about what is going on 
in the extra-acoustic environment. It provides ecologically 
significant information about what the furniture is doing, rather 
than just how it is arranged. It is one thing to perceive a tree; it 
is another to hear that it is falling behind you.</p>

<p> Discussion of auditory objects and accounts of their nature and
perception is new among philosophers (see, e.g., O'Callaghan 2008a,
and essays in Bullot and Egré 2010, including Matthen 2010, Nudds
2010). This area is ripe for philosophical contributions.</p>

<h3><a name="Sources">2.3 Sound Sources</a></h3>

<p>

Sounds are among the objects of audition. Plausibly, so are complex,
temporally extended individuals composed of sounds. Do we hear
anything else? Reflection <i>suggests</i> we hear things beyond sounds
and sound complexes. In hearing sounds, one may seem to experience the
backfiring of the car or the banging of the drum. One might hold that
a primary part of audition's function is to reveal <i>sound
sources</i>, the things and happenings that make sounds.</p>

<h4><a name="HearSources">2.3.1 Do Humans Hear Sound Sources?</a></h4>

<p>

If sounds were internal sensations or sense-data, then, as Maclachlan
(1989) observes, we would hear sound sources only indirectly, in an 
epistemological sense, perhaps thanks to something akin to inference.
Acquiring beliefs about the environment would require mediation by 
propositions connecting experienced internal sounds with 
environmental causes.</p>

<p>

If, however, sounds are properties attributed either to ordinary 
objects, as Pasnau (1999) and Kulvicki (2008) hold, or to events, 
then hearing a tuba or the playing of a tuba might only require 
hearing its sounds. Perceptually ascribing such audible attributes to
their sources might ground epistemically unmediated awareness of 
tubas or their playings.</p>

<p>

However, the individuals to which audible attributes are perceptually
attributed need not be identical with ordinary objects or
events. Instead, audible attributes may belong in the first instance
to sounds. Sounds plausibly are distinct from ordinary or
extra-acoustic individuals (O'Callaghan 2007, 2011). Suppose then that
one could not hear an ordinary object without there existing an
audible sound, as well as that sounds can mislead about their sources
(it might sound like drumming but be hammering).</p>

<p>

Given this, forming beliefs about ordinary things and happenings
connected with sounds might seem to require inference, association, or
some otherwise cognitive process, and so awareness of a sound source
might appear to always involve more than perceptual awareness.
According to such an account, awareness of environmental things and
happenings thanks to audition is epistemically mediated by awareness
as of sounds and auditory objects, but does not itself constitute
auditory perceptual awareness as of those things and happenings. You
are inclined to think you hear the source because your representing or
being aware of it co-occurs with, but is no more than a downstream
consequence triggered by, your auditory experience.</p>

<p>

Such an account is not wholly satisfactory. First, the phenomenology
of audition suggests something stronger than indirect, epistemically
mediated awareness of things such as collisions or guitar strummings
or lions roaring. Reflection suggests auditory awareness <i>as of</i>
collisions, strummings, and lions. Second, the capacity to refer
demonstratively to such things and events on auditory grounds also
suggests genuine perceptual awareness of them. Third, we commonly
perceptually individuate sounds in terms of their apparent sources,
and our taxonomy reflects this. “What did you hear?”
“I heard paper ripping,” or, “The sound of a
dripping faucet.” We distinguish two quite similar rattles once
we hear one as of a muffler clamp and the other as of a loose
fender. Furthermore, characterizing certain audible features and
explaining perceptual constancy effects for them requires appeal to
sound sources. Handel says of timbre: “At this point, no known
acoustic invariants can be said to underlie timbre... The cues that
determine timbre quality are interdependent because all are determined
by the method of sound production and the physical construction of the
instrument” (Handel 1995, 441). Explaining loudness
constancy—why moving to the back of the room does not change how
loudly the lecturer seems to speak—appeals to facts about the
sources of sounds (Zahorik and Wightman 2001). Auditory processing
proceeds in accordance with natural constraints concerning
characteristics of sound sources, and information concerning sources
shapes how auditory experiences are organized. This is to say that
processes responsible for auditory experience proceed as if acoustic
information is information about sound sources. Finally,
audition-guided action supports the claim that we hear such things and
events. Turning to look toward the source of a sound or ducking out of
the way of something we hear to be approaching—behaviors guided
by auditory experience—would make little sense if we heard only
sounds. In the first place, these reasons ground a case for thinking
that auditory perceptual experience does not strictly end with sounds
and auditory objects. In particular, awareness as of a source, even if
dependent upon awareness as of a sound, may be constitutive of one's
auditory perceptual experience.</p>

<p>

The main barrier to an alternative is that the relation between sounds
and ordinary things or happenings is commonly understood as
<i>causal</i>. Awareness as of an effect does not itself typically
furnish epistemically unmediated awareness of its cause. Seeing smoke
isn't seeing fire. The right sort of dependence between
characteristics of the experience and the cause is not apparent, and
awareness as of an effect does not by itself ground perceptual
demonstratives concerning the cause. The metaphysical indirectness of
the causal relation appears to block epistemic directness (see
O'Callaghan 2011a for further discussion).</p>

<h4><a name="Mereology">2.3.2 The Mereology of Sounds and Sources</a></h4>

<p>

Is there another explanatory route? Suppose that instead of a causal
relation, we understand the relationship between sounds and sources
<i>mereologically</i>, or as one of part to whole (see O'Callaghan
2011a). Parthood frequently does ground perceptual awareness. For
instance, seeing distinct parts of a surface interrupted by an
occluder leads to perceptual experience as of a single surface
(imagine seeing a dog behind a picket fence). Seeing the facing
surfaces of a cube affords awareness as of a cube, and we can
attentively track that same cube as it rotates and reveals different
surfaces. Suppose, then, that a sound is an event-like individual
(recall, property accounts escape the worry). This event is part of a
more encompassing event, such as a collision or the playing of a
trumpet, that occurs in the environment and that includes the
sound. So, the typical horse race includes the sounds, and you might
auditorily perceive the racing in hearing some of its proper parts:
the sounds. More specifically, you may hear the galloping thanks to
hearing the sounds it includes. You may fail to hear certain parts of
the racing event, such as the jockey's glance back after crossing the
wire, but you also fail to see parts of the race, such as the misstep
of the horse in second place. If the sounds are akin to the audible
“profile” of the event, analogous to the visible surfaces
of objects and visible parts of events, you might then enjoy auditory
awareness as of the galloping of the horses in virtue of your
awareness as of the sounds of the hooves. The sound is not identical
with the galloping, and it is not just a property or a causal
byproduct of the galloping. It is a part of a particular event of
galloping. The metaphysical relation of part to whole, in contrast to
that between effect and cause, might ground the sort of epistemically
unmediated awareness of interest (cf. Nakayama et al.  1995,
Bermúdez 2000, Noë 2004). Auditory perceptual awareness as
of the whole may occur thanks to experiencing the part.</p>

<p>

One objection is that this mereological account of the relation
between sounds and sources cannot account for hearing ordinary
<i>objects</i> by hearing their sounds. You could not strictly hear a
tuba by hearing its sound because a tuba is not an event of which a
sound is a part. However, the sound is part of the event of playing
the tuba, and the tuba is a participant in that playing. So, though
you are not aware as of a tuba, you are aware as of an event that
involves a tuba. That perhaps is enough to explain talk of hearing
tubas and to assuage the worry.</p>

<p>

Another more serious objection contends that the events we seem to
hear are ones that do not constitutively involve sounds or that might
have taken place without sounds. For instance, we hear the collision,
but the collision is something that could have occurred in a vacuum
and not made a sound. If so, the collision and the sound differ and
the collision does not strictly include a sound. The collision
therefore must have made the sound as a causal byproduct. This
suggests that, strictly speaking, you could not hear that very
collision event (since it causes the sound). The best response is to
bite the bullet and accept that events that do occur or that could
occur in vacuums cannot be heard since they include no sounds. This is
not so bad, since you could hear a different, more encompassing event
that includes a sound (along with a collision).  Alternatively, one
might say the very same event that occurs in a vacuum also could occur
in air, but that it would have involved a sound had it occurred in
air. In that case, one can only hear such events when they occur in
air and include a sound. The choice depends upon one's metaphysics of
events. In either case, it seems reasonable that token events that do
not include sounds are inaudible.</p>

<p> Casati et al. (2013) sidestep some of these concerns by rejecting
the distinction between sounds and events that are typically
understood as sound sources. They propose to “Ockhamize”
the “event sources” of sounds by identifying sounds with
events such as collisions and vibrations. The sound just is the
collision or the vibrating, whether or not it occurs in air. This
account implies that sounds could exist in vacuums.</p>

<p>

What hinges on the debate about hearing sources? The first upshot is 
epistemological and concerns the nature of the justification for 
empirical beliefs grounded in perceptual experience. The evidential 
status of beliefs about what one perceptually experiences differs 
from that of beliefs about what is causally responsible for what one 
perceptually experiences. The second upshot concerns the relation 
between audition and certain actions. If we hear only sounds and 
auditory objects, what appears to be effortless, auditorily guided 
action to avoid or orient toward sound sources requires another 
explanation (because sounds are invisible and usually do no harm). 
Finally, it impacts how we understand the adaptive significance of 
audition. Did audition evolve so as to furnish awareness of sounds 
alone, while leaving their environmental significance to 
extra-perceptual cognition, or did it evolve so as to furnish 
perceptual responsiveness to the sources of sounds?</p>

<h2><a name="Contents">3. The Contents of Auditory Perception</a></h2>

<p>

Another way to address the question, “What do we hear?” 
concerns the <i>contents</i> of auditory perception. Two topics are especially  
noteworthy in the context of related debates about vision and its 
contents. The first concerns the whether audition has spatial 
content. The second concerns the perception of audible qualities.</p>

<h3><a name="Spatial">3.1 Spatial Hearing</a></h3>

<p>

One topic where the contrast between vision and audition has been 
thought to be particularly philosophically significant concerns 
space. Vision is a robustly spatial perceptual modality. Vision 
furnishes awareness of space and spatial features. Some claim vision 
has an inherently spatial structure, or, further, that vision's 
spatial structure is a necessary condition on being visually aware of
things <i>as</i> independent from oneself.</p>

<p>

Hearing also provides information about space—humans learn 
about space on the basis of hearing. If audition represents space or 
spatial features, a natural account of being so informed follows. We 
might form beliefs about spatial features of environments on the 
basis of auditory perceptual experiences simply by accepting or 
endorsing what is apparent in those experiences.</p> 

<p>

But learning about spatial features on the basis of audition and
audition's bearing information about space both are consistent with
entirely aspatial auditory phenomenology. For instance, volume might
bear information about distance, and differences in volume at the two
ears might bear information about direction. In that case, audition
bears information about space, and learning about space on the basis
of audition is possible, but it does not follow that auditory
experience is spatial or that audition represents space.</p>

<h4><a name="Skepticism">3.1.1 Skepticism about Spatial Audition</a></h4>

<p>

Notably, a tradition of skepticism about audition's spatiality exists
in philosophy. Certainly, our capacity to glean information about 
space is less acute in audition than in vision. Vision reveals 
fine-grained spatial details, such as patterns and textures, that 
audition cannot convey. But philosophers who are skeptical about 
spatial audition are not just concerned about a difference in spatial
<i>acuity</i> between audition and vision. Malpas says of the 
expression, ‘the location of sound’:</p>

<blockquote> I do not mean by ‘location’
‘locality’, but ‘the act of locating’, and by
‘the act of locating’ I do not mean ‘the act of
establishing in a place’, but ‘the act of discovering the
place of’. Even so ‘location’ is misleading, because
it implies that there is such a thing as discovering the place of
sounds. Since sounds do not have places there is no such act. (Malpas
1965, 131)</blockquote>

<p>

O'Shaughnessy states, “…We absolutely never immediately 
perceive sounds to be <i>at</i> any place. (Inference from auditory 
data being another thing)” (O'Shaughnessy 2002, 446). The claim
is that, in contrast to visible objects, audible sounds 
are not experienced as having locations. Rather, we determine the 
places of sounds and sources from acoustic features, such as loudness
and interaural differences, that bear information about distance and 
direction. We do not auditorily experience spatial features.</p>

<p>

This debate, and the purported contrast between vision and audition,
has consequences for perceptual theorizing. One route to the
conclusion that hearing sounds is auditory awareness of sensations
involves denying that audition satisfies spatial prerequisites on
experiencing sounds as objective or public. For instance, Maclachlan
(1989) claims that audition's phenomenology—in particular, its
aspatial phenomenology—provides reasons to think sounds are
sensations. Comparing sounds with pains, which we readily recognize as
sensations, he says, “[A]lthough the sounds we hear are just as
much effects produced in us as are the pains produced by pins and
mosquitoes, <i>there is no variety in the location of these
effects</i> [the sounds]. Because of the lack of contrast, we are not
even aware that the sounds we hear are bodily sensations”
(Maclachlan 1989, 31, my emphasis). Maclachlan means that, in contrast
even to the case of pains, which are felt at different bodily
locations, sounds are not experienced to be at differing locations,
and so we are not even inclined to recognize that they are bodily
sensations. Maclachlan then suggests that we <i>associate</i> sounds
with things and happenings outside the body rather than appreciate
that they are effects in us. Given the lack of spatial
<i>variation</i> among experienced sounds, we projectively associate
sounds with distal sources. This explanation assumes that experienced
sounds exhibit no audibly apparent spatial variation: sounds seem
located at the ears or lack apparent location altogether. Denying that
auditory experiences present sounds at varying locations beyond the
ears invites difficulty in finding a place for sounds in the world. If
audition is wholly aspatial, this may encourage a retreat to the view
that sounds lack locations outside the mind.</p>

<p>

This kind of strategy has companions and precursors. Lycan's 
suggestion that olfactory experiences are apparent as modifications 
of one's own consciousness depends heavily on the aspatial 
phenomenology of olfactory experience (Lycan 2000, 278–82). Each 
recalls the Kantian claim that objectivity requires space, or that 
grasping something as independent from oneself requires the 
experience of space, a version of which is deployed by Strawson 
(1959, ch 2) in his famous discussion of sounds.</p>

<p>

Two lines of response are open. The first appeals to the thriving 
<i>empirical</i> research program in “spatial hearing” 
(see, e.g., Blauert 1997). Scientists aim to discover the cues and 
perceptual mechanisms that ground spatial audition, such as 
interaural time and level differences, secondary and reverberant 
signals, and head-related transfer functions. Audition clearly cannot
match vision's singular acuity—vision's resolution limit is 
nearly two orders of magnitude better than audition's (Blauert 1997, 
38–9). Nevertheless, this research strongly supports the claim that 
human subjects auditorily perceive such spatial characteristics as 
direction and distance.</p>

<p>

Second, a number of philosophers have objected on 
<i>phenomenological</i> grounds. Audition, they argue, involves 
experiencing or perceptually representing such spatial 
characteristics as direction and distance (Pasnau 1999, Casati and 
Dokic 2005, Matthen 2005, O'Callaghan 2007, 2010). Introspection 
and performance support the claim that sounds or sound sources are in
many ordinary cases perceptually experienced as located in the 
environment at a distance in some direction. We hear the sound of the
knocking over near the door; we hear footsteps approaching from 
behind and to the left; hearing sound to “fill” a room is
itself a form of spatial hearing. Though hearing is more error prone 
than vision, we frequently do not need to work out the locations of 
sounds or sources—we simply hear them.</p>

<h4><a name="Strawson">3.1.2 Strawson and the Purely Auditory Experience</a></h4>

<p>

A subtler form of skepticism about spatial audition aims just to 
block the requirements on objectivity. Strawson (1959) famously 
argues in Chapter 2 of <i>Individuals</i> that because auditory 
experience is not <i>intrinsically</i> spatial—spatial concepts
have no intrinsic auditory significance—a purely auditory 
experience would be non-spatial. It thus would not satisfy the 
requirements on non-solipsistic consciousness. Others have endorsed 
versions of Strawson's claim. “[T]he truth of a proposition to 
the effect that there is a sound at such-and-such a position must 
consist in this: if someone was to go to that position, he would have
certain auditory experiences,” states Evans (1980, 274).</p>

<p>

The claim that audition is not intrinsically spatial admits at least 
two readings. First, since Strawson suggests that audition might 
inherit spatial content from other sense modalities such as vision or
touch, it could mean that audition <i>depends</i> for its spatial 
content upon that of other modalities. If, unlike vision and touch, 
audition's spatial capacities are parasitic upon those of other 
modalities, audition is spatial only thanks to its relations to other
intrinsically spatial modalities. Second, it might be understood as a
claim about the <i>objects</i> of audition. Strawson indicates that 
sounds themselves are not intrinsically spatial. He says that 
although sounds have pitch, timbre, and loudness, they lack 
“intrinsic spatial characteristics” (1959, 65). Since 
these interpretations are not clearly distinguished by Strawson, it 
is helpful to consider his master argument.</p>

<p>

Strawson claims that a purely auditory experience would be 
non-spatial. By “purely auditory experience” Strawson 
means an exclusively auditory experience, or an auditory experience 
in absence of experience associated with any other modality. Given 
the mechanisms of spatial hearing, however, it is empirically 
implausible that a normal acoustic environment with rich spatial cues
would fail to produce even a minimally spatial purely auditory 
experience. Even listening only to stereo headphones could produce a 
directional auditory experience. If any modality <i>in isolation</i> 
ever could ground spatial experience, audition could. On the other 
hand, it does seem possible that there could be a non-spatial but 
<i>impoverished</i> exclusively auditory experience if no binaural or
other spatial cues were present. But similarly impoverished, 
non-spatial experiences seem possible for other modalities. Consider 
visually experiencing a uniform gray ganzfeld, or floating 
weightlessly in a uniformly warm bath. Neither provides the materials
for spatial concepts, so neither differs from audition in this 
respect. One might contend that we therefore lack a good reason to 
think that, <i>in contrast to a purely visual or tactile 
experience</i>, a purely auditory experience would be an entirely 
non-spatial experience (see O'Callaghan 2010).</p>

<h4><a name="Structure">3.1.3 Does Audition Have Spatial Structure?</a></h4>

<p>

Nudds (2001) suggests another way to understand the claim, and 
interprets Strawson as making an observation about the internal 
<i>structure</i> of audition:</p>

<blockquote>When we see (or seem to see) something, we see it as
occupying or as located within a region of space; when we hear (or
appear to hear) a sound we simply hear the sound, and we don't
experience it as standing in any relation to the space it may in fact
occupy. (Nudds 2001, 213–14)</blockquote>

<p>

Audition, unlike vision, lacks a spatial structure or field, claims 
Nudds. A purely auditory experience thus would not comprise a spatial
field into which individuals independent from oneself might figure. 
Following an example from Martin (1992), Nudds argues that while 
vision involves awareness of unoccupied locations, audition does not 
involve awareness of regions of space as empty or unoccupied. 
Martin's example is seeing the space in the center of a ring <i>as 
empty</i>. In audition, Nudds claims, one never experiences a space 
as empty or unoccupied.</p>

<p> In response, one might simply deny a difference between vision and
audition on this count. If one can attend to a location near the
center of the visible ring as empty, one can attend to the location
between the sounding alarm clock and the slamming door as a place
where there is no audible sound—as acoustically empty space. Of
course, auditory space generally is less replete than visual space,
but this is contingent. Consider seeing just a few stars flickering on
and off against a dark sky. Since such an experience may have spatial
structure, and since it is analogous to audition, one might on these
grounds defend the claim that audition has spatial structure.</p>

<h4><a name="Differs">3.1.4 How Spatial Audition Differs from Spatial Vision</a></h4>

<p>

What about the second way mentioned above to understand Strawson's
claim? Though audition's status as intrinsically spatial may not
differ from that of vision or touch, perhaps sounds are not
intrinsically spatial. But without further argument, or a commitment
to a theory of sounds, it is difficult to state confidently the
intrinsic features of sounds and thus whether they include spatial
features. If, for instance, wavelength is among a sound's intrinsic
features, sounds are intrinsically spatial.</p>

<p>

Nonetheless, the claim might be that sounds, 
as they are perceptually experienced to be, lack intrinsic or 
non-relational spatial features. Roughly, independent from spatial 
relations to other sounds, experienced sounds seem to lack 
<i>internal</i> spatial structure. That is why you cannot auditorily 
experience the empty space at the center of a sound or hear its 
edges. Interpreted as such—that sounds are not experienced or 
perceptually represented to have inherent spatial 
features—the claim is plausible (though consider diffuse or 
spread out sounds in contrast to focused or pinpoint sounds). It 
certainly marks an important difference from vision, whose objects 
frequently not only seem to have rich internal spatial structure, but
also are individuated in terms of inherent spatial features.</p>

<p>

This difference, however, does not ground an argument that any purely
auditory experience is non-spatial or that sounds fail to satisfy the
requirement on objectivity, since sounds' being experienced to have
internal, intrinsic, or inherent spatial characteristics is necessary
neither for spatial auditory experience nor to experience sounds as
objective. Since sounds phenomenologically seem to be located in space
and to bear extrinsic spatial relations to each other, auditory
experience satisfies the requirements for objectivity, which need only
secure the materials for a conception of a place for sounds to exist
when not experienced.</p>

<p>

So, vision and audition differ with respect to space in two ways. 
First, vision's spatial <i>acuity</i> surpasses that of audition. Second, 
vision's objects are perceptually experienced to have rich <i>internal</i> 
spatial structure, and audition's are not. However, given the spatial
characteristics evident in audition, such as direction and distance, 
the spatial status of audition presents no barrier to understanding 
its objects as perceiver-independent. The spatial aspects of auditory
phenomenology thus may fail to ground an argument to the conclusion 
that sounds are modifications of one's consciousness. If that is the 
case, then audition provides no special intuitive support for 
accounts on which private entities are the direct objects of perception.</p>

<h3><a name="Qualities">3.2 Audible Qualities</a></h3>

<h4><a name="Colors">3.2.1 Sounds and Colors</a></h4>

<p>

According to theories on which sounds are individuals, sounds are not
secondary or sensible qualities. But, humans hear audible qualities, 
such as pitch, loudness, and timbre, that are analogous to colors, 
tastes, and smells. Thus, familiar accounts of colors and other 
sensible attributes or secondary qualities might apply to the audible
qualities. For instance, pitches might be either dispositions to 
cause certain kinds of experiences in suitable subjects, the physical
or categorical bases of such dispositions, sensations or projected 
features of auditory experiences, or simple primitive properties of 
(actual or edenic) sounds.</p>

<p>

Tradition suggests that the form of a philosophical account of 
visible qualities, such as color, and their perception applies to 
other sensible qualities, such as pitch, flavor, and smell, and their
perception. Thus, according to tradition, if dispositionalism, 
physicalism, projectivism, or primitivism about sensible qualities is
true for features associated with one modality, it is true for 
features associated with others. Despite tradition, we should be wary
to accept that a theory of sensible qualities translates plausibly 
across the senses.</p>

<p>

Debates about sensible qualities and their perception begin with 
concerns about whether sensible features can be identified with or 
reduced to any objective physical features. What follows has two 
aims. The first is to give a sense of how such debates might go in 
the case of audible qualities. The focus is on pitch, since pitch is 
often compared to color, and the case of color is well known. The 
second is to point out the most salient differences and similarities 
between the cases of color and pitch that impact the plausibility of 
arguments translated from one case to the other.</p>

<p> 

First, I consider two noteworthy arguments that are founded on aspects
of color perception. Each aims to establish that the colors we
perceive cannot be identified with objective physical
features. Neither argument transposes neatly to the case of
pitch. Thus, we should not assume arguments that are effective in the
case of color have equal force when applied to other sensible
qualities. Color perhaps is a uniquely difficult case.</p>

<p>

Second, however, I discuss two respects in which pitch experience is
similar to color experience. It is instructive that these aspects of
pitch experience do raise difficulties for an objective physical
account of pitch that are familiar from the case of color.</p>

<h4><a name="Pitch">3.2.2 Pitch, Timbre, and Loudness</a></h4>

<p> What are pitch, timbre, and loudness? Pitch is a dimension along
which tones can be ordered according to apparent
“height”. The pitch of fingernails scratching a blackboard
generally is higher than that of thumping a washtub. Loudness can be
glossed as the volume, intensity, or quantity of sound. A jet plane
makes louder sounds than a model plane. Timbre is more difficult to
describe. Timbre is a quality in which sounds that share pitch and
loudness might differ. So, a violin, a cello, and a piano all playing
the same note differ in timbre. Sometimes timbre is called “tone
color”.</p>

<p>

Physics and psychoacoustics show that properties including frequency,
amplitude, and wave shape determine the audible qualities sounds
(auditorily) appear to have. To simplify, take the case of pitch,
since pitch often is compared to color. Not all sounds appear to have
pitch. Some sounds appear to have pitch thanks to a simple,
<i>sinusoidal</i> pattern of vibration at some frequency in an object
or in the air. Some sounds appear pitched thanks to a complex pattern
of vibration that can be decomposed into sinusoidal constituents at
multiple frequencies, since any pattern of vibration can be analyzed
as some combination of simple sinusoids. Sounds appear pitched,
however, just when they have sinusoidal constituents, or
<i>partials</i>, that all are integer multiples of a common
<i>fundamental</i> frequency. Sounds with pitch thus correspond to
regular or <i>periodic</i> patterns of vibration that differ in
fundamental frequency and complexity. Simple sinusoids and complex
waveforms match in pitch (though they typically differ in timbre) when
they share fundamental frequency, even when the complex tone lacks a
sinusoidal constituent at the fundamental frequency (the phenomenon of
the <i>missing fundamental</i>).</p>

<h4><a name="Physical">3.2.3 Is Pitch Physical?</a></h4>

<p>

A straightforward account identifies pitch with periodicity (perhaps
within some range). Having pitch is being periodic (see O'Callaghan
2007, ch. 6). Periodicity can be expressed in terms of fundamental
frequency, so individual pitches are fundamental frequencies. This has
advantages as an account of pitch. It captures the linear ordering of
pitches. It also explains the musical intervals, such as the octave,
fifth, and fourth, for example, which are pitch relations that hold
among periodic tones.  Musical intervals correspond to whole-number
ratios between fundamental frequencies. Sounds that differ by an
octave have fundamental frequencies that stand in 1:2 ratios. Fifths
involve a 2:3 relationship, fourths are 3:4, and so on. This also
allows us to revise the linear pitch ordering to accommodate the
auditory sense in which tones that differ by an octave nonetheless are
the same pitch. If the pitch ordering is represented as a helix, upon
which successive octave-related tones fall at a common angular
position, each full rotation represents doubling frequency.</p>

<p>

Is the periodicity theory of pitch plausible as an account of the 
audible features we perceive when hearing sounds? If so, then 
objective physicalism about at least some sensible qualities might 
succeed.</p>

<h4><a name="Disanalogies">3.2.4 Disanalogies with Color</a></h4>

<p>

The periodicity theory of pitch fares better on two counts than 
theories that identify colors with objective physical properties.</p> 

<p>

First, consider the phenomenological distinction between 
<i>unique</i> and <i>binary</i> hues. Some colors appear to 
incorporate other colors, and some do not. Purple, for instance, 
appears both reddish and bluish; red just looks red. Some 
philosophers contend that the leading physical theories of color 
cannot explain the unique-binary distinction without essentially 
invoking the color experiences of subjects. How, for instance, do 
reflectance classes identified with unique hues differ from those 
associated with binary hues?</p> 

<p>

Consider an analogous issue for pitch. 
Some tones with pitch sound <i>simple</i>, while other pitched tones,
such as sounds of musical instruments, auditorily appear to be 
<i>complex</i> and to have discernible components. However, the 
difference between audibly simple and audibly complex pitched tones 
<i>is</i> captured by the simplicity or complexity of a sound's 
partials. Simple tones are sinusoids, and complex tones have multiple
overtones. So, one response is to hold that the unique-binary color 
distinction and the simple-complex pitch distinction are 
disanalogous. Unlike the case of color, one might contend, no pitch 
that is essentially a mixture of other pitches occupies a unique 
place in pitch space.</p>

<p>

Second, consider <i>metamerism</i>. Some surfaces with very different
reflectance characteristics match in color. Metameric pairs share no 
obvious objective physical property. Some philosophers argue that 
unless color experience fails to distinguish distinct colors, 
metamers preclude identifying colors with natural physical properties
of surfaces (see the entry on
 <a href="../color/">color</a>).</p>

<p>

 Now consider the case of pitch. Are there pitch metamers? Some sounds
with very different spectral frequency profiles match in pitch. A 
simple sinusoidal tone at a given frequency matches the pitch of each
complex tone with that fundamental frequency (even those that lack a 
constituent at the fundamental). But, again, the case of pitch 
differs from the case of color. For each matching pitch, a single 
natural property does unify the class. The tones all share a 
fundamental frequency.</p>

<h4><a name="Analogies">3.2.5 Analogies with Color</a></h4>

<p>

Two kinds of argument are equally pressing in the case of pitch.</p>

<p>

First, arguments from <i>intersubjective variation</i> transpose. 
Variations in frequency sensitivity exist among perceivers; for 
instance, subjects differ in which frequency they identify as middle 
C. If there is no principled way to legislate whose experience is 
veridical, pitch might be subjective or perceiver-relative. One 
response is that, in contrast to the case of unique red, there is an 
objective standard for middle C: fundamental frequency. But, whose 
pitch experience has the normative significance to settle the 
frequency of middle C?</p>

 <p>

Some might wonder whether there is a pitch analog of the trouble 
posed by the kind of variation associated with <i>spectrum inversion</i> in 
the case of color (see the entry on 
 <a href="../qualia-inverted/">inverted qualia</a>).
 Spectral shift in pitch, sometimes dramatic, commonly occurs after 
cochlear implant surgery. This is not spectral inversion for pitch; 
but, a dramatic shift makes most of the same trouble as inversion. 
Not quite all the trouble, since cochlear implants preserve the pitch
ordering and its direction. But, there could be a cochlear implant 
that switched the placement of electrodes sensitive to 100 hertz and 
1000 hertz, respectively; and there could be one that reversed 
the entire electrode ordering. This goes some distance to grounding 
the conceivability of a pitch inversion that reverses the height 
ordering of tones.</p>

<p>

Second, consider an argument that frequencies cannot capture the 
<i>relational structure</i> among the pitches. This is loosely 
analogous to the argument that physicalism about color fails to 
capture the relational structure of the hues—for instance, that
red is more similar to orange than either is to green. In the case of
pitch, psychoacoustics experiments show that perceived pitch does not map 
straightforwardly onto frequency. Though each unique pitch 
corresponds to a unique frequency (or small frequency range), the 
<i>relations</i> among apparent pitches do not match those among frequencies. 
In particular, equivalent pitch intervals do not correspond to equal 
frequency intervals. For example, the effect upon perceived pitch of 
a 100 hertz change in frequency varies dramatically across the 
frequency range. It is dramatic at low frequency and barely 
detectable at high frequency. Similarly, doubling frequency does not 
make for equivalent pitch intervals. A 1000 hertz tone must be 
tripled in frequency to produce the same increase in pitch as that 
produced by quadrupling the frequency of a 2000 hertz tone. Apparent 
pitch is a complex function of frequency; it is neither linear nor 
logarithmic (see, e.g., Hartmann 1997, ch 12, Gelfand 2004, ch 12, 
Zwicker and Fastl 2006, ch 5). Pitch scales that capture the 
psychoacoustic data assign equal magnitudes, commonly measured in 
units called <i>mels</i>, to equal pitch intervals. The <i>mel</i> 
scale of pitch thus is an extensive or numerical pitch scale, in 
contrast to the intensive frequency scale for pitch. The former, but 
not the latter, preserves ratios among pitches.</p>

<p>

S. S. Stevens famously argued on the basis of results drawn from 
psychoacoustic experiments that pitch is not frequency (see, e.g., 
Stevens et al. 1937, Stevens and Volkmann 1940). In light of similar 
results, contemporary psychoacoustics researchers commonly reject the
identification of pitch with frequency or periodicity. The received 
scientific view thus holds that pitch is a subjective or 
psychological quality that is no more than correlated with objective 
frequency (see, e.g., Gelfand 2004, Houtsma 1995). Pitch, on this 
understanding, belongs only to experiences. The received view of 
pitch therefore implies an error theory according to which pitch 
experience involves a widespread projective illusion.</p>

<p>

What is the argument against the periodicity theory of pitch? Compare
an argument against reflectance physicalism about color. Reflectance 
physicalism identifies each hue with a class of reflectances. 
Periodicity physicalism identifies each pitch with a fundamental 
frequency. In both cases, each determinate sensible feature is 
identified with a determinate physical property. In the color case, 
it is objected that reflectance classes do not bear the relations to 
each other that the colors bear. In the pitch case, the frequencies 
do not bear the relations to each other that the pitches bear. Thus, 
if the relational features among a class of sensible qualities are 
essential to them, an account that does not accurately capture those 
relations fails. Frequencies, according to this line of argument, do 
not stand in the relations essential to pitch.</p>

<p>

This, of course, is a quite general phenomenon among sensible 
qualities. Brightness and loudness vary logarithmically with simple 
physical quantities. Even if we identified candidate molecules for 
smells, nothing suggests physical similarities would mirror their 
olfactory similarities.</p>

<p>

One might respond, in the case of pitch and other sensible features
that can be put in a linear ordering, that the relational order is
essential, while the magnitudes are not. In that case, if pitch is
frequency, pitch experience has the right structure, but distorts
magnitudes of difference in pitch. This retains the periodicity theory
and explains away the results in terms of pitch experiences. (Pautz
2014, 3.5, has replied that this partial error account cannot be
reconciled with certain types of possible intersubjective
difference).</p>

<p>

Suppose, however, we accept that the mel scale is well-founded and 
that it accurately captures essential relationships among pitches. 
This does not by itself imply a projective or subjective theory of 
pitch. Pitches might be dispositions to produce certain kinds of 
experiences, or they might be simple or primitive properties. It also
is open to seek a more adequate physical candidate for pitch. For 
instance, pitches might be far more complex physical properties than 
frequencies. Such physical properties may be of no interest in 
developing the simplest, most complete natural physical theory, but 
they may be anthropocentrically interesting.</p>

<p>

It is an important question whether a physical theory of sensible
features should just provide a physical candidate for each determinate
sensible feature, or whether the physical relationships among those
physical candidates should capture the structural relations among
sensible qualities (and, if so, which structural relations it should
capture). This is an example of how considering in detail the nature
and the experience of sensible qualities other than color promises
insights into traditional debates concerning the sensible qualities
(Pautz 2014 contains an empirically-grounded argument concerning a
variety of sensible qualities that advances this discussion).</p>

<h2><a name="Varieties">4. Varieties of Auditory Perception</a></h2>

<h3><a name="Musical">4.1 Musical Listening</a></h3>

 <p>

Musical listening is a topic that bears on questions about the 
relationship between hearing sounds and hearing sources. While the 
philosophy of music has its own vast literature (see the entry on
 <a href="../music/">the philosophy of music</a>),
 musical experience has not been explored extensively in connection 
with general philosophical questions about auditory perception. This 
section discusses links that should advance philosophical work on 
auditory perception.</p>

<h4><a name="Acousmatic">4.1.1 Acousmatic Experience</a></h4>

 <p>

An account of listening to pure or non-vocal music should capture the
<i>aesthetic significance</i> of musical listening. Appreciating 
music is appreciating sounds and sequences, arrangements, or 
structures of sounds. Thus, the temporal aspects of auditory 
experiences are critical to appreciatively listening to music.</p>

<p>

One might go further and hold that sounds are all that matters in
music. In particular, some have argued that appreciatively listening
to music demands listening in a way that abstracts from the
environmental significance, and thus from the specific sources, of the
sounds it includes (Scruton 1997, 2–3). Such <i>acousmatic
listening</i> involves experiencing sounds in a way that is
“detached from the circumstances of their production,”
rather than “as having a certain worldly cause” (Hamilton
2007, 58; see also Hamilton 2009). Listening to music and being
receptive to its aesthetically relevant features requires not
listening to violins, horns, or brushes on snare drums.  It requires
hearing sounds and grasping them in a way removed from their common
sources. (Hearing a high fidelity recording thus furnishes an
aesthetically identical musical experience despite having a speaker
cone rather than a violin as source.) “The acousmatic experience
of sound is precisely what is exploited by the art of music”
(Scruton 1997, 3).</p>

<p>
This suggests an intuitive difference between music and visual arts
such as painting and sculpture. As Kivy (1991) explains, it is
difficult even with the most abstract paintings and sculptures to see
them in a way that takes them to be entirely formal or abstract. That
is, it is difficult to avoid seeing pictures and sculptures as
representational. In contrast, it seems easier to listen attentively
to the formal acoustical features of musical sounds, without being
compelled to think of what makes them.</p>

<p> Musical listening thus may be thought to provide a prima facie
argument against the claim that in hearing sounds one typically hears
sound sources such as the strumming of guitars and bowing of
violins. If such “interested” audition were the rule,
musical listening would be far more challenging.</p>

<h4><a name="Attention">4.1.2 Acousmatic Listening as Attention to Sounds</a></h4>

<p>

Acousmatic experience, however, may be a matter of <i>attention</i>. 
Nothing prevents focusing one's attention on the sounds and audible 
qualities without attending to the instruments, acts, and events that
are their sources, even if each is auditorily available. That musical
listening requires effort and training supports the idea that one can
direct attention differently in auditory experience, depending on 
one's interests. Not getting eaten and safely crossing the street 
require attending to sound sources, while listening with aesthetic 
appreciation to a symphony may require abstracting from the 
circumstances of its production, such as the finger movements of the 
oboist. This response holds that musical listening is a matter of 
auditorily attending in a certain way. It is attending to features of
sounds themselves, but does not imply failing to hear sound sources.</p>

<p>

The acousmatic thesis is a limited view about which aspects of one's auditory 
experience are aesthetically significant. These include aspects 
involved in hearing sounds proper, but exclude, for example, other 
contents of auditory experience. However, room exists for debate over
the aesthetically significant aspects of what you hear (see Hamilton 
2007, 2009). For example, one might argue that live performances have 
aesthetic advantages over recordings because one hears the 
<i>performance</i> of the sounds and songs, rather than their 
reproduction by loudspeakers (cf. Mag Uidhir 2007). Circumstances of 
sound production, such as that skillful gestures generate a certain 
passage, or that a particularly rare wood accounts for a violin's 
sounds, might be aesthetically relevant in a way that outstrips the 
sounds, and some such features may be audible in addition to sounds. 
For instance, hearing the spatial characteristics of a 
performance may hold aesthetic significance beyond the tones and 
structures admitted by traditional accounts of musical listening. 
Composers may even intend “spatial gestures” among 
aspects essential for the appreciation of a piece (see, e.g., Solomon
2007). To imagine auditorily experiencing the spatial characteristics
of music in a way entirely divorced from the environmental 
significance of the sounds is difficult. Appreciating the 
relationship between experiences of sounds and of sources makes room 
for a view of the aesthetic value of musical listening that is more 
liberal than acousmatic experience allows.</p>

<h3><a name="Speech">4.2 Speech Perception</a></h3>

<h4><a name="Special">4.2.1 Is Speech Special?</a></h4>

<p> Speech perception presents uniquely difficult twists, and few
philosophers have confronted it directly (Appelbaum 1999, Trout 2001a,
Matthen 2005, ch 9, and Remez and Trout 2009 are recent
exceptions). Something striking and qualitatively
distinctive—perhaps uniquely human—seems to set the
perception of speech apart from ordinary hearing. The main
philosophical issues about speech perception concern versions of the
question, Is speech special?  (See O'Callaghan 2014 for a
comprehensive review and discussion.)</p>

<p>
How does perceiving speech differ from perceiving ordinary
non-linguistic sounds? Listening to music and listening to speech each
differ from listening to other environmental sounds in the following
respect.  In each case, one's interest in listening is to some degree
distanced from the specific environmental happenings involved in the
production of sounds.</p>

<p>

But this is true of listening to music and of listening to speech for
different reasons.  In music, it is plausible that one's interest is
in the sounds themselves, rather than in the sources of their
production.  However, speech is a vehicle for conventional linguistic
meaning.  In listening to speech, one's main interest is the meanings,
rather than in the sources of sound.  Ultimately, the information
conveyed is what matters.</p>

<p>
 
Nevertheless, according to the most common philosophical
understanding, <i>perceiving</i> spoken utterances is just a matter of
hearing sounds.  The sounds of speech are complex audible sound
structures.  Listening to speech in a language you know typically
involves <i>grasping</i> meanings, but grasping meanings requires
first hearing the sounds of speech.  According to this account,
grasping meanings itself is a matter of extra-perceptual
cognition.</p>

<p> The commonplace view—that perceiving speech is a variety of
ordinary auditory perception that just involves hearing the sounds of
speech—has been challenged in a number of ways. The challenges
differ in respect of how speech perception is held to differ from
non-linguistic audition.</p>

<h4><a name="SpeechObj">4.2.2 The Objects of Speech Perception</a></h4>

 <p>

First, consider the <i>objects</i> of speech perception.  What are the
objects of speech perception, and do they differ from those of
ordinary auditory perception? According to the commonplace
understanding, hearing speech involves hearing sounds. Thus, hearing
spoken language shares perceptual objects with ordinary audition.
Alternatively, one might hold that the objects of speech perception
are not ordinary sounds at all. Perhaps they are language-specific
entities, such as <i>phonemes</i> or <i>words</i>. Perhaps, as some
have argued, perceiving speech involves perceiving <i>articulatory
gestures</i> or movements of the mouth and vocal organs (see the
supplement on
 <a href="supplement.html">Speech Perception: Empirical and Theoretical Considerations</a>).
 Note that if audition's objects
typically include distal events, speech in this respect is not
special, since its objects do not belong to an entirely different kind
from ordinary sounds.
</p>

<h4><a name="SpeechCon">4.2.3 The Contents of Speech Perception</a></h4>

<p>

Second, consider the <i>contents</i> of speech perception. 
Does the content of speech perception differ from that of ordinary 
audition? If it does, how does the experience of perceiving speech 
differ from that of hearing ordinary sounds? Perceiving speech might 
involve hearing ordinary sounds but auditorily ascribing distinctive
<i>features</i> to them. These features might simply be, or comprise,
finer grained qualitative and temporal acoustical details than 
non-linguistic sounds audibly possess. But perceiving speech also 
might involve perceiving sounds as belonging to <i>language-specific 
types</i>, such as phonemes, words, or other syntactic categories.</p>

<p>

Furthermore, speech perception's contents might differ in a more
dramatic way from those of non-linguistic audition. Listening with
understanding to speech involves grasping <i>meanings</i>. The
commonplace view is conservative. It holds that grasping meanings is
an act of the <i>understanding</i> rather than of audition. Thus, the
difference between the experience of listening to speech in a language
you know and the experience of listening to speech in a language you
do not know is entirely <i>cognitive</i>.</p>

<p>

But one might think that there also is a <i>perceptual</i>
difference. A liberal account of this perceptual difference holds that
perceiving speech in a language you know may involve hearing sounds
<i>as meaningful</i> or auditorily representing them as having
semantic properties (see, e.g., Siegel 2006, Bayne 2009; see also
Azzouni 2013). Alternatively, a moderately liberal account holds that
the perceptual experience of speech in a language you know involves
perceptually experiencing language-specific but nevertheless
non-semantic features (see O'Callaghan 2011b).</p>

<h4><a name="SpeechAud">4.2.4 Is Speech Perception Auditory?</a></h4>

 <p>

Third, consider the <i>processes</i> responsible for speech
perception. To what extent does perceiving speech implicate processes
that are continuous with those of ordinary or general audition, and to
what extent does perceiving speech involve separate, distinctive, or
modular processes? While some defend <i>general auditory</i> accounts
of speech perception (see, e.g, Holt and Lotto 2008), some argue that
perceiving speech involves dedicated perceptual resources, or even an
encapsulated perceptual system distinct from ordinary non-linguistic
audition (see, e.g., Fodor 1983, Pinker 1994, Liberman 1996, Trout
2001b). These arguments typically are grounded in several types of
phenomena, including the <i>multi modality</i> of speech
perception—visual cues about the movements of the mouth and
tongue impact the experience of speech, as demonstrated by the McGurk
effect (see the section
 <a href="#Crossmodal">4.3 Crossmodal Influences</a>);
 <i>duplex perception</i>—a particular stimulus
sometimes contributes simultaneously both to the experience of an
ordinary sound and to that of a speech sound (Rand 1974); and the
<i>top-down influence</i> of linguistic knowledge upon the experience
of speech. A reasonable challenge is that each of these
characteristics—multimodality, duplex perception, and top-down
influence—also is displayed in general audition. </p>

 <blockquote>

 <a href="supplement.html">Speech Perception: Empirical and Theoretical Considerations</a>.
 </blockquote>

<h3><a name="Crossmodal">4.3 Crossmodal Influences</a></h3>

<h4><a name="Illusions">4.3.1 Crossmodal Illusions</a></h4>

<p>

Auditory perception of speech is influenced by cues from vision and 
touch (see Gick et al. 2008). The McGurk effect in speech perception 
leads to an illusory auditory experience caused by a visual stimulus 
(McGurk and Macdonald 1976). Do such multimodal effects occur in 
ordinary audition? Visual and tactile cues commonly do shape auditory
experience. The ventriloquist illusion is an illusory auditory 
experience of location that is produced by an apparent visible sound 
source (see, e.g., Bertelson 1999). Audition even impacts experience 
in other modalities. The sound-induced flash 
illusion involves a visual illusion as of seeing two consecutive 
flashes that is produced when a single visible flash is accompanied 
by two consecutive audible beeps (Shams et al. 2000, 2002). Such 
crossmodal illusions demonstrate that auditory experience is impacted
by other modalities and that audition influences other modalities. In
general, experiences associated with one perceptual modality are 
influenced by stimulation associated with other modalities.</p>

<h4><a name="Constitutive">4.3.2 Causal or Constitutive?</a></h4>

<p>

An important question is whether the impact is merely causal, or 
whether perception in one modality is somehow constitutively tied to 
other modalities. If, for instance, vision merely causally impacts 
your auditory experience of a given sound, then processes associated 
with audition might be proprietary and characterizable in terms that 
do not appeal to other modalities.</p>

<p>

Suppose that such cross-modal illusions are intelligible as the results 
of adaptive perceptual strategies. In ordinary circumstances, 
crossmodal processes serve to reduce or resolve apparent conflicts in
information drawn from several senses, and thereby make perception 
more reliable overall. Thus, crossmodal illusions differ from 
<i>synaesthesia</i>. Synaesthesia is just a kind of accident. It 
results from mere quirks of processing, and it always involves 
illusion (or else is accidentally veridical). Crossmodal 
recalibrations, in contrast, are best understood as attempts 
“to maintain a perceptual experience consonant with a unitary 
event” (Welch and Warren 1980, 638).</p> 

<p>This principled reconciliation of information drawn from different
sensory sources suggests, first, that audition is governed by
extra-auditory perceptual constraints. Second, since conflict requires
a common subject matter, such constraints concern the common sources
of stimulation to multiple senses. This suggest that audition and
vision share a perceptual concern for a common subject matter.</p>

<p>
This concern for a common subject matter may be reflected in certain
forms of perceptual experience. For instance, the commonality may be
experientially evident in the experience of space and the perceptual
experience of audio-visual intermodal feature binding. Thus, auditory
and visual experiences may share a common multimodal or amodal content
or character (see O'Callaghan 2008b, Clark 2011). And one modality
could have a constitutive rather than a merely causal impact upon
processes and experiences associated with another.</p>

<h4><a name="Multimodal">4.3.3 Multimodality in Perception</a></h4>

 <p>

What hangs on this? First, it bears on questions about audition's 
content. If we cannot exhaustively characterize auditory experience 
in terms that are modality-specific or distinctive to audition, and 
doing so requires amodal or multimodal contents, then we might hear 
<i>as of</i> things we can see or experience with other senses. This 
is related to one puzzling question about hearing sound sources: How 
could you hear as of something you could see? Rather than just a 
claim about audition's content that requires further explanation, we 
now have a story about why things like sound sources figure in the 
content of auditory experience. Second, all of this may bear on how 
to delineate what counts as auditory perception, as opposed to visual
or even amodal perception. If hearing is systematically impacted by 
visual processes, and if it shares content and phenomenology with 
other sense experiences, what are the boundaries of auditory 
perception? Multimodal perception may bear on the question of whether
there are clear and significant distinctions among the sense 
modalities (cf. Nudds 2003). Finally, multimodal perceptual 
experiences, illusions, and explanatory strategies may illuminate the
phenomenological <i>unity</i> of experiences in different modalities,
or the sense in which, for instance, an auditory experience and a 
visual experience of some happening comprise a single encompassing 
experience (see the entry on 
 <a href="../consciousness-unity/">the unity of consciousness</a>).
 </p>

<p>

We can ask questions about the relationships among modalities in
different areas of explanatory concern. Worthwhile areas for attention
include the objects, contents, and phenomenology of perception, as
well as perceptual processes and their architecture.  Crossmodal and
multimodal considerations might shed doubt on whether vision-based
theorizing alone can deliver a complete understanding of perception
and its contents. This approach constitutes an important
methodological advance in the philosophical study of perception (see
O'Callaghan 2012 for further discussion).</p>

<h2><a name="Conclusion">5. Conclusion and Future Directions</a></h2>

<p>

Considering modalities other than vision enhances our understanding of
perception. It is necessary to developing and vetting an adequate
comprehensive and general account of perception and its roles.
Auditory perception reveals a new rich territory for philosophical
exploration in its own right, but it also provides a useful contrast
case in which to evaluate claims about perception proposed in the
visual context. One of the most promising directions for future work
concerns the nature of the relationships among perceptual modalities,
how these relationships shape experience across modalities, and how
they may prove essential to understanding perception itself.  Recent
philosophical work on auditory perception thus encourages the advance
beyond considering modalities in isolation from each other.</p>
