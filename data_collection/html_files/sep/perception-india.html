<h1>Perceptual Experience and Concepts in Classical Indian Philosophy</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Thu Dec 2, 2010; substantive revision Mon Jun 22, 2015</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>

Classical Indian Philosophy accepts perception
(<em>pratyakṣa</em>), or perceptual experience, as the primary
means of knowledge (<em>pramāṇa</em>). Perception
(<em>pratyakṣa</em>) is etymologically rooted in the
sense-faculty or the sense-organ (<em>akṣa</em>) and can be
translated as sensory awareness, while <em>pramāṇa</em>, on
the other hand, is derived from knowledge (<em>pramā</em>) and,
literally means ‘the instrument in the act of
knowing’. However, the standard interpretation of perception
accepted by classical Indian philosophers, barring the Buddhists and
the Vedāntins, is that it is a cognition arising within the
self—the knowing subject—from mental operations following
a sense-object contact. It, therefore, is neither an instrument in the
act of knowing, nor a mere sensory awareness. Definitions of
perception from various classical Indian philosophy schools are given
in section 2 below.</p>

<p>
The same is true of concepts. There is no one agreed notion or
definition of concept understood as the meaning of a general term in
Classical Indian Philosophy. Rather, we have a variety of views
ranging from robust realism about concepts as real properties,
essences or universals to extreme nominalism which admits only of
unique particulars with versions of conceptualism in between. The
robust realist position is defended by the
Nyāya-Vaiśeṣika and Mīmāṃsā
schools, the nominalist by the Buddhist schools and the conceptualist
by the Vedāntins and Jainas. I will not be discussing the
conceptualist position or their arguments here because ultimately this
position ends up collapsing into a version of realism or
nominalism.</p>

<h2><a name="Int">1. Introduction</a></h2>

<p>

The etymology of perception in Sanskrit underlines a major and,
perhaps the most controversial, issue in classical Indian
epistemology, viz. is the sensory core <em>all</em> there is to the
content of a perceptual experience? Put differently, it is asked
whether the <em>content</em> of a perceptual experience is restricted
to being unconceptualized (<em>nirvikalpaka</em>), or can any part of
it be conceptualized (<em>savikalpaka</em>) as well? The
Naiyāyikas generally take perception to be a two-staged process:
first there arises a non-conceptual (<em>nirvikalpaka</em>) perception
of the object and then a conceptual (<em>savikalpaka</em>) perception,
both being valid cognitions. For Buddhists, non-conceptual perceptions
alone are valid, while Grammarians (Śābdikas) deny their
validity altogether. Sāṃkhya and
Mīmāṃsā agree with the Nyāya position. These
two realist schools, Nyāya and Mīmāṃsā,
contest the Grammarian as well as the Buddhist positions. Advaita
Vedānta position on perception seems to agree, in spirit, with
the Buddhists, but their reasons for supporting non-conceptual
perceptions alone as ultimately valid (<em>paramārthika
satta</em>) are very different. This debate, on the role of concepts
in perception, is discussed in detail in section 3.</p> 

<p>Yet another
debate about the nature of universals and concepts looms in the
background of this debate. How do we know universals or concepts? The
Buddhist introduce the doctrine of apoha to provide the resources for
constructing concepts from sensory content to further the nominalist
project of explaining thought and language in a world of
particulars. In response to Buddhist nominalism, Nyāya
philosophers present a defense of realism in the course of which they
argue for a theory of real perceivable universals. This debate will be
the focus of secion 4.</p>

<p>

A very critical question germane to these epistemological issues is 
raised by the Buddhist philosopher Vasubandhu (c. 4th century CE): how do we 
distinguish veridical perceptions from the non-veridical ones? This 
is taken up in the last section.</p>

<p>

Before we start out with the definitions, the following observation 
may be noted. It is true that the classical Indian philosophers were 
seriously concerned with the notions of enlightenment, the highest 
good, freedom from the cycle of rebirth and the attainment of 
ultimate bliss, etc. Therefore, some even question whether they were 
concerned with any epistemological questions at all, much less the 
ones raised here? But they were! For Naiyāyikas, in particular, 
this was a major focus: the reason offered in the early Nyāya 
tradition, in Vātsyāyana's (c. 450–500 CE) commentary
on the <em>Nyāya-sūtra</em>, is that without 
knowledge of objects there is no success in practical response to 
them. Not very enlightening, perhaps. However, a much sharper 
justification comes from Gaṅgeśa (c. 12th century CE), the
founder of the Navya-Nyāya school, in the introduction to his 
great work, <em>Jewel Of Reflection On The Truth</em> 
<em>(Tattvacintāmaṇi</em>):</p>

<blockquote>
  In order that discerning persons may have interest in studying the
  work, Akṣapāda Gautama (c. 2nd century CE) laid down the
  <em>sūtra</em>: ‘Attainment of the highest good comes
  from right knowledge.’.
</blockquote>

<p>

It should not then be surprising that one of the most sophisticated 
classical Indian treatises dealing with perception, Kumārila's 
(c. 7th<sup> </sup> century CE) <em>Pratyakṣapariccheda</em> (a
portion of <em>Ślokavārttika</em> pertaining to the fourth 
<em>sūtra</em> of 
<em>Mīmāṃsā-sūtra</em>), discusses
the nature and validity of perception without any consideration of 
its role in the ascertainment of religious and moral truth; in fact, 
the <em>Mīmāṃsā-sūtra</em> itself 
characterizes perception as not being a <em>means</em> of knowing 
righteousness (<em>Dharma</em>). It is true that epistemological 
debates in classical Indian philosophy arose in the 
religio-philosophical context; however, there is plenty of evidence 
on record to show that classical Indian philosophers were haunted by 
the very same epistemological concerns that have troubled the minds 
of Western philosophers through the ages. The controversial classical
Indian epistemology issue—whether perception is conceptualized 
or not?—continues to be debated in the Western and Indian 
philosophy journals even today. That said, what makes this historical
inquiry significant is that the epistemological issues in classical 
Indian philosophy are introduced against the backdrop of radically 
different metaphysical and ethical presuppositions.</p>

<h2><a name="PerPer">2. Perspectives on Perception</a></h2>

<p>

Most classical Indian philosophical schools accept perception as the
primary means of knowledge, but differ on the nature, kinds and
objects of perceptual knowledge. Here we first survey Buddhist and
orthodox Hindu schools' definitions of perception (excluding
Vaiśeṣika and Yoga schools since they simply take on board
Nyāya and Sāṃkhya ideas, respectively) and note the
issues raised by these definitions. As mentioned above, the orthodox
schools generally accept both non-conceptualized (indeterminate) and
conceptualized (determinate) perceptual states in sharp contrast to
the Buddhist view that perception is always non-conceptualized or
indeterminate awareness.</p>

<h3><a name="BudNom">2.1 Buddhist nominalism</a></h3>

<p>

The oldest preserved definition of perception in the Buddhist
tradition is the one by Vasubandhu (c. 4<sup>th</sup> century CE),
“Perception is a cognition [that arises] from that object [which
is represented therein]” (Frauwallner, 1957, p. 120).  However,
the more influential and much discussed view is that of later Buddhist
Yogācāra philosopher Diṅnāga (c. 480–540
CE) for whom perception is simply a cognition “devoid of
conceptual construction (<em>kalpanāpodhaṃ</em>)”.
Taber (2005, p. 8) notes two important implications of this
definition. First, perception is non-conceptual in nature; no seeing
is seeing-as, because that necessarily involves intervention of
conceptual constructs, which contaminate the pristine given.
Perception is mere awareness of bare particulars without any
identification or association with words for, according to
Diṅnāga, such association always results in falsification
of the object. Referents of the words are universals which, for the
Buddhist, are not real features of the world. Second,
Diṅnāga's definition only indicates a phenomenological
feature of perception; it says nothing about its origin and does not
imply that it arises from the contact of a sense faculty with the
object. Therefore, for the Buddhist idealist, the object that appears
in perceptual cognition need not be an external physical object, but a
form that arises within consciousness itself. Both these ideas led to
vigorous debates in classical Indian philosophy between the Hindus and
the Buddhists. The first of these ideas relates to the notion of
non-conceptual perception, the second to idealism.
Diṅnāga's philosophy is idealist-nominalist in spirit and
his epistemological position is in sync with the Buddhist metaphysical
doctrines of no-self and evanescence of all that exists which,
expectedly, evoke strong reaction from the realist
Nyāya-Vaiśeṣika and Mīmāṃsā
schools.</p>

<p>In recent literature, there has been a scholarly debate on whether
the Indian Yogācāra philosophy is a form of idealism or
not. This debate is murky because there are various versions of
idealism discussed in the literature in Buddhist philosophy. At least
three versions have been discussed in recent literature in Buddhist
philosophy: subjective idealism (the view that there are no
mind-independent objects); metaphysical idealism (the view that
external objects do not exist); and, epistemic idealism (the view that
what we are immediately aware of is intrinsic to cognition). Lusthaus
(2002) and Coseru (2012) have argued, respectively, for a
"phenomenological" and "phenomenalist naturalist" interpretation of
Yogācāra in opposition to the standard idealist
interpretation. The main argument for the phenomenological reading is
that the epistemic claims made by the Yogācāra philosophers
do not commit them to ontological claims. This would avoid the charge
of metaphysical idealism but is still open to being interpreted as
offering an epistemic or subjective idealism. Lusthaus sees
Yogācāra philosophers' denial of solipsism and affirmation
of other minds as a fatal blow to the idealist interpretation of
Yogācāra. Idealism does not necessitate solipsism as is made clear in Berkeley's version of subjective idealism and Hegel's absolute idealism which explicitly requires other minds. Thus, there is 
reason to think that the idealist interpretation of Yogācāra
is not threatened by its commitment to other minds. It is not entirely
clear whether Coseru's phenomenalist view involves a denial of idealism
or he thinks that it is compatible with an idealist reading of
Yogācāra.</p>

<p>More recently, Kellner and Taber (2014) have presented a new reason
for the revival of the standard idealist reading of
Yogācāra. Their argument for this reading is based on
Vasubandhu's argumentative strategy rather than the logical structure
of individual proofs. They claim that in
the <i>Viṃśikā</i> Vasubandhu uses the argument from
ignorance, according to which, the absence of external objects is
derived from the absence of evidence for their existence. They also
note that Vasubandhu uses the same strategy to refute the existence of
the self in the <i>Abhidharmakośabhāṣya</i> IX. The
argument from ignorance seems like a bad strategy. It is often listed
as a logical fallacy of the general form: since statement <i>P</i> is
not known or proved to be true, <i>P</i> is false. But because the
general form of the argument is bad, it does not necessarily follow
that every argument of that form is unsuccessful. It may well succeed
because of other features, for example the semantic meanings of the
terms or when the arguments are arguments to the best
explanation. Kellner and Taber emphasise that some arguments from
ignorance are successful when they function as arguments to the best
explanation especially in contexts where there are agreed-upon
standards of verification. For example, the medical community agrees
that the most accurate and sensitive test for typhoid is testing the
bone marrow for Salmonella typhi bacteria. If it turns out that it
cannot be proven that one has typhoid (because of the lack of
Salmonella typhi bacteria in one's bone marrow), then it is false that
one has typhoid. No matter how suggestive the symptoms are, if the
specific bacteria do not show up in the bone marrow within a specific
time period, then one does not have typhoid. So, then, the question
is: Is Vasubandhu's argument from ignorance successful for
establishing idealism? I fear not. That is because there are no
universally agreed-upon criteria among Classical Indian philosophers
(not even among fellow-Buddhists) as to what counts as evidence for
the existence of external things.</p>

<h3><a name="NyaRea">2.2 Nyāya realism</a></h3>

<p>

The most comprehensive, and the most influential, definition of 
perception in classical Indian philosophy is offered in Gautama's 
<em>Nyāya-sūtra</em> 1.1.4:</p>

<blockquote>
  Perception is a cognition which arises from the contact of the sense
  organ and object and is not impregnated by words, is unerring, and
  well-ascertained.
</blockquote>

<p>

Expectedly, each part of this definition has raised controversy and 
criticism. If perception is a cognition (and non-erroneous), then it 
is a state of knowledge, rather than a means to knowing! How does 
that constitute a primary means of knowledge? Some Naiyāyika 
commentators, Vācaspati Miśra (c. 900–980 CE) and 
Jayanta Bhaṭṭa (c. 9th century CE) among them, 
suggest that the <em>sūtra</em> is to be understood by adding to
it the term ‘from which (<em>yataḥ</em>),’ since 
the preceding <em>sūtra-s</em> indicates that Gautama's 
formulation of this <em>sūtra</em> was intended to define the 
instrument of a valid perceptual cognition. Another issue has been 
the interpretation of the word “contact”. In what sense 
are the eye and the ear, the sense organs for vision and auditory 
perception, respectively, in contact with their objects? Here a 
careful look at the term “sannikarṣa,” generally 
translated as contact, helps resolve the issue; 
“Sannikarṣa” literally means ‘drawing 
near,’ and can be interpreted as being in <em>close</em> 
connection with or in the <em>vicinity of</em>. Thus perception is 
that which arises out of a close connection between the sense organ 
and its object.</p>

<p>

More substantial debates on the nature of perception focus on the 
adjectives in the latter part of the <em>sūtra</em>, viz., 
non-verbal (<em>avyapadeśyam</em>), non-erroneous or 
non-deviating (<em>avyabhichāri</em>), and 
well-ascertained or free from doubt 
(<em>vyavasāyātmaka</em>). There is some disagreement among
the Naiyāyika commentators about the interpretations of the 
adjectives non-verbal and well-ascertained. 
Vātsyāyana, in his commentary on the 
<em>Nyāya-sūtra</em>, argues that the adjectives non-verbal
and well-ascertained are really part of the definition; 
non-verbal to point out that perceptual knowledge is not associated 
with words (Bhartṛhari, the famous Grammarian, on the other 
hand, holds that awareness is necessarily constituted by words and 
apprehended through them) and well-ascertained to affirm that 
perceptual knowledge is only of a definite particular and 
specifically excludes situations in which the perceiver may be in 
doubt whether a perceived object ‘a’ is an <em>F</em> or 
a <em>G</em>. Vācaspati Miśra, argues that the adjective 
well-ascertained need not be used to exclude the so-called perception
in the form of doubt, as doubtful knowledge, being invalid, is 
already excluded by the adjective non-erroneous. Rather, the
term <em>vyavasāyātmaka</em> stands for determinate 
perceptual judgment. Thus understood, the adjectives 
<em>non-verbal</em> and <em>determinate</em> seem to be 
complementary; a piece of <em>non-verbal</em> perceptual knowledge 
cannot be said to be, at the same time, 
<em>determinate.</em> Vācaspati Miśra posits that these two
adjectives indicate two different forms of perceptual cognition and 
are not to be regarded as its defining characteristics. According to 
him, Gautama included these adjectives to identify two <em>kinds</em>
of perceptual knowledge: <em>avyapadeśyam</em> indicates 
non-conceptual or non-verbal perception and 
<em>vyavasāyātmaka</em> indicates conceptual or determinate
perceptions. He contends that by the term non-verbal, 
Gautama refutes the Grammarian view and includes 
non-conceptual perception and, by the term well-ascertained, 
he refutes the Buddhist view and includes conceptual or 
judgemental perceptions as valid. Pradyot Mondal (1982) traces the 
history of this controversy among Naiyāyikas. He offers 
overwhelming scholarly evidence in favor of the view that 
Naiyāyikas mostly regard the adjectives as part of the 
definition of perception and do not agree with Vācaspati's 
interpretation. For most Naiyāyikas “non-verbal” is 
included to deny the causal role of words in origination of 
perceptual cognition and, therefore, it applies to non-conceptual and
conceptual perceptions both, the difference being that the former is 
inexpressible in language, while the latter is not. Thus Mondal 
claims that the adjective “non-verbal” is 
sufficient on its own to reject the Grammarian and the Buddhist views
of perception. “Non-verbal” has raised a most contentious
debate, for over a millennium, between Nyāya and Buddhist 
philosophers, and it is still alive today. The role of concepts in 
perception—in dispute in this debate—will be discussed in
the next section.</p>

<p>

The Navya-Naiyāyika Gaṅgeśa objects to the notion 
‘sensory connection’ in the classical Nyāya 
definition of perception, arguing that this makes the definition too 
wide and too narrow at the same time: too wide because it implies 
that <em>every</em> awareness is perceptual being produced by virtue 
of a connection with the ‘inner’ sense faculty or mind 
(<em>manas);</em> too narrow because it fails to include 
divine perception, which involves no sensory connection. 
Gaṅgeśa offers a simpler definition of perception as an 
awareness which has no other awareness as its chief instrumental 
cause. Being concerned that his definition may be interpreted as 
ruling out conceptualized or determinate perception that may have 
non-conceptual or indeterminate perception as one of it causes, he 
argues that indeterminate perception can never be <em>the</em> chief 
instrumental cause of determinate perception, although it <em>is</em>
a cause, since it supplies the qualifier or the concept for 
determinate perception.</p>

<h3><a name="MiiRea">2.3 Mīmāṃsā realism</a></h3>

<p>

The <em>Purva</em> <em>Mīmāṃsā-sūtra</em> 
(MS) were originally composed by Jamini around 200 BCE. The fourth 
MS 1.1.4 says:</p>

<blockquote>
  The arising of a cognition when there is a connection of the sense
  faculties of a person with an existing (<em>sat</em>)
  object—that (<em>tat</em>) is perception; it is not the basis
  of the knowledge of <em>Dharma</em>, because it is the apprehension
  of that which is present. (Taber, 2005:44)
</blockquote>

<p>

There is no consensus among Mīmāṃsā commentators
on whether this is intended as a definition of perception, even while
an initial reading of it suggests that it may be. Kumārila, the 
noted Mīmāṃsā commentator argues that the first 
part of the <em>sūtra</em> is <em>not</em> intended as a 
definition because of the context in which it figures; the 
<em>sūtra-s</em> preceding it are concerned with an inquiry into
righteousness (<em>Dharma</em>). Moreover, the <em>sūtra</em> 
construed as a definition of perception, results in too wide, and not
too accurate, a definition, because it only says that perception 
arises from a connection between the sense faculty and an existing 
object and does not exclude perceptual error or inferential 
cognition. Taber (2005, 16), on the other hand, suggests that it is 
possible to construe MS 1.1.4 as a valid definition, and indeed such 
a construal was proposed by an earlier commentator, the so-called 
<em>Vṛttikāra</em> quoted at length by Śābara in
his <em>Śābarabhāṣyam</em>. This, the most 
extensive commentary on the 
<em>Mīmāṃsā-sūtra</em>, suggests that the 
words of the <em>sūtra</em> (<em>tat</em> = ‘that’ 
and <em>sat</em> = ‘existing’) be switched around for a 
different reading for the first part of the <em>sūtra</em>, 
which would then state that, “a cognition that results from 
connection of the sense faculties of a person with that 
(<em>tat</em>) [same object that appears in the cognition] is true 
(<em>sat</em>) perception”. This switch rules out perceptual 
error and inference; both these present objects other than those that
are the cause of the perception.</p>

<h3><a name="SaaDef">2.4 Sāṃkhya definition</a></h3>

<p>

In the oldest Sāṃkhya tradition, perception is the 
functioning of a sense organ. This is clearly inadequate, as the 
ancient skeptic Jayarāśi Bhaṭṭa (c. 8th 
<sup></sup>century CE) is quick to point out. Perception in this 
sense cannot be a means of knowledge (<em>pramāṇa</em>) as
it does not distinguish between proper and improper functioning of 
sense organs and, therefore, between valid and erroneous perceptions.
A more sophisticated definition is later devised wherein perception 
is “an ascertainment [of <em>buddhi</em> or intellect] in 
regard to a sense faculty 
(<em>Sāṃkhyakārikā</em> 5 in 
<em>Yuktīdipikā</em>)”. This implies that perception 
is a modification of the intellect in the form of selective 
ascertainment of an object, brought about by the activity or 
functioning of a sense faculty. In some respects, this 
characterization of perception as an “ascertainment” of 
the intellect neatly captures the idea that perception, being an 
instrument of knowledge, is the primary means of knowledge. 
Ascertainment residing in the intellect is regarded as the instrument
of perception, while residing in the self it is regarded as the 
result of the process of perception. Furthermore, the 
<em>Sāṃkhyakārikā</em> states that the function 
of the senses with regard to the objects is “a mere 
seeing” (<em>Sāṃkhyakārikā</em>, 28b), and
the function of the intellect, referred to as ascertainment, can be 
thought of as “identification” of the object as in 
“this is a cow”, etc. 
(<em>Sāṃkhyakārikā</em> 5ab). This suggests a 
two-stage process: first the functioning of the sense faculty results
in “mere seeing” of the object (non-conceptualized 
awareness) and, later this mere seeing is acted upon by the intellect
or mind and results in a conceptual identification of the object. 
This two-stage process is very similar to the detailed account of 
conceptual (<em>savikalpaka</em>) perception offered by the 
Mīmāṃsakas and the Naiyāyikas.</p>

<h3><a name="AdvVedDirKno">2.5 Advaita Vedānta: direct knowledge</a></h3>

<p>

According to Advaita Vedānta the defining characteristic of 
perception is the directness of knowledge acquired through perception
(Bilimoria, 1980:35). In highlighting the directness of the 
perceptual process, the Advaitin differs from Nyāya and 
Mīmāṃsā proponents for whom the contact of the 
sense faculty with its object is central to the perceptual process. 
Vedānta Paribhāṣā (ed. 1972: 30) cites pleasure 
and pain as instances of perception that are directly intuited 
without any sense object contact. For the Advaitin perception is 
simply the immediacy of consciousness; knowledge not mediated by any 
instrument (Gupta et. al., 1991, p. 40). It is worth noting that this
definition is very close to that accepted by Navya-Naiyāyikas. 
Like the latter, the Advaitins regard the role of the sensory 
connection as accidental, rather than essential, to the perceptual 
process. The Neo-Advaitins accept the distinction between conceptual 
or determinate perception (they refer to it as <em>viṣayagata 
pratyakṣa</em>) and non-conceptual or indeterminate perception 
(<em>nirvikaplapka</em> <em>pratyakṣa</em>), but do not think 
of non-conceptual perception as simply a prior stage of 
conceptualized perception, as other Hindu schools do.

<h2><a name="NirSavPra">3. Nirvikalpaka and Savikalpaka Pratyakṣa</a></h2>

<p>

The Sanskrit term <em>kalpanā</em> is variously translated as 
imagination or conceptual construction and is meant to be the source 
of ‘<em>vikalpa</em>’, roughly translated as concepts, 
but which may stand for anything that the mind adds to the 
‘given’. The time-honored differentiation of perception 
into conception-free perception (<em>nir-vikalpa 
pratyakṣa</em>) and conception-loaded perception 
(<em>sa-vikalpa</em> <em>pratyakṣa</em>) is made on 
the basis of concepts (<em>vikalpa</em>) (Matilal, 1986: 313).</p>

<h3><a name="BasBudNom">3.1 The basis of Buddhist nominalism</a></h3>

<p>

The distinction between non-conceptual and conceptual was first drawn
by Diṅnāga who contended that all perception is 
non-conceptual because what constitutes seeing things as they really 
<em>are</em> must be free from any conceptual construction. The claim
is that a verbal report of proper perception is strictly impossible, 
for such a report requires conceptualization, which is not perceptual
in character; the objects of conceptual awareness are spontaneous 
constructions of our mind and are essentially linguistic in 
character. On the other hand, what is seen, ‘the given’, 
does not carry a word or a name as its label and neither is such a 
label grasped along with the object, nor inherent in it, nor even 
produced by it; objects-as-such, the real particulars 
(<em>svalakṣaṇas</em>), do not, as Quine would 
say, wear their names on their sleeves. Furthermore, the sense 
faculty cannot grasp a concept or a name; if I have never smelt 
garlic before I first encounter it, I cannot smell it <em>as 
garlic</em>, though I can smell IT; an olfactory awareness can only 
grasp a <em>smell</em> present in the olfactory field. The Buddhists 
argue that a perceiver apprehends only the real particulars, 
<em>arbitrarily</em> imposes concepts/words on them and believes, 
mistakenly, that these are <em>really there</em> in the objects and 
integral to them. The conceptual awareness conceals its own 
imaginative quality and, because it results directly from experience,
the perceiver takes it to be a perceptual experience. The perceiver 
fails to notice that imagination is involved and mistakenly thinks 
that he really perceives the constructed world. From the Buddhists 
standpoint, therefore, a perceiver can only perceive real particulars
so that any perceptual experience is always and only at the 
non-conceptual level.</p>

<h3><a name="DevHinReaNyaMis">3.2 The development of Hindu realism: the Nyāya mission</a></h3>

<p>

The Nyāya view evolves in response to Buddhist account of 
perception. They regard perception as a cognitive episode triggered 
by causal interaction between a sense faculty and an object. This 
interaction first results in a sensory impression, nothing more than 
mere physiological change. This preliminary awareness, non-conceptual
perception, is a necessary first step in the process of perception 
and is invariably followed by a structured awareness leading to 
conceptual perception. A cognition that is independent of preliminary
sensory awareness cannot result in a perceptual judgment. The first 
awareness does not destroy the perceptual character of the second; 
rather, it facilitates this subsequent awareness. Non-conceptual 
perception is an indispensable causal factor for generation of 
conceptual perception, although memory, concepts and collateral 
information may also be required. It is important to note that the 
Nyāya notion of <em>vikalpa</em> (in their distinction of 
<em>nir-vikalpa</em> and <em>sa-vikalpa</em>) is different from that 
of the Buddhists. Unlike the latter, the Naiyāyikas do not think
of <em>vikalpa-s</em> as mental creations or imaginative 
constructions but as objectively real properties and features of 
objects. <em>Vikalpa</em> in this sense indicates the operation of 
judging and synthesizing rather than imagining or constructing. Thus 
conceptual perceptions <em>truly</em> represent the structure of 
reality. Of the five types of concepts (<em>vikalpa-s</em>) 
recognized by the Buddhists, viz. <em>nāma</em> (word), 
<em>jāti</em> (universal), <em>guṇa</em> (quality), 
<em>kriyā</em> (action) and <em>dravya</em> (substance), the 
Naiyāyikas, regard all but the first <em>vikalpa</em> as 
categories of reality (Mondal, 1982, p. 364). Unlike the Grammarians,
the Nyāya schools do not accept the objective reality of words; 
words are not inherent to the object presented in perception. Rather,
the Naiyāyikas hold that the relation between word and object is
created by convention in a linguistic community. Although a concept 
is associated with a word (<em>nāma-vikalpa</em>) by means of a 
convention, it is not merely a fabrication. For example, when someone
brings garlic clove near my nose and teaches me by pointing to it 
that it is called garlic, then subsequently confronted with the 
garlicky odor and a similar clove, I can see it and smell it <em>as 
garlic</em>. Thus perceptual awareness includes knowledge of words 
but, insofar as it is perceptual awareness, it is brought about by 
sensory contact with the object and, its properties which exists 
independently of words. </p>

<p>

The Buddhists reject this argument on the basis that the conventional
meaning of a word relates the word with the concept or the universal.
Universals or concepts cannot be objects of our perception; they 
cannot be sensed. Universals, attributes and concepts are theoretical
constructs for the Buddhists; what is sensed is the actual object, 
the exclusive particular, the ultimate existent. The Buddhists offer 
two arguments in favor of the claim that only particulars are real. 
First, knowledge by means of words or verbal testimony is very 
different from perceptual knowledge, for what we are aware of when we
hear the words “garlic is pungent” is very different from
what we are phenomenologically aware of when we smell garlic; words 
do not denote or stand-in for actual objects and can be uttered in 
the absence of any objects, but perception cannot arise in the 
absence of objects. Second, the particulars are real or existent 
because they have causal efficacy 
(<em>arthakriyāsāmarthya</em>). Only particular real garlic
can flavor one's food or ruin it, but the universal garlichood cannot
do any of these; in this sense, only the particulars are real for 
they fulfill the purposes (<em>artha</em>) of humans.</p>

<p>

The foregoing discussion shows that the epistemological debate 
between the Buddhists and the Naiyāyikas regarding the nature of
perception rests on, and brings to the fore, their metaphysical 
disagreement about the nature of universals. The Naiyāyikas are 
realists about universals; universals are objective features of the 
world that impress themselves upon minds; they are not mere figments 
of our imagination. The Naiyāyikas hold that particulars are 
qualified propertied wholes and we directly perceive them <em>as they
are</em>, without any kind of manipulation or imposition; we do not 
impose universals on property-less real particulars, rather we find 
stable, durable, relational wholes in reality that do not require any
imposition or manipulation. They argue that there is no evidence of a
world of bare particulars, as claimed by the Buddhists. Therefore 
conceptual or determinate perception does not involve distortion of 
reality; rather it presents things as they really are. To see a piece
of sandalwood as it <em>really</em> is, we do not need to see the 
sandalwood as a colorless, odorless pure particular; indeed, since 
the piece of sandalwood is <em>really</em> brown and <em>really</em> 
fragrant, to see it as a propertied whole is to see it as it 
<em>really</em> <em>is</em>.</p>

<p>

The idea that the world consists of propertied particulars seems to 
put pressure on the notion of non-conceptual perception. If there are
no indeterminate particulars, what is the object of indeterminate 
perception? Indeed some Navya-Nyāya thinkers hold that the raw 
data of perception (‘real particulars’ in the Buddhists 
sense) is too inchoate and elusive to count as objects of knowledge. 
Recently, Arindam Chakrabarti (2000), a prominent contemporary 
Navya-Nyāya thinker offered seven reasons for altogether 
eliminating non-conceptual, or immaculate perceptions as he calls 
them, from Nyāya epistemology in an attempt to understand the 
“deeper relation between direct realism and concept-enriched 
perception”. Chakrabarti's skepticism about non-conceptual 
perception as a cognitive state stems from the fact that we cannot 
assign an intentional role to the object of indeterminate perception 
because the object of non-conceptual perception is incapable of being
apperceived or directly intuited in any fashion. Chakrabarti's 
gauntlet has been picked by several Nyāya enthusiasts (Phillips,
2001 and 2004; Chadha, 2001, 2004 and 2006) and defenders of Buddhist
doctrine (Siderits, 2004). This debate brings to the fore an 
important feature of non-conceptual perception first highlighted by 
Gaṅgeśa, suggesting that while there is no direct, 
apperceptive evidence for non-conceptual perception, it is posited as
the best explanation for the availability of the qualifier (property,
feature), since the cognizing subject is not immediately aware of the
object of non-conceptual perception. Phillips (2001, p.105) presents 
Gaṅgeśa's argument for the inclusion of non-conceptual 
perception as an essential part of Nyāya epistemology:</p>

<blockquote>

…it [nirvikalpa pratyakṣa] is posited by the force of the
following inference as the first step of a two step argument.
“The perceptual cognition ‘A cow’ (for example) is
generated by a cognition of the qualifier, since it is a cognition of
an entity as qualified (by that qualifier appearing) like an
inference”. The second step takes a person's first perception of
an individual (Bessie, let us say) as a cow (i.e., as having some such
property) as the perceptual cognition figuring as the inference's
subject (<em>pakśa</em>) such that the cognizer's memory not
informed by previous cow experience could not possibly provide the
qualifier cowhood. The qualifier has to be available, and the best
candidate seems to be its perception in the raw, a qualifier
(cowhood), that is to say, not (as some are wont to misinterpret the
point) as divorced from its <em>qualificandum</em> (Bessie) but rather
as neither divorced nor joined, and, furthermore, not as qualified by
another qualifier (such as being-a-heifer) but rather just the plain,
unadorned entity. In the particular example, the entity is the
universal, cowhood, or being-a-cow, although, again, it would not be
grasped as a universal. Or as anything except itself.</blockquote>

<p>

The Navya-Nyāya notion of non-conceptual perception differs from
that of the Buddhists in many respects, two of which are very 
important. First, according to Navya-Naiyāyikas, there is no 
apperceptive evidence for non-conceptual perception, unlike the 
Buddhists who contend that conception-free awareness is necessarily 
self-aware. The Navya-Naiyāyikas, as is obvious from the quote 
above, emphasize that the evidence for a non-conceptual sensory grasp
of universals comes in the form of an inference. Second, according to
Navya-Nyāya, the object of non-conceptual perception is a 
qualifier (concept), although not given as that in the first
instance, but not a bare particular as the Buddhists hypothesize. It 
is, as the above quote explains, posited by the force of an 
inference; the ‘bare object’ of non-conceptual perception
<em>becomes</em> the qualifier in a resultant determinate perception.
While this does not satisfactorily address Chakrabarti's concern that
lack of apperceptive evidence implies that the subject cannot assign 
an intentional role to the object of non-conceptual perception, 
Chadha (2006) argues that the subject's not being in a position to 
assign an intentional role to the object of non-conceptual perception
is no hindrance to the intentionality of non-conceptual perception 
itself. Non-conceptual perception is awareness <em>of</em> a 
“non-particular individual” (Chakrabarti, 1995) and can 
be assigned the intentional role of a qualifier in virtue of the 
recognitional abilities acquired by the subject on the basis of the 
perceptual episode. The subject <em>sees</em> a non-particular 
individual but, since there is no apperceptive or conscious 
awareness, the subject does not see it <em>as</em> an instance of a 
universal or a qualifier. Chadha explicates Gaṅgeśa's 
insight that a qualifier is given as a non-particular individual, 
neither divorced from nor joined to the <em>qualificandum</em> and, 
therefore it is wrong to suggest that lack of apperceptive evidence 
implies that non-conceptual perception is not an intentional 
perceptual state.</p>

<h3><a name="MiiAdvRea">3.3 The Mīmāṃsā advance in realism</a></h3>

<p>

Kumārila argued against the Buddhist position to show that 
perception is not always devoid of concepts. In 
<em>Pratyakṣapariccheda</em>, he principally targets 
Diṅnāga's theory, while simultaneously addressing some of 
Dharmakīrti's ideas and arguments. Kumārila, like 
Naiyāyikas, holds both the two kinds of perception as valid. For
him the initial non-conceptualized perception is borne of the 
undifferentiated pure object (<em>śuddhavastu</em>) and is 
comparable to the perception of an infant and others who lack a 
language. The ‘pure object’ is the substratum for the 
generic and specific features of the object, but the subject is not 
distinctly aware of any of these and simply cognizes the object as an
indeterminate particular, as “this” or 
“something”. Although Kumārila agrees with the 
Buddhists that the object of immediate perception is inexpressible in
language, he maintains that it is different, in at least one respect,
from the real particular (<em>svalakṣaṇa</em>) of the 
Buddhists; the latter being a structure-less unitary whole, whereas 
the former is non-unitary and grasps both the particular and the 
universal aspects of the object. Otherwise, Kumārila argues, it 
could not give rise to conceptual awareness, which explicitly 
identifies such features. Diṅnāga's counterpoint to this 
is that conceptual awareness at second stage cannot be a perception, 
since it involves application of concepts and words which, in turn, 
requires memory. If we admit conceptual awareness as perception, we 
are forced to accept that a sense faculty is capable of remembering 
(since perception is a cognition brought about by the functioning of 
the sense faculty) but that cannot be the case because a sense 
faculty, being a mere instrument of cognition, is in itself 
unconscious and cannot remember anything. Kumārila admits that 
conceptual awareness is aided by memory and concepts, but argues that
that does not rob it of its perceptual character for the sense 
faculty is still functioning while in contact with the very same 
object. He further suggests that we should not expect a perceptual 
cognition to arise as soon as there is contact between a sense 
faculty and its object. He uses the analogy of entering a dimly lit 
room after walking in the blazing sun; even though the contents of 
the room are directly available to the sense faculties of the subject
who has just walked in, he does not immediately apprehend the objects
in front of him. However, the subject may become distinctly aware of 
the objects in the room and their features in the following moments. 
The perceptual character of the latter awareness is maintained so 
long as the connection between the sense faculty and the object is 
intact, even when other conceptual awarenesses or memories intervene 
between the initial contact with the object and the subsequent 
awareness. A conceptual awareness can be referred to as a perception 
even though the mind, <em>qua</em> memory, is involved because the 
functioning of the sense faculty is the factor responsible for 
arising of the awareness. Furthermore, he insists that the mind must 
be involved in all perceptions since it functions as a link between 
the sense faculty and the self; the sense faculty is turned on or 
activated by a connection with the self and, the self as the subject 
of knowledge is involved in all cognitions. He points out that even 
Buddhists do not deny this, since they hold that self-reflexive 
awareness accompanies every cognition. He contends that the Buddhists
are wrong to insist that only a cognition arising directly from the 
functioning of a sense faculty is perception; they agree that we 
perceive inner states, e.g., pleasure and pain, and if the mind is 
accepted as the operative sense faculty in the self-reflexive 
awareness of such cognitions, it follows that they should admit that 
the mind is also the sense faculty that gives rise to conceptualized 
cognitions. He, however, clarifies that not every cognition that 
follows a contact between a sense faculty and an object is a 
perception, for if one were to open one's eyes momentarily (in the 
above analogy) and construct a judgment such as “that was 
table” with eyes closed again, it would not be a perceptual 
cognition since it solely depends on the memory of a fleeting sensory
contact.</p>

<p>

Later, Dharmakīrti, using a methodology very different (and akin
to proof by contradiction) from his predecessor Diṅnāga, 
raises new problems for the Nyāya-Mīmāṃsā 
view. Assuming, he says, for the sake of the argument, that 
universals are real. Then the judgments “This is a cow,” 
“It is an animal,” relate two distinct entities, namely a
particular (or object) and a universal (or concept) arguably via a 
non-relational tie as in being substratum and superstratum, with the 
proviso that the substratum object has the power to let the universal
reside in it. This leads to all the universals (such as cowness, 
animalhood, etc) then being tied to the object by this simple and 
single power. In such a scenario, any perceptual judgment involving 
the universal cowhood as in the case of “This is a cow” 
makes subsequent judgments “This is an animal,” 
“This is a substance,” etc., superfluous. For, if one 
perceives an object along with its power to let any one universal 
reside in it, one must be able to perceive its power to attract all 
other universals that reside in it. Thus, there would be no 
distinction between “This is a cow” and “This is a 
substance”; clearly an unacceptable thesis. Matilal (1986, 
p.326) notes two points in connection with this argument. First, 
Dharmakīrti assumes that an object, or a unique particular, is 
perceived in its entirety and no part of it is left unperceived. 
Second, the realist has objectified all the universals including the 
relation-universal. If, as the realist believes, the object of 
perception—the particular—has the power to accommodate 
all universals in it, then the onus is on him to show why only a 
single universal manifests itself in a perceptual judgment. This 
concern is pertinent, especially against the Nyāya philosophers 
who admit only one single relation-universal: inherence, which 
supposedly unites all nesting universals with the object. The 
Naiyāyikas readily respond to this argument by pointing out that
the redundancy objection rests on Dharmakirti's assumption that an 
object is grasped in its entirety in perception. This assumption is 
false; perception is perspectival, we never see all sides of an 
ordinary three-dimensional object, but we still see <em>it</em>. </p>

<p>

Furthermore, Dharmakīrti's argues that conceptual or judgmental 
awareness is phenomenologically distinct from non-conceptual 
awareness. In the latter we are confronted with the object of 
perception which is vivid and immediate, while in the former no 
object is present. In the judgment “this is a cow”, even 
the ‘subject’ of the judgment does not refer to the 
object of perception, since words do not refer to perceived 
particulars but to universals which extend across space and time. 
Dharmakīrti admits that the words we apply to things have some 
objective basis in those things; we call something a cow because it 
has a certain effect, it gives milk, is gentle, or it calls forth a 
certain cognition, etc. This effect, in turn, inclines us to 
associate the word ‘cow’ with other things that have the 
same effect and we do that by jointly dissociating them from things 
that lack that effect. Universals, according to the Buddhists are 
arbitrarily constructed “exclusions” (<em>apoha</em>); 
words serve the purpose of separating things off from other objects. 
For example, the word ‘cow’ singles out a class of things
by excluding them from things they are not, all things assembled 
together under the concept “cow” are distinct from each 
other and do not share a single nature that the word 
‘cow’ names. A conceptual awareness insofar as it imputes
a word to a particular object and, therefore a universal nature it 
shares with all others of the same universal-kind, essentially 
falsifies the object. Kumārila objects to the Buddhists theory 
of universals (<em>apoha</em>) on the grounds that it is 
counterintuitive and circular. The theory of universals 
(<em>apoha</em>) contradicts our intuition that meaning of a positive
word is positive; there is nothing negative about the word 
‘cow’. A negative entity can be the meaning of a word 
only where something is negated. Moreover, if we accept that 
understanding <em>x</em> requires eliminating non-<em>x</em>, then in
turn we presuppose knowledge of non-<em>x</em>, which entails an 
understanding of non-non-<em>x</em>, and so on (Drefyus, 1997, 
p.215). The Mīmāṃsakas also take on board the 
concerns raised by the Naiyāyika philosopher Uddyotakara (c. 7th 
century CE), who questions the theory of exclusions on the specific 
grounds that it fails to offer an adequate theory of reference and 
relation between concepts and reality. He argues if the word 
‘cow’ primarily designates a negative entity, either this
entity is a cow in disguise or is different from a cow. If it is a 
cow in disguise then the Buddhist view of universals is no 
different from the Nyāya common sense realism that words are 
used to single out phenomena in the world. If the negative entity is 
different from a cow, then the word ‘cow’ does not refer 
to real cows, making it difficult to explain how any word can refer 
to real objects or classes thereof. This last point begs the question
because the Buddhist denies that words refer to the objects in the 
real world. For him words refer to universals, and that is precisely 
what the world does <em>not</em> contain. The onus is put back on the
realists to show that universals, which serve as meanings of words, 
are real properties of objects rather than imagined or mentally 
constructed features. This challenge is taken up by the 
Naiyāyikas and their position against the nominalist stand of 
both the Buddhists and the Grammarians is presented later below.</p>

<h3><a name="SaaGraNomReaObj">3.4 The Śābdika (Grammarian) nominalism and realist objections</a></h3>

<p>

Bhartṛhari, the most notable Grammarian, highlights the 
intimate relation between language, thought, and knowledge. Two 
aspects of his theory have important implications for the nature of 
perceptual experience. First, there is no non-linguistic cognition in
the world; all knowledge appears permeated by words. Though 
Bhartṛhari's theory may leave room for extraordinary, or 
other-worldly, cognitions, there is no scope for pure 
non-conceptualized perception in this world. The essence of his 
theory is: words do not designate objects in the external world 
directly, but through the intervention of universals, which are 
inherent in words. Thus universals constitute the basis of our 
knowledge of the external world, since they are intimately connected 
with language and mind on the one hand, and the world on the other. 
Given this, the Grammarians question the very possibility of 
non-conceptual perception? The second aspect is underscored by 
Kumārila who ascribes the so-called Superimposition Theory to 
Bhartṛhari (Taber, 2005, p.27), according to which, a word has 
its “own form” superimposed upon its meaning. This has 
implications for determinate conceptual perception, which (for the 
pluralists and direct realists of Mīmāṃsā and 
Nyāya persuasions) arises purely out of the object itself and 
involves discrimination and determination of its nature.</p>

<p>

Bhartṛhari's argument can be thought of as an attack, on the 
adjective ‘non-verbal’ (<em>avyapadeśyam</em>) in 
the Nyāya definition of perception, aimed at their belief that 
for cognitive comprehension language is an inessential detail. For 
him, bare sense-impressions cannot count as awarenesses because they 
are nor effective enough, nothing is accomplished by them and, they 
do not result in appreciable mental activity. Bhartṛhari gives 
an example: a man walking along a village path to approach his house 
would invariably touch some grass on the road, and in some sense this
would be tactile awareness at a pre-linguistic level 
(<em>Vākyapadīya</em>, Ch.1, verse 123). But this would not
count as an awareness unless combined with the further ability to 
sort it out or verbalize it; consciousness cannot reveal an object to
us unless we discriminate it, and the process of discrimination 
requires verbalization. What about a baby's awareness, or that of a 
mute person, asks Vātsyāyana? Bhartṛhari points out 
that a baby's sensations or a mute person's awarenesses may still 
count as cognitive because they are linguistically potent. A 
pre-linguistic state of an infant can be cognitive if and only if it 
has speech potency, which is the cause of verbal language. So also, 
in the non-conceptual perceptual awareness (in adults and even some 
animals) speech-potency is latent; it is an essential trait of human 
consciousness and the defining characteristic of cognitive awareness 
(<em>Vākyapadīya</em>, Ch.1, verse 126). All knowledge of 
what is to be done in this world depends on speech-potential; even an
infant has such knowledge due to residual traces from previous births
(<em>Vākyapadīya</em>, Ch.1, verse 121). The initial 
sensory awareness of external objects which does not grasp any 
special features of them, nonetheless illuminates them in a 
non-specific manner as mere things by such expressions as 
‘this’ or ‘that’ (Bhartṛhari; 123 and 
124). Thus, insofar as the initial sensation is an awareness, it can 
be verbalized. The following analogy is offered as an argument for 
positing the presence of speech-seed (verbal disposition, as some 
modern philosophers call it) in pre-linguistic awareness: think about
the experience of trying, but failing, to remember a verse heard 
before. Bhartṛhari claims that the entire verse exists in the 
cognitive faculty as speech-potency but because of lack of other 
contributory factors there is no verbalization. Similarly, a 
non-linguistic experience of a mute-person is an awareness because of
the presence of verbal disposition or speech-seed even though there 
is no actualization of speech. There are no non-conceptual 
perceptions, because ordinary objects are not given to us without a 
concept (<em>vikalpa</em>) or some mode of presentation; 
verbalization makes the concept explicit. There are infinite concepts
associated with an object, none integral to it. However, we always 
perceive an object in <em>a</em> concept as an instantiation of a 
universal; it is a cow, white, bovine, four-legged, etc. The point to
note is that concepts or universals (<em>vikalpa-s</em>) are 
word-generated and superimposed on the objects; there are no 
‘thing-universals’ or real universals over and above 
these. Bhartṛhari's defends linguistic nominalism, according to
which, words are the only universals that exist; thing-universals are
word-generated illusions. As Matilal remarks, for Bhartṛhari 
there is not much of a distinction between words and concepts, they 
are two sides of the same coin (Matilal, 1986, 396).</p>

<p>

Naiyāyikas and Mīmāṃsakas, the common sense 
realists, raise specific objections to the Grammarian view on the 
grounds that it is not borne by experience. We have separate 
awarenesses of words and universals. While we may not perceive 
something as a cow prior to acquiring the word ‘cow,’ we 
are surely aware of cowness before we acquire the linguistic 
expression, just as we are aware of and can discriminate shades of 
red even before we acquire the names of some of those shades. A 
non-conceptual awareness of the object is implied by the subsequent 
occurrence of a conceptual awareness with determinate content. 
Kumārila also points to other phenomena which indicate that the 
awareness of the meaning of a word (the object) is independent and 
distinct from the word itself. Furthermore, awareness of the meaning 
and that of the word are usually different kinds of representations; 
there is no possibility of confusing or conflating these. 
Kumārila brings to attention linguistic phenomena that reinforce
the point that words and meanings must be distinct representations, 
e.g., homonymy, synonymy, categorizing and recognizing grammatical 
parts of speech, etc. The ability to distinguish and discriminate 
types is perhaps enhanced by knowledge of language and concepts, but 
is not completely dependent on it. Those who are not trained in music
can certainly hear the difference between distinct notes, even though
they are unable to identify them by name. Vātsyāyana also 
appeals to the ordinary experience of people who are conversant with 
words. Ordinarily, words are apprehended as names of objects. The 
knowledge of the word-object association comes after the perceptual 
knowledge derived through sense-object contact. Such contact results 
in a perceptual awareness which, in turn, provides the occasion for 
recalling the appropriate word, if indeed the appropriate word exists
in the experiencer's linguistic repertoire. Perceptual knowledge is 
antecedent to verbal knowledge and cannot owe its existence to words.
Vācaspati Miśra specifically objects to Bhartṛhari's 
claim that infants and adults who lack a language perceive objects by
memory impressions of their names from previous births. Objects are 
vividly and clearly given to us in perception, but the 
memory-impressions of previous births are at best vague and 
indistinct. Vācaspati Miśra asks, “How can such a 
vague and unclear thing be identified with a clear and distinct 
perception?” 
(<em>Nyāyavārttikatātparyaṭīkā</em>, 
p. 127). His other argument against Bhartṛhari is the obvious 
point that words do not necessarily refer to their objects, for 
example words in quotation marks do not refer to objects, only to 
themselves. Moreover, if the word and its denotation were identical, 
a blind man would grasp red or redness when he grasps the word 
‘red’ and a deaf person would grasp the word 
‘red’ when he grasps a red thing 
(<em>Nyāyavārttikatātparyaṭīkā</em>, 
p. 129).</p>

<p>

The Naiyāyikas also have a general response to 
nominalists—Buddhists as well as Grammarians. They posit 
monadic universals that correspond to natural and metaphysical kinds 
and one dyadic universal, viz. inherence. The main nominalist 
objection is that once we accept real universals in our ontology we 
risk overpopulating the world with entities corresponding to every 
expression that designates a property. For example, if we accept 
horsehood and cowhood as universals, we also need to accept 
universalhood as another universal. The Naiyāyikas propose that 
not every expression which designates a property generates an 
objective universal (<em>jāti</em>); some property-expressions 
correspond to subjectively constructed categories 
(<em>upādhi</em>), which though useful for analysis, are not 
ontologically real. Uddyotakara argues that to correspond to a real 
universal a general term must meet two conditions: (i) a general term
should be based on a ground, which accounts for the common awareness 
of a number of different objects, that makes the application of the 
term possible, and (ii) that ground should be a simple 
(non-compound), unitary property or entity that cannot be analyzed or
explained away otherwise (Commentary on 
<em>Nyāya-sūtra</em>, 2.2.65). Universalhood is a 
<em>bogus</em> universal; it violates the second condition. There is 
no simple basis or ground for universalhood as opposed to universals 
such as cowhood and horsehood; the ground of being one-in-many can be
analyzed in terms of inherence. The same applies to universals like 
‘barefooted’, ‘cook’, ‘reader’ 
etc.; the basis for their application is presence of compound 
features such as bare feet, etc. However, this stratagem forces the 
Naiyāyikas to admit that many general terms designate bogus 
universals and, consequently, they start succumbing to the nominalist
pressure. Matilal (1986, p. 420–421) notes that there is 
another way in which it happens to Navya-Nyāya: A real universal
<em>must</em> partake of the nature of ‘one-in-many’. The
Navya-Naiyāyika, Udayana (c. 10th century CE), lists a third 
necessary condition for disqualifying a property from being regarded 
as a real universal. Under this condition, an abstract property that 
belongs only to one individual is also a bogus universal even though 
it is simple and unanalyzable; skyness in the sky is bogus because it
is only a nominal attribute. However, since both cowhood and skyness 
are simple properties, they are grasped <em>as such</em> in 
perception without further qualification. In this sense, 
Naiyāyikas maintain that some real universals are directly 
perceptible. When we see a cow, we do not necessarily see 
‘it’ as a ‘cow’, the cow and the cowness are 
not given as separate entities in our awareness, rather they appear 
fused. This leads to the peculiar Nyāya view that real 
universals and basic properties are grasped in our awareness as 
‘epistemic firsts’ or ultimates (Matilal, 1986, p.421). 
Gaṅgeśa calls such perception, in which universals are 
grasped as such, non-conceptual (<em>nirvikalpaka</em>) perception.</p>

<h3><a name="AdvVedComHinRea">3.5 The Advaita Vedānta: a compromise on Hindu realism</a></h3>

<p>

The Advaita Vedānta theory compromises on the realism of earlier
classical Hindu philosophy. Their early view on perception is akin to
the Buddhists, although arrived at from a different perspective. 
Maṇḍana Miśra says:</p>

<blockquote>
  Perception is first, without mental construction, and has for its
  object the bare thing. The constructive cognitions which follow it
  plunge into particulars. (<em>Brahma-Siddhi</em>, 71.1-2)
</blockquote>

<p>

He draws a distinction between perceptual cognition and constructive 
cognition, but is careful to use <em>vikalpa-buddhi</em>, rather than
<em>savikalpaka pratyakṣa</em>, for the latter cognition. For 
him perception is always non-conceptual (<em>nirvikalpaka</em>) 
perception and it is of a universal, indeed of the highest universal,
Being (<em>sat</em>). According to early Vedāntins, the real is 
bereft of all character since its nature is non-differentiated 
consciousness or Brahman. Therefore, perceptual cognition, which 
presents the real, must be non-conceptual or indeterminate for it is 
the knowledge of the existence of a thing without any qualifications 
or predications. Maṇḍana Miśra also denies the 
thesis that non-conceptual (<em>nirvikalpaka</em>) perception is 
non-verbal. This surprising claim is clearly owed to 
Bhartṛhari's influence, as is evidenced by the example used by 
Maṇḍana Miśra in the argument. Confronted by an 
opponent with the claim that verbal knowledge involves duality and 
relation, and therefore must involve concepts, Maṇḍana 
Miśra replies that verbal knowledge is not necessarily 
relational: a baby's non-verbal knowledge of its mother's breast, 
grasps it merely as ‘this’ (of course we do not assume 
that the baby articulates the word ‘this’; the word, as 
in Bhartṛhari's account, has a more subtle form in the baby's 
mind) and, therefore, the highest knowledge of the Ultimate reality 
(<em>Brahman</em>) in which there is no duality, no relations, no 
concepts, may still be verbal.</p>

<p>

Neo Advaita-Vedāntins, however, accept a distinction between 
non-conceptual (<em>nirvikalpaka</em>) perception and conceptual 
(<em>nirvikalpaka</em>) perceptions from empirical or practical 
(<em>vyāvahārika</em>) standpoint; from ultimate 
(<em>paramārthika</em>) standpoint such distinction is 
untenable. A brief description of conceptual 
(<em>viṣayagata</em>, Advaita-Vedānta 
term for <em>savikalpaka</em>) perception will help put in 
perspective Applebaum's (1982) reconstruction of their notion of 
non-conceptual (<em>nirvikalpaka</em>) perception later. Determinate 
perception is the result of the activity of mind (<em>manas</em>) or 
<em>antaḥkaraṇa</em> (literally translated as 
‘inner vehicle’)—the terms are frequently used 
interchangeably. Advaitins maintain that the mind 
(<em>antaḥkaraṇa)</em> ‘goes out’ through the
respective sense organ (the eye, say) and pervades the object of 
attention. As a result of this contact, the object presents itself as
data to the receptive mind (<em>antaḥkaraṇa</em>) which, 
in turn, transforms into mental state (<em>vṛtti</em>) 
(Bilimoria, 1980, p.38). As soon as the data are presented to inner 
faculty, there is an identification of consciousness associated with 
the mental state (<em>antaḥkaraṇa-vṛtti</em>) with 
the consciousness associated with the object. To say that vṛtti
and data are identified is to say that the form of the mental state, 
if all goes well, corresponds one-to-one with the form of the object;
the mental state is a reflection of the object of perception, and as 
such is non-different from the object. Thus results a determinate 
judgment (<em>vṛttijñāna</em>) of the form 
“this is a jar”. Furthermore, according to them, we do 
not perceive our mental states; we directly perceive the objects 
themselves. Bilimora explains,</p>

<blockquote>
  The <em>vṛtti</em> in the form of the object impresses itself
  as it were in the mode of the subject itself, and thereby comes to
  be apprehended, but as a predicate—and not as the pure
  subject-content which is the “I-notion”—in the
  subject's apperception”. (Bilimoria, 1980, p.41)
</blockquote>

<p>

The initial mental state subsides and the subject becomes directly 
aware of the object itself; the cognition is self-evident to the 
subject, just like the cognition of pleasure and pain. In this 
reflective stage, the mind (<em>antaḥkaraṇa</em>) 
integrates the mental contents corresponding to the object with 
familiar or recognized percepts. Determinate perception of the 
totality of the object occurs with the completion of the assimilative
process.</p>

<p>

David Applebaum (1982) notes that Bilimoria's discussion of the 
Advaitin's notion of perception focuses on the necessary conditions 
or criteria for valid or veridical perceptions. According to him, 
this approach while justified in the light of perception's inclusion 
among the means of knowledge (<em>pramāṇa-s</em>) is 
mistaken because it only focuses on sensation as a species of mental 
state (<em>vṛtti</em>). For the Advaitin, sensation is not a 
mode exhausted by the judgmental content of a mental state 
(<em>vṛtti</em>), it has epistemic value independently of its 
role in judgmental perception. Applebaum quotes from the Upanisadic 
texts to support this view:</p>

<blockquote>
  <em>Manas</em> is for men a means of bondage or liberation …
  of bondage if it clings to objects of perception
  (<em>visayasangi</em>), and of liberation if not directed towards
  these objects (<em>nirviṣayam</em>). (Applebaum, 1982,
  p.203)
</blockquote>

<p>

Non-conceptual perception furnishes us with knowledge of pure 
existence (<em>sanmātra</em>) rather than with protodata to 
construct imagined particulars. Therefore, it is not simply a prior 
stage of conceptual perception and so also not necessarily a mental 
state produced in cooperation with the object. Applebaum (1982, 
p.204) suggests that non-conceptual perception in this sense focuses 
attention on sensing, in which consciousness turns its attention 
inwards to the activity of the sense-organs resulting in deepening 
and broadening their proprioceptive content. Proprioception, he 
claims, points the way to the soul or self (<em>ātman</em>); 
mind (<em>antaḥkaraṇa</em>) returns to its presentational
activity, its function of monitoring and unfolding the sensory 
manifold to create conditions for the emergence of self 
(<em>ātman</em>), which according to the Advaitin, is identical 
with the Ultimate reality (<em>Brahman</em>). In non-conceptual 
(<em>nirvikalpaka</em>) perception, consciousness is returned to 
itself and opens up the possibility of manifesting or seeing the 
<em>Seer</em> (<em>ātman</em>) or knowing the Ultimate reality 
(<em>Brahman</em>).</p>

<h2><a name="ConConKnoUni">4. Constructing Concepts or Knowing Universals?</a></h2>

<p>

The problem of universals, as we have seen, is at the epicentre of the
debate between Hindu philosophers and their Buddhist opponents. The
doctrine of exclusion (<i>apoha</i>) is the Buddhist attempt to
account for the relation between concepts and sensory content. The
doctrine of apoha basically claims that the term "cow" does not refer
to the universal "cowness" or "cowhood" because there is no such
general entity; rather, the term refers to every individual that is
not a non-cow. In a recent paper Tillemans (2011) draws a useful
distinction between two versions of the apoha doctrine: the top-down
approach and the bottom-up approach. The former is presented by
Diṅnāga who is also credited with introducing the doctrine
of <i>apoha</i>. According to the top-down version, the negation
operator in the exclusion, the <i>apoha</i> somehow manages pick out
real particulars in the world while avoiding any commitment to
universals. <i>Apoha</i>, in this sense functions like a sense or
meaning, a not-non X expressed by the word X, which enables us to pick
out real particulars while at the same time avoiding a commitment to
real universals in virtue of the special features of double
negation. The latter is presented by Dharmakīrti who uses the
causal approach to link language and the world. According to this
version of the doctrine, <i>apoha</i> provides a way to bridge the gap
between sensory perception of particulars and expressions of belief
and judgement in thought and language. The top-down version of the
apoha doctrine was subjected to various criticisms from the Hindu
realists, especially by Kumārila who criticised the doctrine on
grounds of circularity. The thought is that in order to understand the
exclusion class of non-cows, we have to first have an idea that some
particulars are cows. In other words, one must be able to refer to
cows before one can refer to non-cows. The bottom-up approach
developed by Dharmakīrti was basically a response to this
circularity worry. His version of the apoha doctrine is developed as a
strategy to bridge the gap between non-conceptual perceptual content
and conceptual content. Dreyfus (2011) develops Dharmakīrti's
naturalized account of concept formation by elucidating the mediating
role of representations that link reality to
conceptuality. Representations, in this sense, stand for agreed-upon
fictional commonalties and are projected on to discrete individuals
(Dreyfus, 2011, 216).</p>

<p>The top-down approach is promising but there is a concern that a bottom-up account might not succeed in offering a completely reductive story about concepts. In response to this concern, Ganeri (2011) develops a hybrid account that
combines the resources of the top-down and bottom-up approaches. The
idea is that we work up from basic sentience and down from the
language of reference and predication to meet at the middle-ground of
feature-placing in the formation of proto-concepts (Ganeri, 2011,
244). These proto-concepts show that sense experience can normatively
constrain belief and judgement, though it does not give us a
full-blown reductive account of concepts in non-conceptual terms.</p>

<p>

The doctrine of <i>apoha</i> and Ganeri's hybrid version may well be
ingenious, but it is a far cry from what would satisfy the Hindu
realist. According to Nyāya-Vaiśeṣika, universals
exist in this very world of ours. We do not need to construct concepts
from sensory content, rather universals are part and parcel of this
sensory content. Chadha (2014, 289) explains that according to
Nyāya, for a universal to exist all that is required is that it
be exemplified; in a Quinean twist – to be is to be
exemplified. There is no further requirement that it exist
independently as an abstract entity or in Plato’s heaven;
universals are given directly in perception insofar as their loci are
perceived.</p>

<p>
It is useful to think of a universal in this sense as a non-particular
individual (Chakrabarti, 1995). Examples abound: Dusky is what many
particulars are, though they may be spatiotemporally separated by many
miles and years; rainy is what several days of the year can be at the
same time in different places and at different times in the same
place. If we are not thinking of universals as abstract entities in
Platonic heaven or in the mind, but as individuals out there in the
world, it is easier to grasp the idea that they can be perceived. The
Nyāya equation of universals and properties might tempt one to
think that Nyāya conceives of universals as natural properties in
David Lewis’ sense of the term (Lewis, 1983), but such is not
the case. Nyāya universals are as robust as Armstrong’s
universals: they capture facts of resemblance and the causal powers of
things. Naiyāyikas will happily endorse Armstrong’s
‘One over Many’ argument as the main reason for including
universals in their ontology (Armstrong, 1978). Udayana puts the point
thus: “Causality is regulated by universals, so is
effect-hood. It is a natural universal if there is no obstruction [in
establishing it]; it is a conditional [nominal] universal when we have
to establish it through effort [construction?]”
(<i>Kiraṇāvālī</i>, in Praśastapāda
1971, p. 23).</p>

<p>

Although Gautama mentions universals in
the <i>Nyāyasūtras</i> as the meaning of general terms,there
is no explanation in these original <i>sūtras</i> as to how they
might be known. Praśastapāda was the first to argue that
universals are sensorily given. He argues that universals, when they
inhere in perceptible loci (e.g., ‘cowness’ in an
individual cow), are perceived by the same sense organs that also
perceive those loci (<i>Padārthadharmasaṃgraha</i>,
99). This thesis is explicated in detail by Jayanta Bhaṭṭa
in <i>Nyāyamañjarī</i> where he argues against the
Buddhist nominalists as well as the holistic monist pan-linguist
Bhartṛhari and his followers. Jayanta makes an allusion to the
view that universals are given in indeterminate perception, a view
later developed in detail by Gaṅgeśa
in <i>Tattvacintāmaṇi</i> (the chapter on
“Perception,” the section on “Indeterminate
Perception”). Most of Jayanta's arguments against the Buddhist
nominalist are discussed in detail in Chakrabarti (2006), however, he
does not discuss the issue about universals being given in
indeterminate perception. This is, as we have mentioned in the above
sections, because Chakrabarti is sceptical about the coherence of the
notion of indeterminate perception. Chadha (2014) argues that
Gaṅgeśa makes a unique contribution to this debate in
proposing the idea that universals or qualifiers are given as objects
in indeterminate perception. He spells out his argument in terms of
qualifiers rather than real universals, because the logical and
epistemological role of a real universal is the same as that of a
simple nominal property. Gaṅgeśa is concerned with basic,
unanalyzable properties that can be grasped as such in our
awareness. Basic properties in this sense are simple; they can be
grasped without further qualification. They are, according to
Nyāya, the ‘epistemic firsts’ comparable to
non-conceptual perception in Buddhist
epistemology. Gaṅgeśa’s argument is presented by
Bhattacharya (1993, pp. 10-11) using a specific form of inference
(<i>parārthānumāna</i>) developed in Nyāya for
convincing others. It has a five-proposition structure:</p>

<ol> 
<li>Proposition: The determinate perception of the form ‘a
cow’ (or ‘that’s a cow’) is produced by the
cognition of the qualifier. </li>

<li>Reason: Because this is a qualificative cognition.</li>

<li>Pervasion with an example: Every qualificative cognition is
produced by a prior cognition of the qualifier, for example,
inference.</li>

<li>Application: The perception of the form ‘a cow’ is a
qualificative cognition.</li>

<li>Conclusion: Hence, it is produced by the cognition of the
qualifier.</li>

</ol>

<p>
The weight of the argument rests on the third
sentence. Gaṅgeśa supports it offering various examples of
qualificative cognition, namely inference, recognition, analogy,
verbal testimony, and so on. The point is that unless some awareness
of dung is present in a person, (s)he cannot infer that there is dung
on the hill on the basis of seeing some animals grazing on the
hill. Universals like fireness and dungness are given directly in
indeterminate perception. Gaṅgeśa’s argument
maintains a causal uniformity among pramāna-generated cognitions
of an entity as qualified (Phillips and Tatacharya 2004,
p. 398). However, there is a problem: if anything that is known
through a qualifier requires a prior cognition of the qualifier, there
will be a regress of cognitions. Gaṅgeśa’s answer is
that an indeterminate perception blocks the threat of such a regress,
because the qualifier is then grasped directly rather than through
another qualifier. In other words, the object is perceived through the
property, but the property itself is perceived directly rather than
through another property. The indeterminate perception, which precedes
the determinate perception of an object through a mode, that is, as
possessing a certain property, is not itself a perception through a
mode. Simply put, we need to grasp the universal cowness in order to
have an awareness of a particular as qualified by cowness. Chadha
(2014) argues that Gaṅgeśa’s argument thus shows that
the postulate of indeterminate perception of universals is a necessary
requirement for realism.</p>


<h2><a name="PerIll">5. Perceptual Illusion</a></h2>

<p>

The skeptics challenge strikes at the claim made by the 
Naiyāyikas that perception should be non-erroneous 
(<em>avyabhichāri</em>) and well-ascertained or free from doubt 
(<em>vyavasāyātmaka</em>). They ask: how do we distinguish 
between veridical perceptions and the non-veridical ones? In case of 
a perceptual doubt, say, seeing something at a distance which looks 
like a pole or an old tree-trunk, we are uncertain which it is but 
are <em>a priori</em> sure it cannot be both. In case of perceptual 
illusion, I see a snake but I misperceive as there is only a rope in 
front of me. Illusoriness of the experience (seeing a snake) is 
exposed with reference to another veridical experience (seeing a 
rope), but again, we are <em>a priori</em> sure that both cannot be 
true together. Then, the Buddhist skeptic, Vasubandhu, raises the 
ante with the question: could they not both be false simultaneously? 
The skeptical argument is premised on a denial of the realist thesis 
that experiences refer to a mind-independent reality. Vasubandhu's 
argument for idealism appears right at the beginning of 
<em>Vimśatikā</em>, when he states:</p>

<blockquote>
  This [the external world] is consciousness only, because there is
  appearance of non-existent things, just as a person with cataracts
  sees non-existent hairs, moons et cetera. (Feldman, 2005, p. 529).
</blockquote>

<p>

Vasubandhu offers many other examples of dreams, delusions, 
hallucinations, etc., where we are aware of non-existent objects that
are products of our imagination and not objects external to the mind.
If it is possible for awareness to create its own object and then 
grasp it (as in a dream) then, Vasubandhu argues, everything that we 
seem to be aware of could be a making of awareness.</p>

<p>

The standard reply to this view appeals to the intuition that 
illusory experience is parasitic on veridical experience. The 
Naiyāyika, Vātsyāyana explains that an erroneous 
cognition depends on a principal cognition as its basis. “This 
is a man” for a tree-trunk, which is not a man, has for its 
basis a principal cognition of a man. If a man has never been 
perceived in the past, an erroneous cognition of a man, in what is 
not a man, can never be produced 
(<em>Nyāya-Sūtra-Bhāṣya</em>, 4.2.35). 
A similar argument is put forth by the Advaita-Vedanta founder 
Śankara. He challenges Vasubandhu's view on the ground that it 
is incoherent; when the Buddhists say “that which is the 
content of an internal awareness appears <em>as though</em> 
external,” they are</p>

<blockquote>
  assuming the existence of an external thing even while they deny it
  … For they use the phrase ‘as though’ …
  because they become aware of a cognition appearing externally
  … For nobody speaks thus: Viṣnumitra appears like the
  son of a barren woman.
  (<em>Brahma-Sūtra-Bhāṣya</em>, 2.2.28)
</blockquote>

<p>

Feldman (2005, p. 534) argues that this does not suffice to defeat 
Vasubandhu's idealism. The illusory experience of <em>x</em>, no 
doubt requires a memory impression which can be produced by a 
previous cognition, but there is no further requirement that the 
previous experience be veridical, because such impressions can be 
produced by illusory experiences. Feldman uses the case of someone 
who has only experienced snakes in dreams. He can mistake a rope for 
a snake, because the previous dream experience provides the necessary
memory impression. Feldman's argument ignores the gravity of the 
concern raised by Vātsyāyana and Śankara, however. 
They reject Vasubandhu's argument on the grounds that we cannot 
imagine (dream, hallucinate, etc) an absolutely unreal thing, like a 
barren woman's son. The Nyāya theory of imagination, working in 
the background here, says that to imagine something is to superimpose
or attribute properties belonging to one kind of thing to a thing of 
different kind, provided that there is some resemblance between the 
two kinds of objects (Uddyotakara's 
<em>Nyāya-Sūtra-Bhāṣya</em>, 3.1.1). 
For example, to imagine a centaur is to attribute a property 
belonging to the human-kind to a thing of the horse-kind. There is 
some general resemblance between the two kinds: both are animals and 
have legs. However, an ‘absolutely unreal’ thing can have
no properties, and hence <em>a fortiori</em> no properties in common 
with an existing thing. They, therefore, cannot be an object of 
imagination.</p>

<p>

Uddyotakara presents an even stronger argument against the skeptics. 
In his <em>Nyāya-Vārttika</em> he turns Vasubandhu's own 
argument against him. Uddyotakara asks: how do we know that the 
object of a dream experience is non-existent? Vasubandhu accepts that
the dreamer does not know that he is dreaming; the knowledge that the
object is non-existent occurs only when he awakens and no longer 
apprehends the object. If non-apprehension of an object in the waking
state is required to support the claim that the objects of dream 
experience do not really exist out there, then apprehension in the 
waking state must be an indicator of their existence, otherwise there
would be no contrast between what is apprehended and what is not 
(<em>Nyāya-Vārttika</em>, 4.2.33). If there is no such 
contrast, then Vasubandhu's argument fails because there is no 
support for the claim that objects of dream experiences do not exist 
in the external world. And, if there is such a contrast between 
apprehension and non-apprehension, then at least some external 
objects must exist. Clearly, Vasubandhu's argument for thesis of 
universal delusion (or idealism) does not succeed completely, nor are
the realists totally defeated.</p>

<p>

We close this entry on the note that <em>Sūtra-s</em> were 
primarily composed in the seven centuries from 5<sup>th</sup> BCE to 
2<sup>nd</sup> CE and, thereafter, for the next millennium and more, 
the philosophical work was carried forward by <em>Sūtra</em> 
commentators (<em>tikākār-s</em>) 
from respective schools. This latter period saw these epistemological
debates rage among scholars from these schools. Note also that there 
is no consensus on the dates given here; most Western scholars accept
these, while Indian schools place them further back in antiquity.</p>
