<div id="preamble">

<p>

While the French Franciscan Peter Auriol (ca. 1280–1322) has not
attracted as much attention as has his slightly younger contemporary
William Ockham, nevertheless on many topics Auriol was probably just as
influential among fourteenth century thinkers as was the Venerable
Inceptor. Often explicitly rejecting the ideas of Thomas Aquinas, Henry
of Ghent, and most importantly John Duns Scotus, Auriol created
interesting, innovative, and frequently controversial positions over a
whole range of philosophical and theological issues — not least in his
theory of cognition — and many of his positions set the terms of
debate for later thinkers like Gregory of Rimini and John
Capreolus.</p>

<h2><a name="LifWor">1. Life and Works</a></h2>

<p>

As with many of his contemporaries, we know very few dates with
certainty in the life of Peter Auriol (a.k.a. Peter Auriole, Peter
Aureol, Petrus Aureoli, the <em>Doctor Facundus</em>). On the basis of
his later career it seems reasonable to suppose that Auriol was born
around 1280, and we have evidence that he originated in the region near
the city of Cahors in France. We know that Auriol joined the Franciscan
order in the order's province of Aquitania, and we surmise that this
took place sometime before 1300. From the structure of the contemporary
Franciscan educational system we can deduce that he studied in Paris
sometime in the first decade of the fourteenth century, but evidence
that some scholars have presented that Auriol heard Scotus in Paris or
was definitely in Paris in 1304 is inconclusive. Auriol's first written
work, dealing with the issue of Franciscan poverty (<em>Tractatus de
paupertate et usu paupere</em>), seems to have been composed in 1311 or
at latest early 1312. In the latter year we know that Auriol was
teaching in Bologna, presumably at the Franciscan convent in that city.
It was here that he authored his <em>Tractatus de principiis
naturae</em> (<em>Treatise on the principles of nature</em>), his only
non-theological work. By the end of 1314, Auriol was in Toulouse, again
apparently teaching at the Franciscan convent, and it seems that the
two treatises that he authored in support of the Immaculate Conception
of the Virgin Mary (and in opposition to Dominican critics of that
view) stem from this time (<em>Tractatus de conceptione Beatae Mariae
Virginis</em> and <em>Repercussorium</em>). In one or both of these
cities, Auriol must have also been lecturing on the standard medieval
theological textbook, the <em>Sentences</em> of Peter Lombard, and his
massive commentary on the first book of the <em>Sentences</em>, his
<em>Scriptum super primum Sententiarum</em> — more than 1100 folio
pages in its early modern printing (Rome 1596) — was almost certainly
substantially finished by the autumn of 1316 when Auriol arrived in
Paris, sent by the Franciscan order to earn his doctorate. Auriol read
the <em>Sentences</em> at Paris 1316–18. No less a figure than Pope
John XXII, Auriol's mentor, wrote to the Chancellor of Paris in a
letter dated July 14, 1318, asking that Auriol be granted the
doctorate. The letter served its purpose, and by late 1318 he was the
Franciscan regent master in theology there. Auriol served as regent
master in Paris until 1320 or 1321, lecturing on the Bible (from which
resulted several extant biblical commentaries), and holding at least
one series of quodlibetal disputations. In 1321, he was elevated by
John XXII to the position of Archbishop of Aix-en-Provence, but Auriol
died soon after taking office, probably on January 22, 1322. (See, for
more details, Teetaert 1935, and esp. Buytaert 1952).</p>

<p>

As should be clear from the above, Auriol's extant works are
predominantly theological in nature, having been composed in connection
with his duties as a theological student and teacher. Nevertheless,
especially his commentary on Peter Lombard's <em>Sentences</em> is a
treasure trove of philosophical thought spanning a vast range of issues
in metaphysics, epistemology and philosophy of mind, natural
philosophy, and ethics; it is in addition his most important and
influential work. We possess several versions of Auriol's
<em>Sentences</em> commentary. Besides the <em>Scriptum</em>, which, as
mentioned above, was mostly composed before Auriol arrived in Paris in
the autumn of 1316, we have <em>reportationes</em> (student
transcripts) of lectures that Auriol held on all four books of the
<em>Sentences</em>, some of which have obviously been reworked to one
degree or another by Auriol himself and some of which are still found
only in medieval manuscripts. A version of his commentary on books
II-IV was published in Rome in 1605 (along with Auriol's single
<em>Quodlibet</em> of sixteen questions). In part because the project
to critically edit all of Auriol's works has been initiated only
recently, the complex relationship between these published texts and
other versions, found only in manuscripts, as well as the relationship
between the published
<em>Scriptum</em> and the extant <em>reportationes</em> on book I of
the <em>Sentences,</em> is not entirely clear. (See however, Nielsen
2002; Schabel 2000a, pp. 67–76; Schabel 2000b; Duba 2000; for more
information on Auriol's works, see the bibliography on the Peter Auriol
Homepage (Other Internet Resources).)</p>

<h2><a name="ChaAurThoSomNotPos">2. The Character of Auriol's Thought and Some Noteworthy Positions</a></h2>

<p>

Auriol's thought is relentlessly systematic; one finds certain basic
ideas or devices that crop up time and again in extremely varied
philosophical and theological contexts. Given this, it seems clear that
at an early stage in his career Auriol settled on these basic ideas and
devices as those best representing his fundamental convictions, and
then applied them rigorously, so that his philosophy and theology
emerge from them like spokes from a hub. As a consequence, Auriol's
thought has the appearance of being extremely unified. </p>

<p>

Auriol also exhibits throughout his works a pronounced historical
bent. That is to say, when dealing with nearly every philosophical or
theological issue, he takes as his point of departure a detailed
analysis of earlier and contemporary ideas on the matter at hand,
offering for the most part accurate summaries of other positions and
generally perceptive critiques. On the basis of this analysis of
earlier positions, Auriol's own thought often takes shape as he
proposes positions that have the goal of avoiding the pitfalls he sees
in his predecessors' ideas. A recent study of Auriol's citation
practice in his <em>Scriptum</em> (Schabel 2009) has shown
that the top five university authors explicitly cited are, in reverse
order: Durand of St. Pourcain, Hervaeus Natalis, Henry of Ghent, Thomas
Aquinas, and John Duns Scotus. While these were the authors who clearly
had the greatest impact on Auriol's thought, he responded throughout
his works to many other theologians, including William of Ware, Godfrey
of Fontaines, Bonaventure, Richard of Mediavilla (Middleton), Thomas
Wylton, and Giles of Rome. Moreover, Auriol is clearly extremely
well-versed in ancient and Arabic thought. (See e.g., Duba 2001.)</p>

<p>

Finally, Auriol is well known for proposing unusual and sometimes
radical solutions to traditional problems. This was one of the reasons
why Auriol's thought was so provocative to his contemporaries and to
readers right into the seventeenth century. Recent research has
pointed to several areas of Auriol's thought as particularly
innovative. Among these areas can be mentioned the following.</p>

<h3><a name="Cat">2.1 The Categories</a></h3>

<p>

Auriol maintained that only five of the ten Aristotelian categories
actually exist in the extra-mental world (substance, quality,
quantity, action, and passion), the other five (relation, place, time,
position, and state/habit) being merely conceptual or mind-dependent,
i.e.  resulting from an intellect conceiving one of the actual
categories to be other than it is in extra-mental reality. Thus, the
conceptual categories exist only potentially, but not actually, in
extra-mental reality; it is possible for the intellect, upon
acquaintance with one of the actual categories in extra-mental
reality, to form the concept of the corresponding conceptual category
(on Auriol's ideas on the category most broadly, see Amerini
2014). This theory has been studied most thoroughly with regard to
Auriol's ideas concerning the category of relation (cf. e.g.,
Henninger 1989, pp. 150–73; Brower 2014, section 3.1; Friedman
2013, pp. 550–56). In this context, Auriol maintains that real
relations are conceptual in nature, not existing in extra-mental
reality, and hence dependent upon the activity of the mind; the three
types of real relation originate from the intellect's acquaintance
with respectively quantity (e.g., a relation of equality), quality
(e.g., a relation of similarity), and action and passion (e.g., a
relation of causality). Moreover, Auriol, in stark contrast to the
medieval tradition before him, thinks of relations as
being <em>between</em> two terms, and not in a subject towards a
term. While the impact of Auriol's ideas on the categories has not
been studied in any depth, nevertheless it is interesting that Gregory
of Rimini devotes a great deal of his discussion of the category of
relation to a thorough attack on Auriol's view (Henninger 1989,
p. 173; for Auriol's more general views on the ontology of accidents
as well as some reaction to those views, see Pasnau 2008).</p>

<h3><a name="ConBei">2.2 The Concept of Being</a></h3>

<p>

Auriol modified Scotus' view on the univocity of the concept of
being. While accepting Scotus' view that ‘being’ is
univocal both between God and creatures and between substance and
accidents, Auriol nevertheless heavily criticized Scotus for
maintaining that being was contracted to the most general genera
through various “qualitative differences” that themselves
were not included under the concept of being; on Scotus' view, being
itself became like a genus that was contracted through an outside
difference.  Auriol rejected this view on the grounds that this
“outside difference” was an illusion; according to Auriol,
nothing escapes the concept of being. Instead Auriol maintains that
the concept of being is an
<em>indeterminate</em> concept that grasps all beings at once and
equally. This concept of being itself has no determinate content;
instead it contains within itself implicitly all other concepts that
the intellect could possibly form. Being, then, for Auriol is not
contracted to its inferiors through any added difference, but merely
through explicating what is already contained implicitly and
indeterminately in the concept of being (Brown 1964; Brown 1965; Goris
2002; Pickavé 2004; Aertsen 2012, pp. 433–56). As with many
other topics, the history of the reception of Auriol's view on the
univocity of the concept of being remains to be written, but the
important fifteenth century Thomist, John Capreolus, copied half of
his eleven page treatment of this issue verbatim from
Auriol's <em>Scriptum</em> only to reject Auriol's view in favor of a
more Thomistic one. (See Brown 1964, p. 6, esp. n. 10.)</p>

<h3><a name="FutConDivFor">2.3 Future Contingents and Divine Foreknowledge</a></h3>

<p>

Auriol developed influential theories on future contingents and divine
foreknowledge. These take their starting point in two convictions that
Auriol firmly holds. First, he maintains that immutability and
necessity are mutually implicative, and thus, since God is immutable,
if he were to know the future, the future would be necessary. (This
same conviction led Auriol to reject, at least in some contexts, the
use of the popular later-medieval distinction between God's absolute
and ordained powers. For Auriol, there is no genuine possibility in
God to will other than he does.) Second, Auriol took as a fundamental
principle the existence of human free will (on Auriol's theory of free
will, see Hoffmann 2015; Alliney forthcoming). These two principles
lead Auriol to theorize that God does know the future, but not as
future; rather God knows the future <em>indistantly</em>, as
abstracted from all time; it is therefore this special way of knowing
the future that preserves human freedom and avoids divine
necessitarianism. In accordance with this view, Auriol develops a
three-valued logic, in which future-tensed propositions are neutral,
admitting of neither truth nor falsity, thereby discarding the
principle of bivalence (the principle claiming that any proposition
can have only one of two truth values). Auriol's position on future
contingents and divine foreknowledge had a great deal of impact in the
later Middle Ages, since it often inspired refutations that
nevertheless took into account the criticisms that Auriol had made
of,  e.g., Thomas Aquinas, Henry of Ghent, and John Duns Scotus
(Schabel 2000a). When Auriol's view actually found an adherent in
Peter de Rivo at the University of Louvain (Leuven) in the period
1465–74, it occasioned a major debate involving in the end Pope
Sixtus IV, who in 1474 officially condemned aspects of Auriol's
view. Despite this condemnation, however, it appears that Auriol's
critique of earlier scholastic views and some elements of his own
theory on the topic influenced the humanist Pietro Pomponazzi around
1520, and perhaps as well the reformer Martin Luther (Schabel
2003).</p>

<h3><a name="PreFreWil">2.4 Predestination and Free Will</a></h3>

<p>

In the related area of predestination, human free will is again a
motive force behind Auriol's ideas. Believing that earlier explanations
of the way God elected some to salvation and damned others to eternal
punishment left all too little room for human free will, Auriol
proposed a theory on which God offers his grace freely to all human
beings. Salvation comes to those who passively accept this free offer
of grace. Those whom God knows offer an obstacle to grace, i.e. those
who actively reject it, God damns to eternal punishment. Thus, for
Auriol, the central issue in predestination is how human beings choose
to react to God's free offer of grace: they are judged on their
reaction. Auriol believes that he has avoided any hint of Pelagianism
-- where human beings can merit salvation on their own account --
because individuals do not <em>do</em> anything actively in order to
earn their salvation on his theory; they are only required to passively
accept grace by not offering an obstacle to it, and this passive
acceptance is, according to Auriol, a negative cause of the person's
salvation. Auriol's theory when first proposed was an extremely
innovative way of explaining the mechanics of salvation, and it came in
for scathing criticism from, among others, Gregory of Rimini; but,
whether through direct influence or not, elements of Auriol's theory
appear in the works of such thinkers as William Ockham, Robert Holcot,
and, on the eve of the Reformation, Gabriel Biel  (Halverson
1998).</p>

<p>

In the rest of this entry, we'll look at two areas in which Auriol
provoked a significant response in part on account of his radical
solutions, two areas that also illustrate the systematic and historical
nature of his thought: his ideas on the relation between cognition and
reality (including his conceptualism) and his ideas on intuitive and
abstractive cognition.</p>

<h2><a name="CogReaConEssApp">3. Cognition and Reality: Conceptualism and the <em>esse apparens</em></a></h2>

<p>

If there is one thing that is known about Peter Auriol, it is that
he was a “conceptualist.” Indeed, Auriol has often been viewed as a
forerunner of William Ockham precisely on account of his conceptualism.
What is probably the very first monograph ever devoted to Auriol
(Dreiling 1913) deals with his conceptualism. Thus, understanding
Auriol's conceptualism is a good place to start when dealing with
Auriol's thought.</p>

<p>

In fact, Auriol <em>is</em> a conceptualist. By this it is merely
meant that, for Auriol, only singulars (i.e. individuals) have real,
extra-mental existence. As Auriol writes: “every thing, insofar as it
exists, exists as a singular” (<em>omnis res, eo quod est,
singulariter est</em>). Moreover, Auriol states explicitly that there
is no principle of individuation — individuals just are individuals
and their individuality needs no further explanation. This is one of
the most basic of Auriol's metaphysical principles, and it necessarily
entails that universality and universals are mental phenomena,
fabricated in some way by the intellect. Thus, for Auriol, the
individuality of singular things does not need explaining, but the
formation of universal concepts on the basis of these individuals does
need explaining. What is important for understanding Auriol's
conceptualism, then, is explicating his theory of intellectual
cognition: determining the process by which the intellect fabricates
these universal concepts, determining what these universal concepts
are, and what relation they have to really existing singulars in the
world.</p>

<p>

While only individuals have real, extra-mental existence, every
individual by its very nature has several different ontological or
quidditative aspects. Auriol calls these quidditative aspects
<em>rationes</em> (a term that will remain untranslated in the rest of
this entry). Thus, Auriol claims that, e.g., Socrates has the
<em>rationes</em> substance, corporeality, sensitivity, rationality.
Moreover, <em>rationes</em> of the same kind found in different
individuals are “maximally similar”
(<em>simillimae</em>). e.g., Socrates' corporeality is totally like
Plato's corporeality, which is totally like the donkey Brunellus'
corporeality. It should be noted that these <em>rationes</em> are
non-universal characteristics, i.e. a <em>ratio</em> belongs to one
and only one individual. This is why Auriol emphasizes the maximal
similarity of <em>rationes</em> of the same kind: they are not the
same and they are not shared, they are merely as alike as they can
be. What is most important about these <em>rationes</em> in the
present context is that they are the basic unit of intellectual
acquaintance: every <em>ratio</em> of its very nature is able to serve
as the basis for a concept, although the concept that results from the
intellection of a <em>ratio</em> can be modified by the way that we
conceive it (our <em>modus concipiendi</em>), a purely psychological
difference with no immediate grounds in extra-mental reality. We might
say that a <em>ratio</em> directs our intellect to form one certain
concept, this core concept undergoing modification according to the
way we conceive it. Our universal concepts, then, have in these
<em>rationes</em> a direct basis in extra-mental individuals. (See,
for more on this, Friedman 1999, Wöller 2015, pp. 36–79; for the
term ‘maximally similar’ [as it is used in Ockham], see
Panaccio 1992, pp.  258–67.) What universal concept we actually
form, according to Auriol, depends on how closely our will makes the
intellect focus on the information we receive from the object of
cognition, and hence how strong an impression the object makes on the
intellect: the more closely focused, the stronger the impression, the
more specific the universal concept that is formed.</p>

<p>

To understand further what universal concepts are, we need to know
what Auriol thinks concepts in general are. Central to this is
Auriol's theory of apparent existence or <em>esse apparens</em>, that,
at all levels, our cognitive faculties, in the very process of
cognizing, put the object of cognition into a special type of
existence, termed by Auriol “apparent existence” (<em>esse
apparens</em>). For Auriol, in line with the general medieval view,
our cognitive apparatus is divided into a sensory part (including the
five external senses, the common sense, which puts the sense data from
the five external senses together, and the imagination, which stores,
retrieves, and sometimes manipulates the sense data, as well as sends
them on to the intellect) and an intellectual part (including the
agent and the possible intellect). According to Auriol, in any
cognitive act — whether sensory or intellectual — the
cognitive power puts the object of cognition into this special type of
existence, and the object of cognition in this special type of
existence <em>is</em> the object as perceived. Thus concepts as well
as sensations are simply cognized things themselves in a type of
existence different from that which they have in extra-mental
reality. Auriol employs at least two different approaches to argue for
this view: one based on intellectual cognition, the other based on
sensory cognition. (Auriol's trinitarian theology provides further
arguments for this view; see Friedman 2013, esp. Ch.  9, section 4.)
We'll look at each of these in turn, in the process sketching what it
was about the theory of <em>esse apparens</em> that made it quite
radical and disturbing to Auriol's medieval readers. (For the sake of
precision, <em>esse apparens</em> will go untranslated hereafter.)</p>

<p>

<strong>Intellectual cognition</strong> (see Friedman 1999;
Adriaenssen 2014, esp. pp. 85–95; Friedman 2015): Auriol's solution to
the question of what a concept is takes its point of departure in the
necessity of explaining three things at once: essential predication;
intellectual acquaintance with extra-mental objects; and necessary,
scientific knowledge. Auriol holds that the first of these explanatory
requirements would not be fulfilled by any theory of concepts
according to which the concept is a type of representation or token of
the thing, if this representation has real
-- albeit mental -- being. Examples that he gives of solutions of this
sort are that a concept might be the intellectual act or an
intelligible species or any type of accident terminating an act of the
understanding. All of these representations have some real being of
their own. According to Auriol, these types of representational
theories of concepts would make explaining essential predication
impossible, since, assuming any of them, when I predicated, e.g.,
animal of human being, I would make a false predication, inasmuch as
the concept human being would not <em>be</em> the concept animal. The
ultimate problem with theories of universals of this sort, according to
Auriol, is that if they were correct, then universals would not be
universals at all, but would be particulars with their own real being.
Moreover, not only these same types of representational views of
concepts, but also any theory that holds concepts to be Platonic Ideas,
would hinder us in having intellectual acquaintance with extra-mental
objects, Auriol's second explanatory requirement. On both these types
of theories, our knowledge would extend only to these really existing
entities. We would, according to Auriol, be intellectually blind to
extra-mental reality. On the other hand, we could certainly have
intellectual acquaintance with extra-mental objects, if our concepts
were particular things in the extra-mental world as they exist
extra-mentally — a final position Auriol criticizes — but we would be
unable to have necessary, scientific knowledge, Auriol's third
explanatory requirement. In fact, we would be unable to make universal
judgments of any kind, since there would be nothing universal about our
knowledge; instead of knowing that all mules are sterile, we would know
only that this mule is sterile and that that mule is sterile.</p>

<p>

Having considered all these views and found them wanting, Auriol
offers his own alternative: the only way to explain at once essential
predication, intellectual acquaintance with extra-mental objects, and
necessary, scientific knowledge is to maintain that concepts
<em>are</em> extra-mental particulars, but having a different type of
existence (<em>modus essendi</em>) from the real existence they have
extra-mentally. This special type of existence Auriol terms <em>esse
apparens</em>, apparent being, but he uses many synonyms for it,
including “intentional” or “objective”
existence. (For other synonyms, see Tachau 1988, p. 90.) What
characterizes this type of existence is that it is a particular
extra-mental object, e.g., Socrates, but indistinguishably mixed
together (<em>indistinguibiliter</em>
<em>immiscetur</em>) with passive conception, i.e. the formation of a
concept of Socrates. A concept of Socrates <em>is</em> Socrates as
conceived.</p>

<p>

For Auriol, Socrates and a concept grasping Socrates, then, are the
same thing with differing types of existence. That they are “the
same thing” Auriol means quite literally. He says that “a
thing and its intention do not differ numerically with respect to
anything absolute”; they are the same thing strictly
speaking. What thing and intention differ by is a respect or a
relation. And this is no ordinary respect “fixed to or
superimposed upon that thing, as are other relations, rather it is
utterly intrinsic and indistinguishably joined to it.” This
intrinsic relation, Auriol tells us, is the appearance of the thing as
an object of perception (<em>apparere</em>) to a perceiver (hence the
term <em>esse apparens</em>). For Auriol, then, it is intrinsic to
each and every thing to have two different types of being: real or
extra-mental being on the one hand, and intentional or objective being
on the other. Unlike real being, the thing's intentional being needs a
perceiver in order to actualize it. This is only to say that it is
through the act of conceiving that a thing is put into intentional
being.</p>

<p>

In fact — and here we return to conceptualism — on the basis of
what Auriol has said, we can deduce that every particular thing, e.g.
Socrates, has several potential intentional existences: one for each of
Socrates' <em>rationes</em>, those basic units of intellectual
acquaintance that direct the mind to form certain concepts of him. And,
according to Auriol, all of these different concepts of Socrates
<em>are</em> Socrates. On Auriol's account, this makes good sense:
<em>rationes</em> are quidditative or essential aspects without which
a particular thing would not be the particular thing that it in fact
is. Thus, Socrates is not Socrates without being a rational animal,
i.e. without having the
<em>rationes</em> sensitivity and rationality. Socrates is every bit as
much a human being as he is Socrates, and on Auriol's theory the
concept ‘human being’ is every bit as much Socrates as is
the concept ‘Socrates’. Thus upon intellectual
acquaintance, Socrates (and in particular his <em>ratio</em> of
rationality) directs us to form the concept ‘human being’,
and that concept <em>is</em> Socrates, one of Socrates' several
potential intentional existences.</p>

<p>

In this way Auriol attempts to deal with the problems he saw in other
theories of concepts. On the one hand, he attempts to get our
knowledge grounded as firmly as possible on extra-mental things: a
concept simply <em>is</em> the intellected extra-mental particular in
a different type of being from that which it has extra-mentally, a
type of being that is nevertheless intrinsic to the extra-mental
particular; the concept offers no barrier whatsoever between
conceiving mind and conceived object. At the same time, however,
Auriol wants to preserve the universality of universal concepts and
their use in essential predications and necessary, scientific
knowledge, and he thinks that his theory of concepts does just
that. Because <em>rationes</em> of the same kind found in different
individuals are “maximally similar,” they all direct the
mind to form the same concept. Thus the concept ‘human
being’ arising from Socrates is the same as the concept
‘human being’ arising from Plato, since they are both
based on the maximally similar <em>ratio</em> of rationality.  Auriol
is clear that a universal concept <em>is</em> all of its particulars,
rose <em>is</em> all particular roses, animal <em>is</em> all
particular animals. That is to say, animal is the concept and every
really existing animal at the same time.</p>

<p>

<strong>Sensory Cognition</strong> (Wood 1982, pp. 214–17,
220–23; Tachau 1988, pp. 89–100; Denery 1998,
pp. 28–39; Lička forthcoming): The intellect is not the
only cognitive faculty that functions by putting the cognized thing
into <em>esse apparens</em>: the sensitive faculties also work in this
way according to Auriol. In fact, Auriol uses sensory cognition, and
his claim that the senses form <em>esse apparens</em>, as further
proof that the intellect does so as well. In a famous passage in
Auriol's works (<em>Scriptum</em>, d. 3, q. 3, a.1, ed. Buytaert,
vol. 2, pp.  696–99), one that was known to and criticized by
William Ockham, Auriol creates an account of sensory cognition that
takes its point of departure in a group of “experiences”
that Auriol thinks prove that the senses cognize by actively placing
the object sensed in <em>esse apparens</em>. Thus, if someone were on
a ship moving down a river, it would appear to that person that the
trees on the shore were moving; when a baton is twirled extremely
rapidly, it appears to the viewer that a colored circle hovers in the
air; a stick placed halfway into a bucket of water appears to be
broken; if I press on my eye while looking at a candle, it will appear
that I see two candles; upon looking directly at the sun, an
afterimage appears. Auriol gives eight experiences like these, but for
him all of them lead to the same conclusion: that in each of these
cases, what <em>appears</em> to us (i.e. our erroneous perception)
does not correspond directly to reality but is a result of the senses'
putting the object into <em>esse apparens</em>. Take the case of the
twirling baton: what is the circle that appears in the air?  It can't
be anything real existing in the baton itself, since the baton is
straight. Nor, clearly, is the circle something real hovering in the
air. Finally, the circle is not something in vision or in the eye,
since we are seeing the circle and not our vision of it, and also
since the circle appears to be in the air. For Auriol, the only
possible explanation for the circle is that it appears to us because
our sense of sight has actively put the baton into <em>esse
apparens</em>. More generally, what we see in these cases is
“only the appearance of the thing or the thing in <em>esse
apparens</em>.” Sensory error, for Auriol, is explained by
appealing to the fundamental activity of the senses. And Auriol
insists that the senses are just as active in cases where they
function correctly; this is because, since activity is a noble trait
to have, if in erroneous visions our sense of sight actively places
the thing seen in <em>esse apparens</em>, it will certainly do so in
veridical visions. The difference between a veridical sensory
experience and an erroneous one is that in a veridical one the way the
object of cognition <em>appears</em> and the way it <em>is</em> in
extra-mental reality coincide. So in veridical sensory experience we
have no way to tell that the senses are placing the thing
into <em>esse apparens</em>. Thus, these experiences of sensory error
are of immense importance, since it is only through them that we can
discern the necessary role that <em>esse apparens</em> and the
activity of the senses play in all sensory cognition.</p>

<p>

For Auriol, then, the senses necessarily put the cognized object
into <em>esse apparens</em> or intentional being; this is a condition
of our perceiving. Moreover, Auriol makes clear in this context that
this <em>esse apparens</em> is not a representation of the thing with
its own real being; rather it <em>is</em> the thing itself merely
placed in another type of existence. The <em>esse apparens</em> of a
sensed object is merely that object as sensed. (See on this
particularly Denery 1998, pp. 34–39.) Obviously, this
corresponds to the theory we have already seen Auriol holds
concerning <em>esse apparens</em> in intellectual cognition, and
Auriol makes the correspondence explicit. To go from sensory
perception to intellectual cognition, Auriol uses a common scholastic
principle called by Philotheus Boehner “The Principle of
Hierarchy” (Boehner 1949, p. 298): given two faculties, one
lower and one higher (like sense and intellect), if the lower faculty
can do something noble, then the higher faculty can certainly do the
same. The activity of the senses, then, i.e. the fact that the senses
put the object into <em>esse apparens</em>, since it is noble, shows
that the intellect also puts its object into <em>esse
apparens</em>. (Auriol's theory of sensory perception is complicated
by the fact that Auriol seems to claim that some of the illusory
sensory experiences he mentions exist outside the mind, e.g., that the
colored circle is “in” the air and not “in”
the mind. For approaches to this complication, see Pasnau 1997,
pp. 69–76; Denery 1998, pp. 36–37; Lička
forthcoming).</p>

<p>

Three general claims can be made on the basis of this examination of
Auriol's ideas on cognition and reality. First, Auriol is a
conceptualist, holding that universals are nothing more than concepts
formed by the mind, although these universal concepts do have a direct
basis in the particular thing cognized (the <em>rationes</em>). Second,
a principle underlying Auriol's theory of cognition is that cognitive
faculties are fundamentally active. All cognition takes place because a
cognitive faculty <em>places</em> the object of cognition into <em>esse
apparens</em>, which is merely the object of cognition in a different
type of being than it has extra-mentally, the being of being perceived.
Thus, Auriol is part of one pronounced strain of medieval thought
(deriving from Augustine and ultimately from Plato) that rejects that
the soul and its powers are passively affected by extra-mental objects.
(See on this Tachau 1988, Friedman 2000.) Cognitive powers are, for
Auriol, active. A third point, and one that has been noted in a great
deal of the secondary literature (e.g., Tachau 1988; Denery 1998;
Bolyard 2000; Friedman 2000) is that by appealing to <em>erroneous</em>
visions to show that both sense and intellect produce <em>esse
apparens</em> or make things appear, Auriol has given error a central
place in his account of cognition. To put this in another way, Auriol
does not have a real problem explaining how we can have erroneous
perception and intellection (in contrast to many theories of
knowledge); rather he needs to explain how we can have veridical ones
and just as importantly how we can know when we are having veridical
ones. This is roughly one of the functions that the distinction between
intuitive and abstractive cognition served for some medieval authors
(in e.g., John Duns Scotus and William Ockham), although as we will see,
Auriol does not use it in this way. Indeed it seems best to describe
Auriol as a “reliabilist,” holding as a type of axiomatic principle
that under normal circumstances our God-given cognitive faculties
represent the world in an adequate manner. (See Bolyard 2000, p. 175;
that Auriol is not the only medieval thinker with this reliabilist
attitude, see e.g., Stump 1998, pp. 306–07.) No matter what Auriol
thought, however, the skeptical implications of Auriol's theory of
<em>esse apparens</em> did worry many of his medieval readers, and the
theory elicited a critical response because some thought that it posed
too sharp a break between cognition and reality. (For examples, see
Wood 1982, Tachau 1988.)</p>

<h2><a name="IntAbsCogLimHumCogAbi">4. Intuitive and Abstractive Cognition and the Limits of Human Cognitive Abilities</a></h2>

<p>

John Duns Scotus, who introduced the distinction between intuitive
and abstractive cognition, took the view that intuitive and abstractive
cognition were distinct because they had different objects. Thus, for
Scotus, we have an abstractive cognition of an object when it is not
directly present to us, on account of there being some intervening
representation; an intuitive cognition can only come about when the
object of cognition is existing and directly present to us. For Scotus,
then, intuitive cognition carries along with it the guarantee that the
object of cognition exists; not so for abstractive cognition. (See
Tachau 1988, esp. pp. 68–81; Dumont 1989; Pini 2014.) It is well known that
William Ockham took exception to this view, holding that we can, in
certain extraordinary (i.e. supernatural) cases, have intuitive
cognition of non-existent objects. Auriol too objects to Scotus'
view.</p>

<p>

For Auriol, in contrast to Scotus, intuitive cognition is possible
whether the object of cognition is present or absent. Likewise, an
abstractive cognition of an object that is actually present is
possible. The distinction between intuitive and abstractive cognition
does not depend on the object at all; the very same object can be
cognized in both an intuitive and an abstractive way. According to
Auriol, whether we are having the one type of cognition or the other
depends exclusively on the characteristics of the cognition that we
are having, how the object appears to us. Auriol says explicitly that
intuitive and abstractive cognition are in fact simply two
fundamentally different ways that the <em>esse apparens</em> created
by the cognitive faculties can appear to us: “abstractive and
intuitive cognition differ … for there are two modes of formal
appearance … by which things appear objectively” (trans. Pasnau
2002, p. 201, n. 111). In order to illustrate this, Auriol claims that
ocular cognition, i.e. the sense of sight, is fully intuitive, while
imaginary cognition, i.e. cognizing something through the internal
sense of the imagination, is fully abstractive. This is the
governing metaphor in Auriol's attempt to distinguish the two types of
cognition: sight is intuitive, imagination is abstractive. Thus,
describing sensory cognition, Auriol gives four traits that together
enable us to determine whether any particular cognition is intuitive
or abstractive.  First, an intuitive cognition is characterized by
being
<em>immediate</em> or <em>direct</em>, as when we see an object before
us. Not so abstractive or imaginary cognition; it is mediate, requiring
some type of discursive process. Auriol gives the following example: an
astronomer sitting in his room can predict an eclipse through
calculation, and he can even imagine it on that basis, but this is
something entirely different from seeing the eclipse directly. A second
characteristic of ocular or intuitive cognition is the
<em>presentness</em> of the object. The object of an intuitive
cognition seems to be present (whether it actually is or not), whereas
the object of an abstractive cognition does not have this appearance of
presence. Take the astronomer again. He can imagine the eclipse, but in
the very act of doing so he knows that the eclipse is not present
before him. The third and fourth characteristics that Auriol mentions
are roughly equivalent: an intuitive cognition carries with it the
<em>actualization</em> and <em>existence</em> of its object; not so an
imaginary, abstractive cognition. The astronomer can imagine an
eclipse, and even imagine an eclipse taking place right now, but again,
the very fact that he is imagining the eclipse bears with it the
recognition that it is not in fact actualized and existing. Auriol sums
up:</p>

<blockquote>Therefore, it is rightly said that an intuitive cognition
is a direct cognition as opposed to a discursive one, that it is
present as opposed to the absent mode in which the imagination reaches
even toward things that are present, and that it actualizes the object
and posits its existence, since it makes the object's real existence
and actual position appear, even if the object does not exist. And in
contrast it is clear that an imaginary cognition lacks and abstracts
from these four conditions. It extends to its object neither directly
nor presently, nor by actualizing or positing existence, even if one
imagines the object to exist and be actual and even if it is present.
(trans. Pasnau 2002, pp. 206–07, n. 109).</blockquote>

<p>

(The most complete discussion of Auriol on intuitive and abstractive
cognition is Boehner 1949; for the background and reception of
Auriol's view, see particularly Tachau 1988; for a translation into
English of Auriol's major text on intuitive and abstractive cognition,
his <em>Scriptum</em>, Prologue (aka Prooemium), q. 2, see Pasnau
2002, pp. 178–218.)</p>

<p>

Thus, what is central to Auriol's distinction between intuitive and
abstractive cognition is the character of the cognition as it appears
to us. The distinction between them is phenomenologically determined.
As mentioned above, in this way Auriol rejected Scotus' view that
intuitive cognitions are only of objects present and existing. Auriol's
rejection of Scotus' distinction between intuitive and abstractive
cognition takes as one of its starting points several “experiences”
that recall the experiences he employed to show that the senses put the
object of sensitive cognition into <em>esse apparens</em>. For example,
upon looking directly at the sun or any other luminous object, an
afterimage appears; thus a vision of the sun remains in the eye even
when the object itself is absent. In dreams, we can experience sights,
sounds, and tactile sensations, in the real absence of the objects of
sensation. Persons who are deceived by illusions often see things that
are not really there. In all of these sensations the object appears to
be actually present and existing, when it is not. Auriol concludes that
we can have an intuitive sensory cognition of non-existent objects.</p>

<p>

That was the characterization of intuitive <em>sensory</em>
cognition as opposed to abstractive cognition. What about intellectual
cognition? Auriol makes clear that the human intellect can have
intuitive cognition. To show this he first appeals to the Principle of
Hierarchy mentioned above: because the lower faculties, the senses, can
have intuitive cognition, therefore it is certain that the higher
faculty, intellect, can have intuitive cognition, since it is more
noble than the abstractive cognition that we know the intellect does
have. Moreover, on the basis of a famous passage from St. Paul's I
<em>Corinthians</em> (13:12 “For now we see in a mirror dimly, but then
face to face”), Auriol maintains that we are assured that the beatific
vision of God is an intuitive intellectual cognition.</p>

<p>

Although intuitive cognition is <em>possible</em> for an intellect,
Auriol, in contrast to William Ockham, nevertheless denies that we
<em>experience</em> intuitive cognition in this life. Because the
intellect of the wayfarer (<em>viator</em> — the person in this life)
is dependent upon the senses and their cognition of particulars,
Auriol denies that we can have (or at least that we can know that we
have) intellectual cognition with the direct and present, ocular-like
cognition that is characteristic of intuitive cognition. Auriol says:
“Thus each of these cognitions should be posited within intellect,
although we do not experience intuitive cognition in this life because
of its conjunction with sensory intuition” (trans. Pasnau 2002,
pp. 210–11, n. 121.) Intuitive intellectual cognition is reserved for
the angels and for the blessed in heaven, unencumbered by bodily
senses. All of our intellectual cognition in this life is
characterized by the discursivity and mediacy that is the mark of an
abstractive cognition.</p>

<p>

Above, it was mentioned that Auriol seems ultimately to be best
described as a reliabilist; he does not question that, given normal
conditions, our God-given cognitive faculties work as they should and
that they are self-correcting. He does not seem to have been concerned
about possible skeptical ramifications of his theory of <em>esse
apparens</em>. But with this said, by denying that human beings in
this life have intuitive intellectual cognition, he set the stage for
somewhat strictly limiting human intellectual abilities in his
philosophy.</p>

<p>

This last point explains some interesting features of Auriol's
attitude towards human knowledge. In particular, despite the fact that
Auriol maintains that God could give a person in this life an
abstractive cognition of the divine essence, and that this abstractive
cognition would be able to serve as the basis for demonstrative
knowledge of all articles of the Christian faith (<em>Scriptum</em>,
Prologue, q. 2, ed. Buytaert, vol. 1, pp. 211–14; trans. Pasnau 2002,
p. 213, n. 130 and p. 214, n. 133), nevertheless Auriol often exhibits
a noticeable pessimism when it comes to human cognitive
abilities. Thus, Auriol argues at length that in this life we are
unable to decide such issues as whether the universe is eternal or
created in time. (We know, of course, through Scripture that the world
is not eternal, but we could never decisively prove this by means of
unaided human reason.) Auriol argues that this is the case because we
do not have direct intellectual cognition of, e.g., temporal instants;
such cognition would allow us to resolve this problem. (See esp.
Nielsen 1996, esp. pp. 223–26, 232–35, 239–41; see also Nielsen 1999.)
Here we see that Auriol's rejection of intuitive intellectual
cognition in this life lies at the heart of a somewhat pessimistic
view of the reach of human reason: we do not have direct intuitive
knowledge of the world (much less of God), only indirect abstractive
knowledge, and this places fairly strict limitations on just what our
intellect can achieve unaided. The disembodied soul of the blessed,
having direct intuitive intellectual cognition, will fare much
better.</p>

<p>

Auriol's theory of human intellectual cognition of singulars also
shows the influence of his rejection of intuitive intellectual
cognition in this life. Auriol is explicit that universal concepts
(formed through the Aristotelian process of abstraction) always appear
to us as abstractive cognitions, since what is universal abstracts from
any presentness and directness of the object of cognition (see e.g.
<em>Scriptum</em>, Prologue, q. 2, ed. Buytaert, p. 206, n. 111,
l. 87, Pasnau 2002, p. 207; cf. Friedman 1997,
pp. 310–14). There were, however, a number of members of the
Franciscan order, including John Duns Scotus, who was sometimes
understood by contemporaries to have claimed that singulars could be
cognized as singular by the intellect. (On this aspect of Scotus
thought see, e.g., Boler 1982, esp. Pini 2008.) Auriol rejects this
Franciscan tradition; because true intuitive intellectual cognition is
barred to us in this lifetime, we can have no direct intellectual
cognition of singulars at all. Auriol maintains in his theory of
intellectual cognition of singulars that we only form concepts of
singulars through the mediation of the senses and by means of a
discursive process. (By recognizing that the senses are now sensing a
singular, the intellect can reason that a singular must now exist and
be present, but we have no direct intellectual knowledge or concept of
any singular.) Auriol explicitly claims, however, that angels and the
blessed, lacking bodies and bodily senses, would have direct
intellectual cognition of singulars, just as God does by seeing his
own essence. (On Auriol's theory, see Friedman 2000.) A mild pessimism
about human cognitive abilities is thus systemic in Auriol's thought,
and has its most clear expression in his claim that we do not
experience intuitive intellectual cognition in this life.</p>
