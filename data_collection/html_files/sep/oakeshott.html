<h1>Michael Oakeshott</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Tue Mar 8, 2016</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
Michael Oakeshott (1901–1990) is commonly viewed as a
conservative thinker and critic of government planning. But that view
notices only one aspect of Oakeshott’s thought and invites
misunderstanding because his ideas about government are not the
conventional ones this characterization suggests. His ideas spring not
from practical engagement but from study of the history of European
political thought, sharpened by philosophical reflection on its
arguments and their presuppositions. Like many other philosophers,
Oakeshott saw philosophical questions as connected and as inviting
wide-ranging critical investigations. His contribution to philosophy
is therefore not limited to politics. It lies in distinguishing modes
of understanding and inquiry, identifying different conceptions of
rationality and their place in practical judgment, distinguishing the
idea of the state as an association in terms of noninstrumental laws
from that of the state as a corporate enterprise, and theorizing the
character of history as a mode of inquiry and its place in explaining
human conduct. Oakeshott also wrote on the history of political
thought, especially the thought of Thomas Hobbes, as well as on
religion, morals, education, aesthetics, and the character of
political discourse. A recurrent theme in his writings is the tension
between individuality, which implies plurality, and its denial, which
he characterized as barbarism. Given his concern with individual
freedom and his doubts about regarding politics as the pursuit of
political ideals, the current interest of political philosophers in
republican ideas of freedom as nondomination and in realism in
political discourse as an alternative to political moralism suggests
the continuing relevance of Oakeshott’s arguments. Rather than
surveying all of these topics, this entry will focus on his most
important contributions to philosophy: his theory of modes of
experience, his criticism of political rationalism, his argument that
the key tension in modern politics is over the character and purpose
of the state, and his philosophy of history.</p>

<h2 id="LifeWork">1. Life and Works</h2>

<p>
Michael Oakeshott’s father, Joseph Oakeshott, was a member of
the Fabian Society, a socialist but not radical organization (its
symbol was the tortoise), many of whose members participated in
establishing the British Labor Party. The Society’s leaders,
Beatrice and Sidney Webb, were also among the founders of the London
School of Economics. The younger Oakeshott studied history in Gonville
and Caius College, Cambridge, in the early 1920s and was made a fellow
of the college in 1925. After serving in the British Army between 1940
and 1945 he returned to Cambridge, then taught briefly at Oxford
before being appointed in 1951 as Professor of Political Science at
the London School of Economics. He chaired his department there until
his retirement in 1969. At some point during his years at the LSE he
began an annual course of undergraduate lectures in the history of
political thought. Initially focused on the classics of political
thought, perhaps like his lectures at Harvard in 1958 (Oakeshott
1993b), the course eventually morphed into a more comprehensive
consideration of the political thought and political experience of
four peoples, those of ancient Greece, Rome, medieval Europe, and
modern Europe (Oakeshott 2006). He also established a seminar in the
history of political thought for postgraduate students and, as
emeritus professor, continued to be active in it until 1980,
contributing papers on the historical study of political thought and
the philosophy of history. Brief accounts of Oakeshott’s life
and career can be found in two memorial collections (Norman 1993;
Marsh 2001) and a more recent biographical essay (Grant 2012).</p>

<p>
Although Oakeshott challenged the postwar Labor government’s
faith in planning, in his youth he thought of himself as a socialist.
But it was socialism of a romantic sort, concerned with spiritual
transformation rather than economic redistribution (O’Sullivan
2014). And though he subsequently repudiated Fabianism, Marxism, and
other left-wing ideologies, Oakeshott sympathized with the anarchism
of Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, sharing the latter’s vision of a
liberal order combining community and equality with individuality and
independence. His reputation as a conservative thinker was
substantially shaped by essays on the limits of reason in political
life, collected as <em>Rationalism in Politics and Other Essays</em> (cited as
<em>RP</em>), on the basis of which he has been compared to a host of
figures from Burke to Wittgenstein, while others have argued that he
is better characterized as a liberal (Franco 1990). As a theorist of
the rule of law he invites comparison with Friedrich Hayek and Carl
Schmitt (Dyzenhaus and Poole 2015). But efforts to label
Oakeshott’s thought as either conservative or liberal, Right or
Left, founder not only on the ambiguities of those words but on his
thoughtful rejection of the partisanship they imply: as he
provocatively told the American conservatives to whom he gave a
lecture on “Talking Politics” at the twentieth-anniversary
celebration of the <em>National Review</em> in 1975, their differences
with liberals were a petty squabble over how the spoils of the state
as a corporate enterprise were to be distributed (<em>RP</em> 459). To
grasp the philosophical significance of Oakeshott’s thought one
must move beyond the labels and arguments of twentieth-century
political controversy (Nardin 2015).</p>

<p>
In his first book, <em>Experience and Its Modes</em> (1933, cited as
<em>EM</em>), Oakeshott barely mentions politics. But this does not
mean that he was not interested in political philosophy at that time,
and in fact the book grew out a set of Cambridge lectures from the
late 1920s, “The Philosophical Approach to Politics”, now
included in <em>Early Political Writings</em> (Oakeshott 2010). But
whereas in these lectures he distinguishes alternative ways of
thinking about politics, in the book they are detached from the
subject of politics and presented as general modes of experience. By
the time he wrote <em>Experience and Its Modes</em>, Oakeshott had
come to believe that political philosophy was necessarily defective,
that it was not genuine philosophy and had no place in a philosophical
work. The book is a highly individual performance in the style of
British philosophical Idealism, written at a time when that approach
to philosophy was going out of fashion. In it, Oakeshott credits the
influence of Hegel, Bradley, and Bosanquet but it was evident that he
had absorbed their views “into an insistent literary personality
which moved freely and suggestively in many types of literature”
(Cowling 2003: 256). When Oakeshott took up politics again, it was in
the context of the controversies of the day, as illustrated by the
anthology of texts he compiled in the late 1930s expounding the
“doctrines” of contemporary Europe: Representative
Democracy, Catholicism, Communism, Fascism, and National Socialism
(Oakeshott 1939). His first postwar publication was an edition of
Hobbes’s <em>Leviathan</em>, with an influential introduction
later collected with other essays in <em>Hobbes on Civil
Association</em> (Oakeshott 1975b). In 1947 he founded and began
editing the <em>Cambridge Journal</em> as a vehicle for treating
politics and culture as topics for civilized conversation rather than
ideological polemics or academic research. Several of the essays
reprinted in <em>Rationalism in Politics</em> made their first appearance in the journal.</p>

<p>
Oakeshott’s magnum opus, <em>On Human Conduct</em> (1975a, cited
as <em>OHC</em>) appeared late in his career. It was greeted in some
quarters with incomprehension and in others by hostility, but mostly
with silence. Even those who judged the book to be an important work
found its style forbidding, and its impact has been muted. Also
difficult are the essays on the philosophy of history collected in
<em>On History and Other Essays</em> (1983, cited as <em>OH</em>). His
essays on the idea of liberal education and its practical
implications, collected in <em>The Voice of Liberal Learning</em>
(1989, cited as <em>VLL</em>), are more accessible and continue to
invite attention (Williams 2007; Backhurst and Fairfield 2016). After
Oakeshott’s death other writings began to surface, some of which
appeared in a series of volumes published by Yale University Press
(Oakeshott 1993a, 1993b, and 1996) and others in a more recent series
from Imprint Academic (Oakeshott 2004, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2010, and
2014). There has also been a steady stream of secondary works,
including two companion volumes (Franco and Marsh 2012; Podoksik
2012), and this literature, together with the attention his less
accessible writings are starting to receive, suggests that Oakeshott
occupies an increasingly secure place in the history of philosophy and
political thought.</p>

<h2 id="ModeExpe">2. Modes of Experience</h2>

<p>
Philosophers have used the word “mode” to refer to an
attribute or form that a thing or substance can take, and sometimes to
refer to an aspect of something larger (more inclusive) or more real
than itself (Descartes 1641: 27–28, 31). For Oakeshott, who
began as a philosophical Idealist critical of empiricism as an
approach to philosophy, that thing or substance is experience as
already shaped by the ideas brought to it by a thinking subject.
Experience always involves thinking and therefore ideas. This claim
that there is no experience unmediated by thought applies as much to
sensation and perception as to intuition or inference. Where ideas
have achieved a substantial degree of integrity, coherence, and
differentiation, a mode of thought can be said to have emerged. In
<em>Experience and Its Modes</em> there are traces of the view, also
discernible in Spinoza and Hegel, that this “larger thing”
is everything that exists, the sum total of experience identified as
God or the Absolute. Oakeshott does not use the word
“mode” in later writings in a way that postulates a
universal or ultimate reality. But neither does he understand a mode
of thought to be any kind of thinking or point of view. It is an
“autonomous” kind of understanding or inquiry, one that is
“specifiable in terms of exact conditions” and
“logically incapable of denying or confirming the conclusions of
any other mode of understanding” (<em>OH</em> 2). Because
experience always involves ideas, a mode can be said to constitute a
world of ideas, a distinct and self-consistent “whole of
interlocking meanings” (<em>VLL</em> 38) resting on its own
criteria of truth, factuality, and reality. Thinking that leads to
action is one such mode, which Oakeshott called
“practice”. Another is “history”, by which he
meant not “the notional grand total of all that has ever
happened” or some part of it, whose makers are the participants
in the occurrences that constitute it, but rather a kind of enquiry
into and understanding of such occurrences and therefore as something
made by the historian (<em>OH</em> 1–2). It is, moreover, as
Oakeshott devotes many pages to arguing, an inquiry that aims to
explain past events as intelligible outcomes of antecedent events. In
contrast to history, understood in this way, the mode of
“science” is defined by its search for regularities that
can account for the occurrence of repeatable events and for ways to
express these regularities as relationships between quantities. Both
history and science are inherently explanatory, however, which means
that history is sharply distinguished from ideas about the past shaped
by current practical concerns (the “practical past”) and
science from the practical application of scientific ideas: for
Oakeshott, engineering is a practical discipline rather than a
scientific one.</p>

<p>
Modes, then, are provisionally coherent and distinguishable kinds or
categories of understanding and inquiry. In <em>Experience and Its
Modes</em>, Oakeshott aims to identify the presuppositions in terms of
which a mode can be made coherent and distinguished from other modes.
In philosophy, categorial distinctions are distinctions of kind rather
than degree and what are called categories are often thought of as the
most fundamental classes to which things can belong. But philosophers
differ on whether the identified kinds are natural or real
(ontological) or conceptual (epistemological). The former are
categories of being (Aristotle), the latter categories of
understanding (Kant). Philosophers also disagree about whether a
categorial scheme must be exhaustive and fixed or, alternatively, can
be open and mutable. The modes that Oakeshott identifies in
<em>Experience and Its Modes</em>—history, science, and
practice, to which he later added “poetry” (art)—are
epistemological categories, not ontological ones. And although the
modes are mutually exclusive, they do not form a closed set. They are
constructions that have emerged over time in human experience. They
could change or even disappear and other modes might yet appear.</p>

<p>
A number of conclusions follow from these premises. First, a mode of
experience implies a distinct and autonomous kind of understanding and
way of expressing that understanding in language. It implies a
universe of discourse with its own arguments and ways of assessing and
grounding them. Because propositions in one kind of discourse have no
standing in another, truth is coherence within a given mode (Nardin
2001: 23–27). To argue across a modal boundary is to commit the
fallacy of <em>ignoratio elenchi</em> (irrelevance). If there is any
relationship at all between the modes it can only be conversational,
not argumentative: cross-modal encounters yield differences, not
agreed supra-modal conclusions. Oakeshott sometimes makes this point
by speaking of modes as “voices” in an inter-modal
conversation (<em>RP</em> 488–491, 497). Second, because what is
rational in discourse depends on the mode of discourse, there is no
mode-independent definition of reason or rationality. The illusion
that there is arises from privileging what counts as reasonable within
a given mode and believing that it is superior to other ways of
thinking. This illusion of superiority generates the kind of hubris
characteristic of each mode: historicism, scientism, pragmatism,
aestheticism. A conversational as opposed to argumentative
juxtaposition of modal voices is playful and for that reason
inherently civilized, which means that to insist on the primacy of any
one mode or voice is boorish, even barbaric. And third, because the
modes are independent of one another, and none is more expressive of
reality than any other, there can be no hierarchy of modes.</p>

<p>
In making these points, Oakeshott differed from philosophical
Idealists in Germany, Italy, and England who were exploring similar
categorial distinctions around the same time. These included Benedetto
Croce, who distinguished the theoretical modes of art, history, and
philosophy from the practical modes of economics and ethics, and R.G.
Collingwood, who in <em>Speculum Mentis</em>, an early work, began
with Hegel’s triad of art, religion, and philosophy, identifying
philosophy broadly defined with “knowledge” and
distinguishing three kinds of knowledge—science, history, and
philosophy proper—to generate a fivefold hierarchy of modes. In
Collingwood’s scheme, art was at the bottom followed by
religion, the former concerned to imagine or “suppose” and
the latter to “assert”, and then by the three kinds of
genuine knowledge, which are distinguished from art and religion in
being critical. Philosophy is the most critical of all because it aims
to transcend and synthesize the other forms (Collingwood 1924;
Connelly 2015). Oakeshott, working in part from Collingwood, folded
art and religion into practice, denied that modes could be ordered
hierarchically, and defined philosophy as the activity of
interrogating modal presuppositions rather than as itself a mode. But
he severed the tie between philosophy and unqualified
knowledge—“the Absolute”—that was part of much
Idealist metaphysics from Hegel to Collingwood. The distinction
between modal thinking and philosophy reappeared in <em>On Human
Conduct</em> as a distinction between “conditional” and
“unconditional” theorizing, the former resting on
assumptions that the latter is concerned to question.</p>

<p>
The idea of a hierarchy of modes is not particular to Idealism. Where
there are different understandings, it can occur to someone interested
in reconciling them to imagine that they represent different levels of
understanding. In contrast to unifying philosophies, including
philosophical Idealism, Oakeshott’s position is pluralist and
anti-hierarchical. In this respect he has more in common with Wilhelm
Dilthey, who struggled with the issue of relativity in metaphysics and
how to distinguish the human from the natural sciences, than with the
British Idealists—Bradley, Bosanquet, and McTaggart among
others—with whom he is often associated (Boucher 2012). For
Oakeshott, all knowledge is tentative and conditional. Theorizing is
“an engagement of arrivals and departures” in which
“the notion of an unconditional or definitive understanding may
hover in the background, but … has no part in the
adventure” (<em>OHC</em> 2–3). In attempting to construct
a coherent view of the world the philosopher “puts out to
sea” (<em>OHC</em> 40) and is perpetually <em>en voyage</em>:
there are no “final solutions” in philosophy any more than
in practical affairs. </p>

<h2 id="RatiRati">3. Rationality and Rationalism</h2>

<p>
The illusion that there are “correct” answers to practical
questions Oakeshott called “Rationalism”. It is the belief
that practical activity is rational only when it rests on moral or
causal laws whose truth can be demonstrated. In Marxism, for example,
one encounters the claim that laws of historical change can be
discerned scientifically and that practical guidance can be derived
from them. But this claim, Oakeshott thought, should be understood as
a rhetorical one that presupposes a certain kind of audience: it can
be persuasive only for those who already believe that such laws exist
and that they dictate correct decisions (Oakeshott 2008:
168–177). The error of Rationalism is to think that making
decisions simply requires skill in the technique of applying rules or
calculating consequences. In an early essay on this theme, Oakeshott
distinguishes between “technical” and
“traditional” knowledge. Technical knowledge is of facts
or rules that can be easily learned and applied, even by those who are
without experience or lack the relevant skills. Traditional knowledge,
in contrast, means “knowing how” rather than
“knowing that” (Ryle 1949). It is acquired by engaging in
an activity and involves judgment in handling facts or rules
(<em>RP</em> 12–17). The point is not that rules cannot be
“applied” but rather that using them skillfully or
prudently means going beyond the instructions they provide.</p>

<p>
Political deliberation occurs when a public decision needs to be made
and a proposed course of action defended against alternatives. But
deciding which course of action to pursue involves more than simply
applying rules or calculating costs and benefits. It requires
interpretation and judgment. We must decide which rule to use and then
interpret what it means in the situation to which it is applied. If,
alternatively, we choose an action based on its likely consequences,
we must judge the expected value of those consequences, which involves
making value judgments as well as estimating probabilities. And
whether we are applying rules or calculating outcomes, we must work
with what we presume to be facts though these are always uncertain in
various ways. For all these reasons, there is never a single and
demonstrably correct course of action. Political arguments cannot be
proved or disproved; they can only be shown to be more or less
convincing than other such arguments. Political discourse, Oakeshott
concludes, is a discourse of contingencies and conjectures, not of
certainties or context-independent truths. It is characteristically
persuasive and rhetorical, not a matter of demonstration or proof
(<em>RP</em> 70–95; Nardin 2012).</p>

<p>
These are familiar points, made by Oakeshott with particular clarity.
What he adds to other philosophical discussions of practical
reasoning, such as Aristotle’s treatment of <em>techne</em> and
<em>phronēsis</em> (<em>Nichomachean Ethics</em> 1142a) or
Kant’s remarks on judgment as the middle term between rules and
applications (Kant 1793, 8:275), is an account of how practical, and
in particular political, discourse is corrupted when these
distinctions are overlooked. His conclusions rest on a detailed
dissection of ideological politics, which, Oakeshott thought, reflects
a characteristically modern disposition to substitute rules for
judgment in practical reasoning. These rules, which are thought to
govern practice and which can be moral, historical, scientific, or
divine, are in fact not independent of practical activity but
abstracted from it. The rules that we abstract from a practice and
appear to govern it are “abridgments” of something more
complex and nuanced. They are not independent of practical activity
and do not in fact govern it (<em>RP</em> 121). They are, to borrow language
from Michael Walzer, interpretations rather than discoveries or
inventions (Walzer 1987). And what they interpret are ways of doing
things—customs, habits, traditions, and skills: </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
the pedigree of every political ideology shows it to be the creature,
not of premeditation in advance of political activity, but of
meditation upon a manner of politics. (<em>RP</em> 51) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The Rationalist, unaware of the local origins of the universal
principles he thinks he has identified, disparages knowledge gained
through experience and rejects it in favor of something called reason.
Whether deductive or computational, this abstract reason is thought to
guarantee a degree of certainty that experience and judgment cannot
provide. The fallacy of Rationalism, in other words, is that the
knowledge it identifies as rational is itself the product of
experience and judgment. It consists of rules, methods, or techniques
abstracted from practice, tools that, far from being substitutes for
experience and judgment, cannot be effectively used in the absence of
experience and judgment.</p>

<p>
Oakeshott discusses many examples of ideological politics in his
essays on Rationalism. He dissects the rhetorical strategies of Locke,
Bentham, and Marx and takes contemporaries to task for thinking that
political conclusions can be extracted from religious or scientific
principles or from the lessons of history. In his <em>Lectures in the
History of Political Thought</em> (Oakeshott 2006, Lecture 31) and the
last part of <em>On Human Conduct</em> (<em>OHC</em> 263–316),
he discusses the arguments of Francis Bacon, the German Cameralists,
and others who impute a collective purpose to the state as an
enterprise for promoting some particular substantive goal. Depending
on the thinker, this goal might be religious, economic, imperial, or
therapeutic. Bacon emerges as an prominent figure in articulating the
view that the purpose of government is to exploit nature, which
implies mobilizing labor for the sake of collective prosperity or
welfare—an implication fully explored and developed by
subsequent thinkers, often but not only those identified as socialist
(the “collective” and “welfare” elements of
this view of the modern state are characteristically socialist, but
the theme of exploiting nature is ubiquitous). Oakeshott examines
seventeenth-century Puritanism, eighteenth-century enlightened
despotism, and twentieth-century totalitarianism, all of which view
the state as a corporate enterprise of one kind or another, instances
of what he sometimes calls “teleocracy”. Like Hannah
Arendt, he underlines the importance of European imperialism in
nurturing new forms of despotism (Arendt 1951).</p>

<p>
Oakeshott pushed his explorations of ideological politics in two
directions. The aim of the first was to distinguish alternative
understandings of the modern European state. The aim of the second was
to affirm the autonomy of explanatory theorizing and its independence
from practical engagement by criticizing the view that the two are
inextricably related: the so-called “unity of theory and
practice”. This is actually an argument, such as one finds in
American pragmatism or in Heidegger and Gadamer, for the practical
character of all knowledge (Neill 2013). Oakeshott’s targets
include the arguments not only of practitioners of ideological
politics but also those of critical theorists and moral philosophers
who identify their activity as providing practical guidance under the
label of normative or applied ethics. One such argument is that
because politics is a practical activity, political philosophy is also
practical. It aims primarily to judge and guide politics and only
secondarily and instrumentally to understand it. Because the
understanding it seeks is for the sake of judgment and action,
political philosophy is intrinsically prescriptive or
norm-setting.</p>

<p>
Oakeshott challenged this view of political philosophy as inherently
practical. Not only is it possible to distinguish political philosophy
from its object, politics, but its claim to being philosophical
requires that it be so distinguished. He makes the same point about
moral philosophy. Normative ethics, he argued early on, is
“pseudo-philosophy” (<em>EM</em> 331–346). Just as a
theory of jokes is not itself a joke (<em>OHC</em> 10), a theory of
morality is not itself a morality. Moral and political theorizing,
Oakeshott thought, aims to understand, not to prescribe. The object of
theorizing is a “going-on” to be reflected upon
(“theorized”) by an observer (a “theorist”)
whose reflections may generate a conclusion (a “theorem”)
(Oakeshott 2004: 391; <em>OHC</em> 3). Theorizing is here
distinguished from what Oakeshott calls “doing” in that
the product of theorizing is an understanding, typically formulated as
a theorem or proposition, in contrast to doing, in relation to which
whatever reflection takes place assumes the form of deliberation
designed to yield an action. Theorizing, which can occur in the modes
of history and science as well as in philosophy, is not prescriptive
but explanatory. What distinguishes philosophical from historical or
scientific inquiry is that it is more critical in examining the
presuppositions of inquiry: where the scientist or historian wants to
get on with an inquiry, the philosopher is concerned—as Arendt
also observes—to examine the experience of thinking itself,
which is not an activity confined to professionals and which
professionalism as well as the lack of it can at times obstruct
(<em>EM</em> 7; <em>OHC</em> 1–12; Arendt 1971: 427). Political
philosophy is properly philosophical when it questions the
presuppositions underlying those aspects of practical activity that
are called political. </p>

<p>
An objection to distinguishing theory and practice in this way is that
it treats as categorial a distinction that is better understood as one
of degree. Political theory is messy. In any actual inquiry,
theorizing and prescribing will be mixed together and it is not always
clear where one begins and the other ends. They are certainly joined
in Oakeshott’s writings (Haddock 2005). But the objection
affirms rather than denies the distinction. This is not to say that
the distinction between theorizing and doing cannot be challenged, but
to push the discussion further the challenge must redefine the terms
involved, for example by defining practical reasoning as reasoning
that results in changes in belief and not only actions (Wallace
2014). Alternatively, one might treat the theory-practice distinction
as contextual: a philosopher’s theoretical argument can look
practical to a historian whose concern is to explain it in relation to
a debate in which the philosopher was engaged.</p>

<p>
For Oakeshott, philosophy is distinguished from other kinds of
thinking, and especially from practical thinking, by its commitment to
questioning rather than using the kinds of knowledge they privilege.
Theorizing politics is therefore not the same as engaging in it, and
to the extent that theorizing is itself political it fails as
theorizing. The distinctive contribution of political philosophy, for
Oakeshott, is not to generate ideologies or recommend policies but to
understand political activity and ideas. The understandings it
generates, moreover, are always provisional. Others may use these
understandings to explain what is going on or to recommend a response
to it, but to the philosopher, qua philosopher, they are material for
further reflection. Although this might seem to blur the distinction
between philosophy and other kinds of inquiry, Oakeshott preserves
that distinction by identifying philosophy as an inquiry that is
characteristically more relentless in questioning presuppositions than
other inquiries: an inquiry </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
in which questions are asked not in order to be answered but so that
they may themselves be interrogated with respect to their conditions.
(<em>OHC</em> 11) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
To embrace this enterprise is to escape the prison of one’s
current understanding. For the philosopher, it is to leave politics
and even political philosophy behind to pursue other inquiries. This
view is not a description of what political philosophers are doing
(they do many things) nor a prescription for how they should proceed;
it is the product of Oakeshott’s reflections on his own
experience in moving from engaging with political arguments to
uncovering their presuppositions.</p>

<h2 id="CiviAsso">4. Civil Association</h2>

<p>
For the study of politics to be genuinely philosophical, Oakeshott
thought, it must exchange the vocabulary of political controversy for
one that allows it to explain politics in terms that differ from those
that need to be explained. The two vocabularies are not
interchangeable, however, which leads to misunderstanding. The
philosopher, to borrow Plato’s metaphor, has left the cave and,
should he return, saying strange things, he will not be understood and
is likely to offend when he questions the beliefs of the cave-dwellers
(Plato, <em>Republic</em> Book 6, 514a.2–515a.7; <em>OHC</em>
27–31). The need to escape the prison of an inherited political
vocabulary explains why, in <em>On Human Conduct</em> especially,
Oakeshott departs from that vocabulary to capture the character of the
mode of association he calls “civil” and to contrast it
with the idea of the state as an association to promote a substantive
purpose: a corporate enterprise. Civil association implies a state
whose laws leave citizens free to pursue their own self-chosen goals
within limits that secure that freedom for all: a state that is
premised on the independence of those associated and is therefore
hostile to the domination that occurs when one person seeks to
arbitrarily impose his preferences on others or when the state itself
is organized to impose a collective purpose on everyone.
Oakeshott’s Latinate terminology—<em>civitas</em> for
state, <em>cives</em> for citizens, <em>lex</em> for law, <em>jus</em>
for the rightness of law, and <em>respublica</em> for the common
good—springs from his wish to direct the reader away from the
conventional connotations of the English words by using words that are
both less familiar and less contaminated by the concerns of enterprise
association that pervade modern politics and therefore modern
political discourse. <em>Civitas</em> is a mode of association in
which <em>cives</em> are related to one another as fellow subjects of
a common law, and in which the laws on which their relationship is
based are noninstrumental rules.</p>

<p>
A common objection to this view of the state is that any actual state
must rest on instrumental as well as noninstrumental rules; no state
can proceed without issuing orders and framing policies to secure
compliance, to raise revenue, to defend itself against internal and
external enemies, and so forth. Oakeshott would not disagree. Any
actual state is a mixture of formal and substantive elements,
procedures and policies, of civil and enterprise association. What he
is doing, philosophically, is not describing the features of any
actual state but rather identifying the “postulates” of
civil association as a mode of association: those aspects of the state
that define its civil character and distinguish it from states in
which that character is recessive or even suppressed, as it is in
despotic states. <em>Cives</em> are united in their recognition of the
authority of <em>lex</em> and of the obligations it prescribes. The
law identified as <em>lex</em> constrains citizens in the same way
that Hobbes said hedges constrain travellers: they keep them on the
roads without prescribing their destinations (<em>Leviathan</em>, ch.
30). To say that the laws in a <em>civitas</em> are authoritative is
to say that their authority as law is independent of whether
<em>cives</em> approve or disapprove of the obligations they
prescribe. Similarly, to consider the desirability of an existing or
proposed law in a civil association is to engage in an activity
narrowly focused on the question of whether that law is an appropriate
expression of <em>respublica</em>, understood not as a common
substantive good, interest, or purpose but as the rules, procedures,
offices, and related practices and arrangements governing the conduct
of the associates (<em>OHC</em> 147–149).</p>

<p>
Oakeshott considers the implications of this conception of the modern
state in <em>On Human Conduct</em>, the essay on “The Rule of
Law”, and other works. Underlying the theory of civil
association he develops in these writings is a distinction between two
modes of human relationship, one moral and the other prudential. Laws
in the <em>mode</em> of civil association, which is an idea abstracted
from what might be going on in an actual state, are noninstrumental
rules of individual coexistence, the coexistence of independent wills,
and not instruments to advance a collective purpose. Such laws can
therefore be characterized as “moral”, in the sense of
being authoritative constraints on how individuals go about satisfying
their wants, rather than as prudential, that is, as instruments for
achieving satisfactions. <em>Cives</em> are related on the basis of
rules rather than wants. In contrast to persons related in
transactions or in cooperation to procure individual or joint
satisfactions, persons related morally (in this deontological sense of
the term) are related on the basis of rules as rules: noninstrumental
standards of conduct whose authority is distinguished from their
utility. One might question Oakeshott’s use of the word
“moral” without disagreeing with his suggestion that there
is a distinction between the propriety of an act as judged by its
relationship to a rule and its consequential desirability. A moral
rule binds people regardless of their purposes; it binds enemies as
well as friends. As a moral relationship, civil association unites
people not as comrades pursuing a shared goal but as individuals
pursuing goals of their own, subject to the constraints of a common
law that is not itself the instrument of some larger purpose.</p>

<p>
<em>Lex</em> is what Oakeshott calls an “ideal character”,
an abstraction that must not be confused with the law of any existing
state. To theorize civil association is not to describe the contingent
features of a particular state but to identify its presuppositions as
a distinguishable kind of legal order. Having identified the modes of
civil and enterprise association, Oakeshott is in a position to
distinguish a legal order organized to advance a substantive purpose,
whose laws are instrumental to that enterprise, from a legal order
that is without any such purpose, the laws of which are
noninstrumental constraints on the choices of subjects pursuing
purposes of their own. Once this is understood, we can see why he
identifies the rule of law with civil association: the point of
distinguishing a kind of legal order identified as the rule of law is
precisely to distinguish between laws premised on the independence of
citizens from those designed to conscript them for purposes not their
own and thus to dominate them. For Oakeshott, the rule of law is a
concept, not a description of any actual legal order, much less a
guiding ideal or ideology (as it is for a less philosophical legal
thinker like Friedrich Hayek). In what is sometimes called “the
ambiguity thesis” (Friedman 1989), Oakeshott holds that any
actual state—any actual legal order—is mixture of
noninstrumental rules regulating interactions among citizens and rules
instrumental to achieving substantive purposes, that is, an ambiguous
combination of civil and enterprise association.</p>

<p>
Even in states where the civil character predominates there will be
enterprise elements as well. To affect the conduct of the associates
in an actual state, there must not only be rules of association but
also procedures for recognizing, altering, and applying those rules.
Civil association, in other words, requires legislative and judicial
institutions as well as an apparatus of “ruling”
(policing, taxing, conscripting, etc.). Such institutions are required
to anchor the idea of civility in the real world. The rule of law
needs judges and legislators if it is to subsist in an actual state.
The government of an actual state will occupy buildings, keep records,
employ administrators, and collect taxes, and manage other material
instruments of governing. As part of the practical engagement of
governing it will sometimes pursue substantive policies, seek to
produce particular outcomes, issue specific orders or commands, and
concern itself not only with classes of persons but named individuals.
It must make arrests, issue injunctions, and even in emergencies
impose martial law. All these powers can be, and often are, misused
and corrupted, but the powers themselves must be available if the rule
of law is to be more than “a logician’s dream”
(<em>OH</em> 149). Nevertheless, in civil association the
<em>persona</em> of the legislator, judge, or administrator is defined
by the obligations of <em>lex</em>. In the mode of civil association,
the persona of the legislator is not that of an advocate of policies.
A judge is not an arbitrator between interests nor is an administrator
(ruler) the manager of a purposive project. What is to be legislated,
adjudicated, and enforced is noninstrumental law, <em>lex</em>, not
laws that are instruments for promoting the policies of the state
conceived as a corporate enterprise. In any actual state these
personas—legislator and policy-maker, judge and arbitrator,
ruler and manager—may not be sharply distinguished. But in the
mode of civil association, the ideas of legislative and executive
authority are distinct and justice is blind.</p>

<p>
There is a tension, then, between the conceptual presuppositions of
the rule of law or civil association—in Oakeshott’s
thought the two are synonymous—and the conditions for realizing
it in the contingent circumstances of a particular state. A related
tension is that between the authority of laws and their desirability,
for a legal order that most of its subjects disapproved of might have
difficulty sustaining itself. But the tension is conceptual and not
only practical. Oakeshott joins other theorists who are sometimes
labeled legal positivists in distinguishing the validity of a law as
law (which he calls its “authenticity”) from its
desirability or justice (“rightness”). But as the
vocabulary he has chosen signals, there are subtle differences he
wants the reader to keep in mind. In a state understood as a civil
association, a law is authentic if it is the outcome of an
authoritative procedure for enacting or otherwise recognizing it as
belonging to a given legal order, which leaves open the question of
its utility, moral legitimacy, justice in the sense of meeting some
standard of fair distribution, or other qualities that might be
thought to bear on its desirability. For Oakeshott, the rightness of a
law (strictly speaking, the <em>jus</em> of <em>lex</em>) is not a
matter of its consequences. He does not agree with John Rawls, Ronald
Dworkin, and other liberal egalitarians that the rightness of a law
(which they call justice) depends on whether it fairly distributes
benefits and burdens (<em>OH</em> 156). Nor does he agree that it
depends on criteria that Lon Fuller (1969) calls the “inner
morality” of law, which requires among other things that laws be
public, general, and prospective rather than retroactive. These are,
he argues qualities not of justice but of legality—a law that is
secret, tailored to affect particular named individuals, or regulating
acts done before it had been enacted are disguised commands, not
genuine rules (<em>OHC</em> 128). Oakeshott also disagrees with those
who think that the justice of a law depends on its conformity with a
higher law, either divine or natural, with principles of human rights,
or with any other universal and categorical standard (<em>OHC</em>
174; <em>OH</em> 142). But he does not accept the positivist argument
that the justice of a law is the same as its validity. To make that
argument, he thinks, is to confuse justice with authority by taking
the law itself as providing criteria for assessing its own
justice.</p>

<p>
Oakeshott is clearer about what justice in civil association is not
than about what it is. He suggests that the most important
consideration in assessing the justice of a law is whether the
obligations it prescribes are appropriately imposed by law, in part
because law is inherently coercive (<em>OHC</em> 160; <em>OH</em>
143). That an action is harmful, wrong, or otherwise undesirable is
not necessarily a decisive reason to forbid it legally. Whether a
state should constrain someone’s choices on such grounds depends
on what Oakeshott calls the moral-legal self-understanding of a
community (<em>OH</em> 160). If the criteria used in judging the
justice of laws are not already embedded in the way that a community
deliberates legal changes, what is called justice can become an
arbitrary standard that undermines the rule of law. The defect here is
that of “Rationalism”, judging the laws of a community
according to abstract criteria unrelated to the self-understandings of
its members. His view resembles that of Michael Walzer, who argues
that appropriate and effective “social criticism” comes
from those who are experienced in the ways of the community they
criticize: they are “connected critics” who based their
criticism on the community’s own standards: who stand “a
little to the side, but not outside” the communities whose
practices they criticize (Walzer 1987: 61). The desirability or
otherwise of a law, then, must be judged in relation to the practices
of the community (its “traditions”, in his earlier
vocabulary) and to the vocabulary commonly used in debating limits on
individual conduct. Deliberating the <em>jus</em> of <em>lex</em>
calls for a disciplined focus on the obligations that it is proper for
a state to prescribe, and among these is certainly the consideration
that it should not impose on citizens substantive purposes that are
not their own. But a law might also be found undesirable if enforcing
it requires intrusive surveillance of the sort that might, for
example, be thought necessary to suppress terrorism. The character of
deliberation in a state understood to be a civil association is
defined by its style more than its conclusions in particular cases
(<em>OH</em> 161).</p>

<p>
Oakeshott’s idea of civil association is a response to a
fundamental question in political philosophy: how can the nonvoluntary
character of law be reconciled with individual freedom? And his
answer, which perspicuously restates conclusions reached by Rousseau,
Kant, Mill, and others, is that law can respect individual freedom
only when it is understood as limited to regulating the interactions
of citizens pursuing purposes of their own. To have a legal order of
this kind requires coercion to ensure adequate compliance with its
laws, but coercion for that purpose must be distinguished from
coercion designed to advance substantive policies unrelated to
maintaining the civil order itself. When law becomes an instrument for
imposing the purposes of some on others who do not share them, law as
a framework for coexistence among free individuals gives way to
tyranny. The legal subject in an enterprise state is not an
independent citizen but someone to be led, managed, mobilized, and
provided for: a subordinate assigned a role in a purposive enterprise.
It must not be forgotten that the distinction here is a conceptual
one: Oakeshott is distinguishing two modes of associations and the
understanding of law that goes with each, not describing any
particular state or denying that different states combine civil and
enterprise elements in different proportions. The dependent
role-player in an enterprise state and the independent individual in a
civil one are equally “free”, in one sense of that term,
because both have “agency”, the capacity to choose even
when their choices are constrained. But only in civil association do
those associated enjoy “individual freedom”, which for
Oakeshott means freedom from being legally subjected to the arbitrary
choices of others.</p>

<p>
This is a version of the republican idea of freedom as independence or
nondomination (Skinner 1998; Pettit 1997), though for Oakeshott as
for Kant this freedom is defined in moral rather than material terms
and stripped of certain other elements of republican political
thought, such as that people must have a hand in making the laws that
govern them. Individual freedom, which is distinct from the freedom
inherent in agency, is not compromised by law in civil association.
One reason for this is that law in civil association, as a
<em>mode</em> of association, consists of general laws, not
substantive commands (Coats 1992: 104). From the standpoint of a
concern for individual freedom, the problem with the state as an
enterprise association is that it cannot accommodate purposes that are
“eccentric or indifferent to its purpose” and is for that
reason inherently as well as contingently compulsory (<em>OHC</em>
316). Participating in a purposive enterprise can express
individuality only if it is freely chosen. The subjects of an
enterprise state are not free because the purposes they are compelled
to serve have been chosen for them. And though some may contingently
escape, whether they are permitted to go (or for that matter to
remain) is a management decision (<em>OHC</em> 317). To be subject to
the laws of a state understood as an enterprise association is
therefore to participate in a collective project that is not
one’s own. Because individual freedom in purposive association
is the freedom to dissociate as well as to associate, it can exist
only if the association is voluntary, and this cannot be the case if
the association is a state.</p>

<p>
Oakeshott develops his account of civil association in the second part
of <em>On Human Conduct</em>. In the first part of that book, he
explores the presuppositions on which it rests—the ideas of
agency, agents, actions, transactions for the satisfaction of wants,
instrumental and noninstrumental practices, and the “human
conduct” of agents related in terms of such transactions and
practices. And in the third and final part he explores ideas about the
character of the modern state in European political practice and
philosophy since the late Middle Ages, a topic he also considers in
other writings (Oakeshott 1993b, 1996, 2006, 2008). He traces the
distinction between civil and enterprise association to the medieval
ideas of <em>societas</em> and <em>universitas</em>, terms that he
adapts (and reconstructs) for his purpose. <em>Societas</em>
designates a relationship of agents in a practice (such as a common
language) </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
joined not in seeking a common substantive satisfaction, but in virtue
of their understanding and acknowledgement of the conditions of the
practice concerned and of the relationships it entails. (<em>OHC</em>
88) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
A <em>universitas</em>, in contrast, is a corporate undertaking (such
as a partnership, guild, or school) established to achieve a
particular end. <em>Societas</em> is not synonymous with civil
association, however; it stands for a larger class of relationships in
terms of the noninstrumental considerations that define them. The
civil condition emerges only when these considerations harden into
rules (“laws”) and are seen to require ways of
recognizing, altering, and enforcing them. Reflection on the
characteristics of the modern state, so conceived, appears in the
writings of Machiavelli, Madison, Constant, and Montesquieu, among
others, and more philosophically (that is, in terms of its
presuppositions) in those of Bodin, Hobbes, Spinoza, Kant, Fichte, and
Hegel. Paralleling these efforts are those of theorists of the state
as a purposive enterprise. These include Francis Bacon, who theorized
the state as a productive estate, Joseph de Maistre, who saw it as
“a religious corporation in the Catholic idiom”
(<em>OHC</em> 281), and various theorists of enlightened despotism,
socialism, and national development. But Oakeshott’s discussion
of these thinkers and doctrines is brief and only loosely historical,
inviting the charge that he is using them for purposes of his own and
in a way that falls short of his own standard of genuine historical
inquiry.</p>

<h2 id="HistHumaScie">5. History and the Human Sciences</h2>

<p>
By distinguishing thinking aimed at understanding and explaining from
thinking aimed at deliberating and acting, Oakeshott sought to protect
historical, scientific, and philosophical inquiry from the imperialism
of practical concerns. This effort can be seen with particular clarity
in his treatment of historical inquiry, especially in his concern to
distinguish the idea of a distinctively historical past from what he
called “the practical past”. Genuine historical inquiry is
concerned with what happened, which is dead and cannot speak to
present concerns, not with an imagined practical relevance implied in
expressions such as “the lessons of history” (EM 316) or
“the living past” (OH 19). Historical inquiry is
explanatory, not an exercise in seeking guidance from past experience.
It is not that experience cannot guide but that the guidance found is
not “historical”. Nor is it the business of history to
justify the present by telling a story about progress. Books about the
progress of the human mind (Condorcet) or the end of history
(Fukuyama) written from the standpoint of the author’s time
offer not history but retrospective politics of the sort that Herbert
Butterfield called “Whig history”, history designed to
ratify, if not glorify, the present (Butterfield 1931). Oakeshott drew on the
efforts of historians to distinguish an understanding of history that
was detached from present concerns to create a theory of history as a
distinct mode of inquiry and understanding. It is a theory, too, that
makes historical explanation central to the study of human
conduct.</p>

<p>
Implicit in these claims for the autonomy and importance of historical
inquiry is a distinction between scientific and interpretive
approaches to understanding human affairs. Oakeshott uses the word
“conduct” to identify intelligent choice and action, and
contrasts it with behavior that can be explained as the outcome of
natural, not-intelligent, processes. Such explanations, which have
their place in understanding natural phenomena, are irrelevant to
understanding human conduct as expressions of intelligence and
therefore as involving ideas. Unlike the natural sciences, what are
sometimes called the “human sciences”
(<em>Geisteswissenchaften</em>, the sciences of mind as ideas or
culture) are interpretive. They are, in fact, doubly interpretive
because they interpret human conduct, which is itself an interpretive
activity. And insofar as these disciplines move beyond interpreting
human conduct to explaining particular acts, the explanations they
provide are “historical” explanations.</p>

<p>
In making these arguments Oakeshott draws on late nineteenth- and
early twentieth-century German thinking about the study of history,
and especially on the anti-positivism of Windelband, Rickert, and
Dilthey. Their arguments rest on a distinction between the realm of
human freedom and that of natural necessity advanced by Vico, Kant,
and Hegel, among others. Understanding human conduct from the
perspective of judgment and choice can be scientific—that is,
systematic—in its own manner. Such inquiry may focus on what
Hegel called “objective spirit”, shared ideas expressed in
languages, moral traditions, and other practices that must be
interpreted to be understood. But it can also concern itself with
individual performances: particular acts, ideas, judgments, arguments,
and other products of thinking. The human sciences, the disciplines of
the humanities and humanistic social sciences, are concerned with the
content of thinking—ideas—not the biochemical processes
that make thinking possible (<em>VLL</em> 23–24).</p>

<p>
If distinguishing the social sciences from the humanities was a
mistake, Oakeshott thought, another mistake was to imagine that the
word “social” designates a subject for investigation.
Sociology, he argued, is not a discipline with its own subject matter;
it is either coextensive with the social sciences or else the study of
what remains when disciplines such as economics and psychology have
claimed certain aspects of human activity as their own. But the study
of a residual category cannot constitute a genuine discipline, nor is
there any general science of society that grounds the conclusions of
economics, psychology, and the other social sciences. What are loosely
called social relationships are actually relationships in terms of
specific practices—habits, customs, rules, and roles—that
prescribe considerations of utility or propriety in acting. They are
not, as Oakeshott thought sociologists were inclined to assume, </p>

<p>
This is not a point about nomenclature but rather the argument that a
proper discipline is one whose boundaries enable a coherent inquiry or
set of inquiries. For Oakeshott, the category that defines a coherent
set of inquiries is not “social” but
“intelligent”. Intelligence, here, is not the quality of
being bright or stupid but of having agency, the capacity to think and
choose. An object excavated by an archaeologist is either a
manifestation of intelligence (an inscribed tablet) or not (just
another rock). The categories intelligent and not-intelligent are
orders of inquiry within which more specific inquiries can be carried
on. Intelligence is not an ontological category but an epistemological
one. Oakeshott is not suggesting that the experienced world is made up
of two kinds of things but rather that we experience the world
differently according to the categories of understanding we bring to
experience. And for that understanding to be coherent, it must respect
the categorial distinction between the intelligent and the
not-intelligent because these categories are mutually exclusive.
Propositions that rest on one set of presuppositions cannot be
combined with propositions resting on the other. Propositions about
the biochemistry of thinking cannot explain the meaning of what a
person is thinking. No inquiry, in short, can lead to a coherent body
of knowledge if its objects are categorially ambiguous. This claim
restates Oakeshott’s point that cross-modal arguments are
necessarily incoherent. Much of what is called “social
science” is undermined by efforts to understand intelligent
conduct as the product of not-intelligent physiological,
psychological, or social processes understood as
“natural”, that is, as operating independently of
understanding and choice. Such efforts cannot generate genuine
knowledge because they involve a categorial error. Coherent
explanation is impossible when </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
rules are misidentified as regularities, intelligent winks as
physiological blinks, conduct as “behavior” and contingent
relationships as causal or systematic connections. (<em>VLL</em>
26)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Thoughts and actions can be explained, but the way they are explained
is historically, not scientifically. An argument, choice, or judgment
made by a particular person at a particular moment is an individual
performance, an event. Scientific psychology can generalize about how
people are likely to act but it cannot explain particular choices,
which may fail to illustrate those generalizations, much less the
intellectual content of arguments or thoughts. And the reason for this
limitation is not only the categorial impossibility of explaining the
content of an idea in terms of statistical correlations or biochemical
processes but the gap between an observed generalization and a
particular act. The generalizations about human nature or social
circumstances sought, tested, and relied upon by social scientists,
though often illuminating, cannot explain individual acts, which as
human conduct are always performances in relation to some practice or
practices, and always involve ideas. The social sciences search for
causal relationships between variables like age, income, occupation,
or race, and they offer explanations in terms of these relationships
rather than in terms of intelligent choice and action. Such
explanations are possible, but what they explain is variance in the
data, not particular performances. Explaining particulars, Oakeshott
argues, is “historical” explanation, which as he
understands it is categorially distinct from scientific explanation.
An observed pattern in the data, a generalization, identifies a
“type” of action. A performance, in contrast, is the
choice of an actual agent in a particular place and moment—in
the language of philosophy, it is a “token” (Wetzel 2014).
Science as a generalizing mode of inquiry does not aim to explain
individual events but rather the occurrence and causes of kinds of
events. The humanities and humanistic social sciences are concerned
with individual events or other individual objects. In some cases
these objects are themselves types: the individual religion
“Christianity” is a sub-type of the type
“religion”. In other cases, the object is a token: the
baptism of Delphine Picot in New Orleans on 7 April 1853 is an
individual event, an instance of the type baptism. What makes a
performance individual is the particular meaning it has, which is best
explained in relation to antecedent events. For Oakeshott, only
explanations of this kind are properly historical. We can go part way
toward explaining a performance by interpreting it in relation to the
practices it performs, but such an interpretation does little more
than illuminate the type of conduct a particular performance
illustrates. A performance is also one in a series of acts each of
which has meaning in relation to acts that have come before it. These
antecedent acts, or some of them, that illuminate its unique
character.</p>

<p>
Oakeshott’s account of historical explanation departs sharply
from a positivist theory like the covering law model (Hempel 1942;
Nagel 1961) because it holds that a historical explanation purports to
explain not just the occurrence of an event but its significance.
Unlike scientific explanations, which postulate the occurrence of
repeatable events, historical explanations postulate events that are
individual and unique. Positivist theories of historical explanation
get things backward by assuming that the event to be explained is
already understood (that it is an instance of a type of event), but
the historian cannot make that assumption. Historical inquiry is not
an exercise in explaining events whose character is known in advance
of the effort to explain it. That character has yet to be established,
and it can be established only by showing how events that the evidence
indicates to be its antecedents led to it and not to some other
individual event. The relationship between an antecedent event and a
subsequent event is a “contingent” one in which the
meaning (“character”) of the subsequent event is
illuminated by the antecedent.</p>

<p>
Oakeshott’s conclusion that history is central to the human
sciences is the result of reflecting on the limitations of science in
understanding ideas and practices, and in explaining the individual
performances that illustrate those ideas and practices. But it is also
the result of reflecting on the limits of interpretation in explaining
individual performances. Scholars in the humanities and humanistic
social sciences typically interpret such performances as expressing or
reacting to a historical practices such as religious ceremonies,
musical genres, culinary traditions, or legal procedures, which may be
understood as “languages” of human performance. But the
understanding thereby gained is incomplete, Oakeshott argues, because
what it reveals is not the individuality of a performance but rather
its “conventionality” (OHC 99–100). As explanation,
interpretation is therefore always incomplete. It can help to
understand contexts, situations, and types of action (practices) but
cannot explain the occurrence of a particular act (performance): why a
particular person did such and such a thing on this or that
occasion.</p>

<p>
Given his view of the importance of history among the human sciences,
the attention that Oakeshott paid it over many decades is not
surprising. History is the first mode that he considers in
<em>Experience and its Modes</em> and he returned to the topic in most
of his later books as well as in many book reviews and unpublished
essays. History as a mode is not a record of past events but a
distinct way of identifying and accounting for events, and the task of
the philosophy of history, as Oakeshott sees it, is to clarify what
makes historical inquiry distinct. Historical inquiry is above all
constructive; it cannot simply record historical events because what
is identified as an event depends on evidence, which must itself be
winnowed. The point, fundamental to the modern discipline of critical
history, was made in 1852 by Gustav Droysen, who argued that </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
the data for historical investigation are not past things, for these
have disappeared, but things which are still present here and now,
whether recollections of what was done, or remnants of things that
have existed and of events that have occurred. (Droysen 1893: 11) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The historian begins not with the past itself, brute facts, but with
survivals from the past that must be authenticated and interpreted
before they can be used as evidence. Historical facts are conclusions;
they are not “what really happened” but “what the
evidence obliges us to believe” (EM 112), in the sense that we
identify as historical fact the conclusions that our investigation
best supports. The task of historical inquiry is to establish
historical knowledge, according to the canons of the historian’s
craft, from evidence that is always scattered, suspect, and open to
being interpreted in different ways.</p>

<p>
Historical knowledge, as Oakeshott sees it, can therefore be said to
be constructed (Goldstein 1976; O’Sullivan 2006). The concepts
(“identities”) that the historian uses to organize an
inquiry—the Renaissance, China, just war theory—are
designated, not discovered, and also changing, not immutable.
Historical identities are interpretive tools that dissolve under
scrutiny into collections of events. They are not a given but
themselves open to historical reconsideration. The historian’s
concern, then, is with a sequence of events that is itself a changing
identity to be understood. Historical <em>inquiry</em> is the study of
changes in identified events that are understood as outcomes of
antecedent events and that are themselves changing identities. And
historical <em>explanation</em> is illuminating the circumstantial
meaning of events in relation to their antecedents, which in a
genuinely historical inquiry are always events and never laws or
processes. In a historical explanation, an event to be explained is
made intelligible as the outcome of what the evidence leads the
historian to conclude are relevant antecedent events. In this
account of historical inquiry, which Oakeshott
develops in the second essay in <em>On History</em> (<em>OH</em>
45–96), a particular historical past appears as a collection of
contingently related events, often presented in a narrative. But not
necessarily: Oakeshott argues against what was an emerging view at the
time he was writing (Ankersmit 1983; see Danto 2007 for a later
exposition of this view) because he insists that although historians
frequently do construct narratives, the narrative form is merely one
way of presenting historical knowledge (others include synchronic
portraits or quantitative patterns). </p>

<p>
If historical knowledge is a construction, it follows that what we
identify as the past in fact belongs to the present because it is what
the evidence supports within the present body of historical knowledge.
Historical facts are present because all facts are present, that is,
exist as conclusions within a present system of ideas. The historical
past is constructed according to what present evidence—objects
that have survived into the present, such as an axe, diary, painting,
or coin, that are treated as evidence—compels the historian to
believe. Nor is this constructed past the only possible past: if there
is a historical past then there must be other, non-historical, pasts
constructed in modes other than the historical mode (OH 9). Of these,
Oakeshott is largely concerned with what he calls the practical past
because of the difficulty of distinguishing it from a past constructed
in historical inquiry: </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
even the most severely “historical” concern with the past
is still liable to be compromised by seeking the answer to questions
which are not historical questions and by asides and even judgments
which belong to some other mode of understanding. (OH 118)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
What is distinctive about Oakeshott’s conception of historical
inquiry and explanation can be brought out by comparing it with R.G.
Collingwood’s more familiar claim that the historian’s aim
is to reenact the past (Collingwood 1993 [1946]: 282–302). That
claim makes historical truth subjective by requiring that the
historian reconstruct past events as they were experienced by those
who participated in them. But this privileges the understandings of
the participants, who may not have understood or even known what was
happening, and it overlooks their differences with one another. Their
ideas are important in reconstructing the past but are not themselves
the whole of what we need to know to explain a historical event. To
argue otherwise is to argue that the historian is barred from having
any ideas about the past that “would have been impossible for
anyone who lived in that past” (Oakeshott 2008: 49). Nor does
Oakeshott agree with Collingwood’s claim that “all
philosophy is the philosophy of history” (Collingwood 1993
[1926]: 425) because this would make philosophy, and by implication
all knowledge, subservient to historical knowledge (Oakeshott 2007:
199). For Oakeshott, history is a mode of understanding, not a
primordial form of human experience of which all other forms are
modes. Collingwood’s argument for the primacy of history
(historicism) is no less reductionist than arguments for the primacy
of science (scientism) or practice (pragmatism). These and other
arguments, which are based on the premise that a particular mode of
understanding is the foundation of other kinds of understanding,
characteristically assume the truth of what they set out to prove.
Historical inquiry constructs knowledge from what in the mode of
history counts as evidence. It does not provide knowledge of a given,
pre-modal reality. Historical foundationalism postulates unmediated
access to historical reality, but if historical pasts are intellectual
constructions, there is no access to these pasts except through
historical inquiry.</p>
