<h1>Gilbert Ryle</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Tue Dec 18, 2007; substantive revision Wed Feb 4, 2015</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>

Although Gilbert Ryle published on a wide range of topics in
philosophy (notably in the history of philosophy and in philosophy of
language), including a series of lectures centred on philosophical
dilemmas, a series of articles on the concept of thinking, and a book
on Plato, <em>The Concept of Mind</em> remains his best known and most
important work. Through this work, Ryle is thought to have
accomplished two major tasks. First, he was seen to have put the final
nail in the coffin of Cartesian dualism. Second, as he himself
anticipated, he is thought to have argued on behalf of, and suggested
as dualism's replacement, the doctrine known as
<em>philosophical</em> (and sometimes <em>analytical</em>)
<em>behaviourism</em>. Sometimes known as an “ordinary
language”, sometimes as an “analytic” philosopher,
Ryle—even when mentioned in the same breath as Wittgenstein and
his followers—is considered to be on a different, somewhat
idiosyncratic (and difficult to characterise), philosophical
track.</p>

<p>

Philosophical behaviourism has long been rejected; what was worth
keeping has been appropriated by the philosophical doctrine of
functionalism, which is the most widely accepted view in philosophy of
mind today. It is a view that is thought to have saved the
“reality” of the mental from the
“eliminativist” or “fictionalist” tendencies of
behaviourism while acknowledging the insight (often attributed to Ryle)
that the mental is importantly related to behavioural output or
response (as well as to stimulus or input). According to a
reasonably charitable assessment, the best of Ryle's lessons has
long been assimilated while the problematic has been discarded.
If there are considerations still brewing from the 1930s and 40s that
would threaten the orthodoxy in contemporary philosophy of mind, these
lie somewhere in work of Wittgenstein and his followers—not in
Ryle.</p>

<p>

But the view just outlined, though widespread, represents a
fundamental misapprehension of Ryle's work. First,
Cartesianism is dead in only one of its ontological aspects: substance
dualism may well have been repudiated but property dualism still claims
a number of contemporary defenders. The problem of finding a
place for the mental in the physical world, of accommodating the causal
power of the mental, and of accounting for the phenomenal aspects of
consciousness are all live problems in the philosophy of mind today
because they share some of the doctrine's ontological,
epistemological, and semantic assumptions.</p>

<p>

Second, and importantly, Ryle is not a philosophical
behaviourist—at least he does not subscribe to any of the main
tenets associated with that doctrine as it is known today. One
may be confused by this if one is also confused about Ryle's
conception of philosophy. Although there is some truth in
identifying him as an analytic philosopher—he announces (1932,
61) that “the sole and whole function of philosophy” is
philosophical analysis—this is likely to be misunderstood today
if one thinks that the proper goal of philosophy (attainable if not in
practice at least in ideals) is definitional analysis. It is this
that encourages the association with behaviourism (in at least one of
its many senses). But Ryle was not an analytical philosopher in
this sense. True, Ryle acknowledges the influence of Moore's
emphasis on common sense (and thus on ordinary language); true, he
takes himself to be pursuing the type of philosophical investigation
(exemplified by Russell's Theory of Descriptions) that involves
uncovering the logical form of grammatically misleading
expressions. But it is important to take account of the
differences that separate Ryle from the early Moore and Russell for it
is their conception of philosophy that has been inherited by many of us
working within the “analytic” tradition in philosophy
today. That is the third point. For Ryle does not believe
in <em>meanings</em> (concepts or propositions) as these have been
traditionally construed (as stable objects or rules, the grasp of which
is logically prior to, and thus may be used to explain, the use of
expressions). Indeed, Ryle's conception of philosophy
was not fundamentally different from that of Wittgenstein. Ryle
sets out in print as early as 1932 a philosophical agenda that
prefigures the published work of the later Wittgenstein; the
“elasticity of significance” and “inflections of
meaning” Ryle finds in most expressions appear to be the family
of structures, more or less related, noticed by Wittgenstein; and
Ryle's attack on the “intellectualist legend” shares
Wittgenstein's concern to understand a
proper—non-exalted—place for rules in an explanation of
various philosophically interesting achievements. In spite of the
fact that some of Wittgenstein's protégés were
dismissive of Ryle's
 work,<sup>[<a href="notes.html#ref-1" id="note-1">1</a>]</sup>
the best way to understand Ryle is to see him,
if not as following in Wittgenstein's footsteps, then as walking
some stretches of philosophical terrain down a parallel path.</p>

<h2><a name="Bio">1. Biography</a></h2>

<p>

Gilbert Ryle was born in Brighton, Sussex, England on 19 August
1900. One of ten children, he came from a prosperous family and
enjoyed a liberal and stimulating childhood and adolescence. His
father was a general practitioner but had keen interests in philosophy
and astronomy that he passed on to his children and an impressive
library where Ryle enjoyed being an “omnivorous reader”
(Ryle, 1970, 1). Educated at Brighton College (where later in
life he would return as a governor) Ryle went to Queen's College,
Oxford in 1919 initially to study Classics, but he was quickly drawn to
Philosophy, graduating in 1924 with first-class honours in the new
Modern Greats School of Philosophy, Politics and Economics. While
not particularly sporting, his undergraduate studies were relieved by
rowing for his college eight, of which he was captain, and he was good
enough to have trials for the University boat. After his
graduation in 1924 he was appointed to a lectureship in Philosophy at
Christ Church College and a year later became tutor. He would
remain at Oxford for his entire academic career until his retirement in
1968; in 1945 he was elected to the Waynflete Chair of Metaphysical
Philosophy. With the outbreak of war Ryle volunteered. He
was commissioned in the Welsh Guards, serving in intelligence, and by
the end of the War had been promoted to the rank of Major. He
became the Editor of <em>Mind</em> after G.E. Moore's retirement
in 1947; a post he held until 1971. Ryle was unstinting in his
advice and encouragement to generations of students. With
colleagues he was “tolerant (and) uncensorious” (Warnock,
xiv), but in philosophical debate he could turn into a formidable
opponent, expressing an intense dislike of pomposity, pretence and
jargon (Urmson, 271; Gallop, 228). He was also ever ready to
challenge both the excessive veneration paid by others to Plato and
Classical authors as well as the philosophical positions held by such
contemporary colleagues as Collingwood in Oxford or Anderson in
Australia. He befriended Wittgenstein whose work, if not his effect on
colleagues and students, he greatly admired. “Outstandingly
friendly (and) sociable” (Warnock, xiv), he is remembered as an
entertaining conversationalist. Despite having turned away from
literary studies during his first year at Oxford, sensing he had little
aptitude for them, and even though he read little other than the novels
of Jane Austen (about whom he wrote authoritatively) and P. G.
Wodehouse, the style of Ryle's writing is often literary and
instantly recognizable even after a few sentences (Urmson, 271;
Mabbott, 223). A confirmed bachelor, he lived after his
retirement with his twin sister Mary in the Oxfordshire village of
Islip. Gardening and walking gave him immense pleasure, as did
his pipe. He died on 6 October 1976 at Whitby in Yorkshire after
a day's walking on the moors. “Philosophy irradiated
his whole life” (Mabbott, 224). He is reputed to have said
that the only completed portrait of him made him look like a
“drowned German General” (Mabbott, 224).</p>

<h2><a name="Car">2. Philosophy as Cartography</a></h2>

<p>

When Ryle became a young don in the 1920s, philosophers could no
longer “pretend that philosophy differed from physics, chemistry
and biology by studying mental as opposed to material phenomena”
(1971b, vii). Although the turn away from psychologism was
laudable, philosophers succumbed instead to what Ryle considered to be
a regrettable temptation to look for Objects which were neither mental
nor material. Such objects were to be for philosophy what beetles
and butterflies are for entomology:</p>

<blockquote>

Platonic Forms, Propositions, Intentional Objects, Logical
Objects…[and even] Sense Data were recruited to appease our
professional hankerings to have a subject matter of our own (1971b,
vii).</blockquote>

<p>

Ryle's campaign against the tendency of philosophers to
“hypostasise their own terms of art” lasted throughout his
career. Even his very first articles carried the
“Occamizing” message that “[p]hilosophical problems
are problems of a certain sort; they are not problems of an ordinary
sort about special entities” (1971b, vii; these early articles
include 1929, 1930, 1933a, and 1933b).</p>

<p>

Instead, think of a philosopher, by analogy, as a
cartographer. According to Ryle, competent speakers of language
are to a philosopher what an ordinary villager is to a mapmaker.
A local villager knows his way by wont and without reflection to the
village church, to the town hall, to the shops and back home again from
the personal point of view of one who lives there. But, asked to
draw or to consult a map of his village, he is faced with learning a
new and different sort of task: one that employs compass bearing and
units of measurement. What was first understood in the personal
terms of local snapshots now has to be considered in the completely
general terms of the cartographer. The villager's knowledge
by wont, enabling him to lead a stranger from place to place, is a
different skill from one requiring him to tell the stranger, in
perfectly general and neutral terms, how to get to any of the places,
or indeed, how to understand these places in relation to those of other
villages (1962a, 441).</p>

<p>

We are like the villager with respect to our employment of words and
phrases. Knowledge by wont of the use of expressions and of
concrete ideas is something everybody learns in the course of growing
up speaking and understanding a language: “their
‘logical geography’ is taught by one's daily
walks” (1945, 207). So too do people know how to operate
with ordinary, non-technical, and even semi-technical and technical
expressions as well as with relatively concrete and some abstract ideas
without being able to codify the rules, permissions, or sanctions that
govern their operations.</p>

<p>

Now, almost every word or phrase we use contributes to what we say
in a way such that had it been replaced by a word or phrase with a
different significance, it would have had different “implication
threads”:</p>

<blockquote>

It would have been a different statement, different in having
different implications, in requiring different tests for truth or
falsehood, in being compatible and incompatible with different
affiliated statements, in being evidence for or against different
corollaries, and so on. (1962a, 442-3)</blockquote>

<p>

To the extent that I understand what I am saying, I understand the
particular differences that the expression contributes to the
statements, questions, commands, etc. that I make with it. In
making everyday (non-philosophical) statements, or in asking ordinary
factual questions, or in giving concrete, practical advice I am like,
Ryle says, the villager who simply walks to his destination without
having to think about what he is doing or turning back in his
tracks. But even in making everyday, non-philosophical
statements, I employ a plurality of expressions. The implication
threads of some of these expressions may “pull against” the
implication threads of others. For example,</p>

<blockquote>

…I might truly and intelligibly describe a weary sailor in a
storm as having toiled voluntarily, although reluctantly; and then I
find myself in a perplexity. For I seem to be saying that he
toiled not under compulsion but because he volunteered to do it,
despite the fact that he did not want to do it. The natural
implication threads of ‘voluntarily’ seem to pull away from
the natural implication threads of ‘reluctantly’. (1962a,
443)</blockquote>

<p>

To resolve this complexity it is not enough that I be familiar with
the separate contributions of the two adverbs. To resolve it, I
need to be satisfied that the conflict is only apparent. I am
confronted with a conceptual problem that requires that I be able to
<em>say</em> how the implication threads of the one bear on the
implication threads of the other. This requires abstracting from
or ignoring the particular reference to this sailor or that storm; it
requires that I operate upon general notions of <em>actions, motive,
preference, strength of desires, choice</em> and so on.</p>

<p>

The most philosophically interesting questions arise for those cases
of conflict that present themselves again and again. We speak in
the same breath of a responsible human agent who is, and acts, in a
world that is a field of physical, chemical, and biological causes and
effects. “Men <em>must</em>, we feel, be free; yet they
<em>must</em>, we feel, be amenable to prediction and
explanation. Their actions cannot be mechanical. Yet also
they cannot be unmechanical” (1962a, 444). From the
point of view of laymen and scientists who are actually exploring the
world, we find out what there is by perceiving it; yet from the point
of view of the inquirer into the mechanism of perception, what we
perceive never coincides with the world (1954, 2). The
reconciliation of these convictions, an answer to the question
<em>how</em> this could be, belongs to philosophy.</p>

<blockquote>

We have now to operate <em>upon</em> what we ordinarily operate
readily and unquestioningly <em>with</em>. We now need the theory
of our daily practice, the geography of our daily walks. When two
or twenty familiar implication threads seem to pull across and against
one another, it is no longer enough to be able unperplexedly to follow
along each one by itself. We need to be able to state their
directions, their limits and their interlockings; to think
systematically <em>about</em> what normally we merely think competently
<em>with</em>. (1962a, 444)</blockquote>

<h2><a name="SysAmbTypTre">3. Systematic Ambiguity and Type Trespasses</a></h2>

<p>

Ryle's concern in much of his work was not simply the charting
of the logical bearings of ideas. It was rather to apply this
method as a way of testing (and often destroying) philosophical
theories themselves. When we put on our philosophical
hats and begin to operate not only upon concrete ideas, but abstract
ideas or abstractions, we tend to get into trouble. Not only is
it the case that every word or phrase we use contributes to what we say
in a way such that had it been replaced by a word or phrase with a
different significance, it would have had different implication
threads; had we used the same word or phrase in a different
context what we would have said is also likely to have had a different
significance with different implication threads.</p>

<blockquote>

A given word will, in different sorts of context, express ideas of
an indefinite range of differing logical types and, therefore, with
different logical powers. And what is true of single words is
also true of complex expressions and of grammatical constructions.
(1945, 206)</blockquote>

<p>

Thus, even if we were to put aside ambiguity of the kind that
logicians ignore (Ryle calls such expressions “pun words”),
we are faced with another sort of elasticity of significance which
characterizes the use, according to Ryle, “not of a few but of
most or of all expressions…”(1945, 205). Unlike
ambiguous words such as ‘bank’ or ‘report’ or
‘stud’, the inflections of meaning to which most of our
expressions are susceptible nonetheless have affinities: the ideas
expressed by these expressions in their various uses are
“intimately connected” with each other; they are
“different inflections of the same root” (1945, 206).
The paraphrases and translations of these expressions will normally
have “a precisely similar” flexibility. This means
that if we were to paraphrase the expression as it is used in one
context in order to make clear its implication threads in that context,
we can expect the paraphrase, like the original expression, to express
a different idea in a different context. To use a contemporary
idiom, the paraphrase, like the original expression, is
“context-sensitive”.</p>

<p>

The philosophical task Ryle recommends involves tracing the
inflections of significance that are conveyed by expressions with a
common root in their various uses. On this way of looking at it,
it is not wrong to say that the philosopher studies or investigates the
idea or the concept of, say, justice. But putting it this way may
be misleading if it obscures the fact that the logical force of the
relevant words (‘is just’) may change with the context in
which it is used. Again, Ryle thought this to be so for
<em>most</em> single words and complex expressions and not only the
ambiguous “pun-words”. Indeed, “[u]nnoticed
systematic ambiguities are a common source of type-confusions and
philosophic problems” (1945, 207).</p>

<p>

Systematic ambiguity affects not only single words and complex
expressions. It affects grammatical constructions as well.
Since expressions of the same grammatical constructions function
to express thoughts of multifarious logical sorts, those starting to
philosophise (those operating upon ideas and not merely with them)
“tend to be blind to the fact that different ideas have different
logical powers…” (1945, 200). Assimilation of the
functions or uses can lead to trouble, and this can be shown by
eliciting contradictions, absurdities, and paradoxes.</p>

<blockquote>

The inevitable consequence is that naïve intellectual
operations with those ideas lead directly to logically intolerable
results. Concepts of different types cannot be coerced into
similar logical conduct. Some sort of contradiction arises from
the attempt and this, in fortunate cases, compels the thinker to turn
back in his tracks and try to change his treatment of the outraged
concept. (1945,
 201)<sup>[<a href="notes.html#ref-2" id="note-2">2</a>]</sup></blockquote>

<h2><a name="ConProMea">4. Concepts, Propositions, and Meaning</a></h2>

<p>

The implications of this view for the concept of meaning or for
nominalisations of the verb ‘to mean’ are important.
We are not at all likely to be misled by expressions of the form
‘<em>x</em> means what <em>y</em> means.’ But when we use the
expression quasi-descriptively, as in ‘The meaning of <em>x</em> is the
same as the meaning of <em>y</em>’ or ‘The meaning of <em>x</em> is
doubtful’ we are liable to be misled into thinking that we are
referring to some queer new object. Ryle generalises the point to
suggest that all the mistaken doctrines of concepts, ideas, terms,
judgment, contents, and the like derive from the fallacy</p>

<blockquote>

that there must be <em>something</em> referred to by such
expressions as ‘the meaning of the word (phrase or sentence)
<em>x</em>’ [which is analogous to the policeman] who is referred
to by the descriptive phrase ‘Our village policeman is fond of
football’. (1932, 56)</blockquote>

<p>

The meaning of an expression is not an entity denoted by it and not
the nominee of any <em>thing</em>. It would be a related mistake
to suppose, Ryle tells us, that a particular concept is precisely
indicated by a particular expression: as if the idea of equality could
be identified as that for which the word ‘equality’ stands
(1945, 206). For Ryle, agreeing here with Wittgenstein,
“concepts are not things that are there crystallised in a
splendid isolation”; rather</p>

<blockquote>

they are discriminable features, but not detachable atoms, of what
is integrally said or integrally thought. They are not detachable
parts of, but distinguishable contributions to, the unitary senses of
complete sentences. To examine them is to examine the live force
of things that we actually say. It is to examine them not in
retirement, but doing their co-operative work. (1962b, 185)
 <sup>[<a href="notes.html#ref-3" id="note-3">3</a>]</sup></blockquote>

<p>

The idea that expressions have meaning insofar as they stand for
things should be rejected. Indeed, some expressions denote
(in one of a variety of ways) because they are significant. To
learn the meaning of an expression is to learn to operate correctly
with it; more like learning a piece of drill than like coming across a
previously unencountered object (1957, 365).</p>

<p>

Concepts are instead to be understood as that which is conveyed by a
word or phrase independently of the language (English or French) in
which the word is written or spoken. Although we tend to make use
of abstract nouns to talk about that which is conveyed by various
words, this should not mislead us. Russell and Moore may have
described their pursuits as the investigation of supra-mundane
entities, but this was not, claims Ryle, the way they or any other
philosopher set about their task. Aristotle, for example, when
studying Plato's account of Pleasure, did not “stare
hard” at an entity or Essence designated by this abstract noun:
“Instead he rightly considered what we are asserting or denying
<em>in concreto</em> when we say that someone did or did not enjoy the
concert; or that someone enjoys this piece of music more than that
piece” (1962b, 185). Unlike the abstract noun
“Pleasure”, the live verb is making specific contributions
to sense. Similarly, an analysis of the concept, say, of
<em>existence</em> “cannot consist just in acts of contemplating
a rarefied object, withdrawn, like a coin in a museum, from its native
commercial transactions” (1962b, 185).</p>

<h2><a name="OrdLan">5. Ordinary Language</a></h2>

<p>

Ryle is often described as an ordinary language philosopher or as
recommending that philosophy should concern itself with the ordinary
use of language. In a certain sense this is apt; in another
it is not.</p>

<p>

Philosophers may well study the stock use of various
expressions. But these may be highly technical or semi-technical
expressions, as well as vernacular ones. Berkeley, for example,
in examining the stock (and possibly the only) use of
‘infinitesimals’, was examining the way in which this word was
employed by mathematicians. Philosophers of law, biology,
mathematics, formal logic, theology, psychological and grammar are all
required to examine technical terms or concepts. So if
‘ordinary’ is contrasted with ‘technical’ or
‘specialised’ then some philosophy is and some philosophy
is not concerned with ordinary language (1953, 304).</p>

<p>

But one reason it may be true that philosophy should be couched in
vernacular terms has to do with philosophy's special task.
Just as the cartographer was required to use a different, more general
vocabulary to plot the geography of the local village, so too should
the philosopher use a more general vocabulary than the
specialist's to plot the “cross-bearings” between the
concepts of different theories. The tangles and knots that a
philosopher has to unpick are set not by some branch of specialist
theory, but “in the thought and the discourse of everyone,
specialists and non-specialists alike” (1953, 304).</p>

<p>

Talk about the <em>use</em> of an expression, like the use of
safety-pins and table-knives, helps us to avoid thinking that we are
talking about any queer relations or queer entities; to suppose or
half-suppose that “studying the meaning of the phrase ‘the
solar system’ [is]… the same thing as studying the solar
system” (1953, 306). It reminds us, for example, that when
enquiring into the problems of perception or in discussing the concepts
of seeing, hearing, and smelling, we are <em>not</em> tackling the
questions of opticians, neuro-physiologists or psychologists. We
are rather after accounts of how certain words work, “namely
words like ‘see’, ‘look’,
‘overlook’, ‘blind’, ‘visualise’,
and lots of other affiliated expressions” (1953, 317).</p>

<p>

A philosopher of Ryle's ilk is interested in the informal
logic of the employment of expressions; the nature of the logical force
that expressions have as components of theories and as pivots of
concrete arguments. That is why, he says, in our discussions we
argue <em>with</em> expressions and <em>about</em> those expressions in
one and the same breath. We are trying to register what we are
exhibiting; to codify the very logical codes which we are then and
there observing (1953, 318).</p>

<p>

Often the appeal to what we do and do not say, or can or cannot say
is resisted, Ryle says, by those who hold that philosophical disputes
can be settled by formalising the warring theses, or translating them
out of the natural language in which they were originally constructed into
the notation, perhaps, of a <em>Principia Mathematica</em>.
As we should expect from a philosopher who sees his job as the plotting
of the logical force of expressions as they appear in different
contexts, Ryle describes as a “formaliser's dream”
the conviction that the investigation can be regularised in such a way
as to replace what was philosophically puzzling by logical problems
amenable to known and teachable procedures of calculation.
Indeed, he denies not only that the logic of everyday statements but
even the logic of the statements of scientists, lawyers, historians and
bridge-players can in principle be adequately represented by the
formulae of formal logic.</p>

<p>

Of course, he concedes, the logical behaviour of the terms of
non-notational discourse may be assisted by studies in formal logic; so
may chess-playing assist generals. But waging a campaign can no
more be replaced by playing games of chess than the study of the
logical behaviour of the terms of non-notational discourse can be
replaced by doing formal logic. Thus in the slogan ‘Back to
ordinary language’, ‘ordinary’ may be contrasted with
‘notional’. The slogan can then be used by those who
have awoken from the formaliser's dream. So used, he says,
it should be repudiated only by those who hope to replace
philosophising by reckoning (1953, 316-7).</p>

<h2><a name="OffDocConOff">6. The Official Doctrine and its contemporary offshoots</a></h2>

<p>

Ryle's writings on the question of what constitutes a
philosophical problem, and of the way to solve it, occupied him in the
1920s and 30s. <em>The Concept of Mind</em> was written after
this “long spell of methodological talk”: what was needed
was “an example of the method really working” (1970,
12). Although entitled <em>The Concept of Mind</em>, the book,
Ryle tells us, is</p>

<blockquote>

an examination of multifarious specific mental concepts, such as
those of <em>knowing, learning, discovering, imagining, pretending,
hoping, wanting, feeling depressed, feeling a pain, resolving, doing
voluntarily, doing deliberately, perceiving, remembering</em> and so
on. (1962b, 188)</blockquote>

<p>

As the analogy of philosophy with cartography suggests, Ryle
investigates the workings not just of one concept by itself, but
“all of the threads of a spider's web of inter-working
concepts” (1962b, 189).</p>

<p>

The book focuses on the “type-errors” or
“category mistakes” which philosophers of mind are prone to
make when they consider the logical form of “mental conduct
verbs”, especially if they use as their starting-point the
“Janus-faced account of human life” suggested by a
Cartesian conception of the mind.</p>

<p>

Ryle's explicit target in <em>The Concept of Mind</em> is what
he calls the “Official Doctrine”, which results, he tells
us, at least in part from Descartes' appreciation that Galilean
methods of scientific discovery were fit to provide mechanical
explanations for every occupant of space, together with
Descartes' conviction that the mental could not simply be a more
complex variety of the mechanical. This “two-world”,
Cartesian view has distinctive ontological, epistemological, and
semantic commitments that each lead to particular philosophical
puzzles.</p>

<h3><a name="OntCom">6.1 The ontological commitment</a></h3>

<p>

The ontological commitment of the view is that there are two
different kinds of things, body and mind, that are somehow harnessed
together. The one exists in space and is subject to mechanical or
physical laws; the other is not in space and is not subject to these
laws. And yet the mind and body influence each other. The
view that mind and body are somehow fundamentally different or
distinct, but nonetheless interact, leads to the philosophical
conundrum known as <em>the mind-body problem</em>. For
contemporary philosophers of mind, the mind-body problem no longer
involves construing the mind as an independent substance. But
working out the relation between mental and physical
<em>properties</em> remains an urgent project (Kim, 2).
 <sup>[<a href="notes.html#ref-4" id="note-4">4</a>]</sup>
</p>

<p>

In contemporary philosophy of mind, Ryle is credited with having
established an important connection between mental predicates and
behaviour; but many of his successors (Place, Armstrong, Putnam, and
Fodor) thought he misconstrued the nature of that
connection. When strict physicalist positions were beset by
objections from the multiple realisability of mental predicates,
“token-physicalist” versions of functionalism (or
“ontic-neutral” versions of the causal theory of mind)
stepped up to the plate, and advertised that, in acknowledging
behavioural outputs as well as stimulus conditions, they were retaining
what was right about Ryle's emphasis on behaviour (in the
circumstances), but rejecting what they considered the
“explanatory vacuity” of conceptual or definitional links
between mental predicates and behavioural ones. These were
replaced with causal links between the alleged referents of the mental
terms and the action to be explained.</p>

<p>

But to suppose the explanatory power of mental conduct terms depends
on their designating an event or state that is causally related to the
performance is to accept another version of the
“paramechanical” hypothesis, even though it is now couched
in ontic-neutral or physicalist
 terms.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#ref-5" id="note-5">5</a>]</sup></p>

<p>

Although Ryle's own target is the attempt to staple an elusive
mental event construed as a conscious “experience” onto a
respectable biological (muscular, neurophysiological) causal chain, it
is nevertheless clear that the problems he sees will also apply to
modern-day variations on the dualist theme. That is, it will also
apply to weak, non-reductive identity theories that wish to preserve a
causal role for mental properties. For consider:</p>

<blockquote>

The episodes supposed to constitute the careers of mind have one
sort of existence, while those constituting the careers of bodies have
another sort; and no bridge-status is involved…Minds, as the
whole legend describes them, are what must exist if there is to be a
causal explanation of the intelligent behaviour of human bodies; and
minds, as the theory describes them, live on a floor of existence
defined as being outside the causal system to which bodies belong.
(1949a, 65)</blockquote>

<p>

It would be difficult to find a better anticipation of the mind-body problem as we know it today. The problem of mental causation may not be
exactly the same as Descartes' problem, but it is nonetheless
inherited by anyone who insists that mental properties must, on the one
hand, make a causal difference and by those who, on the other, think
that physics is a closed causal system. Just as mind-body
interaction was a problem for substance dualism, so is mental causation
<em>still</em> the problem facing the many varieties of (both reductive
and non-reductive) physicalism (Kim, 29-30).</p>

<p>

It seems then that the two ontological aspects of the Official
Doctrine—finding a place for the mental in the physical world and
the problem of mental causation—still survive today.</p>

<h3><a name="EpiSemCom">6.2 The epistemological and semantic commitments</a></h3>

<p>

The ontological commitments of the Official Doctrine lead to the
mind-body problem; the epistemological commitments of the Official
Doctrine lead to the problem of other minds. According to the
traditional view, bodily processes are external and can be witnessed by
observers, but mental processes are private, “internal” as
it is metaphorically described (since mental processes are not supposed
to be locatable anywhere). Mental processes or events are
supposed, on the official view, to be played out in a private theatre;
such events are known directly by the person who has them either
through the faculty of introspection or the
“phosphorescence” of consciousness. The subject of
the mental states is, on this view, incorrigible—her avowals of
her own mental states cannot be corrected by others—and she is
infallible—she cannot be wrong about which states she is
 in.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#ref-6" id="note-6">6</a>]</sup>
Others
can know them only indirectly through “complex and frail
inferences” from what the body does.</p>

<p>

But if all that is mental is to be understood in this way, it is
unclear how we are justified in believing that others have the
requisite episodes or mental accompaniments. It would be
possible, on this view, for others to act as if they are minded, but
for them to have none of the right “conscious experiences”
accompanying their actions for them to qualify as such. Perhaps
we are in much the same position as Descartes who thought it made sense
to wonder whether such creatures are automata instead.</p>

<p>

The problem of other minds is compounded by even more serious
difficulties given certain assumptions about the way language
works. Proponents of the Official Doctrine are committed to the
view that mental discourse serves to designate items that carry the
metaphysical and epistemological load of that doctrine.</p>

<blockquote>

The verbs, nouns and adjectives, with which in ordinary life we
describe the wits, characters and higher-grade performances of the
people with whom we have do, are required to be construed as signifying
special episodes in their secret histories, or else as signifying
tendencies for such episodes to occur. (1949a, 16-17)</blockquote>

<p>

Ryle's criticism of the Official Doctrine begins by pointing
out an absurdity in its semantic consequences. If mental conduct
verbs pick out “occult” causes then we would not be able to
apply those verbs as we do; so something must be wrong with a theory of
mental phenomena that renders so inadequate our everyday use of these
verbs. For, according to the Official Doctrine</p>

<blockquote>

when someone is described as knowing, believing or guessing
something, as hoping, dreading, intending or shirking something, as
designing this or being amused at that, these verbs are supposed to
denote the occurrence of specific modifications in his (to us) occult
stream of consciousness. (1945, 17)</blockquote>

<p>

Ryle's criticism of the view is that if it were correct, only
privileged access to this stream of consciousness could provide
authentic testimony that these mental-conduct verbs were correctly or
incorrectly applied. “The onlooker, be he teacher, critic,
biographer or friend, can never assure himself that his comments have
any vestige of truth.” And yet,</p>

<blockquote>

it was just because we do in fact all know how to make such
comments, make them with general correctness and correct them when they
turn out to be confused or mistaken, that philosophers found it
necessary to construct their theories of the nature and place of
minds. Finding mental-conduct concepts being regularly and
effectively used, they properly sought to fix their logical
geography. But the account officially recommended would entail
that there could be no regular or effective use of these mental-conduct
concepts in our descriptions of, and prescriptions for, other
people's minds. (1949a, 17)</blockquote>

<p>

Ryle is often given credit for having shown some of the many
difficulties in substance or Cartesian dualism. But the arguments
in <em>The Concept of Mind</em> warn of difficulties for any account
that takes mental conduct terms to discharge their explanatory role by signifying inner processes: whether irreducibly mental or at bottom physical. Ryle's target
was not merely the ghostliness of the mental processes hypothesized by
the Cartesian; it was their essential hidden-ness. The thrust of
Ryle's polemic is that theories about the nature of the alleged
referents of the mental concepts we employ in our ordinary everyday
commonsense practices cannot make a mystery of this employment without
threatening to rob the theories of their subject
matter. Our practice of employing such mental
concepts would be a complete mystery on a view that takes the
“truth-makers” of our mental statements to be not only
items within an occult (to others) stream of consciousness, but also on
a view that takes them to be items within an occult (to most of us)
series of computations or neurological events. Both picture the
truth-makers of our claims about other minds or our ascriptions of
mental predicates as hidden and thus in practice (if not in principle)
as inaccessible.</p>

<h2><a name="IntLeg">7. The Intellectualist Legend</a></h2>

<p>

To highlight the general difficulties with Cartesianism is only part
of Ryle's destructive strategy. The other part is to show
how logical absurdities arise with one particular offshoot of the
Official Doctrine: one he dubs “the intellectualist
legend”. This involves the type-error or category mistake
of supposing that what distinguishes certain performances from others
that are perceptually similar (in one sense of
‘perceptual’) is the addition of some non-perceptual
feature. The Official Doctrine construes this feature as a
special mental
 accompaniment.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#ref-7" id="note-7">7</a>]</sup>
The intellectualist legend, accepting
this construal of the Official Doctrine, says that intelligent or
rational behaviour can be accommodated or explained by some sort of
theoretical operations involving these hidden accompaniments. But
if this is a mistake, it is a big one; for it is made not only
throughout various sub-branches of philosophy but also in collaborating
disciplines. (The idea, for example, that intelligence involves
physically realised, (non-introspectible) theoretical (computational)
operations is one of the founding blocks of the cognitive
sciences.) </p>

<p>

This picture of how rational abilities in general are to be
explained, including the ability to speak a language, was called into
question by Ryle in a number of early papers (especially in 1946a,
ostensibly reworked as the second chapter of 1949a, and in 1946b and
1950). It was also called into question by Wittgenstein in his
discussion of rules (Wittgenstein, §§143-155 and
179-202).</p>

<p>

In broad brush-strokes, Ryle's argument-strategy against the
supposition that generally intelligent or rational abilities can be
explained in terms of prior theoretical operations (involving the
apprehension of the relevant truths) is to exhibit how the supposition
leads to logically vicious regresses. Intelligent behaviours
cannot be explained, in general, by assuming that theoretical
operations have gone on behind the scene, since those operations
themselves can be intelligent or non-intelligent. The supposition
that intelligent behaviour always requires prior (or even
contemporaneous) theoretical operations launches a vicious regress of
theoretical operations. Thus, it must be allowed that some
intelligent behaviour is not the outcome of prior theoretical
operations.</p>

<p>

The role of the rules, standards, or norms that govern our practices
should neither be exaggerated nor underestimated. For Ryle
(as for Wittgenstein), rules are codifications or distillations of
normative practices that are already up and running. As Ryle
aptly quips,</p>

<blockquote>

[t]here were reasoners before Aristotle and strategists before
Clausewitz. The application of rules of reasoning and strategy
did not have to await the work of their codifiers. Aristotle and
Clausewitz were, in fact, only able to extract these rules, because
they were already being applied. (1946b, 233)</blockquote>

<p>

The crystallisation of performance-rules in rule-formulae is, in
some cases, a product of studies in the methodology of the practices in
which they have already been applied and not the condition of their
being applied. In other words: there must be a way of applying a
rule that does not require the prior consultation of an expression of
that rule.</p>

<p>

Close attention to the cases in which we credit someone for her
performance shows that it is often enough for her (merely) to have
satisfied certain criteria or for her performance to have lived up to
the relevant standard. Close attention to the cases in which we
require not only that she satisfy certain criteria but also that she
apply the criteria by using an expression of a rule to guide her shows
that the latter is in fact a separate skill, which we only sometimes
(but importantly not always) demand of the one we wish to credit for
her
 performance.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#ref-8" id="note-8">8</a>]</sup></p>

<p>

The ability to apply criteria in order to ensure that one's
performance is successful is like showing a ticket in order to ensure
one's right to travel by rail (1950, 239-40). It would be a
category mistake to imagine that the ticket itself plays a role in the
explanation of the train journey on the same level as the pistons,
levers, and tracks. So, too, would it be a category mistake to imagine
that reasons, for example, play a role in the explanation of action on
(almost) the same level as the internal processes that explain (in a
different sense) the body's motions; or that meanings or
understandings play a role in the explanation of language use on
(almost) the same level as the internal processes that explain (again,
in a different sense) vocalisations. But just this type of
category error seems to be made by those who construe the relevant
mental phenomena, including understanding, as inner causal
 events.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#ref-9" id="note-9">9</a>]</sup></p>

<h2><a name="Beh">8. Behaviourism</a></h2>

<p>

Ryle's view is standardly characterised as a weaker or
“softer” version of this doctrine (Smith and Jones,
144). According to this standard interpretation, Ryle's
view is that statements containing mental terms can be translated,
without loss of meaning, into subjunctive conditionals about what the
individual will do in various circumstances. So Ryle (on this
account) is to be construed as offering a dispositional analysis of
mental statements into behavioural ones. It is conceded that Ryle
does not confine his descriptions of what the agent will do (under the
circumstances) to purely physical behaviour—in terms, say, of
skeletal or muscular descriptions—but is happy to speak of
full-bodied actions like scoring a goal or paying a
 debt.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#ref-10" id="note-10">10</a>]</sup>
But the
“soft” behaviourism attributed to Ryle still attempts an
analysis (or translation) of mental statements into a series of
dispositional statements which are themselves construed as subjunctive
conditionals describing what the agent will do (albeit under the
relevant action description) under various circumstances. Even
this “soft” behaviourism is bound to fail, however, since
mentalistic vocabulary is not analysable or translatable into
behavioural statements even <em>if</em> these are allowed to include
descriptions of actions. For the list of conditions and possible
behaviour will be infinite since any one proffered translation can be
defeated by slight alteration of the circumstances; and the defeating
conditions in any particular case may involve a reference to facts
about the agent's mind, thereby rendering the analysis
circular. In sum, the standard interpretation of Ryle construes
him as offering a somewhat weakened form of reductive behaviourism
whose reductivist ambitions, however weakened, are nonetheless
futile.</p>

<p>

But this characterisation of Ryle's programme is simply
wrong. Although it is true that Ryle was keen to point out the
dispositional nature of many mental concepts, it would be wrong to
construe him as offering a programme of analysis of mental predicates
into a series of subjunctive conditionals. The relationship
between mental predicates and the “hypothetical” and
“semi-hypothetical” sentences with which we can
“unpack” them is other than that required by this kind of
analysis.</p>

<p>

It will be helpful to keep in mind that Ryle's target is the
Official Doctrine with its attendant ontological, epistemological, and
semantic commitments. His arguments serve to remind us that we
have in a large number of cases ways of telling or settling disputes,
for example, about someone's character or intellect. If you
dispute my characterisation of someone as believing or wanting
something, I will point to what he says and does in defending my
particular attribution (as well as to features of the
circumstances). But our practice of giving reasons of this kind
to defend or to challenge ascriptions of mental predicates would be put
under substantial pressure if the Official Doctrine were correct.</p>

<p>

For Ryle to remind us that we do, as a matter of fact, have a way of
settling disputes about whether someone is vain or whether she is in
pain is much weaker than saying that a concept is meaningless unless it
is verifiable; or even that the successful application of mental
predicates requires that we have a way of settling disputes in all
cases. Showing that a concept is one for which, in a large number
of cases, we have agreement-reaching procedures (even if these do not
always guarantee success) captures an important point, however: it
counts against any theory, say, of vanity or pain that would render it
unknowable in principle <em>or in practice</em> whether or not the
concept is correctly applied in every case. And this was
precisely the problem with the Official Doctrine (and is still a
problem, as I suggested earlier, with some of its contemporary
progeny).</p>

<p>

Ryle points out in a later essay that there is a form of dilemma
that pits the <em>reductionist</em> against the
 <em>duplicationist</em><sup>[<a href="notes.html#ref-11" id="note-11">11</a>]</sup>:
those whose battle cry is “Nothing
but…” and those who insist on “Something else as
Well…”. Ryle attempts a dissolution of these types
of dilemma by rejecting the two horns; not by taking sides with either
one, though part of what dissolution requires in this case, as in
others, is a description of how both sides are to be commended for
seeing what the other side does not, and criticised for failing to see
what the other side does.</p>

<p>

The attraction of behaviourism, he reminds us, is simply that it
does not insist on occult happenings as the basis upon which all mental
terms are given meaning, and points to the perfectly observable
criteria that are by and large employed when we are called upon to
defend or correct our employment of these mental terms. The
problem with behaviourism is that it has a too-narrow view both of what
counts as behaviour and of what counts as observable. The
attraction of Cartesianism is that it recognizes in a way the
behaviourist does not that there may be crucial differences between
creatures who—on a certain restrictive notion of
behaviour—do indeed behave identically. The problem with
Cartesianism is that it attempts to account for these differences by
hypothesizing the existence of occult or hidden causes.</p>

<p>

In an attempt to defeat the Cartesian or Platonist and remind us
that mental predicates have perfectly ordinary standards of
application, Ryle focuses on what is observable. It is part of
his war against what is not only occult (and observable only through
introspection) but also against what is hidden from the viewpoint of a
third-party observer. But, in focussing on what is
observable, he does not commit himself to reducing what is observable
itself to sequences of “muscular behaviour”. Those
who attribute to Ryle a “soft” behaviourism are at least
correct that the reminders he issues to ward off Cartesianism include
frank appeal to what he later will describe as actions much higher up
on the “sophistication ladder” like paying a bill, or
scoring a goal, as well as to what he will later call
“concrete”, “<em>per se”</em>, or
“infra” doings like scribbling numbers on a cheque book or
kicking a ball between two posts.</p>

<p>

Surely, as his earlier critics pointed out (and as those who see him
as a behaviourist ignore) some of the phenomena he allows will
reintroduce a realm of private occurrences (dreams and imaginings will
be the paradigm case). But as Ayer suspects, this sort of
“ghost” is an honest ghost. Not simply (as Ayer
suggests) because the phenomena do not command the stage of a private
theatre: in the sense that no one else can tell us about them they are
in that respect
 private.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#ref-12" id="note-12">12</a>]</sup>
As Ryle himself admits, “the
technical trick of conducting our thinking in auditory word-images,
instead of spoken words, does indeed secure secrecy for our
thinking…” (1949a, 35).</p>

<p>

It is an “honest ghost” since privacy or secrecy of
certain episodes will not lead to privacy for them all; and thus the
epistemological concomitant to the Official Doctrine that would lead to
the problem of other minds is not a threat. Nor does this sort of
privacy usher in the semantic consequences of the Official
Doctrine. The privacy attending our dreams and imaginings does
not impugn our right to draw on observable (in the robust sense of the
term) phenomena to defend our right to employ mental predicates for a
large number of cases, for “this secrecy is not the secrecy
ascribed to the postulated episodes of the ghostly shadow-world”
(1949a, 35).</p>

<p>

There will indeed be cases in which only the agent can say whether
she is pondering, imagining, dreaming, letting her mind wander,
calculating, solving, planning, or rehearsing. But the sort of
privacy in which only she can say whether she was doing any of these or
other particular things is not the sort of privacy that gives rise to
philosophical conundrums like the problem of other minds and the
problem of necessarily private languages. On the contrary, the
ability to describe one's dreams (as well as one's
sensations) <em>presupposes</em> a language whose terms have
established and public criteria for their correct use.</p>

<h2><a name="Dis">9. Dispositions</a></h2>

<p>

A constant irritant for Ryle, throughout his writings, is “the
preposterous assumption that every true or false statement either
asserts or denies that a mentioned object or set of objects possesses a
specified attribute” (1949a,
 115).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#ref-13" id="note-13">13</a>]</sup>
As an
example of a kind of sentence whose primary job is other than
fact-stating, consider laws. Although we speak of law-sentences
as true or false, “they do not state truths or falsehoods of the
same type as those asserted by the statements of fact to which they
apply or are supposed to apply” (1949a, 116-7). The way to
bring out the difference is to note that part of the point of trying to
establish laws is to find out how to infer from particular matters of
fact to other particular matters of fact, how to explain particular
matters of fact by reference to other matters of fact, and how to bring
about or prevent particular states of affairs.</p>

<p>

A law, Ryle tells us, is “an inference ticket (a season
ticket) which licenses its possessors… to move from one
assertion to another, to provide explanations of given facts, and to
bring about desired states of affairs by manipulating what is found
existing or happening” (1949a, 117).</p>

<p>

A dispositional sentence such as ‘Jones believes the earth is
round’ is unlike a law-sentence insofar as it mentions an
individual, Jones. But it is like a law-sentence insofar as its
role is not (or not primarily) one of describing or reporting, or
stating that some object has such-and-such an attribute or stands in
such-and-such a relation with another object. Its
“truth-maker”, to use a contemporary expression, has to be
understood in terms of what would satisfy it as opposed to what it
purportedly
 describes.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#ref-14" id="note-14">14</a>]</sup>
What would satisfy a law is not specified or mentioned in the
law-sentence; similarly, what would satisfy a disposition is not
specified or mentioned in the disposition-sentence. Nor could it
be. What would satisfy ‘Jones believes the earth is round’
is an open-ended (infinite) list of inferrings, imaginings, saying,
and doings (etc.) on the part of Jones (1949a, 44). (And note again, a
propos of behaviourism, that if ‘imagining’ is construed
in one of its ordinary senses, as something someone may be doing just
by sitting, unmoving, with his hand on his chin, there is explicit
reference to an irreducible-to-behaviour mental occurrence in this
specification of what would satisfy the sentence as well as the
explicit denial of the finiteness of the long list that would unpack
the sentence by alluding to its satisfaction conditions.)</p>

<p>

Ryle suggests that ‘John knows French’ is a warrant
which gives us the right to infer that John understands what he reads
in <em>Le Monde</em> or that he is communicating successfully when
telephoning in French<em>.</em> Immediately on specifying what we
are entitled to do with the inference ticket ‘John knows
French’, Ryle admits that the examples of what would satisfy the
sentence are too precise, for</p>

<blockquote>

[w]e should not withdraw our statement that he knows French on
finding that he did not respond pertinently when asleep, absentminded,
drunk, or in a panic; or on finding that he did not correctly translate
highly technical treatises. We expect no more than that he will
ordinarily cope pretty well with the majority of ordinary French-using
and French-following tasks. ‘Knows French’ is a vague
expression and, for most purposes, none the less useful for being
vague. (1949a, 119)</blockquote>

<p>

To adopt a couple contemporary turns of phrases, the warrants or
inference tickets provided are therefore <em>pro tanto</em> and
<em>occasion-sensitive</em>. The latter is yet another feature of
Ryle's view that puts him at a safe distance from ideals of
analytical behaviourism.</p>

<p>

Ryle concedes that what he says about dispositions is likely to be
contested by the
“addicts of
the superstition that all
true indicative sentences either describe existents or report
occurrences” (1949a, 119). How could the statement
‘This wire conducts electricity’ be true unless there were
something now going on, albeit unfortunately behind the scenes?
But consider Ryle's argument against this. Even those who
are attracted by this picture will have to admit that we often do know
that a wire conducts electricity, that an individual knows French, that
a person is proud, that a sugar cube is soluble, without having
discovered anything in the appropriate sense “hidden”
(read: accessible via introspection or laboratory experiment). In
any case what would be the point or the theoretical utility of
discovering what is hidden? Ryle suggests the utility would
consist only in its entitling us to do just that predicting,
explaining, and modifying which we already do and often know that we
are entitled to do. Even if these postulated processes were
conceded, they themselves are hypotheses or inferences (to the
“best explanation”): things the existence of which are
inferred from the fact that we can predict, explain, and modify the
observable actions and reactions of individuals. So if a theorist
demands actual “rails” to ground ordinary inferences, this
theorist will have to provide some further “rails” to
justify his own peculiar inference (to the best explanation) from the
legitimacy of ordinary inferences to the purported “rails”
that he supposes to ground them. “The postulation of such
an endless hierarchy of ‘rails’ could hardly be attractive
even to those who are attracted by its first step” (1949a,
120).</p>

<h2><a name="SelKno">10. Self-knowledge</a></h2>

<p>

The editors of a recent volume on self-knowledge write:</p>

<blockquote>

Each of us effortlessly knows an enormous amount about those of our
attributes which go with our rationality, sentience, and affective
susceptibilities: our beliefs, hopes, desires, and fears, whether we
have a headache or an itchy toe, whether we are elated or depressed,
whom we love and hate, what attracts or repels us. (Wright, et.
al., 1)</blockquote>

<p>

Whereas knowledge of others' sensations, emotions, and
intentional states demands reliance on independently articulatable
grounds, self-knowledge is, by contrast, characteristically
immediate. This immediacy is already enough to be philosophically
perplexing, but not only do we know <em>differently</em> from others
what we think, hope, and feel, we are also, in normal circumstances,
regarded as knowing <em>best</em>. Furthermore, if we do enjoy
certain mental attributes, we are expected to know that we do: our
mental states are salient to us. According to the editors,
“[t]hese three features of the epistemology of
self-knowledge—<em>immediacy</em>, <em>authority</em>, and
<em>salience</em>— combine to set a certain explanatory
problem…”.</p>

<p>

To what extent does this explanatory puzzle arise because of a tacit
allegiance to Cartesianism? We have already seen how the
epistemological consequences of the Official Doctrine lead to the
problem of other minds. The other side of the Cartesian coin
seems to put us in an especially privileged position with respect to
our own minds. For, if ascribing mental predicates to others is
problematic, according to the Official Doctrine, ascribing them to
ourselves is problem-free. Immediacy, authority, and salience are
features of the epistemology of self-knowledge that the Cartesian view
is best-placed to accommodate.</p>

<p>

Ryle would see this contemporary expression of the problem of
self-knowledge as a result of the conflation of various suspect
philosophical tendencies. One of these has its roots in the
epistemological strand of the Official Doctrine; another is the
tendency of philosophers to underestimate the many-layered complexity
of mental discourse. This includes the refusal to acknowledge
that the same sentence may have different “elasticities” or
kinds of jobs, as well as the tendency to favour sentence-jobs of
informing, describing or reporting over those, for example, of
explaining, exhorting, encouraging, or admonishing.</p>

<p>

For if self-knowledge is to be construed as a sort of perception of
inner states or events that are (by the special faculty of
introspection or by the “refulgence” of consciousness)
“visible” to me but not to others, then Cartesianism,
though seeming to leave knowledge of our own minds intact, instead
presents an untenable picture of what this “knowledge” can
be. Sorting out this confusion puts what can genuinely be
called self-knowledge on relative parity with other-knowledge. It
will also leave room for the importance of “unstudied
talk”, “ego-pronouncements”, or
“avowals”, which do enjoy protection from epistemic
criticism. But once the nature of this protection is understood,
philosophical perplexity should be extinguished, not kindled.</p>

<p>

Ryle accepts the sort of privacy or secrecy that attends our dreams,
imaginings and silent soliloquies and he concedes that besides the
dispositional one there is another sense of ‘know’ which
has to do with what a person is presently thinking, feeling or doing.
He does not deny the existence of mental processes of this kind
(again, a reason to resist calling him a ‘behaviourist’);
nor does he deny that I am the only one in position to say what, for
example, my musings, ponderings, or dreams are about. Nor does
Ryle deny that usually when we witness something, or feel something, or
act in such-and-such a way we are able, when asked, to give a correct
account of it. He denies, rather, that either the
“luminous” or “refulgent” view of consciousness
or one that buys into the intellectualist legend is required to
accommodate this ability. He acknowledges that the concept of
visualizing, imagining, or “seeing” in the mind's
eye, and “hearing” in the mind's ear are useful
concepts. He denies that these uses commit us to the existence of
pictures or images that we contemplate or tunes that we hear: rather
than construe someone who pictures his nursery as the spectator of a
resemblance of his nursery, he should be construed as resembling a
spectator in his nursery (1949a, 234).</p>

<p>

Ryle's discussion of avowals introduces, in effect, a
different elasticity in our use of ‘know’, when we say, for
example, that usually a person knows what she is on about. This
has to do with her propensity to avow moods, feelings, inclinations,
intentions, desires, and so forth. One striking feature of
avowals is that they seem to enjoy a special kind of security from
epistemic assessment or criticism. “How do you know?”
or “I think you must be mistaken” or “You have been
careless in your observations” do not make sense as rejoinders to
avowals. For Ryle,</p>

<blockquote>

[i]f the avowal [“I feel depressed”] is to do its job,
it must be said in a depressed tone of voice; it must be blurted out to
a sympathizer, not reported to an investigator. Avowing “I
feel depressed” is doing one of the things, namely one of the
conversational things, that depression is the mood to do. It is
not a piece of scientific premises-finding, but a piece of
conversational moping. (1949a, 99)</blockquote>

<p>

Ryle warns against construing the fact that avowals are unassailable
as indicating that there is special kind of knowledge in play.
From the fact that these utterances are protected from epistemic
assessment or criticism it does not follow that we have a special kind
of knowledge about them; any more, says Ryle, than it follows from the
fact that someone is not a quack doctor that he is a good doctor: for
he may not be a doctor at all (1993b, 216). For with the idea of
knowledge comes the idea of truth, of justification, of representation,
of description, of taking closer looks, etc.</p>

<p>

The standards for assessing “ego-pronouncements” run
along lines of sincerity/insincerity where these in turn are cashed out
in terms of lying, feigning (for fun), acting (in a play), putting on
(for sympathy), etc. When lying, feigning, etc., are ruled out,
then someone's saying so may be on some particular occasion what
justifies us in accepting or what gives us a reason to accept what he
says. The question of his being wrong (as measured against some
additional standard) may not arise. If he is not wrong in saying
that he is in pain (because he can only be lying or insincere in the
ways that we are imagining have been ruled out) it does not follow that
he has a special kind of knowledge. Rather, it would be more
appropriate to say that questions of knowledge are here out of
place. The discussion of avowals, then, illustrates yet
another elasticity or sentence-job for certain mental
expressions. None of this is to deny that “I am in
pain”, for example, may have a use which, on some occasion,
counts as a description. Indeed, it may be both a description and
a complaint (1993a<em>,</em> 214).</p>

<p>

Many contemporary discussions in philosophy of mind and
self-knowledge, accepting a modern variant of the assumptions of
Cartesianism, are committed to the view that in using mental
predicates, we (or the subject) attribute(s) to the subject a mental
state or condition of which her subsequent behaviour is a causal,
contingent manifestation. But once the assumption is made that
mental verbs function to pick out such underlying states or properties, then
seemingly incompatible demands are placed upon these states and the
traditional philosophical problem of self-knowledge is revealed.
Construed as speaking from and expressing an occurrent state the
speaker is authoritative; construed as speaking from or referring to a
dispositional state she is not.</p>

<p>

In Ryle's (and in Wittgenstein's) hands, pointing to the
non-descriptive use of an utterance such as “I intend to go to
the store” or “I am bored” is supposed to put to rest
the mystery of the avower's authority (on those occasions when
she <em>is</em> authoritative); it is not supposed to invite the
development of a philosophical account to explain it. It
constitutes a step not only in rebutting the Cartesian's
accommodation of this authority, but also in denying that there is only
one use of the relevant expression—namely, to designate a state,
occurrence, or property—in the first place.</p>

<h2><a name="Thi">11. Thinking</a></h2>

<p>

Ryle's express target in <em>The Concept of Mind</em> was the
Cartesianism of the Official Doctrine, and the ontological,
epistemological and semantic predicament we would be confronted with if the
view were correct. Because of this target, many of his reminders
about how mental expressions are used point to the kinds of
circumstances and performances that would satisfy them: often these
include what others suitably trained have no trouble seeing. But
he was dissatisfied that in this work he left out some of the cardinal
uses of concepts of thinking, in which there may be no performances for
others to witness. Certainly, the concept of thinking applies to
observable performances. But it also applies to the many
thinking-activities we may imagine of Rodin's <em>Le Penseur</em>
who is merely sitting on a rock with his chin in his hand.
Ryle's professed long-range objective in much of his later work
was to come to an understanding of the various sorts of thinking
<em>qua</em> pensive without committing either the
“Category-howler of Behaviourism or the Category-howler of
Cartesianism” (1979a, 17).  In these later
articles, he suggests that what is needed besides the choice between
“not muscular, therefore inner” or “not inner,
therefore muscular” is a way of enlarging the domain of the
mental so that it includes not only actions or performances but also
certain omissions or failures to act that are conceived on a relatively
high step of the ladder of sophistication of mental discourse (1979c,
119).</p>

<p>

Like all or at least most philosophically interesting concepts, Ryle
thought there was no general answer to the question ‘What does
thinking consist of?’ (any more that there is a general answer to
the question ‘What does working consist of?’).</p>

<blockquote>

When we start to theorise about thinking, we naturally hanker to
follow the chemist's example, namely, to say what thinking
consists of and how the ingredients of which it consists are
combined…. But modelling thinking on processes like
perspiring, digesting, counting, and apple-picking, which can be broken
down into ingredient processes which have been coordinated in a certain
way is a mistake…. (1951b, 260)</blockquote>

<p>

There is a host of widely different sorts of toiling and idlings,
engaging in any one of which is thinking.</p>

<p>

Ryle rejects the view that thinking is symbol manipulation: indeed,
he denies that words, phrases or sentences are symbols, if symbols are
to be understood as proxies or as representations for something else
(perhaps that which the word is alleged to designate). Thinking,
in the sense of pondering, calculating, and musing, is not reserved for
the labour of trying to decide things. Nor do we reserve the
title ‘thinking’ for inner processes. An architect
can think out his plan while manipulating toy bricks as can a sculptor
plan a statue in marble by modelling a piece of plasticine.
Additional labours might be necessary to put these plans into
words. In general, thinking should not be equated with
using language.</p>

<p>

Our ordinary ways of describing our ponderings and musings tend to
be graphic and not literal. They should be histories, not
chronicles, and as such the plot should be told in abstraction from any
particular stream-of-consciousness reports of detail we may
recall. In only some cases of thinking the accomplishment of a
task, if there is one, involves the thinker's being equipped to
declare his policy, scheme or theory. But there can be thinking
where there is no talking or even the attempt to talk.
Mozart's thinking results in something playable, not statable;
Cezanne may make mistakes but is not in error. A symphony is not
composed in English or German, it has no translation, and there is no
evidence for or against it. Thus, although it is an
important truth that the products of thinking may be publishable truths
or falsehoods (and not unshareable introspectibles), this is true for
only some types of thinking (1979b, 85).</p>

<p>

When the thinking does result in propositions or sayings, however,
the temptation is on the one hand toward excessive inflation, and on
the other toward excessive deflation. For the result is not
merely a string of words linked together in a grammatically well-formed
sentence. In recognising this truth, however, we are tempted toward the view that bits of language are
only necessary as the interpersonal vehicles of objective Meanings that
are thinkable, in principle, to any hearers or readers of any
nationalities.</p>

<blockquote>

These Meanings are for the Duplicationist those significance-cargoes
that are carried indifferently by your French and my English internal
locutions—though the challenge to exhibit to his Reductionist
critic even one such cargo, prised off its French or English vehicle,
is as usual unwelcome to him. (1979b, 87)</blockquote>

<p>

Ryle's solution is to reject the vehicle-cargo
model. In owning a penny, the duplicationist is right in
saying I own more than a mere metallic disc; but the reductionist is
also right in rejecting the idea that I own two things: a mere disc and
a non-metallic, unpocketable yet marketable cargo. The word I
employ is not a noise and something else as well; nor is just a
noise. In learning a word's meaning, I become enabled to
conduct with it a host of <em>inter alia</em> informative, calculative,
recording, anagram-solving, and versifying transactions of quite
specific kinds. Just as a penny is not just a disc and nor is it
a disc and something else as well, so a word is not just noise, but nor
is it a noise and something else as well. The penny is an
institutionally-qualified enabling instrument that I can use for
specific sorts of transactions. The word is a complexly qualified
noise, endowed with a quite specific saying-power, endowed by
institutional regulations, accumulating public custom, pedagogic
disciplines, and so on. The formulation of the qualifications of
both penny and word would “require not just some simple auxiliary
nouns, simple adjectives or simple verbs but a whole batch of
syntactically variegated subordinate clauses” (1979b, 88).</p>

<p>

Even if it is true that <em>Le Penseur</em> is saying things to
himself, this description fails because it stops just where it ought to
begin. ‘Murmuring syllables’ to himself is the
thinnest possible description of what he is engaged in. A thick
description may be that he is trying to find out whether or not the
things that he is saying will lead him where he wants to go:</p>

<blockquote>

…in his pondering, reflecting, deliberating, etc., the
thinker is not guiding himself anywhere, but trying to find out whether
this or that track of his own making would or would not qualify as a
guiding, as opposed to a mis-guiding, or non-guiding, track. (1968,
494)</blockquote>

<p>

Exploring is on a higher-sophistication level than piloting; and
piloting is on a higher sophistication level than following a
pilot's lead. If <em>Le Penseur</em> is trying to find the
proof of a new theorem then he is working on a higher
accomplishment-level than he is in trying to teach his student his
proof when he has got it; just as trying to teach it is on a
higher-sophistication level than that on which his students are working
in trying to master it.</p>

<p>

On its thinnest description, <em>Le Penseur</em> may be muttering to
himself a few geometrical words or phrases, just as on its thinnest
description a penny is a piece of metal. But to say that that is
not <em>all</em> he is doing (or that that is not <em>all</em> the
penny is) is consistent with saying it is the only thing he is doing or
with denying that the penny is a piece of metal and something else as
well.</p>

<blockquote>

A statesman signing his surname to a peace-treaty is doing much more
than inscribe the seven letters of his surname, but he is not doing
many or any more things. He is bringing war to a close by
inscribing the seven letters of his surname. (1968, 496)</blockquote>

<p>

Thinking can be saying things to oneself under a thin
description. Under a thicker description it may be saying things
to oneself with the specific heuristic intention of trying to open
one's eyes or consolidate one's grasp. It is this
specific, experimental intention that is obliterated, Ryle tells us, by
sweeping generic slogans such as “Thought is Language” or
“Thinking is Saying Things to Oneself”, whether or not this
is supplemented by “…and Something Else as
Well.” The adverb ‘experimentally’ adds not an
extra action but the intention-to-find-out-what-happens-when….
Neither the Reductionist nor the Duplicationist (the Behaviourist
or the Cartesian) can account for the adverb
‘experimentally’.</p>

<blockquote>

They had tried to tell us what pondering is, eluding that little
knot of subordinate clauses, such as ‘…in order
to…’, ‘what happens…’, and
‘…when..’ without which the notion of
<em>experimenting</em> cannot be unpacked; no more than burglary,
treaty-signing, or goal-scoring can deliberately be described in simple
adjectives <em>plus</em> simple verbs, whether mundane or
transcendent. What qualifies an undertaking as one of pondering
or, not very differently, as one of discussing, is not any catalogue of
simple qualities and simple relations, whether rude or refined, but
some nexus of statable because statement-shaped conditions. (1979b,
82)</blockquote>

<h2><a name="Sen">12. Sensation</a></h2>

<p>

Ryle was unhappy with the treatment he gave of the concepts of
sensation and perception in <em>The Concept of Mind</em>. In both
the Foreword and the Afterword of the chapter entitled “Sensation
and Observation”, he expresses his dissatisfaction at having
given too much to the opposition by having “fallen in” with
the Official story that perceiving involves having sensations. 
</p>

<p>

In a later paper (1956) Ryle corrects this. The idea that perceiving
involves “having sensations” is called into question with
an investigation of the ordinary concepts of sensation and feeling and
their relation to the technical notions of sense-impression and
sense-data. (Arguably, today’s notion of “perceptual
experiences” – conceptual or non-conceptual—also
figure as a target of Ryle’s arguments.)  In this section, I
shall discuss the negative thesis that perception does not require the
postulation of sensations construed in its ordinary sense and why one
motivation for postulating sense-data or sense-impressions should be
resisted. In the next, I discuss a different motivation and show why
the thickness of perceptual concepts thwarts attempts to discover the
“nature” of perception in physiological, optical,
acoustic, etc. phenomena. </p>

<p>

Both philosophers and physiologists “pass without
apology” from saying that without optical or auditory
sense-impressions there is no seeing or hearing to saying that seeing
and hearing involve the having of sensations. But can the
sense-impressions which are supposedly required for perception be
identified with sensations or feelings in one of their non-technical
senses?</p>

<p>

Ryle suggests not. On one understanding of
“feeling” or “sensation” we include pains,
nausea, tickles, suffocation, and thirst, which are distressing in some
way. (In the <em>Concept of Mind</em> he notes that not all
“agitations” are disagreeable: “People
voluntarily subject themselves to suspense, fatigue, perplexity, fear,
and surprise…”(95).)</p>

<p>

 A different understanding of “feeling” or
“sensation” comes with tactual sensations of external
objects and kinaesthetic sensations (of anatomically internal things
and events). Instances of the latter include the feeling of
warmth, say, as my hand approaches a fire or feeling how cold, rough,
smooth, slippery, or sticky some things are or whether they are
vibrating, stiff, resilient, or loose. </p>

<p>

<em>Pace</em> Berkeley, the difference between these types of states
is not merely a matter of degree: feeling the warmth of a fire is
not like a feeling of pain. Feeling the fire is hotter than it
was before is a matter of perception, discrimination, or finding out a
difference. People can be better at it than others: doctors
acquire the skill of feeling pulses that an untrained person cannot and
race drivers feel a car going into a skid well before an ordinary
motorist can. Feeling pain, giddy, nauseous, or high, by
contrast are not a matter of perception, an acquired skill or that
which training can fine-tune. Mistakes due to carelessness are
ruled out when we talk of sensations <em>qua</em> pain or elation; they
are not ruled out when it comes to perception as discrimination or
detection.</p>

<p>

Armed with these two sets of implication threads (and in this sense,
different <em>understandings of</em>, or things we <em>count</em>
<em>as</em>) sensation or feeling, it can be seen that perception
requires neither of these. Seeing a cat does not require that I
feel anything in the sense of pain, discomfort, tickle, giddiness, or
calm (nor, we can add, relief, amusement, surprise, or rapture). Nor,
however, does seeing a cat or hearing a violin require that I tactually
or kinaesthetically feel with my eye or with my ear that which I also
perceive. Nor does smelling require that I feel, in this sense,
with my nose. And though the tongue is a double-sense organ
insofar as I can tactually and kinaesthetically detect the texture and
the temperature of food in my mouth, as well as taste it, tasting food
does not depend upon my being able to feel these other properties of
the food with my tongue.</p>

<p>

So, Ryle says, when philosophers and psychologists assert that all
perceiving involves the having of sensations or the feeling of
something, either they are wrong or they are using a third, different
understanding of “sensation” or
“feeling”. </p>

<p>

Let us examine this different sense of “feeling” or
“sensation”. It does not seem to derive from ordinary
use, which, we might suggest, would not in itself be a problem, as long
as the implication threads of one understanding are not crossed with
those of another. Consider the epistemologist’s
notion of sense-data or sense-impressions which are posited as
candidates for grounding knowledge or certainty in what is supposedly
given in perception. Suppose this third understanding of
<em>sensation</em> or <em>feeling</em> derives from sense-data or
sense-impressions thus understood. Whatever the merits or
demerits of this view, in order for sensations—now understood as
sense-impressions or sense<em>-</em>data—to play this
foundational role, we must be conscious of them. Curiously
enough, however, we do not report them. Instead, we report what
we see under different descriptions, which carry different
luggage-loads. (Or, as Austin said, we report what we see under
different descriptions which depend, in part, on how far we are willing
to stick our neck out.) Someone who claimed to see something
green might subsequently, when he learns of the presence of a cat,
claim that what he saw was the eyes of a cat. The “luggage”
that Ryle speaks of here includes the logical threads (including
implication and evidence, etc.) that accompany certain descriptions
rather than others. (There are more ways to be wrong, as Austin
says, the more we stick our necks out.) We shall come back to
this in the next section. But now we are investigating a third,
new sense of “sensation” or “feeling” which
derives, not from ordinary use, but from the (alleged) needs of
epistemology. But what supports the idea that we see have such
experiences? </p>

<p>

Not the fact that we report <em>appearances</em>, for, as Ryle
reminds us, we use the locution “it appears that…”
all the time without committing ourselves to having any particular
experiences. “15 x 16 appears to make 220” or “It
looks as if the river is twice the size of the road” commit me to
no special sense-experiences. So, argues Ryle, we cannot adduce
idioms of the patterns “It looks as if…” or
“It appears…” as evidence of the untutored,
uninferential manner in which the postulated sense-impressions are
delivered to consciousness. But this leaves us with a
problem. </p>

<p>

We have, in fact, no special way of reporting the occurrence of
these postulated impressions; we are, therefore, without the needed
marks of our being conscious of such things at all. For there is
surely something absurd in maintaining that we are constantly conscious
of some things in the way in which we are conscious of pains, and yet
have no way of telling ourselves or other people anything whatsoever
about them. (1956, 343)</p>

<p>

This particular theoretical allegiance that drives some
epistemologists to posit sensations understood in the technical sense
of sense-data has as its source the idea that there are two kinds of
space, which we know today, thanks to Sellars, as the space of reason
and the space of natural law. In the first, the notion of
inference, evidence, premises, evidence, and conclusions have their
home; in the other is the raw “data” understood in the
sense of that which is given or accepted without argument. </p>

<p>

The allegiance to this picture has its source in the view that all
thinking intended to result in the discovery or establishment of truths
is inferring. A child sees a word on a page, an adult sees a
misprint, and an illiterate sees a black mark. Each has eyes in
perfect working order. According to this view, the difference
between seeing black marks, a word, or a misprint has to do with the
reasoning we bring to what is perceptually given. And sense-data
(or, we may add, perceptual experience) play the role of what is given
prior to any thinking, and prior therefore to any exploitation of
knowledge or beliefs previously acquired. A datum, as it is used
here, is something that we reason <em>from</em> and does not have to be
reasoned <em>to</em>.</p>

<p>

Ryle dismisses this motivation for introducing sensation thus
understood on the grounds that not all thinking is inferring. 
Multiplying, for example, is thinking but our calculations are not
conclusions and our mistakes are not fallacies. If it is not true
that the thinking that enters into perceptual recognition,
identification, comparison, etc. is inferring then the search for its
fund of premises is the search for nothing. </p>

<p>

But worse, why suppose that seeing the misprint or seeing a crop of
wheat (as opposed to a word, or a planted field) is thinking at
all? It may be discerned in a flash; there may be no moment,
however short, in which one might be described as pondering,
reflecting, or putting two and two together. All the
argument has shown so far is that without a particular training,
recognising a misprint or a crop of wheat would be impossible. 
Why suppose the exploitation of the knowledge resulting from this
training involves thinking <em>qua</em> reflecting, pondering, or
inferring?</p>

<p>

Here the fact that the misprint is immediately obvious to him is
supposed to need to be explained not just by reference to his prior
education, but also by the postulation of the performance by him of a
piece of thinking, with the queer property of not requiring any time
for its performance. (1956, 345)</p>

<p>

According to Ryle, seeing a misprint involves the possession of the
exploitation of knowledge already acquired. But this exploitation
of knowledge required for perceptual recognition, identification, etc.
need not embody any thinking; <em>a fortiori</em>, it need not embody
inferential thinking. “So the argument for the occurrence
of sense-impressions to be the data or premises for the inferential
thinking embodied is doubly broken-backed” (1956, 345).</p>

<h2><a name="Aft">13. Afterword</a></h2>

<p>

This has been a short tour through but a patch of the rich
philosophical landscape that Ryle has charted, concentrating on the
philosophy of language and mind. Left out are a number of themes
and interests of Ryle, for example, his discussion of traditions in
Philosophy from Plato, through the Phenomenological tradition and the
work of Bretano, Husserl, and then Heidegger, through the trenchant
exposition of Wittgenstein's <em>Tractatus</em>, to his criticism
of Carnap, to Collingwood, and Anderson. I have not
commented on his dissolution of philosophical problems he presented in
his Tarner Lectures; nor have I been able to include discussions on
morality, feelings, pleasure, the self, and much more.
Nor is this reading of Ryle a standard one: even many of his students
interpreted him as a behaviourist and irrealist. I hope it is
enough, however, to raise the possibility that his work has been widely
misunderstood, is presently underestimated, and that he has a lot to
contribute to today's debates.</p>
