<h1>Jayarāśi</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Wed Jan 19, 2011; substantive revision Thu Feb 11, 2016</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>

Jayarāśi Bhaṭṭa, who most likely flourished
between 800–840 probably in Southern India, was an Indian philosopher,
a sceptic loosely affiliated to the materialist Cārvāka /
Lokāyata school of thought, the author of one of most
extraordinary philosophical works in India, the
Tattvôpaplava-siṁha (‘The Lion of the Dissolution
of [all] Categories’). His main claim is that it is not possible
to arrive at true knowledge, because one should first properly define
basic criteria of validity for valid cognitive procedures, which is not
possible without a prior true knowledge of reality against which we
could test the procedures for validity etc. Clearly, our knowledge of
reality and of objects depends on valid cognitive procedures. However,
all valid cognitive procedures are either fundamentally flawed and
ultimately unreliable or they require further valid cognitive
procedures, and these stand in the same need etc. Therefore, we can
neither formulate proper definitions of valid cognitive procedures nor
define what reality is and what basic categories are. This is at least
the case, he claims, with all the cognitive tools and epistemological
categories which are now at our disposal.</p>

<h2><a name="LifWorPhiAff">1. Life, Works, and Philosophical Affiliation</a></h2>

<h3><a name="DatJayBha">1.1 The Dating of Jayarāśi Bhaṭṭa</a></h3>

<p>

The first serious attempt to date Jayarāśi
Bhaṭṭa was undertaken by Sukhlāljī
Saṁghavī and Rasiklāl C. Pārīkh, who brought
the Tattvôpaplava-siṁha to light, in their 1940 edition
(p. iv-xi) of the treatise, assign the work to 8th century (p. x). This
dating was slightly modified by Sukhlāljī Saṁghavī
(1941) who placed Jayarāśi's
Tattvôpaplava-siṁha between 725-825, which, in turn, is
accepted by Eli Franco (1987: 12–13). However, the latter, in the
‘Preface to the second edition’ of 1994, modifies the date
of Jayarāśi Bhaṭṭa and assigns him to the period
of 770–830 on the basis of what he thinks are
Jayarāśi's indirect references (primarily
terminological grounds) to the Buddhist philosopher Dharmottara (ca.
740–800).</p>

<p>
In fact, that dating of the Tattvôpaplava-siṁha could be
slightly modified to perhaps 800–840. I would place Jayarāśi
Bhaṭṭa after the Digambara Jaina philosopher Akalaṅka
Bhaṭṭa (c. 720–780) and before Vidyānanda
Pātrakesarisvāmin (c. 850), a philosopher in the same
tradition who commented on Akalaṅka. As Franco (1994: XI) himself
notices, the Buddhist Kamalaśīla (c. 740–795) nowhere refers
to Jayarāśi in his encyclopaedic commentary of the
Tattva-saṅgraha. Further, we find no mention of
Jayarāśi in the oeuvre of Akalaṅka Bhaṭṭa,
although he was very well acquainted with current ideas of his
contemporaries. It would be especially surprising in the case of
Akalaṅka Bhaṭṭa not to mention an author who greatly
influenced the way Jaina thinkers argued and formulated their thoughts,
because both of them seem to belong to South India. On a few occasions
Akalaṅka did have a chance to either allude or even directly
refer to such an original thinker as Jayarāśi certainly was,
but he nowhere does it. A good instance is Akalaṅka's work
Aṣṭa-śatī ‘In Eight Hundred Lines’
(itself a commentary on the work
Āpta-mīmāṁsā, ‘An Examination of An
Authoritative Person’) of Samantabhadra, c. 580–640). In it, (the
commentary on verse 1.3 of Āpta-mīmāṁsā,
AṣŚp.2 = AṣS 29.20), Akalaṅka refers
to a materialist argument: ‘[The opponent]: “For this
reason it has been said that there is no omniscient person, because
truth claims [of various teachers competing for primacy] turn out to be
wrong cognitive criteria, inasmuch as there is no difference between
them (i.e., all are equal in their convincing force). Since one accepts
that [it is not possible to decide for or against a view among a few
competing ones], there is nothing wrong [in rejecting the idea of an
omniscient person].” [Akalaṅka:] Ergo this decision of some
[thinkers, i.e., materialists] is itself void of any rational basis.
For, as we know, the scope of perception [which could prove the
materialist's rejection of an omniscient person] cannot itself
demonstrate that there cannot be any other proof of an omniscient
person, because this would have too far-reaching consequences. Neither
can [the materialist prove that an omniscient person cannot exist] with
the help of inference, because it has no validity [for him]’.
Akalaṅka clearly has in mind a typical materialist philosopher
who rejects the idea of omniscience, but at the same time accepts
perception (pratyakṣa) as the only valid instrument of knowledge,
while rejecting the validity of inference (anumāna). That is a
standard account of a materialist (Cārvāka / Lokāyata)
thinker in India and there is really nothing to suggest that what
Akalaṅka had here in mind as the target of his criticism was a
sceptic (like Jayarāśi) who rejected the ultimate validity
also of perception.</p>

<p>
However, the account changes in what Vidyānanda (c. 850) has to
say on Akalaṅka's passage. Vidyānanda is, to our
knowledge, the first Indian philosopher to know of and to directly
refer to Jayarāśi. In his Aṣṭa-sahasrī
‘In Eight Thousand Lines’, Vidyānanda (AṣS
29.20-36.6) takes the passage ‘“Since one accepts that [it
is not possible to decide for or against a view among a few competing
ones], there is nothing wrong [in rejecting the idea of an omniscient
person].” [Akalaṅka:] Ergo this decision of some [thinkers,
i.e., materialists] is itself void of any rational basis’
(tathêṣṭatvād adoṣa ity ekeṣām
aprāmāṇikaivêṣṭiḥ) as
explicitly implying two kinds of approaches to the same question. First
(AṣS 29.20 ff.), he says some nihilistic thinkers (eke) are the
Laukāyatika (the followers of Lokāyata, the materialist
school), who do not admit any instrument of knowledge which would could
go beyond the perceptible world, i.e., they accept perception as the
only cognitive criterion. Second, Vidyānanda says (AṣS 31.2
ff.), there are also ‘those who propound the dissolution of [all]
categories’ (tattvôpaplava-vādin), a term which
could hardly be more univocal in its clearly referring to
Jayarāśi. Had Akalaṅka known of Jayarāśi, his
scepticism and rejection of the validity of perception also, he would
have included him among those who rejected the idea of an omniscient
being.</p>

<h3><a name="NatPlaJayBha">1.2 Native Place of Jayarāśi Bhaṭṭa</a></h3>

<p>

As little as we know of the exact dates of his life even less we know
about the place where he flourished, and we are actually left to
speculations, for no hard evidence, such as inscriptions etc., can be
found to help us. There are three points that might suggest
Jayarāśi was of South India, all being rather weak. The
strongest evidence is the circulation and reception of the
Tattvôpaplava-siṁha: the first mention of the work is
made by South Indian Digambara authors Vidyānanda (c. 850) and
Anantavīrya (turn of 10th and 11th centuries). Another equally
weak piece of evidence is that Jayarāśi's critical
method of argument (see below), which the Jainas adopt, first
penetrates the works of South Indian Digambara authors, incidentally
the same who are the first to make reference to Jayarāśi.
This method of critique becomes the standard one among Gujarati Jainas
only at a later stage. The third argument in favour of South Indian
origin of Jayarāśi
(Saṁghavī–Pārīkh 1940, xi), even weaker
that the two above, is his title Bhaṭṭa, regularly
appended to the names of a number of South Indian philosophers and
often used as an official title of South Indian Digambara high rank
clerics (bhaṭṭa,
bhaṭṭāraka). Jayarāśi's title might
suggest he was both South Indian and a Brahmin by social class
(varṇa). However, the title Bhaṭṭa is not
exclusively used by Brahmins or exclusively in South India, though
there is indeed a certain tendency of this kind. However, since there
seems nothing at all to suggest that Jayarāśi was born in
North India, even such slight hints gain some evidential weight.</p>

<h3><a name="WorJayBha">1.3 Works of Jayarāśi Bhaṭṭa</a></h3>

<p>

The only preserved work of Jayarāśi is the
Tattvôpaplava-siṁha (‘The Lion of the Dissolution
of [all] Categories’). Its palm leaf manuscript was discovered in
1926 in a manuscript library at Patan by Sukhlāljī
Saṁghavī and Rasiklāl C. Pārīkh, and the text
remained virtually unknown until its publication in 1940.</p>

<p>
The work was quite well known in mediaeval philosophical milieu, both
in the South and North of India, but hardly ever treated in a way a
serious and original philosophical treatise deserves: Indian
philosophers of established traditions do not, as a rule, refer to the
work directly or refute its contents, not to mention any attempt at the
providing a genuine appraisal of the work or entering into discussion
with its author. They simply ignored it.</p>

<p>

Two reasons might be mentioned for such a situation. First, Indian
philosophers did not principally engage in discussions with
representatives of the materialist school, except for standardised
dismissive refutations of a few basic materialist theories, which are
mentioned by Indian philosophers in their works in order to render a
‘complete’ picture of the philosophical spectrum. These
standardised, habitually repeated refutations were not applicable to
Jayarāśi, who was not a typical representative of the
Cārvāka / Lokāyata school. New powerful philosophical
machinery would have to be applied to engage in a discussion with
Jayarāśi. And that is precisely the second reason: the
arguments Jayarāśi consistently applies, his rigid and
coherent lines of argumentation proved to be an extremely hard piece of
cake to swallow for those whose views he criticised. It seems,
therefore, that the general approach of Indian philosophers
vis-à-vis Jayarāśi was that of disregard and failure
to notice the weight of his work. He is occasionally mentioned in a
positive light when Indian authors acknowledge
Jayarāśi's powerful method of critical analysis, and
these are primarily, or even exclusively, Jaina authors. Sometimes they
even refer to Jayarāśi as an expert in some fields, e.g. by
Malliṣeṇa (c. 1229), who says: ‘A refutation of all
cognitive criteria in details should be consulted from the
Tattvôpaplava-siṁha’ (SVM, p.118.1-2).</p>

<p>
The text of Tattvôpaplava-siṁha was preserved without
any commentary and it seems that its was never commented upon. We
cannot say with absolute certainty whether he had any followers or
whether he established an independent school, but that is not unlikely
because we occasionally come across the expression
tattvôpaplava-vādin in the plural: ‘those who
propound the dissolution of [all] categories’ in philosophical
literature, and across the single term Tattvôpaplava used as
if it denoted a separate school.</p>

<p>
It is not certain whether Jayarāśi composed any other work.
He himself refers to a treatise entitled Lakṣaṇa-sāra
(‘The Quintessence of the Definition [of Cognitive Criteria
(pramāṇa)]’) on one occasion, while refuting the usage
of the term ‘non-verbal’ (avyapadeśya) in the
definition of the cognitive criterion (pramāṇa, or
‘veridical instrument of knowledge’) of the Nyāya
school. There, he says that the inapplicability of the term has already
been shown in the Lakṣaṇa-sāra and one should consult
that work. It is highly probable that he indeed refers to his own text
for the simple reason that he generally does not mention any works of
any other authors either in support of his own views or in favourable
light, except for the materialist teacher Bṛhaspati and his
Bṛhaspati-sūtra. Still, it is not impossible that the text
he referred to under the title Lakṣaṇa-sāra might have
been penned by another representative of the Cārvāka /
Lokāyata school who had been held in esteem by Jayarāśi,
e.g. his own guru.</p>

<h3><a name="PhiAffJayBha">1.4 Philosophical Affiliation of Jayarāśi Bhaṭṭa</a></h3>

<p>

There has been some controversy concerning whether
Jayarāśi could at all be ranked among the representatives of
the Indian materialist school, i.e., among the Cārvākas /
Lokāyatas. Until the publication of the
Tattvôpaplava-siṁha, Jayarāśi was considered a
typical representative of the materialist school. It all changed when
the publication of the work in 1940 made the text available to
scholars. The publication revealed that Jayarāśi's view
are far from what one considered materialism and hardly compatible with
what we so far knew about the schools of the Cārvākas /
Lokāyatas.</p>

<p>
Nonetheless, Sukhlāljī Saṁghavī and Rasiklāl
C. Pārīkh (1940: xi-xii) take the text as ‘a work of
the Lokāyata or Cārvāka school, or to be more precise
– of a particular division of that school’, emphasising
that Jayarāśi ‘is developing the doctrine of the
orthodox (!) Lokāyata’. The tradition of ascribing the view
to Saṁghavī and Pārīkh that the
Tattvôpaplava-siṁha is ‘a genuine
Cārvāka work’ relies rather on the misreading of what
both the authors say: they are well aware that Jayarāśi
develops an original and independent school within what he
himself considered a materialist tradition. This view, adopted also by
Ruben (1958), is somewhat modified by Franco (1987: 4–8).</p>

<p>
Another line of researchers disagree that Jayarāśi belonged
to the materialist tradition at all, typical proponents of this opinion
being Debiprasad Chattopadhyaya (1959), (1989) and Karel Werner (1995).
Chattopadhyaya (1989) argues that since Jayarāśi criticises
all philosophical views and schools, he cannot be reckoned as an
adherent of the Cārvāka / Lokāyata tradition, because
one can either be a materialist or sceptic; and clearly
Jayarāśi's philosophical views do not fit into the
typical materialist framework. Karel Werner (1995) seems to support
such an approach, although with some reservations, but without any
solid rational argument, except for an subjective impression.</p>

<p>
There could hardly be a better source of information on the true
affiliation of Jayarāśi than the author himself. He nowhere
states in his work that he is a Cārvāka / Lokāyata, in
which he does not differ from all other Indian authors who nowhere
mention their philosophical affiliations in the form: ‘The author
of the present work is Buddhist’ or ‘I am a follower of the
Nyāya school’. In most cases, such affiliations are
communicated through the opening sections, e.g. in the introductory
verses (maṅgalâcaraṇa), or in the colophons, but
usually an indirect manner, e.g. by paying homage to the Awakened One
(buddha) or to a guru or Mahêśvara, or through some other
hint, but it is hardly ever done directly, in an unequivocal manner.
Unfortunately, the preserved text of Tattvôpaplava-siṁha
does not contain any introductory verses (probably there were none),
and the colophon contains no hints. The only concealed information in
the opening section of the work could be found the first verse that
occurs in the very beginning which says: ‘The worldly path
(laukiko mārgaḥ) should be followed…/ With
respect to everyday practice of the world (loka-vyavahāra), the
fool and the wise are similar’ (TUS, p.1.9–10 = Franco
(1987: 68–6-7)), quoted from some other source, taken as authoritative
by Jayarāśi. The expression ‘the worldly path’
(laukiko mārgaḥ) often occurs as a reference to the
Lokāyata (‘the followers of the worldly [practice]’),
e.g. by Haribhadra in his ŚVS1.64. Most importantly,
however, Jayarāśi on several occasions quotes verses of
Bṛhaspati in order to either support his own opinion or to show
that there is no disagreement between the
Tattvôpaplava-siṁha and the tradition of
Bṛhaspati. Further, he explicitly mentions the materialist
teacher by name and refers to him with reverence ‘Honourable
Bṛhaspati’ (bhagavān bṛhaspatiḥ, TUS,
p.45.10–11 = Franco (1987: 228.10)), the reverential term
occurring only once in the whole work. This is rather unique, for
Jayarāśi does not seem to follow any authorities or to quote
passages and opinions which he unreservedly views in favourable light.
There can hardly be any doubt, that Jayarāśi placed himself
within that tradition and apparently acknowledged that he was
originally trained within it.</p>

<p>

Further, Jayarāśi criticises basically all philosophical
schools with two exceptions: the Advaita Vedānta of
Śaṅkara and the Cārvāka / Lokāyata school.
The reason for being silent on the tradition of Śaṅkara was
that the latter was either contemporaneous or posterior to
Jayarāśi, but there would have been no reason not to
formulate any criticism against the Cārvāka / Lokāyata
school, if that had not been Jayarāśi's own
tradition.</p>

<p>
Jayarāśi is generally very cautious not to express his own
positive views and theories. But there may be an exception, it seems.
On one occasion (in the Buddhist section, TUP, p.57–88 = Franco
(1987: 269–271)), while refuting the view that ‘the first moment
of consciousness [of the newly born], immediately after the exit from
the mother's womb, is preceded by another moment of
consciousness’, he concludes that ‘the first moment of
consciousness in the womb etc. [i.e., of the newly born], must come from
the combination of the elements’, which is a typically
materialist view. It is however not quite clear how far this conclusion
is brought up merely to dismiss the theory of consciousness as a
principle independent of the matter or the theory of the personal
conscious continuum (santāna), and how far the view is
Jayarāśi's own.</p>

<p>
There is also an external evidence corroborating to a certain degree
the thesis about Cārvāka / Lokāyata affiliation of
Jayarāśi. Vidyānanda who first mentions
Jayarāśi brings some interesting details to light (alluded to
above). In his Aṣṭa-śatī (AṣS 29.20-36.7),
he explicitly indicates a category of nihilistic thinkers who reject a
number of vital principles and claim that ‘There is no [reliable]
omniscient authority (tīrtha-kāra), there is no [reliable]
cognitive criterion (pramāṇa), there is no [reliable]
authoritative doctrine (samaya) or [reliable] Vedas, or any kind of
[reliable] reasoning (tarka), because they contradict each
other,’ and he quotes a popular verse: ‘Reasoning is not
established, testimonies differ, there is no sage whose words are a
cognitive criterion (i.e., authoritative), the essence of the moral law
(dharma) is concealed in a secret place (i.e., is not available). The
[proper] path is that taken by the majority of
 people’<sup>[<a href="notes.html#1" name="note-1">1</a>]</sup>.
Whether the verse
comes from an unidentified Lokāyata source, which is not
impossible, or not, it is echoed by Jayarāśi in the above
mentioned verse at the beginning of his work and the expression
‘the worldly path’ (laukiko mārgaḥ).
Interestingly, the verse has an obvious sceptical underpinning. The
category of such ‘nihilists’ includes (1) the followers of
the Lokāyata school (laukāyatika, AṣS 29.26), also
known as the Cārvāka (AṣS 30.25), who are associated
with the view that there is just one cognitive criterion, i.e.
perception, and (2) the category of ‘those who propound the
dissolution of [all] categories’
(tattvôpaplava-vādin, AṣS 31.2). Vidyānanda
(AṣS 31.2 ff.) explains who the latter are: ‘Some who are
those who propound the dissolution of [all] categories take (1) all the
categories of cognitive criteria such as perception etc. and (2) all
the categories of the cognoscibles as dissolved (i.e., not
established)’. Throughout his text, Vidyānanda keeps these
two traditions – the Lokāyata and the Tattvôpaplava
- separate, although he does acknowledge that they are genetically
related, the main difference between them being whether one recognises
at least one cognitive criterion (Cārvāka / Lokāyata) or
none (Jayarāśi).</p>

<p>
Jayarāśi can be therefore taken as a genuine representative
of an offshoot of the Cārvāka / Lokāyata tradition,
primarily because he himself thought he was a follower of
Bṛhaspati's materialist tradition, and probably because he
had originally been trained in the materialist system. It also seems
very likely that the representatives of the Cārvāka /
Lokāyata system occasionally had sceptical inclinations prior to
Jayarāśi, which helped him to abandon typically materialist
claims and undertake his sceptical project. However, neither he nor his
work can be taken as typical representatives of the Cārvāka /
Lokāyata school or a first-hand source of information about that
tradition. Despite this, the work remains the only authentic, albeit
not ‘orthodox’ treatise of the Cārvāka /
Lokāyata tradition that has come down to us.</p>

<h2><a name="MetJay">2. The Method and Philosophy of Jayarāśi</a></h2>

<p>

Jayarāśi can be classified as a sceptic, or even a
methodological sceptic, who consistently avails himself of a particular
method to analyse theories and the contents of propositions.</p>

<h3><a name="UseRedArg">2.1 Use of Reductio Arguments</a></h3>

<p>

The point of departure of his methodology is a sophisticated and
highly elaborated reductio type of argument (prasaṅga), developed
earlier within the Madhyamaka school of Buddhism and its prominent
adherent Nagārjuna (c. 150 CE).</p>

<p>

In his method, Jayarāśi analyses a particular thesis T of
his opponent by, first, listing all logical implications or all
doctrinally possible conclusions C<sub>1</sub>, C<sub>2</sub>,
C<sub>3</sub>, … C<sub><i>n</i></sub>, admissible within the
opponent's system, that follow from thesis T. Then he
demonstrates how and why each of such conclusions C<sub>1</sub>,
C<sub>2</sub>, C<sub>3</sub>, … C<sub><i>n</i></sub> either
leads to an undesired consequence (logically problematic or unwelcome
within the opponent's system) or contradicts the initial thesis
T:</p>

<blockquote>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td valign="top">(1)</td>
<td>T → C<sub>1</sub> ∧ C<sub>2</sub> ∧ C<sub>3</sub> ∧ … ∧
C<sub><i>n</i></sub></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td valign="top">(2)</td>
<td>|C<sub>1</sub>| = 0<br />
 |C<sub>2</sub>| = 0<br />
 |C<sub>3</sub>| = 0<br />
 …<br />
 |C<sub><i>n</i></sub>| = 0</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td valign="top">(3)</td>
<td>|T| = 0</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</blockquote>

<p>

where ‘0’ stands not simply for ‘false’
(logically), but may also stand for ‘not admissible within the
opponent's specific set of beliefs’, or ‘not
compatible with the opponent's specific set of
beliefs’. To analyse the truth value or admissibility of each of
the conclusions C<sub>1</sub>, C<sub>2</sub>, C<sub>3</sub>, …
C<sub><i>n</i></sub>, if their structure is complex,
Jayarāśi analyses the conclusions in their turn using
exactly the same method.</p>

<p>
What may look like a well-known logical law that underlies the reductio
ad absurdum argument, i.e.,</p>

<blockquote>
[(~<i>p</i>→<i>q</i>) ∧ ~<i>q</i>] → <i>p</i>,</blockquote>

<p>

or like other typical laws of the proof by contradiction, i.e.,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
 [(~<i>p</i>→<i>q</i>) ∧ (~<i>p</i>→~<i>q</i>)] → <i>p</i>,
</p>

<p>
[~<i>p</i> → (<i>q</i>∧~<i>q</i>)] → <i>p</i>, or</p>

<p>
[~<i>p</i> → (<i>q</i>≡~<i>q</i>)] → <i>p</i> ,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>

seems at first closely mirrorred by Jayarāśi. However, his
approach is significantly different in one particular aspect. First,
Jayarāśi analyses positive theses in order to disprove them.
Secondly, the reductio or the proof by contradiction, whereby p is
rejected, does not commit one to admitting ~p in the sense of accepting
a positive state of affairs contrary to p. Jayarāśi is
satisfied merely with a rejection of a thesis, without postulating his
own solution to a problem. In other words, when Jayarāśi
disproves thesis T by demonstrating that its conclusions C<sub>1</sub>,
C<sub>2</sub>, C<sub>3</sub>, … C<sub>n</sub> are all wrong
(either false or doctrinally inadmissible), he does not commit himself
to the contrary thesis ~T with some kind of ontological entailment. The
better way to describe his method would be the following patterns:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
[(<i>p</i>→<i>q</i>) ∧ ~<i>q</i>] → ~<i>p</i>,</p>

<p>
[(<i>p</i>→<i>q</i>) ∧ (<i>p</i>→~<i>q</i>)] → ~<i>p</i>,</p>

<p>
[<i>p</i> → (<i>q</i>∧~<i>q</i>)] → ~<i>p</i>, or</p>

<p>
[<i>p</i> → (<i>q</i>≡~<i>q</i>)] → ~<i>p</i> ,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>

To give an example, Jayarāśi first skilfully demonstrates
that the universal cannot exist by mentioning three possible
conclusions: If (T) the universal exists, then (C<sub>1</sub>) the
universal is different from the individuals in which it is
instantiated, (C<sub>2</sub>) it is not different from the individuals,
or (C<sub>3</sub>) it is different from the individuals in some aspects
and it is not different from the individuals in other aspects. Each of
these options is then analysed into further options, all being
eventually shown as wrong or impossible. Since all the three
conclusions C<sub>1</sub>, C<sub>2</sub> and C<sub>3</sub> are
rejected, the initial thesis T (‘the universal exists’) is
also rejected. However, he does not say what at all exists, if there
are no universals.</p>

<p>
In his method, Jayarāśi does not mention all logically
conceivable conclusions entailed by a thesis he wants to disprove. In
most cases, he limits himself just to those implications which are
relevant to the discussion with a particular philosophical school, and
all other logical or thinkable implications of which we know that the
opponent would never admit for a variety of reason are simply
ignored.</p>

<p>
Interestingly, the critical method of analysis of the reductio type
(prasaṅga) which Jayarāśi so amply uses is basically
absent in the works of the Digambara philosopher Akalaṅka,
whereas the method is regularly used by his commentator Vidyānanda
and all subsequent Jaina thinkers, which may have its historical
relevance and suggest that Jayarāśi was posterior to
Akalaṅka.</p>

<p>
The reductionist tactics, which Jayarāśi shared with the
Mādhyamika Buddhists, was traditionally classified by Brahmanic
philosophers, e.g. the Naiyāyikas, as an eristical dispute or
refutation-only debate (vitaṇḍā) and considered as a
non-genuine argument, because the goal of an authentic debate was to
strive for truth, understood of course in positive terms. Were such
criticisms denying Jayarāśi a genuine argumentative value
justified? Clearly not, and for a variety of reasons, the most
important being that the main objective of Jayarāśi is
indicated in the title of his treatise: the dissolution of all
categories. How should we understand it? Was his approach purely
negative, eristical, nihilistic or agnostic? His main objective, it
seems, was not necessarily the strong claim that no truths can ever be
known. Rather his intention was to show the fundamental dependence of
our knowledge of reality on cognitive means and categories we accept
more or less arbitrarily. The dissolution of all categories implies
that the criteria on which all philosophical systems and theories of
the world rest are in need of further evidence, which itself is not
possible without adopting some of these categories or some other
categories which again call for further evidence, but which categories
and methods we chose is ultimately our arbitrary decision. To engage in
what Brahmanic philosophers would call a ‘genuine debate’
(vāda) one would necessarily have to accept that such an arbitrary
decision is ultimate and justified, thus giving up the further search
for truth, even though the process would be infinite and doomed to
terminate untimely. In other words, contradictions and inconsistencies
are, in fact, inherently systemic in the sense that they are generated
by a body of propositions each adopted arbitrary for this or other
reason, and the systemic knowledge ultimately lacks reliable and
coherent foundations. Just as with Pyrrhonism in Sextus'
interpretation, Jayarāśi seems to be a perpetual
investigator: he discards all theories and propositions that are
neither consistent nor proof-tight, for which there is also no
compelling evidence. But it would probably be far-fetched to claim that
the idea of truth did not represent any value for him.</p>

<h3><a name="SceDef">2.2 Scepticism and Definitions</a></h3>

<p>

Jayarāśi represents what has been once labelled
epistemological scepticism, or ontological scepticism (Hankinson 1995,
13ff), i.e., the position in which one refuses to accept the truth of
some proposition or to affirm the existence of something, without
denying it, as distinguished from negative (ontological) dogmatism,
i.e., the attitude in which one actually rejects the truth of some
proposition and denies the existence of the alleged objects. Further,
Jayaraśi's methodological scepticism should not be confused
with what is covered by the term e.g.  in the case of Descartes'
approach to seek ultimately firm foundations after all beliefs liable
to doubt have been successfully eliminated. Jayarāśi seeks
neither ultimate foundations for his system or firm basis for his
epistemology, ontology or ethics, because he never, even vaguely,
intimates he would have any. He is satisfied with demonstrating that
all we, the philosophers, have so far established, does not hold. But
contrary to Decartes' methodological scepticism,
Jayarāśi does not really cast doubt on what comes to us from
the senses.</p>

<p>
At the outset of his work (TUS 1), he points out the major deficiency
of our knowledge: ‘To establish cognitive criteria
(pramāṇa, instruments of knowledge) depends on proper
definitions. Further, to establish objects of cognitive criteria
depends on cognitive criteria. When proper definitions are absent, how
is it possible that one would treat both the cognitive criteria and
their objects as genuinely real?’ To adopt certain definitions we
first have to adopt certain definitions and criteria of validity. That
has to be done vis-à-vis the external reality and tested for
validity with respect to phenomena that have all the appearance of
real, for Indian philosophers en bloc accepted the correspondence
theory of truth. To test the definitions, criteria of validity and
cognitive criteria with respect to real objects, we should first know
what these real objects really are. To know that we have to have
reliable instruments of knowledge (cognitive criteria) and criteria of
validity at our disposal. We land in vicious circle: we can neither
know cognisable real objects nor determine what genuine cognitive
criteria are, nor be actually able to define them without having the
idea of validity first. Without it we cannot even properly distinguish
between valid cognitive procedures and invalid ones.</p>

<p>
Since it is vital to have a proper definition of a cognitive criterion,
or a valid cognitive procedure and criterion of truth for philosophical
enterprise, Jayarāśi analyses such definitions which were
formulated within most important philosophical schools in India. The
cognitive criteria whose various definitions are one by one examined
are perception (pratyakṣa), inference (anumāna), presumption
(arthāpatti), reasoning based on analogy (upamāna), negative
proof based on absence (abhāva), equivalence (sambhāva),
tradition (aitihya), and verbal or scriptural testimony (śabda,
āgama). In terms of argumentative structure and nature, they all
can be reduced to three: perception, inference and testimony. The
philosophical schools which Jayarāśi most frequently refers
to and criticises their definitions of the cognitive criteria are the
Nyāya, Vaiśeṣika, Sāṁkhya,
Mīmāṁsā as well as Buddhist and Jaina schools.</p>

<p>
He demonstrates that no one so far has offered an irrefutable
definition of perception (which does not have to mean that perception
as such has to be completely unreliable). All definitions of perception
are seriously flawed and we cannot rely on it in the way it is defined:
we do not have even a reliable method or a dependable criterion to
distinguish a genuine perception from a mirage, optical illusion or a
mental image (e.g. in hallucination, reminiscence or dream). However,
Iit is not the case that Jayarāśi argues that ‘there is
simply no way … to know that our sense-perceptions are
true’ (King 1999: 19). What he is up to is to demonstrate that,
given our present definitions of perception and categories on which our
epistemology rests, there is no way to determine which of our
sense-perceptions are true.</p>

<p>
Inference relies on data provided by perception which makes inference
doubtful. But inference the way it has so far been defined is flawed
for a number of other reasons. There is no reliable way to relate
properties or facts in a truth-conducive way. For instance, to infer
the cause from the effect one would have to first to define what
causality is, which as Jayarāśi demonstrates cannot be done
with the categories we have at our disposal: there is actually no
reliable way to relate A and B as cause and effect. Further, what do we
relate in inference: universals with universals, universals with a
particular, or a particular with a particular? Since universals do not
exist, inferences which are based on such notions are intrinsically
flawed. We are left with the idea that inferences depend on
particular-to-particular relation. That being the case, there is no
method to establish any kind of valid relationship between two
particulars which could allow us to draw any sound inferences from
single-instantiated cases. Further, inferences will have to rely on
cases of inductive reasoning which are logically not valid and cannot
be demonstrated to be universally valid. Also testimony of an authority
cannot be a legitimate source of knowledge because, first, such
testimony would have to rely on other cognitive criteria and, second,
we would have no means to determine what a reliable testimony is or who
an authoritative person can be. Therefore, given all available
definitions and criteria, nothing can be known for certain.</p>

<p>
Jayarāśi's undertaking is not restricted to the
examination of valid cognitive procedures and their definitions. In the
course of his work, he analyses a number of fundamental ideas and
demonstrates that their definitions are inadequate and they cannot
exist as understood and defined by philosophers. These include such
notions as validity and nonerroneousness, sublation of previous
knowledge by a subsequent experience, universals, the relation of
composite wholes to their parts, production of cognitions, ontological
categories such as inherence of properties in their substrata, the
nature of illusion, the definition of what exists (e.g. the real
object's ability to execute causally efficient action,
artha-kriyā), the nature of sense-object contact, memory and
recollection, momentariness and permanence, conceptuality or conceptual
state of mind, relation of the conceptual image in cognition to the
external thing represented, the nature of consciousness (rejection of
non-material character), rebirth and karmic retribution, causality,
visible and invisible objects, absences, rules of inference etc. All
these ideas, as Jayarāśi demonstrates, stand in need of
proper definition and as long as we do not have them cannot be
maintained in their present form.</p>

<h3><a name="PosVie">2.3 Positive Views</a></h3>

<p>

Jayarāśi, as we noted, is cautious not to affirmatively
state anything, and nowhere does he use such expressions as ‘thus
it was established that’ (iti sthitam) or similar expressions
typical of all other philosophical works. Despite this, can we
reconstruct any positive views he affirms or is his scepticism
all-embracing? It seems there a few such views. His clear rejection of
karmic retribution, afterlife and the supernatural (‘human
actions do no bring otherworldly results, such as rebirth in heaven
etc.’) and the claim the ultimate reality for us is what we
experience and what surrounds us concerns both metaphysics and ethics.
Metaphysically, there is no supernatural reality of any relevance to
us. Ethically, the only criterion to determine what is right and wrong
is what people agree to accept as such (‘the worldly path should
be followed’). Quite frequently, he uses examples of non-existent
entities such as demons (piśāca), atoms (paramāṇu)
and god (mahêśvara), taking their fictitious character for
granted, which indicates that he apparently rejected invisible reality
which is intrinsically beyond our senses.</p>

<p>
He plainly states that ‘universals do not exist’ (TUP, 4.5
ff.), which does not seem to be a mere thesis which he rejects just for
the sake of argument, because throughout his work he will refer to this
claim (‘we have already shown that universals do not
exist’). Does his denial of universals mean that he was a
nominalist? If so, in what sense? On another occasion (TUS 24) he
criticises the view that composite macroscopic wholes cannot exist, and
what exists instead are their parts only (a typical Buddhist nominalist
position). He concludes there is no way to demonstrate that composite
wholes are non-existent. Interestingly, he nowhere links the idea of
composite wholes (and the paradox of the whole and its parts), which he
seems to accept, to idea the universal (and the paradox of the
universal and the particulars as its instantiations), which he clearly
rejects. These two concepts, the wholes and universals, were generally
analysed in India jointly as two aspects of the same problem: just as
the whole exists (or does not exist) through its parts, in the very
same way also the universal exists (or does not exist) through its
particulars. Interestingly, Jayarāśi never links these two
issues, precisely because, it seems, he admitted the existence of
macroscopic objects of our experience (i.e., composite wholes) whereas
he rejected the existence of universals. Being a sceptic, he does seem
to accept a ‘commonsensical view’ of the world that
consists of such macroscopic objects, but not of invisible atoms or
universals, demons and god. In line with this approach, he seemed also
to maintain that consciousness is a product or combination of the four
elements (see above). It should not come as a surprise to discover that
all these views he shared with genuine materialists of the
Cārvāka / Lokāyata tradition.</p>

<p>
A truly sceptical thesis Jayarāśi entertained was his
assumption that all philosophical claims are always made within a
particular set of beliefs, i.e., within a particular system which is
based on arbitrarily accepted criteria, definitions and categories. His
pragmatic, ‘commonsensical attitude’ is highlighted in a
verse he quotes: ‘with respect to everyday practice of the world,
the fool and the wise are similar’ (see above), because
ultimately we all have to rely on our experience and defective and
partial knowledge of reality.</p>

<p>
The conclusion of his work: ‘Thus, when all categories are
completely dissolved in the above manner, all practical actions (which
entails thought, speech and activity) can be enjoyable, without being
reflected upon’, is quite meaningful. On the one hand it could be
taken to imply some kind of a carpe diem attitude: given our
limitations and intrinsic inability to know with certainty, the only
option we are left with is to enjoy the world the way it appears to us.
On the other hand, the statement could also suggest that what
Jayarāśi had in mind was that for all our practical
activities, including thinking, verbal communication, behaviour or
ordinary life, the world of our actions — as long as it is relevant to
us — is ‘here and now’ and retains its ultimate validity,
even though we are incapable of its proper philosophical analysis.</p>
