<h1>Attention</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Tue Sep 8, 2009; substantive revision Fri Sep 1, 2017</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
Attention is involved in the selective directedness of our mental
lives. The nature of this selectivity is one of the principal points
of disagreement between the extant theories of attention. Some of the
most influential theories treat the selectivity of attention as
resulting from limitations in the brain’s capacity to process
the complex properties of multiple perceptual stimuli. Other theories
take the selectivity of attention to be the result of limitations in
the thinking subject’s capacity to consciously entertain
multiple trains of thought. A third group of theories account for
attention’s selectivity in ways that need not make any reference
to limitations in capacity. These latter theories relate the
selectivity of attention to the selectivity required to maintain a
single coherent course of action, to the weighting of sensory
information in accordance with its expected precision, or to
competition between mutually inhibitory streams of processing. </p>

<p>
The instances of attention differ along several dimensions of
variation. In some of its instances attention is a <em>perceptual</em>
phenomenon. In other instances it is a phenomenon related to
<em>action</em>. In some instances the selectivity of attention is
voluntary. In other instances it is driven, quite independently of the
subject’s volition, by the high salience of attention-grabbing
items in the perceptual field. The difficulty of giving a unified
theory of attention that applies to attention’s voluntary and
involuntary instances, and to its perceptual and enactive instances,
makes attention a topic of philosophical interest in its own right.
</p>

<p>
Attention is also a topic of philosophical interest because of its
apparent relations to a number of other philosophically puzzling
phenomena. There are empirical and theoretical considerations
suggesting that attention is closely related to
<em>consciousness</em>, and there are controversies over whether this
relationship of consciousness to attention is one of necessity, or
sufficiency (or both or neither). There are also controversies –
thought to be important to the viability of representationism about
consciousness – over the ways in which the phenomenal character
of a conscious experience can be modulated by attention. Different
considerations link attention to <em>demonstrative reference</em>, to
the development of an understanding of <em>other minds</em>, and to
the exercise of the <em>will</em>. Some work in the tradition of
virtue ethics takes attention to be <em>morally</em> important, since
there are at least some virtues that require one to attend
appropriately. </p>

<p>
The controversies concerning attention’s relation to these other
phenomena often include debates about the philosophical significance
of theories that have been developed through the empirical study of
attention at the neuropsychological level, and at the cognitive
level.</p>

<h2><a name="HisOve">1. Historical Overview</a></h2>

<h3><a name="DesAttEpi">1.1 Descartes: Attention and Epistemology</a></h3>

<p>
In the early modern period a variety of explanatory roles were
assigned to attention by a number of different writers.
Descartes’ <em>Meditations</em> provides one prominent example.
The result of Descartes’ First Meditation—that everything
can be doubted—is in apparent tension with the Third
Meditation’s claim that clear and distinct ideas are beyond
doubt. Descartes introduces a claim about attention to resolve the
apparent conflict. He claims, in reply to the seventh set of
objections, that it is only when we pay attention to them that clear
and distinct ideas provide a place where doubt does not take hold:</p>

<blockquote>
So long as we attend to a truth which we perceive very clearly, we
cannot doubt it. But when, as often happens, we are not attending to
any truth in this way, then even though we remember that we have
previously perceived many things clearly, nevertheless there will be
nothing which we may not justly doubt so long as we do not know that
whatever we clearly perceive is true. (‘Replies to
Objections’, 309)
</blockquote>

<p>
This passage is usually cited for the point that it makes about
memory, but the picture that Descartes is here outlining is also one
in which attention has an important epistemic role to play: clarity
and distinctness realize their epistemic potential only when attention
is paid to the ideas that have them. Those ideas can be doubted, as,
in accordance with the policy of the First Meditation they must be,
but that doubt cannot be maintained by a properly attentive thinker.
The crucial first move in Descartes’ epistemology—the move
from radical doubt to certainty about the truth of particular clear
and distinct ideas—is, therefore, a transition that is mediated
by attention. </p>

<h3><a name="BerAttAbs">1.2 Berkeley: Attention and Abstraction</a></h3>

<p>
A quite different explanatory role is assigned to attention in Bishop
Berkeley’s <em>Principles of Human Knowledge</em>, although here
again we find that it is in order to remove an epistemological glitch
that the notion of attention is brought in. In the Introduction to
<em>Principles of Human Knowledge</em> Berkeley rejects Locke’s
claim that there exist such things as Abstract Ideas. But Berkeley
retains Locke’s commitment to the core empiricist claim that the
thinking of thoughts is always a matter of handling ideas received
from experience. This would seem to lead to the conclusion that it is
not possible to think about abstractia, but Berkeley realizes that
that conclusion is unacceptable. It is, as he says, perfectly possible
to think about the properties of triangles in general. </p>

<p>
In the second edition of the <em>Principles</em> Berkeley added a
couple of sentences to the Introduction that make it clear that it is
attention and, in particular, the withholding of attention, that is
supposed to explain the possibility of thinking about abstractia
without the need to postulate Abstract Ideas. These added sentences
tell us that:</p>

<blockquote>
[It] must be acknowledged that <em>a man may consider a figure merely
as triangular, without attending to the particular qualities of the
angles or relations of the sides</em>. So far he may abstract, but
this will never prove that he can frame an abstract general,
inconsistent idea of a triangle. (1710, Introduction to 2nd edn.
§16. emphasis added)
</blockquote>

<p>
In these sentences Berkeley is not attempting to elaborate a theory of
attention. He says nothing more about the idea that attention might
enable thought about abstractia. It is nonetheless clear that he
requires attention to play an important role in his picture of the
mind.</p>

<p>
Berkeley’s idea that attention and abstraction are linked was
taken up in the second half of the nineteenth century by William
Hamilton. Hamilton did not, however, think that the link between
attention and abstraction provided the starting point for an
explanation of attention, nor of abstraction. That is because he took
it that the relationship between the two phenomena was too intimate to
be explanatory. He writes that: </p>

<blockquote>
Attention and Abstraction are only the same process viewed in
different relations. They are, as it were, the positive and negative
poles of the same act. (1876, 88)
</blockquote>

<h3><a name="LocAttModTho">1.3 Locke: Attention as a Mode of Thought</a></h3>

<p>
Descartes and Berkeley treat attention very briefly, but each assigns
attention to a particular explanatory role. Locke’s treatment of
attention is also brief, but he has his own theory of the explanatory
role that attention plays, and he goes further than either Descartes
or Berkeley in giving us a positive account of what attention is. The
account is given as part of the catalogue of ‘Modes of
Thinking’ that Locke sets out towards the beginning of Chapter
Nineteen of Book Two of the <em>Essay Concerning Human
Understanding:</em></p>

<blockquote>
[W]hen ideas float in our mind without any reflection or regard of the
understanding, it is that which the French call reverie; our language
has scarce a name for it: <em>when the ideas that offer themselves
(for, as I have observed in another place, whilst we are awake, there
will always be a train of ideas succeeding one another in our minds)
are taken notice of, and, as it were, registered in the memory, it is
attention</em>: when the mind with great earnestness, and of choice,
fixes its view on any idea, considers it on all sides, and will not be
called off by the ordinary solicitation of other ideas, it is that we
call “intention,” or “study.” (1689, II, 19
§1 emphasis added)
</blockquote>

<p>
In addition to providing these quick theories of
‘reverie’, ‘attention’ and ‘intention or
study’, the very same sentence of Locke’s <em>Essay</em>
provides theories of ‘remembrance’,
‘recollection’, ‘contemplation’,
‘sleep’, ‘dreaming’ and ‘ecstasy’.
It is significant that Locke’s account of attention is given so
briefly, and that it goes by as part of a crowd of theories of these
various other mental phenomena. Locke is not here engaging in an
uncharacteristically slapdash piece of rapid-fire theorizing. His
intention in going through this catalogue is to establish that these
are topics for which no new substantive theory is needed. These are,
in Locke’s theory, simply ‘modes of thinking’:
‘reverie’, ‘study’ etc. are not names for
independent phenomena, existing in their own right. Instead they are
the various names that thinking is given when it takes place in
various ways. </p>

<p>
One consequence of Locke’s treatment of attention as a mode of
thinking is that, once we have a theory of thinking before us, we need
no further theory to account for how attention, contemplation, study,
etc. are possible. (Just as, to use the classic example of
‘modes’, we need no substantive independent theory, once
we have a theory of walking, to explain how limping, pacing or ambling
are possible.) We need to say <em>something</em> in giving an analysis
of the nature of modes, but—once the thing-to-be-modified has
been accounted for—the thing that we say can be something brief,
along the lines indicated by Locke. We do not need to give a theory
that postulates any substances or processes specific to the
explanation of attention.</p>

<p>
Locke’s modal view of attention has the consequence that no very
substantive theory of attention is needed once our theory of thinking
is in place. It also entails, and for the same reason, that attention
cannot figure in the explanation of how thinking itself is possible
(for any explanation in which it did figure would be analogous to an
explanation of walking that takes strolling to already be possible; it
would get its explanatory priorities backwards). </p>

<h3><a name="EigNinCenAttPerActRefTho">1.4 The Eighteenth and Nineteenth Centuries: Attention in Perception, in Action and in Reflective Thought</a></h3>

<p>
Locke viewed attention as an explanatorily slight phenomenon—a
mode of thought that is not in need of much explanation, nor capable
of providing much. Theories of attention moved away from that view
over the course of the eighteenth century. Attention was increasingly
treated as a phenomenon with explanatory work to do, and so as a
phenomenon for which a substantive independent theory needed to be
given. The attempt to provide such a theory got properly underway in
1738, when Christian Wolff’s textbook on psychology was the
first to devote a whole chapter to the topic of attention (see
Hatfield, 1995, for an excellent discussion).</p>

<p>
During this period the explanatory remit for theories of attention
broadened in two directions. The first move was away from the idea
that attention acts on already-received ideas and towards the idea
that attention is involved in the initial reception of those ideas.
Locke had characterized attention as the registration of
already-received ideas into memory. But by 1769, when Henry Home Kames
added the appendix of ‘Terms Defined or Explained’ to his
<em>Elements of Criticism</em>, attention’s role as a regulator
of cognitive input was regarded as definitive of it:</p>

<blockquote>
Attention is that state of mind which prepares one to receive
impressions. According to the degree of attention objects make a
strong or weak impression. Attention is requisite even to the simple
act of seeing. (1769, 18)
</blockquote>

<p>
As well as beginning to assign to attention a role in the explanation
of the reception of ideas, eighteenth century theories also moved
towards including a role for attention in the production of
<em>behaviour</em>. This is particularly clear in Dugald
Stewart’s 1792 <em>Elements of the Philosophy of the Human
Mind</em>. Stewart retains Locke’s view that attention has an
essential role to play in determining which things get stored in
memory. He adds to that view the claim that attention has a role in
determining which particular memories get recalled, writing that
“Some attention [is] necessary for any act of memory
whatever.” (1792, 53). Stewart also claims that attention has a
role in the explanation of the development and deployment of at least
some skilled behaviours. The example that Stewart gives here is that
of ‘the dexterity of jugglers’ which, he says,
“merits a greater degree of attention from philosophers than it
has yet attracted” (62). </p>

<p>
In the century between Locke’s <em>Essay</em> and
Stewart’s <em>Elements</em>, then, attention ceases to be seen
merely as a certain mode of idea-handling, and comes to be seen as a
phenomenon in need of its own explanation, and with a role to play in
the explanation of perception, in the explanation of memory (both in
its storage and in its recall), and in the explanation of skilled
action. </p>

<p>
In the century after Stewart’s <em>Elements</em> the diversity
among the phenomena that attention was expected to explain continued
to grow, and it continued to include phenomena from across the
psychological spectrum from perception, to thought, to action. By the
end of the nineteenth century, in what was a crucial period in the
development of scientific psychology, there were some psychologists,
such as E.B. Titchener, who took the role of attention in perception
and in ‘sensory clearness’ to be its most essential
feature (see Titchener, 1908, 1910); others, such as Alexander Bain,
who thought that the essential feature of attention was its role in
action, (Bain, 1888); and a third group, of whom G.F. Stout was the
most prominent example, who argued that the primary job for a theory
of attention was to explain attention’s role in reflective
thought (see Stout, 1891). </p>

<p>
As a result of this diversity in their conceptions of
attention’s explanatory remit (and as a result of the lack of an
established methodology for empirical psychology) the debates between
exponents of these various psychological theories of attention got
themselves into what was acknowledged to be a ‘chaotic
state’ (Pillsbury, 1906). </p>

<h3><a name="WilJamHisConDefThe">1.5 William James and His Contemporaries: Deflationary Theories</a></h3>

<p>
The diversity of explanatory roles assigned to attention in the
eighteenth and nineteenth centuries meant that theorizing about
attention at the end of the nineteenth century was in a chaotic state.
The ambition for theorists of attention writing at the end of the
nineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth centuries was to get
this chaos into order. The theories of attention proposed in this
period therefore tended to take the form of attempts to reveal
attention as something less mysterious and less complex than earlier
writers had supposed. This ambition to give a ‘nothing
but…’ reduction of attention can be seen in the most
influential work from this period: William James’ <em>The
Principles of Psychology</em> (1890).</p>

<p>
One aspect of James’ approach is to play down the more complex
perceptual aspects of attention. His chapter on attention includes a
discussion of experiments into what we now call
‘subitizing’—that is, into the ability to perceive
the cardinality of small stimulus sets without needing to count their
members—but James writes of these experiments that it “is
obvious that such observations decide nothing at all about our
attention, properly so called” (407).</p>

<p>
Although James plays down attention’s role in complex perceptual
phenomena, he does assign attention to an important explanatory role
in the production of behaviour. He claims, for example, that
‘Volition is nothing but attention’ (424). But when James
makes such claims it is as part of a general project that seeks always
to be deflationary where possible. When James associates attention
with volition it is as a way of suggesting how volition could be given
a deflationary treatment, not as a way of inflating attention’s
explanatory role.</p>

<p>
This deflationary approach to attention’s explanatory remit
means that, when it comes to giving an account of the ‘intimate
nature of the attention process’, James can identify two fairly
simple processes which, he claims, ‘probably coexist in all our
concrete attentive acts’. and which ‘possibly form in
combination a complete reply’ to the question of
attention’s ‘intimate nature’ (1890, 411). The
processes that James identifies are:</p>

<ol>

<li>The accommodation or adjustment of the sensory organs, and</li>

<li>The anticipatory preparation from within of the ideational centres
concerned with the object to which attention is paid. (411)</li>
</ol>

<p>
The first of these processes is reasonably familiar. By ‘the
accommodation or adjustment of the sensory organs’ James means
such processes as pointing one’s ears in the right direction,
bringing one’s eyes into focus, taking a sniff, and so on.</p>

<p>
James’s talk of ‘anticipatory preparation’ of
‘ideation centres’ is a little less clear, but the point
is again a quite straightforward one. What James has in mind here is
simply <em>imagination</em>. His claim is that when attention does not
involve adjusting one’s sense organs it consists in imagining
the things or actions that one is attending to, or looking for.</p>

<p>
James illustrates his claim about attention’s link to
imagination with an example from Hermann von Helmholtz. The example is
an important one for James, and it illustrates some important features
of attention that subsequent theorists have tended to neglect. The
example involves the variety of attention that needs to be paid when
trying to discern the overtones in a note played on the piano.
Helmholtz asks us to sit at the piano and to play a G, then, imagining
the sound that we have just heard, to play a low C. Doing this, it is
claimed, enables one to hear that G is discernibly there (as the third
overtone) within the sound produced when C is played.
Helmholtz’s claim, which James endorses, is that the kind of
attention that is paid when listening for an overtone is constituted
by the imagining of what that overtone would sound like. James goes
onto claim that there is a wide range of cases in which paying
attention to what one is doing consists in this same sort of
preparatory imaginative engagement.</p>

<p>
Here, as in his more frequently discussed treatment of emotion, it is
distinctive of James’s approach that he tries to account for a
large-scale personal-level psychological phenomenon in a realist but
somewhat revisionary way, so as to be able to give his account using
relatively simple and unmysterious explanatory resources. An
alternative deflationary approach—one which James explicitly
contrasted with his own—is the approach taken in 1886 by F.H.
Bradley. </p>

<p>
Bradley advocated a view according to which attention is not the sort
of phenomenon for which an independent and substantive theory can or
needs to be given. Bradley does not develop this point in much detail,
and it is a point on which he would later change his mind, but in his
1886 article, ‘Is there a special activity of attention?’,
Bradley was concerned with arguing that a project such as
James’s one of identifying particular processes as the
attention-constituting ones was wrongheaded. He claims that no
particular attention-processes can be identified since:</p>

<blockquote>
Any function whatever of the body or the mind will be active attention
if it is prompted by an interest and brings about the result of our
engrossment with its product. There is no primary act of attention,
there is no specific act of attention, there is no one kind of act of
attention at all. (1886, 316)
</blockquote>

<p>
Although Bradley does not use the Lockean vocabulary, (and although
James himself does not seem to have taken Bradley in this way)
Bradley’s position here has much in common with Locke’s
claim that attention is a <em>mode</em>. Bradley’s position,
like Locke’s, is that what is essential to an instance of
attention is not the matter of <em>which</em> processes are taking
place, but the facts about <em>how</em> the things that happen happen.
He therefore takes the ennumeration of processes to be the wrong form
for a theory of attention to take.</p>

<p>
Other writers who were contemporary with Bradley and James took
different approaches to the project of giving a deflationary
explanation of attention. In Theodule Ribot’s 1888 book <em>La
Psychologie De L’Attention</em> the attempt to explain attention
took an approach that we would now classify as behaviourist. In 1888
behaviourism had not yet been established as a general approach in
philosophical or psychological theories of the mind, but Ribot’s
suggestion that attention’s behavioural manifestations are
essential to it is nonetheless recognizable as an early articulation
of behaviourism in a strong form: </p>

<blockquote>
Are the movements of the face, the body, and the limbs and the
respiratory modifications that accompany attention, simple effects,
outward marks, as is usually supposed? Or are they, on the contrary,
<em>the necessary conditions, the constituent elements, the
indispensable factors of attention</em>? Without hesitation we accept
the second thesis. (1888, 19)
</blockquote>

<p>
A somewhat more moderate version of this behaviour-centred approach
was taken by Alexander Bain, who identified attention, not with its
behavioural manifestations themselves, but with truncated versions of
the motor-control processes that typically bring about those
behavioural manifestations: processes ‘stopping short of the
actual movement performed by the organ’ (Bain, 1888, 371). Much
as Ribot’s view can be seen as an early version of behaviourism,
Bain’s view can be seen as an early version of the motor-based
approaches to attention that can be found in the literature of the
present century (see
 <a href="#MotThe">Section 2.8</a>
 below).</p>

<h3><a name="TweCenLocAttBotInfPro">1.6 The Twentieth Century: Locating Attention at a Bottleneck in Information Processing</a></h3>

<p>
The variety among the deflationary explanatory approaches that
characterized the theories of attention offered in the nineteenth
century gave way in the early twentieth century to a period in which
one such explanatory tactic was dominant: the tactic of behaviourism.
Behaviourists tended to neglect attention, but they did not ignore it
entirely. John Dashiell’s 1928 <em>Fundamentals of Objective
Psychology</em>, for example, is a behaviourist work that attempts to
account for attention “as a form of posturing” (Ch. 10,
§3). The project of identifying a behaviour with which to explain
attention was, nonetheless, an understandably unpopular one. As
Gilbert Ryle notes, it is not only attention, but also ‘heed
concepts’ more generally, that resist simple behaviourist
analysis: </p>

<blockquote>
[W]hen a man is described as driving carefully, whistling with
concentration or eating absent-mindedly the special character of his
activity seem to elude the observer, the camera and the Dictaphone.
Perhaps knitted brows, taciturnity and fixed gaze may be evidence of
intentness; but these can be simulated, or they can be purely
habitual. (1949, 133)
</blockquote>

<p>
In the middle of the twentieth century behaviourism’s dominance
waned, cognitive psychology established itself, and a new theoretical
approach to the explanation of attention was developed. These three
developments were intimately related to one another. Instrumental to
all three was the publication in 1958 of Donald Broadbent’s
<em>Perception and Communication</em>. </p>

<p>
The year prior to <em>Perception and Communication</em>’s
publication had seen B.F. Skinner’s attempt, in <em>Verbal
Behaviour</em> (1957), to apply a behaviourist explanatory approach to
distinctively human aspects of cognition. Skinner’s project in
that book failed, and Noam Chomsky’s famous 1959 review of the
book made its failure conspicuous. Chomsky’s own work in
<em>Syntactic Structures</em> (1957) went some way towards
establishing the new cognitive paradigm for psychology by showing how
internal processing could be theorized by describing transformations
on representations in abstraction from the question of how those
representations were realized. Donald Broadbent’s distinctive
contribution to the overthrow of behaviourism was to show how the move
from behavioural data to the postulation of a particular cognitive
architecture could be disciplined by the then-new strategy of
importing into psychology the intellectual resources used in thinking
about information technology. The year in which Broadbent’s book
was published was an important year for the development of such
technologies, being the year in which (inter alia) the integrated
circuit chip was invented (see Mole, 2012). It was also the year in
which Subscriber Trunk Dialling was introduced to UK telephone
exchanges. The technology of the telephone exchange was what most
naturally suggested itself as a metaphor for attention at the time
when Broadbent was writing. </p>

<p>
Towards the end of <em>Perception and Communication</em> Broadbent
explicitly sets out the claim that the theoretical resources developed
in thinking about the transmission of information through telephone
exchanges provide the basis for an alternative to behaviourism. He
also attacks the positivistic methodological principles that had given
many behaviourists their motivation. But the central lesson from
Broadbent’s work, so far as the theory of attention goes, is a
lesson that he takes to be independent of this attack on behaviourism
and its positivistic foundations. At an early stage in <em>Perception
and Communication</em> Broadbent remarks that: </p>

<blockquote>
Perhaps the point of permanent value which will remain in psychology
if the fashion for communication theory wanes, will be the emphasis on
problems of capacity. […] The fact that any given channel has a
limit is a matter of central importance to communication engineers,
and it is correspondingly forced on the attention of psychologists who
use their terms. (1958, 5)
</blockquote>

<p>
This introduction of the notion of capacity limitations into
discussions of perception and attention was, as Broadbent here
predicted, hugely and permanently influential.</p>

<p>
Broadbent claimed not only that the human brain is subject to capacity
limitations of the sort that communications engineers had learnt to
theorize, he claimed also that these limitations are clustered so that
there is a single bottleneck in capacity that is especially critical
to the brain’s handling of perceptual information. This
bottleneck was said to occur at the junction of two systems operating
in series; the first system having a large capacity for information
processing, and operating automatically on all of the stimuli with
which the subject is presented; the second having a much smaller
capacity, and so needing to be deployed selectively. </p>

<p>
Those who followed Broadbent took it that the bottleneck that results
from the connection of these two systems corresponds to attention in
the sense that, when a representation of a stimulus passes through
that bottleneck, the stimulus <em>ipso facto</em> counts as one to
which attention is paid.</p>

<p>
Broadbent himself was cautious about presenting his claims about
capacity-bottlenecks as a theory of attention. The word
‘attention’ occurs rarely in <em>Perception and
Communication</em>. Broadbent’s later book, <em>Decision and
Stress</em> (1971), does describe his earlier experiments as
‘studies of attention’, but here too Broadbent prefers to
talk about the phenomenon observed in the lab as ‘selective
perception’ (chapter V) or ‘vigilance’ (chapters II
and III). In an article from 1982, entitled, ‘Task Combination
and Selective Intake of Information’, he admits that: “The
topic of this paper is one that is often termed
‘attention’, and it may seem unduly artificial to have
given it a more cumbrous title.” But he goes on to reassert his
qualms: </p>

<blockquote>
‘Attention’ is a word in ordinary language, that can
reasonably be used as a label for experiments in a particular area.
Yet it has also been used as a theoretical concept, a mysterious asset
or energy which is sometimes attached to human functions and sometimes
not. This use of attention […] is not very helpful, and
avoiding the word in the title is a step towards clarity. (1982, 253)
</blockquote>

<p>
When Broadbent does use the word ‘attention’ it is mostly
in discussions of attention <em>shifting</em>. His view, at least in
his early work, seems to have been that where there is a bottleneck in
our information processing capacity there need to be additional
mechanisms that control how our limited capacity resources will be
deployed. These additional mechanisms of bottleneck-<em>control</em>
seem to have been what Broadbent thought of as the attention
mechanisms. He never took himself to have given a theory of them, only
to have given a theory of where they would be needed. Nor were these
mechanisms the topic that was at issue in the debates about attention
that Broadbent prompted. Those debates were concerned with questions
about the nature and location of the bottleneck itself, not about the
factors that determine what, on any particular occasion, gets to pass
through it.</p>

<p>
In the decades following Broadbent a great many psychologists devoted
themselves to the task of locating the attentional bottleneck that he
had postulated. Almost all psychologists writing at this time were
guided to some degree by Broadbent’s
two-serial-systems-and-a-bottleneck picture of perceptual processing.
The question of whether a given task is attention demanding was
therefore understood to depend on the question of whether the
performance of that task requires the engagement of the small-capacity
system that comes after the bottleneck of attention, and so research
into the attention-related demands of particular tasks became another
way by which to approach the issue of where the attentional bottleneck
is located. Broadbent’s two-systems-and-a-bottleneck model was
frequently questioned, but for most research into attention in the
second half of the twentieth century it was very much the orthodox
view. This has now changed. In psychology’s current paradigm,
only a few aspects of Broadbent’s picture remain orthodox.</p>

<h2><a name="TheAtt">2. Theories of Attention</a></h2>

<h3><a name="CapLimThe">2.1 Capacity-Limitation Theories</a></h3>

<p>
Psychologists attempting to produce a theory of attention in the
nineteen sixties and seventies were highly influenced by Donald
Broadbent’s picture of attention as corresponding to a
bottleneck in information processing capacity resulting from the
connection of two seperate perceptual processing systems. The first
piece of business for these psychologists was to locate this
attentional bottleneck by determining which sorts of processing are
done by the large capacity, pre-bottleneck system, and which by the
small capacity, post-bottleneck system. Debates between these
psychologists gave rise to various theories in which the selectivity
of attention was characterized with a claim about the location of this
bottleneck.</p>

<h4>2.1.1 Early Selection Theory</h4>

<p>
Broadbent’s own account of the distribution of processing
between the pre-attentional system and the post-attentional system
defines the ‘early selection’ theory of attention. He
claimed that only very simple properties are detected by the large
capacity system, and that any semantic properties, or properties
relating to the particular <em>identity</em> of a stimulus, are
detected only after representations of the stimulus have passed
through the attentional-bottleneck and into the smaller capacity
system. </p>

<p>
The personal-level consequences of this early selection theory are
that we can recognize what things are and what they mean only if we
are paying attention to them, but can detect the simple physical
properties of things even when paying no attention to them. The theory
can be thought of as a communication-theoretic rendering of two
intuitive ideas. The first is that one has no immediate control over
one’s awareness of simple features of one’s environment,
such as the fact that there are people talking in the next room.
Whatever one is paying attention to, one will continue to hear some
chatter to be going on, if any is. The second idea is that the details
of things—such as the semantic content of that chatter—can
be detected only for the one or two things to which one is paying
attention: If one wants to know what the chatter is about, one has to
listen. </p>

<p>
The early selection theory also entails, more problematically, that
the semantic properties of an unattended item must remain
unrepresented in the nervous system, and so it entails that those
properties can have no psychological effects. According to this view
the semantic features of unattended items cannot explain why those
items attract attention to themselves, on the occasions when they do.
It was to this aspect of the theory that its opponents most frequently
objected.</p>

<h4>2.1.2 Late Selection Theory</h4>

<p>
The chief rivals of Broadbent’s early selection theory were the
‘late selectionists’, who claimed that all (or almost all)
perceivable properties are detected automatically, by a large capacity
system that operates on all of the stimuli with which the subject is
presented. According to this late selection theory of attention the
consequences of passing through the bottleneck of attention into the
post-attentive small capacity system are only (1) that the subject
comes to be conscious of the contents that the large capacity system
has already succeeded in encoding and (2) that those contents come to
be stored in working memory (Deutsch and Deutsch, 1963).</p>

<p>
Although it was originally proposed against the background of
Broadbent’s now superseded theoretical framework, it would be
too quick to dismiss the late selection theory as an obsolete one. The
theory has much in common with some plausible and empirically
well-supported views found in the current literature. Jesse Prinz, for
example, shares the late selectionists’ view that
attention’s primary role is not in managing limited perceptual
processing resources, but in projecting already-processed
representations to working memory. Prinz’s view, varying a theme
from the work of Stanislas Dehaene, is that this projection to working
memory is what makes it the case that the content represented comes to
conscious awareness. (Prinz, 2005, 2012, Dehaene <em>et al</em>.,
2006). </p>

<p>
It should be noted that Prinz’s main philosophical business is
with the explanation of <em>consciousness</em>. Objections have been
raised as to whether the process of projection to working
memory—which Prinz refers to as
‘attention’—can adequately account for the various
things that attention does (Wu, 2014, §6.3.2). If it cannot then
Prinz is willing to allow that this process is not the sole referent
of the English word ‘attention’, writing that ‘other
researchers may choose to define attention differently’, and
that ‘those who disagree with my analysis of attention could
simply drop the term “attention”’ (Prinz, 2012, p.
95).</p>

<p>
The central component of the late-selection theory, as it was
originally understood, was that the effect of withdrawing attention
from a stimulus is to make it the case that the stimulus is processed
without the subject’s awareness, rather than not being processed
at all. This component of the view has, to some extent, been
vindicated. The claim that unattended stimuli are subjected to some
processing of which the subject lacks awareness, including some
processing of those stimuli’s semantic properties, is now
uncontroversial. Since we know that the semantic properties of
unattended stimuli can, for example, produce negative priming effects
(Tipper and Driver, 1988), we know that unattended stimuli are
processed in a way that allows at least some of their semantic
properties to be encoded. The semantic properties of unattended items
have such effects despite the fact that subjects are typically unaware
of what those properties are. </p>

<p>
The traditional late selection theory is right in taking it that
inattention can lead to properties being encoded without our
awareness, rather than not being encoded at all, but that theory is
also committed to the claim that attention’s <em>only</em>
effects are in determining what gets remembered and experienced, and
so that the direction of attention has no effects on the initial
perceptual processing to which stimuli are subjected. These claims we
now know to be false. An important experiment by O’Connor <em>et
al</em>. used fMRI to compare neural activity in subjects who, in
various task conditions, were presented with high and low contrast
checkerboard patterns in one or other half of the visual field
(O’Connor <em>et al</em>. 2002). In some conditions the subjects
had to perform a task involving these checkerboard patterns. In other
conditions the patterns were irrelevant to the task that the subjects
were performing (and in a third condition no pattern was presented,
but the subjects were attending to the screen in anticipation of a
pattern that was about to be presented). The results of these
comparisons revealed that even in the first parts of neural circuitry
through which information from the retina passes, on its way to the
visual cortex—the Lateral Geniculate Nuclei—there is a
difference in the baserate of neural activity, and a difference in the
response that stimuli elicit, depending on what the subject is
attending to. These findings indicate that attention’s effects
are not limited to cortical loci that are upstream from a late process
of attentional selection. They therefore refute any version of the
late-selection theory according to which the selectivity of attention
is entirely a ‘late process’, occurring after initial
perceptual encoding is complete.</p>

<p>
The findings of O’Connor <i>et al</i>. create fewer problems for
some recent theories in which elements of the late selection view are
retained. Nilli Lavie and her collaborators have proposed one such
theory, which attempts to combine some aspects of the late selection
theory with some aspects of its early selectionist rival. According to
Lavie’s ‘load theory’, attention <em>does</em>
correspond to a capacity bottleneck—much as Broadbent
thought—but the differing demands of the task that is at hand
lead to differences as to when that bottleneck restricts the
processing of a stimulus: in conditions of where the processing
demands of perception are high the bottleneck will operate at an early
stage, with the result that unattended stimuli will be processed
rather little; in conditions where the processing load of perception
is lower it will operate at a later stage, with the result that
unattended stimuli will be processed rather more (Lavie &amp; Tsal,
1994, Lavie <i>et al</i>. 2004). This load theory predicts that
peripheral stimuli will elicit less neural activation, and will be
less distracting, when the subject’s task is a perceptually
demanding one. The theory’s predictions have been borne out by
behavioural and neurological observations (Lavie, 2005). Its
theoretical apparatus has provided a useful framework for the
philosophical treatment of attention’s relationship to
consciousness (Hine, 2010). It is perhaps for reasons of fashion that
few psychologists have been persuaded to follow Lavie’s
rehabilitation of the Broadbentian framework’s basic terms. </p>

<p>
Other recently proposed theories also retain the idea that attentional
selectivity is the result of capacity limitations, but do so while
retreating further than Lavie does from the picture of attention that
Broadbent introduced. These theories reject the terms of the debate
between early and late selectionists because they reject the idea that
the capacity limitations responsible for attention are clustered into
a single bottleneck. In some cases this is because the selectivity of
attention is taken to be the result of <em>multiple</em> bottlenecks
in processing capacity (see, e.g., Johnston and McCann, 2006). In
other cases it is because the current theorists see capacity
limitations as occurring throughout the processing stream, and not as
clustered into bottlenecks at all (see Driver, 2001, for a suggestion
along these lines, and Allport, Antonis &amp; Reynolds, 1972, for an
earlier indication of it). </p>

<h4>2.1.3 Other Capacity-Limitation Theories</h4>

<p>
The early and late selection theories dominated discussions of
attention in the decades following Broadbent’s seminal work, but
by the beginning of the nineteen nineties it had become clear that the
debate between advocates of the early selection theory and advocates
of the late selection theory had become fruitless. Those debates were
therefore taken to have been predicated on some sort of mistaken
assumption. Several diagnoses have been proposed as to what that
mistaken assumption might have been. Little consensus has been reached
as to which of these diagnoses is correct, with the result that some
theorists—such as those discussed at the end of the preceding
section—retain ideas from the early and late selection theories,
while others regard this as a wrong-headedly retrograde step.</p>

<p>
One diagnosis is that the early/late debate was fruitless because the
terms ‘early’ and ‘late’ are themselves
problematic. If perceptual processing occurs in a parallel processing
architecture without any prevailing direction of information flow then
there is no sense in labeling one part of that architecture as earlier
or later than any other. If the attentional bottleneck is located in a
system that has such an architecture then it may be this that explains
why there was no satisfactory answer to the question of whether
attentional selection is early or late. It was with this thought in
mind that several writers suggested that the failure of the debate
between early and late selection theories was owing to the fact that
that debate requires us to make an assumption about the
<em>linearity</em> of the processing stream in which selection occurs
(see, e.g., Prinz and Hommel, 2002, 3). This is a thought that needs
to be treated with care.</p>

<p>
The claim that it was a problematic assumption about linearity that
led the early/late selection debate into fruitlessness received its
most influential treatment in an important paper by Alan Allport
(Allport, 1992). Allport identifies several problematic assumptions
that the early/late selection debate requires. His characterization of
what he takes to be the problematic assumption about linearity is as
the claim that:</p>

<blockquote>
[T]he processing of nonsemantic attributes (i.e. the processing of
attributes other than symbolic or categorical identity) occurs earlier
in a logical/causal sequence of operations than does any semantic or
categorical processing. (1992, 187)
</blockquote>

<p>
This assumption about linearity does not seem, on the face of it, to
be a problematic one. There is nothing to be objected to in the claim
that the situations in which we encounter a written word and come to
be in a position to know what that word means are situations in which
our sensory transducers respond firstly to simple nonsemantic
properties of the word. In order for creatures like us to detect the
semantic properties of written words, it <em>is</em> necessary for our
information processing systems to first encode some information about
the simple spatial properties of the lines on the page. This
information does then get passed on to subsequent processing stages in
which more complex properties, concerned with semantics and stimulus
identity, get processed. If this sort of linearity is what Allport was
taking issue with then it seems he must have been mistaken, since
there is nothing problematic about the idea that there is this much
linearity in the processing that any given stimulus is subjected to.
</p>

<p>
Nor is there anything unscientific about that idea. It continues to be
entirely normal for neuroscientists to refer to the processing that
takes place in occipital brain areas as ‘early’ and the
processing in frontal areas as ‘late’. In a much-cited
review of neuroimaging work on attention Sabine Kastner and Leslie
Ungerleider, for example, speak of: </p>

<blockquote>
… an increase in the complexity of processing as activity
proceeds anteriorly through the ventral stream into the temporal lobe.
Whereas posterior regions in cortex are preferentially activated
during the processing of object attributes, such as colors or
scrambled objects and faces, more anterior regions are activated
selectively during the processing of intact objects and faces. (2000,
319)
</blockquote>

<p>
The orthodox view expressed by Kastner and Ungerleider is subject to
differing interpretations. Those who think that perception and
cognition are best thought of as arising from a hierarchical Bayesian
process might reject the idea that information progresses through the
nervous system in a bottom-up fashion, with the detection of simple
properties happening at an early stage, and the detection of more
complex properties happening at a later one. Current advocates of such
hierarchical Bayesian theories place great emphasis on the idea that
the prior hypotheses required by a Bayesian inference can be generated
in a top-down fashion, and can then be tested against incoming signals
which contain information only about the ways in which the predictions
generated by these hypotheses are in error (Hohwy, 2013). Such
theories break from the tradition of thinking about the information
flow in the brain as being largely one-way, but they retain the idea
that information is organized into a structure with earlier and later
stages, with these stages now being understood as corresponding to the
more or less abstract layers in an hierarchically organized Bayesian
inference. They therefore retain the idea that there are earlier and
later stages in the processing of any given stimulus, while rejecting
the idea that there is one predominant direction of information flow
in the brain. Since this much linearity remains in our current
thinking about the architecture of perceptual processing, we cannot
coherently blame an assumption about this much linearity for the
troubles that led to the fruitlessness of the debate between early and
late selectionists. </p>

<p>
That is not to say that the early/late selection debate was entirely
free of problematic assumptions relating to linearity—only that
psychology has not yet settled upon a satisfactory account of the way
in which assumptions about linearity led the early/late debate into
trouble. </p>

<p>
One reason why assumptions about linearity may have been problematic
is that when, following Broadbent, we think about hierarchical
perceptual processing while bearing in mind the communications
engineer’s concerns about capacity limitations, it then becomes
natural to make additional assumptions about the way in which this
hierarchically organized architecture supports personal-level
cognition. The early/late debate’s problems are more plausibly
blamed on these additional assumptions, rather than on any assumptions
about hierarchical organization <em>per se</em>. Given that some
physical properties of a thing must first be represented in order for
the semantic properties of that thing to be detected by the subject,
it is natural for the communications engineer to suppose that no
further representation of these physical properties needs to be
generated in order for the subject to become aware of them, so that a
subject who is experiencing the semantic properties of a stimulus must
have been through a process that already gives him an experience of
that stimulus’s simple spatial properties. This additional
supposition would be a mistake. In fact, the brain represents the
physical properties of stimuli in multiple, parallel, somewhat
overlapping systems, only some of which put the subject in a position
to think about the properties that they represent. In order to get to
a representation of the meaning of the word on a page, the
subject’s brain must represent that word’s physical
properties, but it turns out that the brain’s representation of
these physical properties need not put the subject in a position to
form thoughts about them. The subject’s access to those
properties might require that they be represented all over again, in
some parallel system. From the point of view introduced by Broadbent
– that of a communications engineer who is concerned with the
management of limited capacity channels – this seems strangely
profligate. It is this—not an assumption about linearity <em>per
se</em>, but an assumption about the linearity of the processes that
support personal level thinking—that created problems for the
early/late debate. </p>

<p>
Once the problematic assumption about linearity has been made precise,
however, we see that it cannot be satisfactory to credit the entire
collapse of the early/late debate to this assumption. The falsity of
the assumption about the linearity of the processes supporting
personal-level awareness does not undermine the very idea that the
early/late debate is a meaningful one. The problems it creates are
largely methodological. The falsity of that assumption means that one
cannot make an inference from a lack of personal-level awareness of
some content to the absence of representations encoding that content.
It also means that Broadbent was wrong to suppose that the
psychological effects of unattended stimuli can only depend on those
properties of which the inattentive subject can be aware. But these
are methodological problems. They do not, by themselves, imply that
the debate between the early selection theory and the late selection
theory must have been misconceived. The situation that we find
ourselves in is, then, a somewhat unhappy one. Everybody agrees that
there was something misconceived about the debate between the two
theories of attention that dominated the decades following
Broadbent’s reintroduction of attention to the psychological
agenda. The ongoing influence of Broadbent’s selection theory,
and of the early/late debate, is often noted and sometimes lamented
(Driver, 2001, 56). But nobody is clear about whether the elements of
those theories that are retained in current theorizing are problematic
ones. </p>

<h3><a name="FeaIntThe">2.2 Feature Integration Theory</a></h3>

<p>
In the early nineteen eighties, Anne Treisman and her collaborators
identified the existence of ‘the binding problem’, and
described a process that could solve that problem. Treisman proposed
that attention be identified with this process. This proposal is known
as the Feature Integration Theory of attention. The theory has been
hugely influential, not only as a theory of attention, but also as the
framework that introduced and regimented research into the
independently interesting question of the binding problem (for more on
which, see
 <a href="../consciousness-unity/">‘The Unity of Consciousness’</a>
 esp.
 <a href="../consciousness-unity/#Taxo§2.2">§2.2</a>).
 </p>

<p>
Treisman describes the way in which the binding problem arises like
this: </p>

<blockquote>
Sensory information arrives in parallel as a variety of heterogeneous
hints, (shapes, colors, motions, smells and sounds) encoded in partly
modular systems. Typically many objects are present at once. The
result is an urgent case of what has been labelled the binding
problem. We must collect the hints, bind them into the right spatial
and temporal bundles, and then interpret them to specify their real
world origins. (2003, 97)
</blockquote>

<p>
We can illustrate this problem with an example. Suppose we have a
subject who is presented with a red tomato and a green apple, both at
the same time. This visual input is, as Treisman says, initially
broken up for specialized distributed processing—so, for
example, one part of the brain is responsible for detecting the shapes
of things, a different part is responsible for detecting their
colours. The shape-detecting centres represent the fact that a
tomato-shaped thing is present, and they represent the fact that an
apple-shaped thing is present. The colour-detecting centres represent
the fact that a red thing is present, and the fact that a green thing
is present. But the subject, if he is a normal human, knows more than
is implied by these four facts: He knows that the red thing is the
tomato-shaped thing and the green thing the apple-shaped thing. To
know this he must have a way of ‘binding’ the
representation of red in the colour centre with the representation of
the tomato shape in the shape centre. The binding problem is the
problem of knowing how to put together the properties that are
detected in seperate specialized detection centres.</p>

<p>
Treisman’s proposed solution exploits the fact that
<em>spatial</em> representations are ubiquitous, and the idea that
there is only one thing to be seen in any one place at any one time.
If the centre for detecting colours detects red <em>at place one</em>
and green <em>at place two</em>, and if the centre for detecting shape
detects a tomato shape <em>at place one</em> and an apple shape <em>at
place two</em>, then, given the principle that there is a maximum of
one visible object per place per time, the binding problem can be
solved. Treisman therefore proposes that we achieve a correctly bound
representation by moving a variously sized ‘window’ from
one location in the perceptual scene to another. This window blocks
out the information from all but a single location, and all the
features found at that location can then be ‘bound’ as
being features of the same object. The area covered by the window
within which features are bound is taken to correspond to the region
to which attention is being paid.</p>

<p>
There is more than one way to understand the explanatory import of
Treisman’s claim that the window of attention corresponds to the
window within which features are bound. Treisman’s early work
presents that claim as an attempt to identify the processes of
attention (by telling us that they are the processes of feature
integration). In her later work the explanation being offered is no
longer simply one in which it is attention that occupies the role of
explanadum and the binding processes that occupy the role of
explanans. Her later claim is that solving the binding problem is one
role for the kind of selectivity that attention enables.</p>

<p>
In some work the Feature Integration Theory has been pressed into the
service of more ambitious explanatory goals. The theory plays an
important role in John Campbell’s 2002 attempt, in <em>Reference
and Consciousness</em>, to use attention to explain how the reference
of demonstrative expressions gets fixed by their producers and
understood by their consumers (see section
 <a href="#AttDemRef">3.2</a>).
 Treisman herself suggests, albeit tentatively, that descendants of
the Feature Integration Theory may provide part of the explanation for
“the bound, unitary, interpreted, personal view of the world of
subjective experience” (Treisman, 2003, 111). She goes on to
suggest, again tentatively, that the sort of explanation that such a
theory provides “should give us all the information there is
about the conditions that create consciousness” (<em>op
cit</em>).</p>

<p>
Opposed to those who think that a theory of feature binding will be a
large component in our theory of attention, or of the unity of
consciousness, or of anything else, are a number of philosophers (and
a smaller number of psychologists) who deny that feature binding
creates a problem that needs serious cognitive apparatus to solve it.
Such claims have been made for various reasons. They are generally
made as part of large-scale revisionary proposals for the conceptual
framework of cognitive neuroscience. Kevin O’Regan and Alva
Noë’s rejection of the binding problem ‘as, in
essence, a pseudo-problem’ (O’Regan and Noë, 2001,
967) comes as part of their general attack on the idea that perception
requires the representation of the thing perceived. Vincent Di Lollo
has suggested that the assumptions about neural coding that generate
the binding problem have been superceded, with the result that the
binding problem is an ill-defined one (Di Lollo, 2012). And M.R.
Bennett and P.M.S. Hacker, in their book-length critique of the
philosophical foundations of neuroscience, claim that the notions of
representation and information that enjoy currency in neuroscience are
subject to various confusions, and that these confusions lead to it
being ‘widespread’ for neuroscientists to make
“confused statements of the so-called binding problem”
(Bennett and Hacker, 2003, 14). These debates about the status of the
binding problem (reviewed by Plate, 2007) turn on foundational issues
for the cognitive sciences generally. They have ceased to be
specifically concerned with the explanation of attention. </p>

<h3><a name="CohThe">2.3 Coherence Theories</a></h3>

<p>
The view that the function of attention is the management of
limitations in the brain’s information processing capacity has
been an orthodox one among psychologists since Donald Broadbent
introduced it in the nineteen fifties, but it has sometimes been
called into question. The theories of attention that have been
proposed by philosophers have tended not to endorse any
straightforward version of the capacity-limitation view, and there are
empirical reasons to think that the simplest versions of such a view
are mistaken. In the nineteen seventies Ulric Neisser and his
collaborators carried out a series of experiments showing that, when
appropriately trained, a subject can perform two attention-involving
tasks concurrently, without much interference between them (Hirst
<em>et al</em>., 1980, Neisser, 1976). Neisser interpreted these
experiments as suggesting that, insofar as there is a bottleneck that
attention is needed to manage, it must often be a bottleneck in
behavioural coordination, rather than in information processing
capacity. Simple bodily limitations are what prevent us from looking
in two directions at one time, or from throwing a ball and writing
with the same hand. Neisser’s suggestion was that in many cases
cognitive processing was selective, not as a result of limitations in
processing capacity, but only in so far as such bodily limitations
required it to be.</p>

<p>
In two papers from 1987, authored individually but published in the
same volume, Odmar Neumann and Alan Allport developed a similar idea.
Whereas Neisser emphasized the constraints that are imposed on
cognition by the need to manage a single body, Neumann and Allport
both emphasized the constraints that are placed on cognition by the
need to maintain a coherent course of action. They describe their
position as a ‘selection-for-action’ theory. </p>

<p>
If we think of ‘action’ as here referring to bodily
behaviour then the selection-for-action theory is very similar to
Neisser’s view. But Neumann and Allport’s point retains
its force if we extend the notion of action to include deliberate
mental activities, such as puzzle-solving, for which no bodily
limitations are in play. There is here an “analogy between
practical and theoretical and activity”, which was noted in an
1891 paper by G. F. Stout: </p>

<blockquote>
Thinking is action directed towards intellectual ends. Intellectual
ends are attained by an appropriate combination of movements of
attention just as practical ends are attained by an appropriate
combination of movements of the body. If, therefore, we desire to
explain the process of Thinking, we must clearly determine the nature
of active Attention. (Stout, 1891, p. 23)
</blockquote>

<p>
As Stout and the later generations of action-oriented theorists
indicate, the need to select among several possible sources of
information, and to select among several possible things that might be
done with the information that has then been selected, is a
characteristic of almost all deliberately executed thoughts and
actions, whether those actions are bodily or intellectual. This
ubiquitous need for selectivity has most recently been emphasized in a
series of works by Wayne Wu, where it is referred to as the
“many many problem”(Wu, 2011a, 2014). </p>

<p>
In Wu’s handling of it, the idea that Neumann and Allport
emphasized becomes part of a larger attempt to understand the
essential connections between attention and agency (Wu, 2011b). For
Wu, attention’s role in action is more fundamental than its role
in perception. Stout is not the only precedent for this idea. The same
connection was noted by William James when he claimed that
“Volition is nothing but attention.”, (see Section
 <a href="#WilJamHisConDefThe">1.5</a>,
 above). As with these earlier authors, Wu’s point is not just
that, by treating attention as a purely perceptual phenomenon, we
ignore many of its other instances. Instead Wu wants to suggest that
any division we might attempt to draw between perceptual attention and
the attentional selectivity required by agency would be an artificial
one. Even the involuntary capture of attention by perceptually salient
stimuli should, Wu thinks, be understood as involving a kind of
readiness to act on the things to which we involuntarily attend
(<em>op cit</em>, §3). Wu’s selection-for-action theory of
attention is therefore intended as a step towards a unification of our
philosophical account of ourselves as agents and our philosophical
account of ourselves as perceivers.</p>

<p>
According to selection-for-action type views the function of attention
is not the management of capacity limitations. It is, instead, the
management of capacity <em>excess</em>. It is because we can process
multiple stimuli that we can be distracted by them, and because we can
be distracted by them, not because we cannot process them, that we
need mechanisms of attention to provide selectivity and focus.
Attention, on this view, serves to lend coherence to, and to prevent
interference between, the activity of several components in a system
that has the capacity to handle far more stimuli than those pertaining
to the subject’s current task. Such a view contrasts sharply
with Broadbent’s conception of attentional selectivity as
capacity-bottleneck management. </p>

<h3> <a name="GenPurPri">2.4 General-Purpose Prioritization</a></h3>

<p>
In the tradition that is perpetuated by Wu, the selectivity of
attention is understood as providing a solution to one particular
problem, created by the fact that there are multiple courses of action
that might be taken at any time, with the taking of any one of these
actions requiring the others to be suppressed. The solving of this
particular problem is not the only cognitive need that could be served
by an operation of selectivity, even in a mind without bottlenecks of
processing capacity. The selection-for-action is therefore not the
only alternative to Broadbent’s theory. Other functions for
attentional selectivity might also be proposed.
Alternatively—rather than electing any one of these functions of
cognitive selectivity as being the function that is essentially served
by attention—we might instead characterize attention as a quite
general process of selectivity, recruitable on any of the various
occasions when one thing needs to prioritized over another; whether
this prioritization is required by the presence of a processing
bottleneck, required in order for a particular action-plan to be
executed, or required for some quite different reason. The recent work
of Sebastian Watzl develops the idea that attention might be such a
non-specific process of prioritization (Watzl, 2017).</p>

<p>
In Watzl’s treatment of it, this idea places particular emphasis
on the fact that, just as a binary ‘is greater than’
relation can introduce a partial ordering on a set, so a set of binary
prioritizations can be considered in sum, as introducing a
prioritization structure on the several items that together constitute
one’s mental life. For Watzl, attention is the process by which
one’s life comes to have such a structure.</p>

<p>
Watzl also claims that a mind which lacked such a structure would
therefore be lacking a particular perspective on the world, and so
would not be the mind of a creature with the subjective point of view
that is characteristic of conscious experiences. From this he derives
the claim that every conscious creature is attentive. Carolyn Jennings
has suggested that certain kinds of highly engaged expert performance
may be a counterexample to this (Jennings, 2015).</p>

<h3><a name="PreErrCod">2.5 Precision Optimization Theories and Prediction Error Coding</a></h3>

<p>
The idea that there might be reasons for attentional selection that
have nothing to do with processing bottlenecks has also been a theme
in the work of psychologists hoping to understand perception as a
process of Bayesian inference (Friston <em>et al</em>. 2006,
Summerfield &amp; Egner, 2013), and in the work of those philosophers
who have been influenced by them (Hohwy, 2013; Clark, 2013, 2017).
</p>

<p>
In what has come to be the most developed version of this Bayesian
approach to the mind (Hohwy, 2013, Clark, 2013), cognition as a whole
is understood to be a process of Bayesian updating, in which a
hierarchically-organized series of hypotheses is constantly being
tested, with each hypothesis being updated in the light of evidence
coming from the level below. Advocates of this theory attempt to find
room within this hierarchical framework for all aspects of cognition,
including perception, thought, and action. A central claim of this
theory is that the information that gets passed up through this
hierarchy is encoded in the form of signals representing the
<em>errors</em> in the predictions that are made by the hypotheses at
the hierarchy’s next level up, with the content of one’s
experience at any time being given by whichever hypothesis makes the
least erroneous predictions. (Different versions of the theory use
different techniques to calculate the relative size of these
prediction errors.) Given their commitment to prediction-error coding,
a central claim of these theories is that the role of our sensory
encounter with the world is to provide information about the way in
which our prior hypotheses get things wrong: instead of providing us
with the information that it has started to rain, our senses provide
only the information that it is more rainy than we had expected. </p>

<p>
Advocates of this theory claim that it “allows us to see
attention in a new light and to provide alternative conceptualizations
of its functional role in our overall mental economy” (Hohwy,
2014, p. 191). According to these ‘alternative
conceptions’, attention adjusts the weighting of incoming
prediction error signals, in accordance with their expected
<em>precision</em> (Hohwy, 2012). ‘Precision’ is
understood here in a sense that contrasts precision with accuracy.
‘Accuracy’, in the intended sense, is a measure of the
difference between the value indicated by a signal and the actual
value, whereas ‘precision’ is a measure of the random
fluctuation in that signal, even when the actual input is held
constant. A miscalibrated instrument might, in this sense, be highly
precise, without being especially accurate.</p>

<p>
Various empirical results make it plausible that the brain takes
account of expected precisions, when processing perceptual signals. In
the ventriloquist illusion, for example, it is plausible that
expectations of precision play a role: It is because vision is
expected to give a more precise indication of location than audition
that sounds are heard to come from the location where their source is
apparently seen. Other considerations make it equally plausible that
attention plays a role in accommodating the variations in these
expected precisions, as we move from one context to another. If we
expect that the signal from vision is likely to be a noisy
one—perhaps because a thick fog has started to
descend—then we may place more weight than usual on the
information that is present in the signal coming from audition. It
seems likely that there is a role for attention in bringing about this
change of weighting. It is more controversial to claim, as the
advocates of this theory do, that “attention is nothing but
precision optimization in hierarchical inference.” (Hohwy, 1014,
p.244, citing Feldman &amp; Friston, 2010). Ransom <em>et al</em>.
have suggested that, by taking attention <em>always</em> to be
precision optimization, this theory struggles to account for certain
forms of voluntary attention (Ransom <em>et al</em>. 2017).
 Clark has suggested that this challenge can be met if the
sources of voluntary attention are identified with beliefs, rather
than desires (Clark, 2017).</p>

<h3><a name="ComThe">2.6 Competition Theories and Cognitive Unison</a></h3>

<p>
Like the precision-optimization theories that have been advocated by
Hohwy and Clark, from within the framework of the prediction-error
coding theory, the Coherence theories advocated by Neisser, Neumann,
Allport, and Wu have also suggested that there are <em>functions</em>
for attention other than the management of limitations in processing
capacity. Despite the availability of these non-Broadbentian
conceptions of attention’s function, the Broadbentian idea that
attention’s selectivity serves to manage limitations in
processing capacity continues to be regarded by many psychologists as
incontrovertible. The claim that “Because the visual system does
not have the capacity to process all inputs simultaneously, there must
exist attentional processes that help the visual system select some
inputs” continues to be treated as a platitude of the sort that
can be used as an uncontroversial opening sentence when introducing
one’s research. (The example just given comes from the beginning
of Vecera (2000), but many more examples of the same claim can easily
be found.) </p>

<p>
For those who reject this platitude, and think that the function of
attention is something other than the management of limitations in
processing capacity, it is natural to think that the
<em>mechanisms</em> of attentional selection will be something other
than capacity bottlenecks. </p>

<p>
The clearest non-bottleneck mechanisms for achieving selectivity are
<em>competitions</em>. Since well organized competitions can always
select one winner, however good and however numerous the competitors,
the selectivity of a competitive mechanism need not have anything to
do with bottlenecks, or with any other limitations of processing
capacity. </p>

<p>
Competition based mechanisms for achieving selectivity come in at
least two varieties: In a simple race mechanism each of the
competitors independently completes a process that is comparable,
along some dimension of variation, with the processes completed by the
other competitors. The competitor that achieves the highest value on
the relevant dimension of variation is selected as the winner. In a
<em>struggle</em> the competitors do not just get on with their own
processing in the hope that they will do it better than each of the
other competitors. Instead the active suppression of other competitors
is a part of the process that each competitor carries out. Simple race
models of attention have been proposed (Shibuya and Bundesen, 1988,
Bundesen, 1987) but our best current theories supplement the simple
race mechanism with some components of mutual struggle, or with
additional processes of top-down control (see Bundesen and Habekost,
2008). </p>

<p>
One suggestion for a supplemented-competition mechanism for
attentional selectivity is the biased-competition model, elaborated in
several works by Robert Desimone, John Duncan and John Reynolds. The
biased-competition model accounts for various attention-involving
effects, at the personal and at the sub-personal level, as being
effects that arise from numerous struggles between the different
stimuli that fall within the variously sized receptive fields of
neurons throughout the perceptual processing hierarchy. Each one of
these struggles is hypothesized as being biased, although not settled
outright, by a top-down attention-specific signal (Desimone and
Duncan, 1995, Reynolds and Desimone, 2001).</p>

<p>
We have said that competitions are selective in ways that do not
involve limitations in capacity, and that competition-based theories
of attention’s underlying mechanisms are therefore natural
accompaniments to selection-for-action type views of attention’s
function (Section
 <a href="#CohThe">2.3</a>),
 and perhaps of other views that involve a break from the Broadbentian
view, according to which the function of attention is the management
of capacity limitations. Competition views of attention’s
mechanisms do not, however, require us to take a non-Broadbentian view
of attention’s function. Although the biased competition view
sits naturally with a non-Broadbentian view of attention’s
function, Reynolds and Desimone continue to introduce the biased
competition theory as an attempt to understand attention in
recognizably Broadbentian terms, writing that:</p>

<blockquote>
The visual system is limited in its capacity to process information.
However, it is equipped to overcome this constraint because it can
direct this limited capacity channel to locations or objects of
interest. (2001, 233)
</blockquote>

<p>
Some advocates of the biased competition view emphasize the particular
importance of the top-down biasing signals that the theory postulates
(e.g. Beck and Kastner, 2009, p. 1156), taking the <em>source</em> of
these signals to be the true locus of attentional selection. Others
have suggested that the biased competition theory is better understood
as a theory that refuses to identify any such locus, and that it
should instead be read (as suggested in Duncan’s original
presentation of the theory, (Duncan 1996)) as attributing the
selectivity of attention to the totality of an integrated competition,
involving processes of various sorts at various levels, any part of
which can bias any other (Mole, 2011, §6.7, 2015). </p>

<p>
When it is understood in this second way the biased-competition theory
accords with the proposal that attention should be taken to have a
metaphysical status analogous to that of unison in an orchestra.
According to this view it is always a mistake to identify any one
process as the attention process (or any set of processes as the
attention processes); attention requires the unified activity of
whichever processes happen to be relevant to the subject’s task,
but it does not require any <em>particular</em> processes to be taking
place. Such a view has been advocated in work by Christopher Mole, who
dubs it the ‘Cognitive Unison Theory’. Metaphysically
speaking, such a theory can be understood as a revival of John Locke
and F.H. Bradley’s view that attention is a mode of thinking
(see
 <a href="#LocAttModTho">Section 1.3</a>
 above), and phenomenologically the view has a precedent in
Ribot’s suggestion that attention be identified with
‘monoideism’ (Ribot, 1889, p. 10). It also draws on an
idea that was sketched in a 1964 monograph by Alan White.</p>

<p>
Because operating in unison requires an absence of task-irrelevant
processing, the most straightforward version of the unison theory
entails that attention is a rare achievement, with most cases of
attentiveness involving what is, strictly speaking, only partial or
divided attention. Mole (like Ribot) accepts this implication. Work by
Philipp Koralus has suggested that a view along these lines could give
a more satisfactory treatment of divided attention if the attentive
pursuit of a task were understood to share certain formal properties
with the answering of a question (Koralus, 2014). This
characterization of attention as “the means by which we answer
questions about the environment” has been argued for on
phenomenological and epistemological grounds, by Naomi Eilan (Eilan,
1998). (Eilan credits the thought to Rowland Stout, whose treatment of
it can be found in Chapter 9 §5 of Stout 2006.) Koralus draws on
Hamblin’s 1958 semantics of questions to provide a formal model
of such questioning (Hamblin, 1958).</p>

<h3><a name="SpoThe">2.7 Spotlight Theories</a></h3>

<p>
Whereas <em>bottleneck</em> metaphors have traditionally guided the
theories that attempt to locate the cognitive resources that operate
only on attended stimuli, it has been <em>spotlight</em> metaphors
that have guided the theories that attempt to say which features of a
stimulus determine whether attention is being paid to that stimulus at
any given moment. The idea suggested by the spotlight metaphor is that
a stimulus’s <em>location</em> ultimately determines whether or
not that stimulus receives attention: the point here is not to deny
that one can pay attention to something on account of it being
brightly coloured, or on account of it being interesting. The point
is, instead, that one pays attention to brightly coloured things by
directing one’s attention to the location of those things.</p>

<p>
One can easily see why the spotlight metaphor is appealing. If we are
presented with an array of differently coloured shapes, appearing and
disappearing in various places, then there will be various attention
demanding tasks that we might perform regarding that array. Some tasks
might require us to attend to whatever is going on at the top of the
screen, others might require us to attend to all the red shapes, or to
all the triangles, or to something else. Some of these ways of
attending seem to be more basic than others. It seems, for example,
that attending to things in the top part of the screen might be a
primitive task, whereas attending to the triangles could not be
primitive in the same way: we cannot <em>simply</em> attend to the
triangles. If we want to attend to the triangles, we need first to
work out <em>where</em> the triangles are. If, on the other hand, we
want to attend to the things in the top part of the screen we do not
need to work out whether they are triangles. It is therefore plausible
that when we attend to the triangles we do so <em>by</em> attending to
their locations. In this sense attending on the basis of location
seems to be more basic than attending on the basis of shape.</p>

<p>
The idea that attending to a location is more basic than attending to
a shape might tempt one to think that attending on the basis of
location is absolutely basic, so that attention is always and only
allocated on the basis of location. If that were right then a theory
of the spatial allocation of attention—a theory about the moving
and focusing of an ‘attentional spotlight’—would be
a large and central component in an account of how attention works.
This would be good news for those who want to give a single unified
theory of attention, and it would be good news for the scientific
project of explaining attention more generally, since
attention’s spotlight-like behaviours are some of its best
understood aspects (see Logan, 1996).</p>

<p>
There are reasons to think that location does play a special role in
the allocation of attention, as the spotlight metaphor suggests. But
the role of location in the allocation of attention is probably not as
straightforward as would be required by the most parsimonious of
spotlight-based theories. Location does have a special role to play in
the allocation of attention, but (1) location is not the only property
to have such a role, and (2) the role of location is more complicated
than a simple spotlight metaphor suggests.</p>

<p>
Empirical debates about the direction of the spotlight of attention
have focussed mostly on the second of these points. An important
source of data here is case studies contrasting the different patterns
of attention failure that are shown by different unilateral neglect
patients. Such studies suggest that various frames of reference are
involved in the spatial allocation of attention (Behrmann and Tipper,
1999). This indicates that there is no <em>single</em> map of
locations determining which items get attention: attention is
sometimes allocated on the basis of location in egocentric space,
sometimes on the basis of location in more complex frames of reference
(a point that was among those raised by Allport, in his influential
critique of the Broadbentian debates (see Allport, 1992, p. 197)).</p>

<p>
There are also some well-known experimental effects suggesting that
attention is allocated, not on the basis of straightforward spatial
coordinates, but in ways that are constrained by the distribution of
<em>objects</em> in space. The classic work in this area is John
Duncan’s demonstration that attention shifts more readily
between two locations that fall within the bounds of a single object
than between equidistant locations that are separated by an object
boundary (Duncan, 1984). Equally important here are findings from
experiments using three-dimensional stimuli, and using virtual
three-dimensional displays. These studies suggest that subjects are
unable to differentially attend to depths in an empty space, but that
subjects can shift their attention forwards and backward (to a place
in front of or behind the point that their eyes are fixating) when the
relevant locations are ones in which there are objects (see Yantis,
1998). </p>

<p>
These converging sources of data indicate that the spotlight of
attention is not allocated simply on the basis of coordinates in any
single spatial frame of reference. That is an important finding for
those attempting to localize mechanisms for the allocation of
attention within the brain (since different brain areas differ in
their mapping of space, and in their representation of spatial
information about the objects within it). It has been influential in
leading psychologists to turn away from simple spotlight metaphors. It
should be noted, however, that these findings do not threaten the core
of the idea that was suggested by the spotlight metaphor: The facts
about what a person is attending to might still supervene on the facts
about <em>where</em> that person is attending, even if quite numerous
and sometimes complex factors are responsible for determining which
location that is.</p>

<p>
Other effects are somewhat more damaging for a pure spotlight view,
although they stop short of refuting it entirely. The
more-than-merely-spatial complexity of the way in which attention is
allocated has been nicely demonstrated in a series of experiments by
Dwight Kravitz and Marlene Behrmann (Kravitz and Behrmann, 2011). The
subjects in these experiments have their attention cued by a brief
stimulus that is presented at one end of a shape that is shown on a
computer screen. This shape might be a simple rectangle, a rectangle
with bulbous ends, or a more complex ‘H’ or
‘h’ shape. It is presented alongside another shape, which
in some cases has the same shape and colour, and in some cases is
different. The resulting allocation of attention is then probed by
measuring the reaction times to stimuli that are presented on and near
these objects. Kravitz and Behrmann find that all the different
properties of their stimuli <em>interact</em> to determine the way in
which attention is allocated to the screen on which these stimuli
appear. Most strikingly of all, they find a difference in the
allocation of attention between the case in which the shapes on the
screen are an upper and a lower case ‘H’, and the case in
which the shapes are an upper case H and number 4, even though this
number 4 shape is exactly the same as the lower case h, but presented
upside down. Such findings suggest that attention, even when triggered
by a simple spatial cue, is not allocated merely on the basis of
location, but also on the basis of shape, colour, and arbitrary
learned meaning. </p>

<p>
The discovery that attention can preferentially modulate the
processing of stimuli on account of their colours, shapes, and
meanings does not prevent us from maintaining that the location of a
stimulus has a special role to play in the process by which attention
is allocated to it. More than one line of research in psychology has
sought to identify some one representation in the brain in which items
are encoded in a way that determines the extent to which attention
will be allocated to them. In the longest established of these lines
of research—beginning with the work of Koch and Ullman
(1985)—this representation has been taken to be a <em>map</em>,
in some quite literal sense of ‘map’: the representation
is taken to be one in which every location in some region is
represented, and the representation of these locations is taken to be
in some format that immediately encodes the spatial relations between
them. Every object that is represented is taken to represented as
being at some location, and the properties assigned to these located
objects are taken to determine the likelihood that attention will be
paid to the location that the objects occupy. According to the theory
that postulates these ‘salience maps’, location does play
a unique role in determining the way in which attention is allocated,
despite the fact that other properties contribute to that allocation.
</p>

<p>
In more recent treatments of this idea (Pessoa, 2013) such maps are
taken to include representations, not merely of the objective
properties that give an item salience, but also of subjective
properties, such as emotional-valence and
current-motivational-relevance. The more we think of these maps as
being augmented with additional, non-spatial information, the less
spotlight-like the allocation of attention represented in them will
seem to be, but, provided the representation in question is still
understood to be map-like, location can still be understood to have an
important role (and perhaps even a uniquely important one). </p>

<p>
Debates about the role of such maps, and about the variety of
subjective and objective properties that are represented within them,
may have some wide-ranging philosophical consequences, concerning more
than just the aptness of the spotlight metaphor. Aaron Henry has
suggested that the viability of some recent philosophical theories
depends on the outcome of these debates. Since the recent
philosophical theories of attention have tended to emphasize the role
of agency in attention, they face potential counterexamples from
instances of involuntary attention. Henry suggests that the threat of
such counterexamples can be defused if the mechanisms of involuntary
attention capture are understood to involve attention being allocated
on the basis of a map in which the agent’s priorities for action
are represented (Henry, 2017).</p>

<p>
Although the psychological debates about salience maps are ongoing, an
argument against pure spotlight views can also be made on more
traditional, phenomenological grounds. A pure spotlight theory,
according to which attention is always allocated on the basis of
location, seems unable to account for the sort of case that Hermann
von Helmholtz and William James were concerned with (see section
 <a href="#WilJamHisConDefThe">1.5</a>).
 There is, as their example suggests, a difference between attending
to the pitch of a note and attending to its timbre, or to its
overtones. This difference in attention does not seem to correspond to
a difference in the location attended. Nor does a purely location
based theory of attention allocation seem able to account for the sort
attention that one must pay in order to perform a time-based task,
such as finding out which of a group of shapes appears on screen for
longest. Such temporal aspects of attention have tended to be
neglected, but they are emerging as an important topic in psychology
(see the papers collected in Nobre and Coull, 2010). Some
philosophical work has been devoted to their exploration (see
Phillips, 2011).</p>

<p>
Since some shifts of attention are not shifts in the location
attended, a theory of the factors that determine which locations a
subject is attending to cannot tell us the whole story about the
allocation of attention. It might nonetheless be a central component
in a theory of some of attention’s forms (see Wright and Ward,
2008).</p>

<h3><a name="MotThe">2.8 Motor Theories</a></h3>

<p>
Work in which electrodes are used <em>in vivo</em> to stimulate areas
of the macaque brain known to be associated with eye-movement
coordination has provided compelling evidence for the existence of an
anatomical overlap between brain areas involved in eye-movement
control and those involved in determining which stimuli elicit the
strongest responses in visual cortex. There is evidence that this
anatomical fact has some functional significance. One suggestive
finding is that the links between frontal eye-movement control areas
and attention-like effects in occipital visual areas are spatially
specific: An electrode that is placed so that it elicits an eye
movement to a particular part of the visual field when activated at
one level will, if activated at a lower level, elicit changes in
neural responsiveness that are exactly similar to the changes seen
when attention is shifted to that same location (Moore and Armstrong,
2003, Armstrong and Moore, 2007).</p>

<p>
These facts are suggestive of a ‘motor theory’ of
attention, according to which the processes underpinning attention
are, in at least some cases, truncated versions of the processes
underpinning the coordination of movements of sensory orientation.</p>

<p>
The central idea of such a motor theory is that “the program for
orienting attention either overtly or covertly is the same, but in the
latter case the eyes are blocked at a certain peripheral stage”
(Rizzolatti <em>et al</em>, 1987, 37).  Advocates of motor
theories (such as Moore, Armstrong and Fallah, 2003) have
characterised their work as a revival of the picture that Alexander
Bain proposed at the end of the nineteenth century. Bain (as we saw in
Section
 <a href="#WilJamHisConDefThe">1.5</a>,
 above) identified attention with truncated versions of the
motor-control processes that typically bring about attention’s
behavioural manifestations — processes “stopping short of
the actual movement performed by the organ” (Bain, 1888,
371).</p>

<p>
These versions of the motor theory should be distinguished from
theories that regard attention and motor control as intimately linked,
but that place no emphasis on the fact that the motor control
processes that have been implicated in attention are processes that
control the movement of <em>sensory</em> organs. In these theories
(which are natural but not obligatory concomitants of the
‘selection-for-action’ views discussed in
 <a href="#CohThe">section 2.5</a>)
 attention stands in an intimate relation to motor control more
generally. One line of experimental evidence in support of such a
connection comes from work by Heiner Deubel and his collaborators, in
which various changes to the way in which an object figures in action
are shown to have an attention-indicating influence on the perceptual
discrimination of stimuli that are presented on or near that object.
In one striking example of this Deubel and Schneider found that the
way in which attention is allocated to the space around a 6.5cm wooden
X shape depended on whether the subject was reaching with her left
hand to grasp the shape by the top-left and bottom right arms, or
reaching with her right hand to grasp the shape by the arms at its
top-right and bottom left (Deubel &amp; Schneider, 2004). In each case
attention was allocated not only to the shape, but to the
to-be-gripped parts of it. For other evidence of interactions between
attention and action-targeting, see (Tipper, Howard, and Houghton,
1998). </p>

<p>
Motor theories and other action-based theories give a plausible
account of some of attention’s instances, but they have
limitations that prevent them form applying with full generality:
Since movement of the eyes, or of the limbs, is always movement <em>to
a location</em> motor theories will struggle to account for the
allocation of attention on the basis of anything other than location.
They therefore face the limitations that we saw when considering pure
spotlight theories, of being unable to account for shifts in attention
that do not correspond to differences in the location attended. Nor is
it clear how motor theories should be applied to spatial attention in
those sensory modalities where the orientation of the sense organs is
less straightforward than it is in the visual case. The motor theory
does, nonetheless, provide a plausible and well-supported account of
the location based variety of visual attention displayed in typical
attention-lab experiments. </p>

<p>
The success of motor theories in accounting for the sorts of attention
that are found in some typical attention-lab experiments can be given
either an optimistic or a pesimistic interpretation. The optimistic
interpretation sees the motor theory as providing a successful account
of the processing underpinning some of attention’s simpler and
more central varieties. The pessimistic interpretation sees the motor
theory as revealing a problem with our usual experimental paradigms.
In typical laboratory tasks subjects direct their attention to
different parts of their visual field while keeping their eyes fixated
on a central spot. The behavioural signatures of attention in such
tasks are usually reductions in reaction time to the attended stimuli.
The neural correlates of these behavioural signatures are certain
biases as to which stimuli most strongly drive the neural circuitry
that processes them. The central finding of the motor-theorists is
that these neural and behavioural effects can result from attenuated
versions of the activity responsible for directing eye movements. The
pessimistic interpretation of this finding is as revealing that the
signs that were traditionally taken to indicate the direction of
attention are actually no more than consequences of the truncated
eye-movements that our experimental paradigms induce. If that is right
then the phenomenon studied in attention labs may not be the
psychologically important one that it has been taken for.</p>

<h2><a name="ExpRolForAtt">3. Explanatory Roles for Attention</a></h2>

<h3><a name="AttCon">3.1 Attention and Consciousness</a></h3>

<h4>3.1.1 Is Attention Necessary for Consciousness?</h4>

<p>
The question of whether attention is necessary for consciousness can
be answered in various ways. One answer is given by those who think
that lots of unattended items appear in consciousness. A different
answer is given by those who think that only some unattended items
figure in consciousness. A third answer is given if we think that
unattended items figure in consciousness only in special
circumstances. There is some evidence that, independently of any
philosophical commitments, people differ as to which of these views
they find plausible (Schwitzgebel, 2007). There are also views in
which attention is necessary for consciousness in the sense that every
conscious creature must be an attentive one. Such views need not
entail that attention to an object is necessary for consciousness of
that object.</p>

<p>
At one extreme end of this spectrum is the view according to which
attention is strictly necessary for consciousness, so that the things
to which we are not paying attention do not figure in our
consciousness at all. A number of psychologists endorse this view
(e.g. Cohen <em>et al</em>. 2012), as do some philosophers (e.g.
Prinz, 2012, Carruthers, 2015, Montemayor &amp; Haladjian, 2015).
There is some historical precedent for this view in James’s
remark, at the beginning of his chapter on attention, that “my
experience is what I agree to attend to”(James, 1890, ch. 11),
and in Kames’ remark that “Attention is requisite even to
the simple act of seeing” (see Sect
 <a href="#EigNinCenAttPerActRefTho">1.4</a>,
 above).</p>

<p>
The evidence that is proffered in support of the view that attention
is strictly necessary for consciousness comes from a range of
experiments showing the surprising extent to which subjects are
ignorant of the items to which they have paid no attention. In Mack
and Rock’s ‘inattentional blindness’ paradigm, for
example, subjects who are given an attention demanding task pertaining
to a stimulus in one part of the visual field frequently fail to
notice shapes or words that are flashed up elsewhere (Mack &amp; Rock,
1998). In Rensink <em>et al</em>.’s ‘change
blindness’ paradigm subjects need to see an alternating pair of
pictures between ten and twenty times before they can identify a large
but narratively inconsequential difference between them (Rensink
<em>et al</em>., 1997, Rensink, 2002). In the most memorable of these
experiments a large number of subjects fail to notice the central
appearance of a man in a gorilla suit when their attention is taken up
with the business of counting the number of passes made by one of two
teams in a concurrent basketball-type game (Simons &amp; Chabdris,
1999).</p>

<p>
No single one of these experiments can establish the claim that
attention is always necessary for consciousness—that claim is a
universally quantified one, and is not entailed by any one of its
instances. Nor is it clear that what we see in these experiments
really are instances in which unattended objects drop out of
consciousness altogether. The subject’s ignorance of the
gorilla’s appearance, for example, is compatible with its being
the case that the presence of the gorilla <em>does</em> make a
phenomenal difference for the inattentive subject. To explain the
subject’s ignorance we need only say that any phenomenal
difference that the unattended gorilla makes is a difference that the
subject is unable to use in answering the experimenter’s
question about whether anything strange happened in the scene. It may
be that it is a phenomenal difference that is epistemically unusable
because it is immediately forgotten (see Wolfe, 1998) or it may,
alternatively, be a difference that is unusable because it is too
unstructured and inchoate to be epistemically mobilizable. In that
case the effect of inattention would be inattentional
<em>agnosia</em>, rather than inattentional <em>blindness</em> (see
Simons, 2000).</p>

<p>
Absolute amnesia for unattended items, or thoroughgoing agnosia for
them, may be indistinguishable from inattentional blindness, both
behaviourally and from the point of view of retrospective
introspection. For that reason it is not a straightforward matter for
the advocates of any of these interpretations of the inattentional
blindness and change blindness effects to rule out the alternative
interpretations. Subpersonal sources of data (such as experiments
using neuroimaging) may be the only sources of data that we have to go
on. (See Rees, <em>et al</em>. 1999 for an example in which fMRI data
is used to argue against the amnesia interpretation of inattentional
blindness effects involving written words).</p>

<p>
It is only narratively insignificant differences that go unnoticed in
the change-blindness paradigm. The change blindness effects might
therefore be taken as showing, not that there is no consciousness in
the absence of attention, but that there <em>is</em> consciousness in
the absence of attention, the contents of which are restricted to the
scene’s overall gist. There are difficulties in adjudicating
between these two interpretations experimentally. When the features of
gist do seem to be perceived, in the apparent absence of attention,
the defender of the claim that attention is necessary for
consciousness may reply by claiming that attention <em>is</em> paid to
these items, either in a dispersed, non-focal way (Prettyman, 2013),
or because these features are briefly and involuntarily
attention-catching (Prinz, 2012, p. 119). Without an experimental
operationalization of complete inattention, these rival
interpretations cannot be ruled out, with the result that empirical
debates about the extent of consciousness beyond attention are
currently in something of deadlock, with experimenters being able to
claim only to have demonstrated perception in the ‘near
absence’ of attention (Li <i>et al</i>., 2002, Reddy <i>et
al</i>., 2004, Reddy <i>et al</i>., 2006), and so providing only weak
support to the hypothesis that attention and consciousness are
dissociable (Koch &amp; Tsuchiya, 2007).</p>

<p>
The methodological puzzle that we face when trying to settle the
dispute between different interpretations of the inattentional
blindness effects raises the question of whether our commonsense
beliefs about the conscious status of unattended items are well
founded. Such beliefs seem to vary from person to person
(Schwitzgebel, 2007), and to vary with certain features of the context
in which they are probed (De Brigard, 2010). To the extent that we
find it natural to suppose that unattended items do figure in
consciousness, this may simply being owing to a version of the
‘refrigerator-light illusion’: If our reason for believing
that we are conscious of the things to which we pay no attention is a
reason that depends on our finding that we are conscious of those
things whenever we check on them, then that belief is on shaky ground.
A checking procedure cannot provide us with good evidence about the
status of unattended items since the act of checking is itself an act
that involves a shift in attention to the things checked.</p>

<p>
Since a direct checking procedure is ruled out we need a more
theory-driven way of assessing the dispute between those who claim
that the consequence of not attending to an item is that the item
drops out of conscious experience and those who claim that inattention
simply puts the subject in a poor epistemic position vis-à-vis
the unattended items. The current state of our theories is such that
it would be premature to try to settle this dispute by an inference to
the best explanation since neither side of the dispute has a theory of
the attention/consciousness relation that has been worked out to a
degree that would allow the different explanations to be compared. We
can, however, see some of the considerations that the two sides in
this debate might invoke. Those who endorse the idea that attention is
necessary for consciousness can point to the fact that this view
accords well with theories in which attention features prominently in
the explanation of consciousness (e.g. Prinz, 2005, 2012). They may
also be able to develop arguments based on theories of the way in
which consciousness and attention evolved (Montemayor &amp; Haladjian,
2015). Those who prefer the epistemic-deficit interpretation of the
inattentional blindness effects (Mole, 2011, §7.3.7) can point to
the fact that that interpretation flows naturally from the view
according to which attention to an item provides the sort of
acquaintance that is needed for the use of a demonstrative concept
that refers to that item (a view advocated by Campbell, 2002, and
discussed in section
 <a href="#AttDemRef">3.2</a>
 below): If attention to the gorilla is necessary for the forming of a
demonstrative-involving thought (such as ‘That’s a
gorilla’) then there is an immediate explanation, consistent
with the idea that unattended items nonetheless feature in the
subject’s consciousness, for the fact that inattentive subjects
are unable to answer questions such as ‘Was there a
gorilla?’. </p>

<p>
The difficulty in the case of the unnoticed gorilla is to discern
whether unattended items are present to consciousness, but not as
individuated items to which a demonstrative reference could be
directed, or whether those unattended items are instead absent from
consciousness altogether. Part of this difficulty originates in the
fact that, although most people give no attention to the gorilla, they
could attend to him, and would have done so if anything had prompted
them to do so. More data may be available, both to introspection and
to laboratory measurement, in cases where our failure to attend has
some more systemic explanation. Ned Block has suggested that one such
case is found in our perception of peripheral stimuli, when these are
subject to the phenomenon of ‘identity crowding’ (Block,
2013a). An individual ‘T’ or ‘F’ can be seen
reasonably clearly, even when presented in a peripheral part of the
visual field. But if additional characters are presented alongside
this individual character, then the properties of these charaacters
are prone to perceptul confusion. Attention seems to bind together
properties from all of the characters in the vicinity of the one
individual that we are trying to pick out. It therefore seems that, in
the perceptual periphery, attention cannot be directed onto a region
that fits an individual character tightly. Due to this
‘crowding’ effect, individual letters or shapes become
impossible to individuate from the others with which they are
clustered, when they fall in parts of the visual field that are
outside of the high-definition centre. The properties of objects that
are crowded in this way can nonetheless be seen, and the fact that
several items are present can be reliably reported. On the basis of
empirical and introspective considerations, Block claims that, even in
cases where the crowded characters share all of their features with
the others by which they are crowded, these crowded characters are
consciously discriminated from their surroundings. He claims that
these characters figure as objects in consciousness. Since attention
cannot be allocated to anything more fine-grained than the crowd of
which these characters are a part, these characters are not objects to
which attention is paid. Block therefore takes ‘identity
crowding’ to give counterexamples to the claim that we are
conscious of objects only when paying attention to them. </p>

<p>
His claim that the crowded character figures in consciousness as an
individuated objects, rather than as a part of some feature-rich
texture, has been contested (Taylor, 2013, Richards, 2013). In
response, Block has suggested that an inference the best explanation
of several related phenomena favours his interpretation of the effect
(Block, 2013b).</p>

<p>
Inference to the best explanation is always a hazardous business,
especially in the vicinity of an explantory gap. In the interpretation
of identity crowding, as in the interpretation of inattentional
blindness, the inescapability of abductive considerations suggests
that our answer to the question about whether attention is necessary
for consciousness may have to wait until we have a better
understanding of the relation of attention to demonstrative reference
(of the sort that is involved in thinking ‘That’s a
gorilla’), and of attention’s role in epistemology more
generally.</p>

<h4>3.1.2 Is Attention Sufficient for Consciousness?</h4>

<p>
In addition to disputes about whether we are conscious of
<em>only</em> those things to which we attend there are also disputes
about whether we are conscious of <em>everything</em> to which we
attend. If we were then a complete theory of attention might be given
by giving an account of the way in which attention modulates
consciousness.</p>

<p>
Declan Smithies has argued in favour of a position according to which
everything that is attended to is consciously attended to. He claims
that all instances of attention must be consciousness-involving, on
the grounds that (1) all such instances must have a connection with
their subject’s ‘rational-access’ to the contents of
her experience, and (2) there is no connection to rationality in the
case of processing that is wholly unconscious. Smithies’ view
is, therefore, that attention is essentially involved in the
‘rational-access’ of consciously experienced contents
(Smithies, 2011). The nature of any such connection between attention
to experience and the justificatory force of that experience is itself
a source of ongoing controversy: Johannes Roesller has argued that
McDowell’s theory of perceptual experience’s reason-giving
force cannot account for the role played by attention in experience
(Roessler, 2011); Susanna Siegel and Nicholas Silins have claimed that
the doxastic influence of an experience can be an instance of rational
access even when the experience is not attended (Siegel &amp; Silins,
2014); Terry Horgan and Matjaž Potrč have argued that the
justification of beliefs by experience must outrun both the contents
of attention and the contents of consciousness (Horgan and Potrč
2011). Here, as above, one’s understanding of attention and
one’s understanding of epistemology constrain one another, and
may provide a theory-driven route to theses about the possibility of
unconscious attentiveness.</p>

<p>
The claim that all attention is conscious attention sits uneasily with
certain empirical results indicating that those psychological
processes that are responsible for the effects that are usually taken
to be signatures of attention are processes that do not require
consciousness for their operation. In an experiment by Yi Jiang <em>et
al</em>., (2006), for example, subjects are presented with
attention-attracting stimuli in such a way that, thanks to an
arrangement of mirrors, these stimuli are given to just one eye.
Because a more vivid stimulus is presented to the other eye, and
because this more vivid stimulus wins the competition for
consciousness that occurs in such cases of binocular rivalry, subjects
do not consciously experience the less vivid stimulus. The
unconsciously processed stimuli in these experiments include erotic
photographs. These unseen erotic photographs do seem to elicit shifts
of attention, as evidenced by the fact that the consciously
experienced stimuli presented in the same location as these unseen
attention-grabbers are more accurately responded to in an attention
demanding task (involving detecting the orientation of gabor-patches).
One striking finding from Jiang <em>et al</em>.’s experiments is
that the way in which the unseen photographs attract and repel the
attention depends on the sexual orientation of the experimental
participants. </p>

<p>
A natural interpretation of these experiments is as showing that the
erotic pictures capture the subject’s attention, despite the
fact that the subject has no conscious experience of them. This
suggests—although it does not conclusively demonstrate
—that one may be attending to a thing without being conscious of
it. The same conclusion is suggested by a quite different set of
experiments involving blindsighted subjects. In these experiments we
see that, even though the blindsighted subject has no experience of
cues presented in his scotoma, those cues can elicit the same
facilitation of processing and reduction of reaction times that are
usually taken to be the signatures of attention (Kentridge &amp;
Heywood, 2001, Kentridge <em>et al</em>., 2004). </p>

<p>
One complaint against both these lines of evidence is that they do not
enable us to distinguish between attention to a thing and attention
that is merely directed to a part of space, and so cannot demonstrate
attention <em>to a thing</em> in the absence of consciousness of it
(Mole, 2008a). Research by Liam Norman, Charles Heywood and Robert
Kentridge goes some way to addressing this complaint. Norman, Heywood
and Kentridge present normal subjects with a screen showing an array
of small, rapidly flickering Gabor patches. Objects the boundaries of
which were defined by changes in the orientations of these patches are
not consciously experienced: Subjects merely see the whole screen as a
flickering array of patches. Cues that direct the attention of these
subjects nonetheless do seem to draw attention to these unseen
objects, as indicated by differences in the response times to items
that are subsequently presented in and outside of their boundaries
(Norman, Heywood &amp; Kentridge, 2013).</p>

<p>
Such experiments show that there is an influence operating between
unconscious processing and the direction of attention, and perhaps
indicate that attention can be paid to objects that make no showing in
conscious experience (Mole, 2014a). They therefore place a limit on
the closeness of the relationship that can be claimed to exist between
attention and consciousness. </p>

<p>
The disputes about whether attention is sufficient for consciousness,
necessary for consciousness, or both, are related to questions about
attention’s metaphysics. The claim that attention is not
sufficient for consciousness is typically made as part of a defence of
the idea that attention and consciousness are underpinned by two
distinct brain processes (see, e.g., Koch and Tsuchiya, 2007). The
claim that attention is sufficient for consciousness but not necessary
for it is required by those who, like Locke (see Section
 <a href="#LocAttModTho">1.3</a>),
 think that attention is a mode of conscious thinking without any
particular process that serves as its underpinning. The claim that
attention is sufficient for consciousness and necessary for it is
required by those who think that the process by which things come to
consciousness is identical to the process by which attention is
allocated (Prinz, 2005, 2011). </p>

<h4>3.1.3 How Does Attention Modulate Phenomenology?</h4>

<p>
Whether or not one thinks that attention is always responsible for
bringing things into our consciousness, there are good reasons to
think that changes in the direction of our attention can make some
difference to the character of conscious experience. Phenomenologists
and Gestalt psychologists have characterized this difference in
various ways, with Maurice Merleau-Ponty emphasizing the way in which
attention can configure the figure ground structure of space
(Merleau-Ponty, 1962, Chp.3–4), and Aron Gurwitsch (Gurwitsch,
1964) elaborating a theory in which the configuration given by
attention has a more complex, three-part structure (explained in
Arvidson, 2006). In the second half of his 2017 book, Sebastian Watzl
develops a similar suggestion, on the basis of his claim that the role
of attention is to impose a priority structure on our mental lives
(see above
 <a href="#GenPurPri">§2.4</a>),
 (Watzl, 2011, 2017).</p>

<p>
There is currently some dispute about whether the differences made by
shifts of attention can be adequately characterized as differences in
the <em>content</em> of the attended experience. If, as Watzl
contends, they cannot, then phenomena of attention create a serious
difficulty for any fully general attempts to explain the character of
conscious experience by reference to the contents represented in it
(Chalmers, 2004), although such explanations might still be viable in
circumscribed domains (Speaks, 2010).</p>

<p>
A series of studies by Marisa Carrasco and her collaborators have
examined the influence of attention on the character of conscious
experience. These have revealed that the phenomenal differences
produced by shifts of attention include differences of perceived
brightness, contrast, and saturation of colours, but do not include
differences of hue (Carrasco, Ling &amp; Read, 2004, Fuller &amp;
Carrasco, 2006). Ned Block has suggested that these perceived
differences should not be thought of as differences in the
<em>content</em> of experience, since to characterize them in that way
would be to take it that attending to an item creates an illusion as
to its brightness, contrast, etc.; a result which he takes to be
implausible. He therefore takes Carrasco’s findings as
indicating an aspect of experience that cannot be accounted for with a
theory of that experience’s content (Block 2010). </p>

<p>
There have been similar disputes, transacted on the basis of more
introspective considerations, concerning the effects of attention on
the perception of ambiguous figures. In response to some
considerations that were first raised by Fiona Macpherson (Macpherson,
2006), Bence Nanay has suggested that the effects of attention on the
perception of such figures can be explained by those who maintain that
every difference in consciousness is a difference of content (Nanay,
2010, 2011). His contention is that the effects of attention on the
character of conscious experience be understood as including a
modulation of the specificity of an experience’s content, in
which the representations of determinable properties are made more or
less determinate. The issues here are similar to those concerning the
way in which blur should be thought to enter into visual experience
(see “Representational Theories of Conciousness” esp.
 <a href="../consciousness-representational/#Cou">§4.4</a>).</p>
 
<h3><a name="AttDemRef">3.2 Attention and Demonstrative Reference</a></h3>

<p>
Consciousness is one philosophically puzzling mental phenomenon that
has been thought to be related to attention in ways that may prove to
be explanatorily revealing. <em>Demonstrative reference</em> is
another. One advocate of the idea that attention contributes to the
explanation of demonstrative reference is John Campbell, who writes
that: </p>

<blockquote>
… the notion of conscious attention to an object has an
explanatory role to play: it has to explain how it is that we have
knowledge of the reference of a demonstrative. (2002, 45)
</blockquote>

<p>
A similar idea was explored in the manuscript on Theory of Knowledge
that Bertrand Russell abandoned (under the influence of Wittgenstein)
in the summer in 1913. In that work Russell gives the following
statement of the idea that reference to particulars requires attention
to them: </p>

<blockquote>
At any moment of my conscious life, there is one object (or at most
some very small number of objects) to which I am attending. All
knowledge of particulars radiates out from this object. (1913, 40)
</blockquote>

<p>
In support of the Russellian claim that there is an explanatory
relation between attention and demonstrative reference, Campbell
develops two lines of thought.</p>

<p>
The first line of thought comes from reflection on examples concerning
the requirements that have to be met in order to understand
demonstrative expressions in conversational contexts where one of the
participants in the conversation uses expressions such as ‘that
woman’, but where various women are present, all of whom are
possible referents for this demonstrative. Knowing which women is
meant, according to Campbell, requires attending to the woman in
question and knowing that it is to her that the speaker was attending.
This is intended to show more than just that the direction of the
speaker’s attention is a possible source of evidence for what
that speaker means. It is intended as showing that attention and
reference stand in a particularly intimate relationship—a
relationship that Campbell characterizes by saying that
‘knowledge of the reference of a demonstrative is provided by
conscious attention to the object’ (p. 22).</p>

<p>
The second line of thought that Campbell develops in support of the
view that attention explains demonstrative reference is a line of
thought pertaining to deductive arguments in which the premises refer
to items that are picked out by demonstratives: Arguments such as
‘(1) That is F. (2) That is G. Therefore (3) That is F and
G’. Campbell’s thought here is that such arguments depend
for their validity on there being no possibility of equivocating on
the meaning of ‘that’, as it occurs in the two separate
premises. Such arguments can only figure in rationally-entitling
reasoning so long as there is a single fixing of the referent of
‘that’ in both premises. This reference fixing, Campbell
thinks, is achieved if and only if there is no redirection of
attention between the premises. Again this is intended to show more
than just that there is some causal or evidential relation between
attending and referring. It is intended to show that the role played
by attention in fixing the reference of a demonstrative is analogous
to the role played by a Fregean Sense in fixing the reference of a
proper name (Campbell, 2002, Chapter 5).</p>

<p>
The explanatory approach that Campbell advocates, and that Russell
considered, has traditionally been thought to suffer from a problem of
circularity. This problem was urged by Peter Geach in <em>Mental
Acts</em> (1957). Geach considers the suggestion that we can use
attention to explain our ability to make reference to the things that
we perceive, but thinks that no such suggestion can provide a genuine
explanation of reference because:</p>

<blockquote>
… it is quite useless to say the relevant sense-perceptions
must be attended to, either this does not give a sufficient condition,
or else “attended to” is a mere word for the very relation
of judgment to sense perception that requires analysis. (1957, 64)
</blockquote>

<p>
Geach’s threat of circularity can be avoided if an independently
given theory of how attention is constituted can be shown to
illuminate the way in which reference is fixed by it. Imogen Dickie
has attempted to show just this. In a 2011 paper Dickie shows that
cognitive psychology provides us with a theory of the role played by
attention in tracking objects over time. She suggests that such a
theory can be used to account for the way in which attending to an
object removes any knowledge-defeating component of luck from our
inferences involving it, and so establishes the attended object as a
possible topic of demonstrative thoughts (Dickie, 2011, 2015). This
treatment of attention exemplifies some of the central themes in
Dickie’s more general attempt to explain how thoughts come to be
about ordinary objects (and so how singular terms come to refer to
those objects). The explanation that she offers is one in which a
thought comes to be about a thing when the justificatory practices in
which that thought figures are anchored to the object in question (in
a sense of ‘anchoring’ that Dickie spells out in detail
(Dickie, 2015)). </p>

<p>
Whether or not a theory of attention can be turned into a non-circular
explanation of reference, the idea that attention and reference are
related does seem to be an idea that casts light on what goes on when
we understand referring expressions. Campbell’s examples suggest
that what we attend to and what we refer to are often the same, and
there is some empirical evidence, coming from developmental
psychology, indicating that attention-related abilities play a crucial
role in the infant’s development of an understanding of its
caregiver’s demonstrative use (see
 <a href="#AttOthMin">Section3.3</a>).
 The lesson that has been drawn from this work in developmental
psychology is not only about the comprehension of linguistic
expressions.  It is also a lesson about our grasp on directly
referring thoughts. The idea – here as in the work of Dickie and
Campbell – is not only that attention contributes to our
production and comprehension of linguistic expressions that have
particular referents, but that it also contributes to the
establishment of those referents as the contents of our thoughts. </p>

<h3><a name="AttOthMin">3.3 Attention and Other Minds</a></h3>

<p>
There are empirical results, coming from developmental psychology,
which are suggestive of an intimate link between the development of
various abilities related to attention and the development of various
capacities that are involved in understanding the mental states that
are being expressed in interactions between the infant and caregiver.
</p>

<p>
An ability to appreciate what others are attending to appears to be a
crucial stage in the normal infant’s development towards
understanding of the fact that its caregivers’ utterances have
referential intentions behind them. More generally, the development of
capacities for attention are important milestones in some
distinctively human aspects of infant development (Moore and Dunham,
1995). There is a distinctive developmental pathway in which normal
human infants develop an ability and a willingness to attend to the
mother, an ability and willingness to attend to the thing that she is
attending to, and then, most importantly, an ability and willingness
to enter into episodes in which there is a third object that mother
and child are attending to <em>jointly</em>, with mutual understanding
of the fact that their attention is shared (Reddy, 2010, Trevarthen,
2011). In these episodes infants and caregivers employ complex cues,
involving speech, gaze-following, and pointing.</p>

<p>
There is good evidence that the child’s progression along this
pathway is intimately related to the develop of abilities to respond
appropriately to the mental states of others, and to the development
of the ability to acquire new vocabulary on the basis of an
understanding of what the words used by its mother refer to. A recent
longitudinal study suggests that the earlier stages in this pathway
are predictive of the age at which infants reach the later ones
– thereby providing some evidence for the hypothesis that this
sequence is a causal one – with the mastery at 12 months of
pointing as a means to direct the attention of others being predictive
of false belief understanding at the age of 50 months, even when
factors relating to temperament and language are factored out (Sodian
&amp; Kristen-Antonow, 2015). Another source of evidence comes from
the fact that the arrested development of these attention-involving
abilities is a revealing marker of the impairments suffered by
autistic children (Kanner, 1943, Hobson &amp; Hobson, 2011), and from
the fact that a lack of such abilities is perhaps related to
limitations in the mental-state attribution abilities of non-human
primates, although this last claim is more controversial (Call &amp;
Tomasello, 2005).</p>

<p>
Some progress has been made towards extracting philosophical lessons
from the empirical work indicating that attention has an explanatory
role to play here (see, for several examples, the papers collected in
Eilan, <em>et al</em>. 2005, Seemann 2011). One of the points at which
philosophical difficulties arise is in characterizing the
<em>sharedness</em> of the attention that is implicated in this
developmental trajectory. Christopher Peacocke has argued that the way
in which joint attention episodes are shared involves a kind of
reciprocal recognition of the other’s recognition of one’s
own attention, and so that it involves a kind of mutual openness that
is analogous to the openness of ‘common knowledge’, as
that notion figures in philosophical analyses of communication and
convention (See
 ‘<a href="../convention/">Convention</a>’).
 Since joint attention is achieved by young children, its achievement
cannot plausibly be thought to make any sophisticated intellectual
demands. Peacocke therefore argues that awareness of reciprocated
openness must be more fundamental than the intellectual achievement of
common knowledge, and should instead be understood as a variety of
<em>perceptual</em> awareness that makes common knowledge possible
(Peacocke, 2005). John Campbell shares Peacocke’s view of joint
attention as being a perceptual phenomenon, as opposed to a phenomenon
that is achieved when one’s perception is reflected on in a
certain way, but Campbell differs from Peacocke in taking the person
with whom attention is shared to be fellow <em>subject</em> of the
joint experience, not an object who figures in the <em>content</em> of
the experience that each joint-attender individually has (Campbell,
2002, Ch. 8). </p>

<h3><a name="AttKno">3.4 Attention and Knowledge</a></h3>

<p>
The apparent links between attention and demonstrative reference (see
section
 <a href="#AttDemRef">3.2</a>)
 and attention and knowledge of other minds (see section
 <a href="#AttOthMin">3.3</a>)
 might be special instances of a more general connection between
attention and the making of epistemic moves. A general connection of
that sort may have been what Descartes had in mind when he suggested
that attention to clear and distinct ideas is a necessary condition
for those ideas to realize their special epistemic potential (see
Section
 <a href="#DesAttEpi">1.1</a>).
 It might also be what Stewart had in mind when he suggested that
“Some attention [is] necessary for any act of memory
whatever” (see Section
 <a href="#EigNinCenAttPerActRefTho">1.4</a>).
 Kant’s anthropological writings also cast attention in a
crucial epistemic role, as explaining the control that one can exert
over representations in thought and in imagination, where this perhaps
includes the kind of imagination that Kant thinks is involved in
making one’s experiences into experiences of an objective
spatiotemporal world (Merrittt &amp; Valaris, 2017).</p>

<p>
Although these philosophers have tended to frame the idea in a way
that reflects their other theoretical commitments, some version of the
idea that attention is always involved in the making of epistemic
moves can be made pre-theoretically plausible. The inattentional
blindness experiments, in which subjects are visually presented with
large changes while attending to something else, show that inattentive
subjects can fail to notice all sorts of perceivable things that
attentive subjects find obvious. Something exactly similar seems to be
true in the a priori domain. Just as no item is so large, so central,
and so well lit that no conscious and sighted observer could miss it,
so there is no step in reasoning that is so simple, so compelling and
so obvious that every thinker, whether attentive or inattentive, can
be expected to recognise it. The inattentional blindness effects show
that there are attentional demands that a thinker has to meet before
his perceptual encounter with things can provide knowledge of them. It
is plausible that there are similar attentional demands that have to
be met before the thinker’s grasp of a thought gives her a
justified belief in the thought’s consequences.</p>

<p>
In both the a priori case and the perceptual case the acquisition of
knowledge seems to require attention, and in both cases this
requirement seems to be a <em>practical</em> one. It may be that
knowledge of some propositions is required if one’s experience
with a gorilla is to provide one with knowledge of the gorilla’s
presence. The propositions here would be of a sort that could serve as
a major premise in an inference by which one’s perceptual
experience was interpreted, but the requirement on gaining knowledge
from experience cannot be that one must be bearing such propositions
in mind. The same is true in the a priori domain. What is required
before an a priori entitlement can be recognized cannot be that one
has to entertain some prior knowledge of a proposition from which the
entitlement can be deduced. To suppose that such occurent
propositional knowledge is what is necessary for such moves would be
to embark on the regress set by Lewis Carroll’s tortoise to
Achilles (Carroll, 1895). What epistemic move-making requires is not
knowledge of a proposition. The thing that it requires is the right
sort of active attention.</p>

<p>
The attentional requirements that have to be met before one can
acquire knowledge from experience or recognize an a priori entitlement
are not requirements merely for alertness. They are not captured
merely by saying that, in order to gain knowledge, the thinker has to
pay <em>some</em> attention to the relevant ideas. A thinker may be
attending to a syllogism, but, if he is attending to its rhythm, he
may still be unable to see that the conclusion follows. A non-question
begging characterisation of the attentional requirements of knowledge
acquisition in general would be an important contribution to
epistemology. Current work on attention, focussing as it does on
attention as a perceptual phenomenon, may only give us a part of the
general theory that we need. Work on purely intellectual forms of
attention continues to be scarce.</p>

<h3><a name="VolAct">3.5 Attention and Voluntary Action</a></h3>

<p>
Attention’s involvement in voluntary <em>action</em> is a lot
harder to study in a controlled way than is its involvement in
perception. The theories of attention emerging from experimental
psychology have, as a result, focussed almost exclusively on
attention’s perceptual instances. In this respect they contrast
with theories that were developed in the period before psychology and
philosophy split, in which the action-involving aspects of attention
were much more prominent. William James, for example, suggests in the
<em>Principles of Psychology</em> that ‘volition is nothing but
attention’ (James, 1890 p. 424), and at one time (in what might
be read as an anticipation of the competition based theories discussed
 above<a href="#ComThe">§2.6</a>)
 he proposed that “Attention, belief, affirmation, and motor
volition, are […] four names for an identical process,
incidental to the conflict of ideas alone, the survival of one in
spite of the opposition of the others.” (1880).</p>

<p>
The issues surrounding attention’s relationship to the
voluntariness of action are parallel to some of the issues surrounding
attention’s relationship to the consciousness of perception. It
seems natural to think that attention is necessary for finely tuned
behaviours, much as it seems necessary for the perception of fine
detail. But it does not seem natural to think that we must be paying
attention to the execution of every act that we voluntarily perform,
any more than it seem natural to suppose that we must pay attention in
order to be perceiving anything at all. A case could therefore be
made, on commonsense grounds, for claiming that attention figures in
the production of some but not all voluntary behaviours. One can
imagine this view being challenged by a theorist who claimed that
attention is necessary for any action to be voluntary, arguing that
there is an illusion (analogous to the refrigerator light illusion)
that gives us the mistaken impression that our inattentive acts are
voluntary too. As in the case of attention and consciousness there is
an epistemological puzzle about the sort of evidence that could settle
this issue. This may be a topic for future research.</p>

<h3><a name="AttVir">3.6 Attention and Virtue</a></h3>

<p>
Attention might also have a role to play in other philosophically
interesting phenomena. This has been underexplored, particular with
regard to the role of attention in ethics. Simone Weil suggests that
attention has an absolutely central role in ethics, and in value
theory more broadly, writing that:</p>

<blockquote>
The authentic and pure values – truth, beauty and goodness
– in the activity of a human being are the result of one and the
same act, a certain application of the full attention to the object.
(Weil, 1986, p. 214)
</blockquote>

<p>
Weil’s claims about attention’s import were developed in
the work of Iris Murdoch, who suggests that there are some forms of
attention that play an essential role in the exercise of the virtues
(Murdoch, 1970, see Mole, 2006). More recently they have been taken up
by Dorothea Debus, who places particular emphasis on Weil’s
claim that it is <em>full</em> attention to which Weil attributes such
cardinal value (Debus, 2015). Nicolas Bommarito has developed an
account of modesty as a just such a ‘virtue of attention’,
arguing that this avoids epistemic difficulties that other accounts of
modesty face, if they characterize modesty as requiring false beliefs
about the extent of one’s strengths (Bommarito, 2013).</p>
