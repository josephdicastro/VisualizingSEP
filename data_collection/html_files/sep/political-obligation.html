<h1>Political Obligation</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Tue Apr 17, 2007; substantive revision Thu Aug 7, 2014</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>

To have a political obligation is to have a moral duty to obey the
laws of one's country or state. On that point there is almost complete
agreement among political philosophers. But how does one acquire such
an obligation, and how many people have really done what is necessary
to acquire it? Or is political obligation more a matter of
<em>being</em> than of <em>doing</em> — that is, of simply being
a member of the country or state in question? To those questions many
answers have been given, and none now commands widespread assent.
Indeed, a number of contemporary political philosophers deny that a
satisfactory theory of political obligation either has been or can be
devised. Others, however, continue to believe that there is a solution
to what is commonly called “the problem of political
obligation,” and they are presently engaged in lively debate not
only with the skeptics but also with one another on the question of
which theory, if any, provides the solution to the problem.</p>

<p>

Whether political obligation is the central or fundamental problem of
political philosophy, as some have maintained (e.g., McPherson), may
well be doubted. There is no doubt, however, that the history of
political thought is replete with attempts to provide a satisfactory
account of political obligation, from the time of Socrates to the
present. These attempts have become increasingly sophisticated in
recent years, but they have brought us no closer to agreement on a
solution to the problem of political obligation than the efforts of,
say, Thomas Hobbes and John Locke in the seventeenth century. Nor have
these sophisticated attempts made it unnecessary to look back to
earlier efforts to resolve the problem. On the contrary, an
appreciation of the troublesome nature of political obligation seems
to require some attention to its place in the history of political
thought.</p>

<p>

This essay begins, therefore, with a brief history of the problem of
political obligation. It then turns, in Part II, to the conceptual
questions raised by political obligation, such as what it means for an
<em>obligation</em> to be <em>political</em>. In Part III the focus is
on the skeptics, with particular attention to the self-proclaimed
philosophical anarchists, who deny that political obligations exist
yet do not want to abolish the state. Part IV surveys the leading
contenders among the various theories of political obligation now on
offer, and Part V concludes the essay with a brief consideration of recent
proposals for pluralistic or “multiple principle”
approaches.</p>

<h2><a name="PolOblHisPer">1. Political Obligation in Historical Perspective</a></h2>

<p>

The phrase “political obligation” is apparently no older
than T. H.  Green's <em>Lectures on the Principles of Political
Obligation</em>, delivered at Oxford University in 1879–80
(D'Entrèves, p. 3).  The two words from which Green formed the
phrase are much older, of course, and he apparently thought that
combining them required no elaborate explanation or defense. In any
case, there was nothing novel about the problem Green addressed in his
lectures: “to discover the true ground or justification for
obedience to law” (Green 1986, p. 13).  Sophocles raised this
problem in his play <em>Antigone</em>, first performed around 440 BCE,
and Plato's <em>Crito</em> recounts Socrates' philosophical response
to the problem, in the face of his own death, some forty years
later.</p>

<h3><a name="SocObeLaw">1.1 Socrates on Obeying the Law</a></h3>

<p>

In 399 BCE an Athenian jury found Socrates guilty of impiety and
corrupting the morals of the youth, for which crimes the jury
condemned him to death. According to Plato's account, Socrates'
friends arranged his escape, but he chose to stay and drink the fatal
hemlock, arguing that to defy the judgment against him would be to
break his “agreements and commitments” and to
“mistreat” his friends, his country, and the laws of
Athens (<em>Crito</em>, 54c; <em>Trial and Death</em>, p. 54).
Socrates' arguments are sketchy, and Crito, his interlocutor, does
little to challenge them, but they are nevertheless suggestive of the
theories of political obligation that have emerged in the two and a
half millennia since his death.</p>

<p>

These arguments fall into four categories. First, Socrates maintains
that his long residence in Athens shows that he has entered into an
agreement with its laws and committed himself to obey them — an
argument that anticipates the social contract or consent theory of
political obligation. Second, he acknowledges that he owes his birth,
nurture, and education, among other goods, to the laws of Athens, and
he hints at the gratitude theory of obligation when he concludes that
it would be wrong of him to disobey its laws now. Third, he appeals to
what is now known as the argument from fairness or fair play when he
suggests that disobedience would be a kind of mistreatment of his
fellow citizens. As he asks Crito, “if we leave here without the
city's permission, are we mistreating people whom we should least
mistreat?” (50a) There is, finally, a trace of utilitarian
reasoning, as when Socrates imagines “the laws and the
state” confronting him with this challenge: “‘do you
think it possible for a city not to be destroyed if the verdicts of
its courts have no force but are nullified and set at naught by
private individuals?’” (50b). None of these arguments is
fully developed, but their presence in the <em>Crito</em> is testimony
to the staying power of intuitions and concepts — commitment and
agreement, gratitude, fair play, and utility — that continue to
figure in discussions of obligation and obedience.</p>

<p>

Plato's <em>Crito</em> is noteworthy not only as the first
philosophical exploration of political obligation but also as the last
to appear for centuries. The Cynics and others did question the value
of political life, and indirectly the existence of an obligation to
obey the law, but they left no record of a discussion of the subject
as sustained as even the five or six pages in the <em>Crito</em>. When
the morality of obedience and disobedience next became a much
discussed issue, it was a religious as much as a philosophical
discussion.</p>

<h3><a name="DivCom">1.2 Divine Command</a></h3>

<p>

Throughout history, the belief that political society and its rules
are divinely ordained has been so strong as to keep many people, and
probably most, from considering the possibility that disobeying those
rules might ever be justified. With the advent of Christianity,
however, that possibility had to be taken seriously. For the
Christian, the distinction Jesus draws (Matthew 22:15–22) between the
tribute owed to Caesar and that owed to God makes it clear that what
the rulers command may be at odds with what God wants done. That point
became even clearer when the rulers tried to suppress
Christianity. Nevertheless, Christian doctrine held that there is an
obligation to obey the law grounded in divine command, with the most
important text being Paul's Epistle to the Romans (13:1–2): “For
there is no authority except from God, and those that exist have been
instituted by God. Therefore he who resists the authorities resists
what God has appointed, and those who resist will incur
judgment.”</p>

<p>

As a theory of political obligation, divine command faces two general
problems. First, it presupposes the existence of divinity of some
sort; and second, the commands of the divine being(s) are not always
clear. It is one thing to know that we should give to Caesar what is
Caesar's and to God what is God's, for example, and quite another to
know what exactly is Caesar's due. For Christians, however, the main
challenge was to reconcile Paul's text with the uncomfortable fact
that rulers were often hostile to Christianity — or, with the
rise of Protestantism in the sixteenth century, hostile to what one
took to be true Christianity. To this challenge, one response was
simply to hold that hostile or vicious rulers must be endured, for God
must have given them power as a sign of His displeasure with a wicked
people. Other responses, though, made room for disobedience.</p>

<p>

One such response was to distinguish the divinely ordained office from
the officer who occupied it. That is, God ordains that political
authority must exist, because the condition of human life since the
fall from grace requires such authority; but God does not ordain that
this or that particular person hold a position of authority, and He
certainly does not want rulers to abuse their authority by ruling
tyrannically. This distinction, employed as early as the fourth
century by St. John Chrysostom, was invoked throughout the middle ages
(McIlwain, pp. 152–53). A second response to the problem Romans 13
posed was to distinguish disobedience from resistance. According to
Martin Luther and others who drew this distinction, Christians may not
actively resist their rulers, but they must disobey them when the
rulers' commands are contrary to God's. Yet a third response was to
note the possibility of conflict between two or more of one's rulers.
In other words, if more than one person holds political authority over
you, and if they issue conflicting commands, then you may satisfy
Paul's injunction by obeying the authority whose commands are more
congenial to your understanding of true Christianity, even when such
obedience entails resisting the commands of others in authority.</p>

<p>

These last two responses played an especially important part in the
political disputes that accompanied the Protestant Reformation. Under
the pressure of those disputes, however, another theory of political
obligation became increasingly prominent, as Protestants came to rely
on the belief that political authority derives from the consent of the
governed (Skinner, vol. 2, chaps. 7–9).</p>

<h3><a name="SocCon">1.3 The Social Contract</a></h3>

<p>

Although the idea of the social contract long antedates the modern era
(Gough 1967), its full development occurred in the seventeenth
century, when Thomas Hobbes and John Locke used the theory to rather
different ends. Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Immanuel Kant, and other
philosophers have also relied on social contract theory, but the
classic expressions of the contract theory of political obligation
remain Hobbes's <em>Leviathan</em> (1651) and Locke's <em>Second
Treatise of Government</em> (1690).</p>

<p>

For Hobbes, social contract theory established the authority of anyone
who was able to wield and hold power. If we imagine ourselves in a
state of nature, he argued, with no government and no law to guide us
but the law of nature, we will recognize that everyone is naturally
equal and independent. But we should also recognize that this state of
nature will also be a state of war, for the “restlesse desire
for Power after power” that drives all of us will lead to
“a warre of every man against every man” (Hobbes,
chaps. 11, 13). To escape so dreadful a condition, people surrender
their independence by entering into a covenant to obey a sovereign
power that will have the authority to make, enforce, and interpret
laws. This form of the social contract Hobbes called
“sovereignty by institution.” But he also insisted that
conquerors acquire authority over those they subject to their rule
— “sovereignty by acquisition” — when they
allow those subjects to go about their business. In either case,
Hobbes said, the subjects consent to obey those who have effective
power over them, whether the subject has a choice in who holds power
or not. Because they consent, they therefore have an obligation to
obey the sovereign, whether sovereignty be instituted or acquired.</p>

<p>

Exactly how much Locke differs from Hobbes in his conclusions is a
matter of scholarly dispute, but there is no doubt that he puts the
same concepts to work for what seem to be more limited ends. According
to Locke, the free and equal individuals in the state of nature
establish government as a way of overcoming the
“inconveniencies” of that state. Moreover, Locke's social
contract appears to have two stages. In the first stage the naturally
free and equal individuals agree to form themselves into a political
society, under law, and in the second they establish the
government. This move allows Locke to argue, contrary to Hobbes, for a
right of revolution on the ground that overthrowing the government
will not immediately return the people to the state of nature. Nor
does he hold, with Hobbes, that mere submission to a conqueror
constitutes a form of consent to the conqueror's rule.</p>

<p>

Locke does agree with Hobbes, of course, in deriving obligations to
obey the law from the consent of the governed. In developing his
argument, however, he reveals three problems that have bedeviled
social contract theory. One problem has to do with the nature of the
contract: is it historical or hypothetical? If the former, then the
problem is to show that most people truly have entered into such a
contract. If the contract is meant to be a device that illustrates how
people <em>would have</em> given their consent, on the other hand,
then the difficulty is that a hypothetical contract “is no
contract at all” (Dworkin, 1977, p. 151). The second problem has
to do with the way Hobbes and Locke rely on <em>tacit</em> consent. If
only express or explicit statements of agreement or commitment count
as genuine consent, then it appears that relatively few people have
consented to obey the laws of their country; but if tacit or implied
consent is allowed, the concept of consent may be stretched too
far. Hobbes does this when he counts submission to a conqueror as
consent, but Locke also runs this risk when he states, in §119 of
the <em>Second Treatise</em>, that the “very being of anyone
within the territories” of a government amounts to tacit
consent. Finally, it is not clear that consent is really the key to
political obligation in these theories. The upshot of Hobbes's theory
seems to be that we have an obligation to obey anyone who can maintain
order, and in Locke's it seems that there are some things to which we
cannot consent. In particular, we cannot consent to place ourselves
under an absolute ruler, for doing so would defeat the very purposes
for which we enter the social contract — to protect our lives,
liberty, and property (Pitkin 1965).</p>

<p>

One of the first to find fault with the argument from consent or
contract was David Hume. In “Of the Original Contract,”
published in 1752, Hume takes particular exception to the appeal to
tacit consent.  To say, he protests, that most people have given their
consent to obey the laws simply by remaining in their country of birth
is tantamount to saying that someone tacitly consents to obey a ship's
captain “though he was carried on board while asleep and must
leap into the ocean and perish the moment he leaves her” (1953,
p. 51). For Hume, it seems, the obligation to obey the law derives not
from consent or contract but from the straightforward utility of a
system of laws that enables people to pursue their interests
peacefully and conveniently.</p>

<h3><a name="UtiObl">1.4 Utility and Obligation</a></h3>

<p>

For all its influence in other areas of legal, moral, and political
philosophy, utilitarianism has found few adherents among those who
believe that there is a general obligation to obey the laws of one's
country. Part of the reason for this situation may be the fact that
Jeremy Bentham, John Stuart Mill, and others who followed Hume's path
had little to say about political obligation. A more powerful reason,
though, is that utilitarians have trouble accounting for obligations
of any kind. If one's guiding principle is always to act to maximize
expected utility, or promote the greatest happiness of the greatest
number, then obligations seem to have little or no binding
force. After all, if I can do more good by giving the money in my
possession to charity than by paying my debts, then that is what I
should do, notwithstanding my obligations to my creditors. By the same
reasoning, whether I should obey or disobey the law is a matter to be
settled by considering which will do more good, not by determining
whether I have an obligation to obey.</p>

<p>

Some utilitarian philosophers have struggled to overcome this problem,
either by pointing to reasons to believe that respecting obligations
serves to promote utility or by restricting calculations of utility to
rules or norms rather than to individual acts (see the entry on
“consequentialism” for details). Whether their efforts have been
successful remains a matter of debate. There seems to be a consensus,
however, that the most sophisticated attempts to provide a utilitarian
grounding for political obligation, such as those of Rolf Sartorius
(1975, chaps. 5 and 6) and R. M. Hare (1976), have proved unsuccessful
(e.g., Simmons 1979, pp. 45–54; Horton 2010, pp. 60–69). As a result,
utilitarianism seldom figures in the debates of those contemporary
political philosophers who continue to believe that there is, in some
political societies, a general obligation to obey the law.</p>

<h3><a name="KanLegObl">1.5 Kant on Legitimacy and Obligation</a></h3>

<p>In contrast to utilitarianism, the practical philosophy of an
eighteenth-century German philosopher, Immanuel Kant, does play a
major part in contemporary debates about political obligation.  The
proper direction of his influence, however, is not altogether settled.
On the one hand, a leading “philosophical anarchist,” Robert Paul
Wolff, claims Kantian inspiration for his a priori rejection of the
possibility of political obligation (see §3.1, below); on the
other hand, important exponents of the “natural duty”
approach to the obligation to obey the law also claim to derive their
arguments from Kant (see §4.5, below).  Kant may bear some
responsibility for fostering such divergent responses, but it is safe
to say that he himself was no anarchist, not even of the
“philosophical” sort.  Indeed, he seems to insist on an
unqualified obligation to obey the law that goes well beyond what any
political philosopher nowadays will countenance.</p>

<p>

Kant's theory employs the same basic concepts as Hobbes's and Locke's
— natural (or innate) rights, the state of nature, and the
social contract — but he puts them to different use.  In
contrast to Hobbes, Kant looks upon the coercive force of the law not
as a limitation on freedom but as the means of securing and extending
it.  In the state of nature, as he conceives of it, individuals may
enjoy “wild, lawless freedom,” but the threats and
constraints imposed by others prevent them from freely acting on their
choices (1991[1797], p. 127).  Justified coercion under law provides a
remedy by impeding those who would interfere with one's actions,
thereby hindering the hindrances to freedom (Ripstein,
pp. 54–55 <em>et passim</em>).  Moreover, unlike Locke's
justification of the social contract as the way to secure one's
property and escape the “inconveniencies” of the state of
nature, Kant takes the “civil condition” produced by the
social contract to be the foundation that property rights and justice
in general presuppose.  The social contract is thus not a matter of
collective consent but a moral imperative: “When you cannot
avoid living side by side with all others, you ought to leave the
state of nature and proceed with them into a rightful condition, that
is a condition of distributive justice” (1991, pp. 121–22).
“Properly speaking,” Kant declares, the original contract
is not an expression of consent to be governed; it is “the idea
of this act, in terms of which alone we can think of the legitimacy of
a state” (1991, p. 127).</p>

<p>

The upshot, as noted above, is that everyone seems to have an absolute
obligation to obey the laws of whoever is in authority; for even if
the ruler “proceeds contrary to law … subjects may indeed
oppose this injustice by <em>complaints</em> … but not by
resistance” (1991, p. 130, emphasis in original; also
pp. 176–77).  Kant's comments on this point are not unqualified,
though.  Among other things, he states that “the <em>spirit</em>
of the original contract … involves an obligation on the part of
the constituting authority to make the <em>kind of</em> government
suited to the idea of the original contract”; and he immediately
adds that “the only constitution that accords with right”
is “that of a pure republic” —that is, “the
constitution in which <em>law</em> itself rules and depends on no
particular person” (1991, p. 148, emphases in original; for
further discussion, see Ripstein, chap. 11).  In any case, it is not
so much Kant's conclusions as the foundations of his theory that have
proved so important to contemporary discussions of political
obligation.</p>

<h2><a name="ConMat">2. Conceptual Matters</a></h2>

<p>

In the twentieth century political philosophers devoted themselves at
least as much to the analysis of the problem of political obligation,
and to the concepts it involves, as to full-scale attempts to devise
theories of the obligation to obey the law. Some even argued that the
existence of political obligations could be established by conceptual
analysis alone — a point we return to in §3.  More often
philosophers working in this vein sought to clarify what was at issue
in the assertion or denial of political obligations,
or <em>duties</em> to obey the law.</p>

<h3><a name="OblDut">2.1 Obligation and Duty</a></h3>

<p>

As the previous sentence suggests, obligations are also duties. That
is true, at any rate, when the obligation in question is political
obligation. To be sure, some philosophers have uncovered differences
between obligations and duties, the most important of which is that
obligations must be voluntarily undertaken or incurred, but duties
need not be (e.g., Brandt 1964; Hart 1958). The obligation to keep a
promise or fulfill a contract, for example, arises only when one has
done something that generates the obligation — made a promise or
signed a contract — but the duties of charity and truth telling
supposedly fall on us regardless of what, if anything, we voluntarily
commit to do. John Rawls relies on this distinction when he argues
that most citizens of a reasonably just political society have no
general obligation to obey its laws, even though they do have a
“natural duty” to support just institutions — a duty
that has the general effect of requiring them to obey (Rawls 1999,
p. 97). For the most part, however, the distinction between obligation
and duty has played no significant role in the debates over the
supposed moral responsibility to obey the law. To invoke the
distinction here would run counter to the tendency in both ordinary
language and philosophical discussion to use the terms
interchangeably, as when we speak of the “duty” to keep a
promise or an “obligation” to tell the truth. This essay will proceed, then,
like almost everything written on either side of the question, on the
understanding that a political obligation, if it exists, is a moral
duty to obey the law (but note the elaboration of this point in §2.3, below).</p>

<h3><a name="OblPolCivLeg">2.2 Obligation: Political, Civil, and Legal</a></h3>

<p>One question that immediately arises from this conception of
political obligation is whether “political” is the appropriate
modifer.  If the obligation in question is a duty to obey the
law, <em>ceteris paribus</em>, then why not call it a <em>legal</em>
obligation?  Or why not conclude, with Bhikhu Parekh (1993, p. 240),
that the question of whether we have a duty to obey the law is really
a matter of <em>civil obligation</em> — that is, “the obligation
to respect and uphold the legitimately constituted civil authority”
— that entails <em>legal obligations</em> “to obey the laws
enacted by the civil authority” rather than political obligation?
“Political” is the broader term, according to Parekh, and someone who
has a truly political obligation will owe her polity more than mere
obedience to its laws (see also Raz 2006, p. 1004). Such a person will
have a positive duty to take steps to secure the safety and advance
the interests of her country.  Following Parekh's distinction, then,
we may say that someone who pays taxes discharges a legal obligation,
no matter how grudgingly she pays them, but someone who pays
taxes <em>and</em> contributes voluntarily to public projects fulfills
a truly political obligation.</p>

<p>

Other philosophers also distinguish political from legal obligations,
but not in the far-reaching way that Parekh does.  Indeed, it seems
that we already have a term, “civic duty,” that does the work he wants
to assign to “political obligation.”  Exhortations to do our civic
duty typically urge us to do more than merely obey the law.  These
exhortations would have us vote in elections and be well-informed
voters; buy government bonds; limit our use of water and other scarce
resources; donate blood, service, or money (beyond what we owe in
taxes) in times of crisis; and generally contribute in an active way
to the common good.  Whether we really have a civic duty to do any or
all of these things may be a matter of dispute, but appeals to civic
duty are certainly quite common, and it is hardly clear that there is
something to be gained by reclassifying them as appeals to political
obligation.</p>

<p>

Rather than political obligation or Parekh's “civil obligation,” why
not call the duty to obey the law a <em>legal</em> obligation?  The
answer seems to be that “legal obligation” has a different kind of
work to do.  For many legal philosophers, the claim that a person has
a legal obligation to do X is merely a descriptive claim, a statement
of social fact.  The fact that a person has a legal obligation to do X
provides him with a moral reason to do X only if he has a moral duty
to obey the law — that is, a political obligation.  The value of
this distinction is that it allows one to hold that a person may be
subject to a legal obligation even though she has no political
obligation to obey the laws of the regime in power.  Suppose that the
regime is tyrannical, inept, or simply so unjust that only a Hobbesian
would maintain that those subject to its commands have a moral
obligation to obey.  Nevertheless, most theorists will agree that
people in this unhappy country have legal obligations to pay taxes,
refrain from certain types of conduct when driving, and do whatever
the legal system that enjoys de facto jurisdiction over them requires;
that is, claims to this effect are true descriptions of the world.
But such descriptions are compatible with the belief that the people
of unhappy countries have no moral duty to act as the law directs
simply because the law so directs.</p>

<p>

A closely related question is whether we should distinguish the
concept of political obligation from that of a duty to obey the law.
The answer may depend on whether we understand the term “political” to
refer to the status in virtue of which a person has the obligation or
to the entity or agent to whom she owes it.  In the former case,
political obligation refers to those obligations a person has as a
member or citizen of a particular polity.  So understood, a theory of
political obligation will tell us nothing about the authority a state
enjoys over non-members; for example, whether and why short-term
visitors residing on its territory have a duty to obey its laws.  That
need not render it defective as an account of political obligation,
but it does entail that we should not take the phrase “political
obligation” to be synonymous with the phrase “a duty to obey the
law <em>simpliciter</em>,” but only with the phrase “a citizen's (or
member's) duty to obey the law.”  In contrast, if “political” refers
to the agent or entity to whom a person owes the obligation, then a
theory of political obligation will be synonymous with a theory of the
duty to obey the law, since it will aspire to explain why those who
are subject to a particular state's jurisdiction, be they citizens or
foreigners, have a moral duty to act as it directs them to act.
Arguably, certain solutions to the problem of political obligation
fare better when “political” refers to the status in virtue of which a
person has the obligation than when it refers to the entity to which
she owes it, or vice versa.  For example, membership (or associative)
approaches to political obligation may have a leg up in justifying
citizens' duties to obey the law but face a significant challenge in
accounting for the obligation of foreigners to do so (see
§4.4). Conversely, natural duty theories may be able to explain
why anyone, citizen or not, has a duty to obey the law (i.e., the laws
of one or another legal system) but struggle to explain why anyone has
a duty to obey the laws of the particular state of which she is a
member (see the discussion of particularity at the end of §2.3;
see also §4.5).  Attention to the ambiguity in the referent of
the term “political” may also support a pluralistic or
multi–principle solution to the problem of political obligation;
e.g., a membership justification for the duty of citizens to obey the
law, and a consent justification for the duty of foreigners to do so
(see §5).</p>

<h3><a name="OblMorPra">2.3 Obligation, Morality, and Practical Reason</a></h3>

<p>

As in the five historically significant theories surveyed in the
previous section, the presumption that the answer to the problem of
political obligation must be stated in moral terms has continued to
prevail.  When T. H. Green set out in 1879 “to discover the true
ground or justification for obedience to law,” for example, he
was looking for more than prudence alone can provide.  “You
ought to obey the law because you will suffer if you do not” may
be a powerful reason for obedience, but it is not a reason that speaks
to Green's concern with “the moral function or object served by
law …” (1986, p. 13).  For Green, and for almost everyone
else who has pondered it, the problem of political obligation is a
moral problem, and the obligation in question is a kind of moral
obligation.  To have a political obligation, then, is to have a moral
duty to obey the law.</p>

<p>

Margaret Gilbert has recently challenged this moralized
characterization of political obligation (Gilbert 2006; Gilbert 2013).
She maintains that a political obligation is a genuine obligation, by
which she means that it provides a person subject to it with a
sufficient, though not necessarily conclusive, reason for action that
trumps considerations of inclination or self-interest.  However,
Gilbert distinguishes between two kinds of genuine obligations, or two
senses of the term “obligation,” the first synonymous with being the
subject of a moral requirement and the second with “owing” something
to another (2013, pp. 391–92).  Obligation in this second sense
describes a normative relationship between two or more parties, one
that can be created via a suitable act of will; for example, by what
Gilbert calls an exercise of joint commitment.  It is the second sense
of obligation that Gilbert maintains we ought to employ in our
analysis of the problem of political obligation, understood here as
the challenge of accounting for the obligations people owe one another
as co-members of a given polity.  That does not preclude the
development of a theory concerning when moral requirements outweigh or
defeat people's political obligations, of course.  As she sees it,
though, the theory of political obligation itself ought to be
de-moralized.</p>

<p>

One upshot of Gilbert's account is that it entirely separates the
existence of political obligations from the justice or injustice of
the political society's institutions and laws.  On her account,
individuals can acquire genuine obligations in the sense of owing
something to another even when their suitable act of willing is
coerced or the content of what they agree to owe another is immoral.
With respect to political obligations, then, neither state coercion
(i.e., the absence of voluntary consent) nor the injustice of a
state's laws or institutions precludes its citizens' acquisition of a
genuine obligation to obey its laws.  But why think that a promise
extracted at gunpoint generates any reason to do that which one
promised, or that a voluntary agreement to torture babies generates a
genuine (albeit not conclusive) obligation to do so?  Or, if coerced
or immoral owing-obligations are genuine but always defeated or
trumped by moral-requirement-obligations, one might wonder why we
should posit their separate existence at all.  One possibility is that
doing so is necessary to render intelligible the response of the
promisee when the coerced promisor reneges on her promise; we can
understand why the promisee feels betrayed even if we do not think he
is justified in feeling that way.  This response, however, treats
Gilbert's account of political obligation as an explanatory theory,
not a justificatory one (Lefkowitz 2007; for a response, see Gilbert
2013, pp. 406–07).</p>

<p>

Gilbert aside, theorists of political obligation characterize it as a
moral duty to obey the law.  As such, it provides a person with a
categorical reason for action, one that does not depend on her
inclinations or self-interest.  Political obligation is also typically
understood to be <em>content-independent</em>; that is, to be a duty
to obey the law as such, or simply because it is the law (Hart 1982,
pp. 254–55).  Where a person has a duty to obey the law, the judgment
that the law requires her to X suffices to provide her with a reason
to X, independent of any judgment she may make regarding the merits of
performing X.  The problem of political obligation, then, is not
simply the question of whether a person has a reason to do that which
the law would have her do.  Often a person will have prudential
reasons to do so, and she may have moral obligations to perform or not
perform specific acts independent of their being legally required or
proscribed, as in the case of forbearing from murder.  Rather, the
question concerns the conditions, if any, in which the fact that the
law requires a person to act thus-and-so imposes a moral obligation on
her to act as the law directs.  The content-independence of political
obligation reflects the fact that what stands in need of justification
is the polity's right to its subjects' obedience — to their
acting as it directs because it so directs them.</p>

<p>

How can the state's mere willing that a person be required to perform
a certain act create a <em>moral</em> obligation to do so?  Though a
few theorists have attempted to address this challenge head on,
Gilbert being the most recent, most construe claims to authority not
as the creation of moral obligations <em>ex nihilo</em> but as a moral
obligation to defer to the state's judgment regarding what they have
independent reason to do (but compare Klosko 2011).  The
characterization of this deference within a person's deliberation is a
matter of some dispute.  H. L. A. Hart and Joseph Raz, for example,
argue that law is preemptive; law does not merely offer a
consideration for or against a potential course of action, to be
weighed against any and all other relevant considerations.  Rather,
law aims to exclude from an agent's deliberation at least some of the
considerations favoring or opposing the conduct at issue,
considerations that in the absence of the law it would be permissible
to take into account (Raz 1979, chaps. 1 and 2).  Rival views of the
manner in which political obligation functions in a person's
deliberation reject the exclusionary element of Raz's account of the
duty to obey the law, arguing that political obligations are simply
weighty moral reasons that are balanced against all of the other
reasons a person has to perform or not perform a given act (Perry
1989).  On neither account, though, is a person's political obligation
taken to provide her with an absolute duty to obey the law.  Raz, for
example, notes that law need not exclude all of the first–order
reasons a person might have for performing a given act (Raz 1986,
p. 46).  Nor does he claim that the first-order reason the law
provides for not performing a given act will always outweigh or defeat
non-excluded first-order reasons a person has to perform that act.  In
other words, the duty to obey the law is a <em>prima facie</em>
or <em>pro tanto</em> reason for action, from which it follows that
the bearer of a political obligation may not always have a conclusive
or all-things-considered reason to act as the law demands.</p>

<p>

Theorists of political obligation typically ascribe two further
features to the moral duty they seek to defend.  First, the duty to
obey the law is <em>general</em> both in the sense that it is a duty
to obey the entire body of law in a given jurisdiction and in the
sense that the duty is borne by all those living within that
jurisdiction.  Note that a general moral duty to obey the law is
consistent with variation in the legal obligations different subjects
bear.  For example, a given state may impose on all and only its male
citizens a duty to register for a military draft, in which case the
full set of legal obligations borne by men in this state will differ
from the full set borne by women.  Nevertheless, citizens of both
sexes may be subject to a general political obligation, meaning that
they have a moral duty to fulfill all of their legal obligations.
Raz, however, denies that the subjects of any existing state or indeed
anything remotely like it have a general duty to obey the law; rather,
law's authority is piecemeal, both with respect to who has a moral
duty to obey a particular law and with respect to the number of laws
within a given legal system that enjoy authority over anyone.</p>

<p>

The second feature commonly ascribed to political obligations is that
they are owed <em>only</em> to the particular political/legal society
that claims primary or exclusive jurisdiction over a person.
Following John Simmons's influential analysis, this has come to be
known as “the particularity requirement.” Political
obligation, Simmons maintains, carries an implicit connection to
citizenship, which means that those who are engaged in the political
obligation debate “are only interested in those moral
requirements [including obligations and duties] which bind an
individual to one <em>particular</em> political community, set of
institutions, etc.” (1979, p. 31, emphasis in original; but
cf. Edmundson 2004, p. 232, and Walton 2013).  As indicated below, in
§4.5, the main objection to natural duty theories of political
obligation is that they cannot account for this particularity.</p>

<h2><a name="AnaChaPolObl">3. Anarchist Challenges to Political Obligation</a></h2>

<p>

According to the foregoing analysis, a political obligation, if it
exists at all, is at least a systemic, <em>prima facie</em> or <em>pro
tanto</em> moral duty to obey the laws of one's polity. But does such
an obligation exist or obtain in any general or widespread sense? Most
political philosophers have assumed that the answer is yes. In the
middle years of the twentieth century some philosophers even asserted,
on conceptual grounds, that political obligation needs no
justification. As one of them put the point,“to ask why I should
obey any laws is to ask whether there might be a political society
without political obligations, which is absurd. For we mean by
political society, groups of people organized according to rules
enforced by some of their number” (Macdonald, p. 192; also
McPherson, p. 64, and, more subtly, Pitkin 1966; but cf. Pateman 1973,
and Horton 2010, pp. 138–46). This view did not long prevail,
but it testifies to the strength of the tendency to believe that
citizens surely have an obligation to obey the laws of their country,
at least if it is reasonably just.</p>

<p>

There have been dissenters, however, and in recent years they have
come to occupy a prominent place among political philosophers. As they
see it, there is no general obligation to obey the law, not even on
the part of the citizens of a reasonably just polity. The most
thorough-going of these dissenters have been anarchists proper —
that is, those persons who insist that states and governments are
wickedly coercive institutions that ought to be abolished. Yet other
skeptics or dissenters have concluded that the anarchist proper is
wrong about the need for the state but right about the obligation to
obey the law. Like the anarchist proper, these “philosophical
anarchists” hold that the state is illegitimate, but they deny
that its illegitimacy entails “a strong moral imperative to
oppose or eliminate states; rather they typically take state
illegitimacy simply to remove any strong moral presumption in favor of
obedience to, compliance with, or support for our own or other
existing states” (Simmons 2001, p.  104; but note Huemer 2013,
who regards philosophical anarchism as a second-best alternative that
could prepare the way for anarchism proper).</p>

<h3><a name="PhiAna">3.1 Philosophical Anarchism</a></h3>

<p>

The arguments of these philosophical anarchists take either an
“a priori” or an “a posteriori” form (Simmons
2001, pp. 104–106).  Arguments of the first kind maintain that it is
impossible to provide a satisfactory account of a general obligation
to obey the law. According to Robert Paul Wolff, the principal
advocate of this view, there can be no general obligation to obey the
law because any such obligation would violate the “primary
obligation” of autonomy, which is “the refusal to be
ruled” (1998 [1970], p. 18). As Wolff defines it, autonomy
combines freedom with responsibility. To be autonomous, someone must
have the capacity for choice, and therefore for freedom; but the
person who has this capacity also has the responsibility to exercise
it — to act autonomously. Failing to do so is to fail to fulfill
this “primary obligation” of autonomy.</p>

<p>

This primary obligation dooms any attempt to develop a theory of
political obligation, Wolff argues, except in the highly unlikely case
of a direct democracy in which every law has the unanimous approval of
the citizenry. Under any other form of government, autonomy and
authority are simply incompatible. Authority is “the right to
command, and correlatively, the right to be obeyed” (p. 4),
which entails that anyone subject to authority has an obligation to
obey those who have the right to be obeyed. But if we acknowledge such
an authority, we allow someone else to rule us, thereby violating our
fundamental obligation to act autonomously. We must therefore reject
the claim that we have an obligation to obey the orders of those who
purport to hold authority over us and conclude that there can be no
general obligation to obey the laws of any polity that falls short of
a unanimous direct democracy.</p>

<p>

Arguments of the second, a posteriori form are more modest in their
aims but no less devastating in their conclusions. In this case the
aim is not to show that a satisfactory defense of political obligation
is impossible but that no defense has proven satisfactory, despite the
efforts of some of the best minds in the history of philosophy. All
such attempts have failed, according to those who take this line, so
we must conclude that only those relatively few people who have
explicitly committed themselves to obey the law, perhaps by swearing
allegiance as part of an oath of citizenship, have anything like a
general obligation to obey the laws under which they live (e.g., Smith
1973; Raz 1979, chap. 12; Simmons 1979 and 2001, chap. 6, and 2005; Green 1988,
pp. 220–47, and 1996).</p>

<h3><a name="AgaPhiAna">3.2 Against Philosophical Anarchism</a></h3>

<p>

Whether a priori or a posteriori, the arguments of the philosophical
anarchists pose a serious challenge to those who continue to believe
in a general obligation to obey the law. This challenge is made
especially difficult by the powerful objections that Simmons and other
a posteriori anarchists have brought against the existing theories of
political obligation. The most effective response, of course, would be
to demonstrate that one's favored theory does not succumb to these
objections, and we shall briefly consider attempts to respond in this
fashion in the following section. Some general attempts to refute
philosophical anarchism ought to be noted first, however.</p>

<p>

Some of these attempts apply specifically to Wolff's a priori attack
on political authority and obligation, while others apply to
philosophical anarchism in general. The arguments against Wolff
usually concentrate on his conception of autonomy and its relation to
authority. In brief, Wolff's critics argue that he is wrong to insist
that moral autonomy is our “primary” or “fundamental
obligation,” for it “is, in fact, highly implausible to
think that autonomy should invariably override all other values
” (Horton 2010, p. 129). Moreover, there is no reason to accept
Wolff's claim that autonomy and authority are necessarily
incompatible. Insofar as autonomy is a capacity, as Wolff says, it
will need to be developed before it can be exercised, and various
kinds of authority — including political authority — will
foster its development and make its continued exercise possible
(Dagger 1997, pp.  66–68). Nor is it clear how Wolff can reject
political authority without also rejecting promises and contracts as
illegitimate constraints on one's autonomy — a problem that
leads even Simmons to judge Wolff's a priori philosophical anarchism a
“failed attempt” (2001, p. 111).</p>

<p>

In the face of these problems, Matthew Noah Smith has recently tried
to rescue the a priori skepticism of Wolff's theory by substituting
the overriding importance of “the moral status of the subject's
self” (2011, p. 2) for Wolff's reliance on the fundamental duty
of autonomy.  According to Smith, preserving the status of the self is
incompatible with the law's claim to authority, because “the
obligation to obey the law would morally require otherwise morally
upstanding subjects to undergo a radical form of self-effacement in
favor of recreating themselves in the image of foreign values”
(p. 2; see p. 9 for an admittedly “florid” way of making this point).
Whether the law is properly understood as an “alien force”
that threatens “to fix who one is ” (p. 14), however, is a
point that critics of a priori anarchism are not likely to concede.
Indeed, the radically individualistic conception of the self that
underpins Smith's argument is one that proponents of the membership or
associative theory of political obligation (see §4.4, below) will
dismiss from the outset.  It seems unlikely, then, that Smith's
adaptation will develop the “traction” that, on his account, Wolff's
has failed to gain.</p>

<p>

With regard to philosophical anarchism in general, critics have
responded in various ways, including the disparate complaints that it
is a kind of false or hypocritical radicalism (Gans) and that it is
all too genuine a threat to political order (Senor). The latter
complaint has both an ontological and a conceptual aspect. That is,
the critics argue that philosophical anarchists fail to appreciate the
social or embedded nature of human beings, which leads the anarchists
to conceive of obligation in excessively individualistic or
voluntaristic terms — which leads, in turn, to their denial of a
general obligation to obey the law. The problem, however, is that it
is a mistake to think “that political life is left more or less
unchanged by dispensing with some conception of political obligation
and adopting the perspective of philosophical anarchism. Unless it can
be shown that we can continue to talk intelligibly and credibly
of <em>our</em> government or <em>our</em> state, then a radical
rethinking of our political relations is an unavoidable
consequence” (Horton 2010, p. 133). Whether the philosophical
anarchists are willing to accept that consequence — and perhaps
to become anarchists proper — or whether they can find a way to
stop short of it thus becomes a major point of contention.</p>

<p>

In the end, of course, the best response to philosophical anarchists,
especially those of the a posteriori kind, will be to produce or
defend a theory of political obligation that proves to be immune to
their objections. At present, though, no single theory has the support
of all of those who continue to believe in political obligation, let
alone the assent of philosophical anarchists. Several theories remain
in contention, however, as the following section will attest.</p>

<h2><a name="ConThePolObl">4. Contemporary Theories of Political Obligation</a></h2>

<p>

Although the lines that separate one theory from another are not
always distinct, philosophical justifications of political obligation
nowadays usually take the form of arguments from consent, gratitude,
fair play, membership, or natural duty. Some philosophers advance a
hybrid of two or more of these approaches, and others hold, as the
concluding section shows, that a pluralistic theory is necessary. For
the most part, though, attempts to
justify a general obligation to obey the law will rely on one of these
five lines of argument.</p>

<h3><a name="Con">4.1 Consent</a></h3>

<p>

Most people who believe they have an obligation to obey the law
probably think that this putative obligation is grounded in their
consent. Political philosophers are less inclined to think this way,
however, in light of the withering criticism to which Hume and more
recent writers — notably Simmons (1979, chaps. 3 and 4) —
have subjected consent theory. The critics' claim is not that consent
cannot be a source of obligations, for they typically believe it
can. Their claim, instead, is that too few people have either
expressly or tacitly given the kind of actual consent that can ground
a general obligation to obey the law, and hypothetical consent cannot
supply the defect, for reasons already noted.</p>

<p>

Nevertheless, consent theory still has its adherents among political
philosophers. Their versions of consent theory vary considerably,
however, with two main approaches emerging in response to the
criticisms. One, advanced by Harry Beran ( 1987), accepts the claim
that only express consent can generate a political obligation, but
calls for political societies to establish formal procedures for
evoking such consent. That is, states should require their members
openly to undertake an obligation to obey the law or to refuse to do
so. Those who decline the obligation will then have the options of
leaving the state, seceding to form a new state with like-minded
people, or taking residence in a territory within the state reserved
for dissenters. In the absence of such procedures, it seems that
Beran's position is roughly the same as that of the a posteriori
philosophical anarchist. Were these procedures in place, though, it is
far from clear that the options available to the members will make
their “consent” truly voluntary (Horton 2010, pp. 34–36;
Klosko 2005, pp. 123–29).</p>

<p>

The second line of response to criticisms of consent theory is to
argue in one way or another that the critics construe
“consent” too narrowly. Thus John Plamenatz (1968,
Postscript) and Peter Steinberger (2004, p. 218) have maintained that
voting or otherwise participating in elections should count as
consent; and Steinberger produces a lengthy list of fairly ordinary
activities — calling the police or fire department for help,
sending children to a public school, using a public library, and more
— that constitute “active participation in the
institutions of the state” (2004, pp. 219–20). Mark Murphy
and Margaret Gilbert have sounded variations on this theme by arguing,
in Murphy's case, that “surrender of judgment is a kind of
consent” (in Edmundson 1999, p.  320), or, in Gilbert's, that
“joint commitment” is an important source of obligations,
including political obligations (1993, 2006, 2013). For Murphy,
surrender of judgment is consent in the usual sense of voluntary
agreement or acceptance. As he says, “One consents to another in
a certain sphere of conduct in the acceptance sense of consent when
one allows the other's practical judgments to take the place of his or
her own with regard to that sphere of conduct. (This consent may be
either to a person or to a set of rules: both of these can be
authoritative)” (1999, p. 330). As the earlier discussion of her
views indicates §2.3, Gilbert differs from Murphy, and others, in
taking a joint commitment to be something that need not arise
voluntarily. According to her theory, “an understanding of joint
commitment and a readiness to be jointly committed are necessary if
one is to accrue political obligations, as is common knowledge of
these in the population in question. One can, however, fulfill these
conditions without prior deliberation or decision, and if one has
deliberated, one may have had little choice but to incur them”
(2006, p. 290). Indeed, membership in a “plural subject”
formed through nonvoluntary joint commitments plays such a large part
in Gilbert's theory that it may be better to place her with those who
advocate an associative or membership theory of political obligation
than with the adherents of consent theory.</p>

<p>

David Estlund (2008, pp. 117–58) has recently offered a new twist on
consent theory.  Most theorists, he observes, maintain that putative
acts of consent are void if it would be wrong to consent to someone's
authority. For example, consent to be another person's slave generates
no obligation even if it genuinely expresses a person's will.  Estlund
argues on grounds of symmetry that we ought to draw the same
conclusion in cases where it would be wrong <em>not to consent</em> to
another person's authority.  Such failures are void, and so a person
who morally ought to have consented to another's authority has a duty
to obey her.  If subjects of a given state ought to consent to obey
its laws, say because the state performs morally necessary tasks, then
their failure to do so is void and no barrier to concluding that they
are under a political obligation to that state.  Estlund's defense of
what he labels <em>normative consent</em> is subtle and sophisticated
in ways we cannot indicate here.  Still, in cases where non-consent is
void, one might wonder whether the duty to submit to another's
authority follows directly from the consideration in virtue of which
it is wrong for someone not to consent (see Sreenivasan 2009).  It is
also unclear whether there is enough of a connection between the
agent's will and her coming to be subject to another's authority to
warrant classifying Estlund's account as an example of consent theory
(for responses to both concerns, see Estlund 2008, pp. 127–31;
2009).</p>

<p>

At this time there is little reason to believe that the critics of
consent theory will be won over by these attempts to revive the theory
by broadening our understanding of what counts as consent. There is
even less reason, however, to believe that appeals to consent will
simply wither away, at least among those who continue to believe in
the existence of a general obligation to obey the law.</p>

<h3><a name="Gra">4.2 Gratitude</a></h3>

<p>

Appeals to gratitude in debates about political obligation are as old
as Plato's <em>Crito</em>, as we have seen, and they remain popular
today. They are rarely, though, the sole or even primary basis for an
attempt to justify the obligation to obey the law. Plato's account of
Socrates' reasoning is typical in this regard, with gratitude being
but one of at least four considerations Socrates relies on in
explaining why he will not disobey the ruling of the jury that
sentenced him to death. (For more recent examples, see Simmons 1979,
pp. 162–63.) When Simmons included a chapter on the weakness of
gratitude as a foundation for political obligation in his
influential <em>Moral Principles and Political Obligations</em>
(1979), in fact, there was no gratitude
<em>theory</em> on which to concentrate his criticism.</p>

<p>

That situation changed within a decade when A. D. M. Walker sketched
such a theory in “Political Obligation and the Argument from
Gratitude.” Walker's argument takes the following form (1988, p.
205):</p>

<ol>
<li>The person who benefits from <em>X</em> has an obligation of
gratitude not to act contrary to <em>X</em>'s interests.</li>

<li>Every citizen has received benefits from the state.</li>

<li>Every citizen has an obligation of gratitude not to act in ways
that are contrary to the state's interests.</li>

<li>Noncompliance with the law is contrary to the state's
interests.</li>

<li>Every citizen has an obligation of gratitude to comply with the
law.</li>
</ol>

<p>

Whether this argument does indeed provide the basis for a satisfactory
theory of political obligation seems to turn on two points. First, are
obligations of gratitude at all pertinent where political
<em>institutions</em> are concerned? Walker holds that one may have an
obligation of gratitude not only to other persons but also to
institutions, including the state or polity; but critics such as
Simmons disagree (1979, pp. 187–88; 2005, pp. 119–20).
Gratitude is owed only to those who intentionally and at significant
cost to themselves provide us with benefits, according to Simmons, and
institutions cannot satisfy these conditions. The second point
concerns the strength of obligations of gratitude. That is, one may
grant that we can have obligations to institutions, including the
state, yet hold that these obligations are “too weak to function
as prima facie political obligations in the usual sense,” for
they “would be overridden frequently, not just in unusual
circumstances” (Klosko 1989, p. 355). Walker, in response,
points to Socrates as someone who obviously thought his obligation of
gratitude was very strong indeed, and concludes that we “can
afford to acknowledge that the extent of our indebtedness to the state
is less than his, while still insisting that it grounds a strong,
though not absolute, obligation of gratitude to comply with the
law” (1989, p. 364; see also McConnell 1993, pp. 180–208,
and, more critically, Wellman 1999).</p>

<h3><a name="FaiPla">4.3 Fair Play</a></h3>

<p>

Although earlier philosophers, including Socrates, appealed to
something resembling the principle of fairness (or fair play), the
classic formulation of the principle is the one H. L. A. Hart gave it
in “Are There Any Natural Rights?” As Hart there says,
“when a number of persons conduct any joint enterprise according
to rules and thus restrict their liberty, those who have submitted to
these restrictions when required have a right to a similar submission
from those who have benefited by their submission” (1955,
p. 185). John Rawls subsequently adopted this principle in an
influential essay of his own, referring to the duty derived from the
principle as the “duty of fair play” (1964).  What the
principle of fair play holds, then, is that everyone who participates
in a reasonably just, mutually beneficial cooperative practice —
Hart's “joint enterprise according to rules” — has
an obligation to bear a fair share of the burdens of the practice.
This obligation is owed to the others who cooperate in the enterprise,
for cooperation is what makes it possible for any individual to enjoy
the benefits of the practice. Anyone who acts as a free rider is
acting wrongly, then, even if his or her shirking does not directly
threaten the existence or success of the endeavor. Those who
participate in the practice thus have rights against as well as
obligations to one another: a right to require others to bear their
share of the burdens and an obligation to bear one's share in
turn.</p>

<p>

The principle of fair play applies to a political society only if its
members can reasonably regard it as a cooperative enterprise. If they
can, the members have an obligation of fair play to do their part in
maintaining the enterprise. Because the rule of law is necessary to
the maintenance of such a polity — and perhaps even constitutive
of it — the principal form of cooperation is abiding by the
law. In the absence of overriding considerations, then, the members of
the polity <em>qua</em> cooperative practice must honor their
obligation to one another to obey the laws. In this way the principle
of fair play provides the grounding for a general obligation to obey
the law, at least on the part of those whose polity they can
reasonably regard as a cooperative enterprise.</p>

<p>

The argument from fair play has met with serious criticism, however,
including that of Rawls, who abandoned fair play as an account of
political obligation for citizens generally in <em>A Theory of
Justice</em> (p. 97, p. 308). The most sweeping criticism is that of
Robert Nozick, who objects that the principle of fair play would allow
others to place us under an obligation to them simply by conferring
benefits on us (1974, pp. 90–95). To make his point, Nozick
imagines a group of neighbors creating a public entertainment system
and assigning every adult in the neighborhood a day on which he or she
is responsible for planning and broadcasting the program. As a
resident of the neighborhood, you occasionally hear and enjoy the
programs, but you never consent to take part in this scheme. When your
assigned day arrives, are you obligated to take a turn? The principle
of fair play says yes, according to Nozick, but the correct answer is
“surely not.”</p>

<p>

A second objection, raised by M. B. E. Smith, is that “the
obligation of fair play governs a man's actions only when some benefit
or harm turns on whether he obeys” (in Edmundson 1999,
p. 81). This implies that the principle of fair play will generate an
obligation to cooperate only when the cooperative enterprise is small
enough that any participant's failure to obey the rules could
reasonably be expected to damage the enterprise. Political societies
are not small, cooperative enterprises, however, and we can readily
think of cases in which someone's disobedience neither deprives anyone
of any benefits nor harms the polity in any noticeable way. It
follows, then, that the principle of fair play cannot ground a general
obligation to obey the law, however useful it may be in other
circumstances.</p>

<p>

According to a third objection, fair play considerations apply only to
cooperative schemes that produce benefits one may refuse. If it
produces <em>nonexcludable</em> goods, which everyone receives
regardless of whether she contributed to their production or even
wants them, then there can be no fair-play obligation to bear a share
of the burdens of the enterprise. But this is typically the case in
political societies, which produce goods such as public order and
national defense that one cannot meaningfully refuse to accept. As
Simmons puts it (1979, p. 129), there is a difference
between <em>receiving</em> and <em>accepting</em> benefits, and merely
receiving them is not enough to place someone under an obligation.  If
there is a political obligation, therefore, it does not follow
directly from the existence of the kind of nonexcludable goods that
states provide.  To be sure, Simmons does acknowledge that some people
may acquire fair-play obligations by enjoying nonexcludable benefits
that they take to be “worth the price [they] pay for them”
if they do so in full awareness that “the benefits <em>are</em>
provided by a cooperative scheme” (1979, p. 132, emphasis in
original).  But he also maintains that few people will satisfy both of
these conditions, with the second proving especially troublesome for
advocates of fair–play theory; for “even in democratic
political communities, these benefits are commonly regarded as
purchased (with taxes) from a central authority rather than as
accepted from the cooperative efforts of our fellow citizens”
(1979, p. 139).</p>

<p>

As one might expect, advocates of the fair-play account have not
remained silent in the face of these criticisms. The leading advocate,
George Klosko, has written two books elaborating and defending the
principle of fairness as the foundation of political obligation (2004
[1992], 2005), and it sometimes seems that every fresh attack on fair
play provokes a swift response (e.g., Carr 2002 and Lefkowitz
2004). And the attacks have certainly continued (e.g., Simmons 2001,
chap. 2; McDermott 2004), as we shall indicate shortly. First, though,
it is necessary to see how fair-play advocates have responded to the
three criticisms sketched above.</p>

<p>

With regard to Nozick's objection, the response is usually to hold
that his example of the neighborhood entertainment system is beside
the point (Bell 1978). That is, Nozick is probably right to say that
one would have no obligation to operate the system on his or her
assigned day, but he is wrong to think fair play would require one to
do so.  There is no fair play obligation in cases such as this, either
because the passive receipt of benefits is not enough to show that one
is a <em>participant</em> in a cooperative practice (Dagger 1997,
pp. 69–70) or because the benefits are “of relatively
little value” (Klosko 2004, pp. 38–39).  To Smith's
objection, the response is that fairness is not a consideration only
when harm or benefit to some person or practice is involved. To fail
to do one's part in a cooperative enterprise is to <em>wrong</em>
those who cooperate even when it does not clearly harm either them or
the enterprise as such (Dagger 1997, p. 71).</p>

<p> 

Responses to Simmons' objection have taken two directions. One is to
say that Simmons has drawn too sharp a distinction between the
acceptance and receipt of benefits. Between the person who passively
receives the benefits of a cooperative practice and the one who
knowingly and willingly accepts them is the person — very many
people, in fact — who actively participates in the practice
without being fully aware, in the ordinary course of life, that he or
she is undertaking an obligation to do his or her part by
participating in a cooperative practice (Dagger 1997, pp. 73–78;
Besson 2005, pp. 487–89). Like Michael Hardimon and other
proponents of the associative theory of political obligation (see
§4.4, below), in other words, those who take this position
believe that there is no straightforward dichotomy between what is
fully voluntary and what is altogether involuntary.  In the middle
ground, they hold, there is room for the voluntary — but not
deliberate or completely conscious — acceptance of obligations.
Others respond to Simmons' criticism by denying that fair-play
obligations must be incurred voluntarily (Arneson 1982; Klosko 2004,
39–57). What matters is not that one accepts the benefits of the
practice, according to Klosko's influential account, but that three
conditions are met: “Goods supplied must be (i) worth the
recipients' effort in providing them; (ii) ‘presumptively
beneficial’; and (iii) have benefits and burdens that are fairly
distributed” (2004, p. 39). If, in sum, a state qualifies as a
cooperative enterprise, and if it provides its members with goods that
are presumptively beneficial — or “indispensable for
satisfactory lives” (Klosko 2005, p. 6) — then its members
have an obligation grounded in fairness to obey its laws.</p>

<p>

Whether these responses have swayed philosophical opinion in the
direction of fair–play theory is difficult to say, but they
clearly have not settled the debate in its favor.  Simmons, for one,
continues to hold that modern political societies are too large and
impersonal to count as cooperative enterprises (2001, pp. 38–42).  He
also contends that Klosko's theory is “not really
a <em>fairness</em> theory at all,” but a “disguised
Natural Duty theory, resting on an unstated moral duty to help supply
essential goods locally …” (2005, p. 190, emphasis in
original; also 2007, pp. 22–23).  Others complain that fair-play
theory is not suitably sensitive to the possible alternatives there
may have been to the cooperative practices that have emerged.  We may
admit, on this view, that people receive benefits from a cooperative
practice, and even net benefits, but we should also notice that they
might have benefited more from the establishment of a different
practice.  To say, in these circumstances, that those who are engaged
in a cooperative practice have an obligation to do their part is to
accept the principle of fairness as “a powerfully conservative
principle” (Normore 2010, p. 231).  In the political context,
according to another critic, the proper comparison is between a state
of affairs in which benefits follow from other people's obeying the
laws in the sense of mere compliance, on the one hand, and a situation
in which benefits follow from others' obeying specifically
“<em>because</em> the law says to do it” (Durning 2003,
p. 255).  If the benefits are the same in both cases, then there is no
reason to think that true cooperation, rather than mere compliance, is
producing the benefits, and hence no reason to think that those who
receive the benefits have a fair-play obligation to obey the laws.</p>

<p>

Arguments such as these seem more likely to prolong than to settle the
debate over the principle of fair play.  For conservatives, in fact,
the claim that fair play is “a powerfully conservative
principle” is hardly a reason to reject the principle.  Others
may note that having a fair–play obligation to the members of an
ongoing enterprise does not bar anyone from trying to transform that
enterprise, perhaps even by means of civil disobedience.  As for the
argument that compliance rather than cooperation is all that is
necessary to provide the benefits ordinarily associated with political
societies, it seems likely to do no more than renew controversies
about the nature of such societies and the viability of philosophical
anarchism.  The question, in other words, is whether we can expect a
polity to survive if its “members” regard one another not
as cooperators in a common enterprise but exclusively as purchasers of
governmental services who comply with the law under the threat of
coercion.  For these reasons, fair-play theory is likely to remain a
live but much disputed option for those who believe in political
obligation.</p>

<h3><a name="MemAss">4.4 Membership or Association</a></h3>

<p>

According to proponents of a theory that has emerged in the last
thirty years or so, political obligation is best understood as an
“associative” obligation grounded in membership. If we are
members of a group, they argue, then we are under an
obligation, <em>ceteris paribus</em>, to comply with the norms that
govern it. Nor does this obligation follow from our consenting to
become members, for it holds even in the case of groups or
associations, such as families and polities, that people typically do
not consent to join. Voluntary or not, membership entails
obligation. Anyone who acknowledges membership in a particular polity
must therefore acknowledge that he or she has a general obligation to
obey its laws.</p>

<p>

At the core of the associative approach is the idea that political
obligation is a form of non-voluntary obligation on a par with
familial obligations. In Ronald Dworkin's words, “Political
association, like family and friendship and other forms of association
more local and intimate, is in itself pregnant of obligation”
(1986, p.  206). The same idea, with an explicit analogy between
family and polity, is at work in John Horton's account of political
obligation:</p>

<blockquote>

My claim is that a polity is, like the family, a relationship into
which we are mostly born: and that the obligations which are
constitutive of the relationship do not stand in need of moral
justification in terms of a set of basic moral principles or some
comprehensive moral theory. Furthermore, both the family and the
political community figure prominently in our sense of who we are: our
self-identity and our understanding of our place in the world (1992,
pp. 150–51).</blockquote>

<p>

As members of families and political communities, on this view, we are
subject to what Michael Hardimon calls “noncontractual role
obligations” — that is, obligations that simply flow from
“roles into which we are born” (1994, p. 347).</p>

<p>

The associative account of political obligation has at least three
attractive features. The first is the refusal of its proponents to
treat ‘voluntary’ and ‘involuntary’ as two
parts of a dichotomy. It is true, they say, that most people do not
voluntarily undertake to become members of a polity, but that hardly
means that membership has been forced or imposed on them. There is a
middle ground, and it is fertile soil for a theory of political
obligation, just as it is for those who believe that being a member of
a family entails obligations that we have neither chosen, on the one
hand, nor incurred against our will, on the other. A second attraction
of the associative account is that it squares with a common intuition,
as a great many people apparently do think of themselves as members of
political societies who have an obligation to obey their polities'
laws. This intuition, moreover, points to the third attractive
feature, which is the way in which the obligation to obey the laws
grows out of the sense of <em>identity</em> that members of a polity
commonly share. If this is <em>my</em> polity, and I find myself
thinking of its concerns as something that <em>we</em> members share,
and its government as <em>our</em> government, then it will be easy to
think also that I have an obligation to obey its laws. For Yael Tamir,
in fact, “the true essence of associative obligations” is
that they “are not grounded on consent, reciprocity, or
gratitude, but rather on a feeling of belonging or
connectedness” (Tamir, p, 137; see also Scheffler 2001, esp. p. 64).</p>

<p>

Like the other theories of political obligation, however, the
membership account has met with considerable criticism, with three
main objections being raised (Simmons 1996; Wellman 1997; Dagger
2000).  First, the critics maintain that the analogy between the
polity and the family is neither persuasive nor attractive. It is
unpersuasive because the members of the modern polity lack the close
and intimate relationships with one another that family members
typically share; and it is unattractive because it raises the
possibility that the paternalism appropriate within the family may be
extended to the polity. Second, the critics object that the
associative account conflates the <em>sense</em> of obligation with
obligation itself. As Wolff and other philosophical anarchists have
argued, the fact that many people feel a sense of identity with and
obligation to their countries does not mean that they really have such
an obligation; nor need one be a philosophical anarchist to share this
conclusion.  Finally, there is the problem of what may be called group
character.  All groups have members, including groups that are not
decent, fair, or morally praiseworthy; but if membership is sufficient
to generate an obligation to obey, then the members of unjust and
exploitative groups will have an obligation to obey the rules. In the
case of the polity, this leads to the unpalatable and
counter-intuitive conclusion that the routinely exploited and
oppressed “members” of an unjust polity are under an
obligation to obey its laws.</p>

<p>

Whether the proponents of the associative theory can overcome these
objections remains, not surprisingly, a matter of debate.  In some
cases the proponents attempt to meet the critics head on, as Horton
does in the second edition of his <em>Political Obligation</em>
(2010). There Horton develops a two-pronged account of political
obligation according to which the polity in question must supply the
“generic good of order and security” and its members must
identify with it and acknowledge its political authority (2010,
p. 177, p. 184). In other cases, proponents attempt to bolster the
associative theory by incorporating elements of other theories, as in
Massimo Renzo's “quasi-voluntarist reformulation of the
associative model,” with its claim that we voluntarily occupy
our roles even in families and polities as long as “we could
have stepped out of them if we had wanted” (2012, p. 109,
p. 120).  To others, however, appeals to membership may be valuable
“as conceptual explorations of the hermeneutics or the
phenomenology of political association,” but they “will
not generate political obligations unless the communities they
describe can be legitimated in accordance with one or more of the
standard repertory of arguments …” (Knowles 2010,
p. 190).</p>

<h3><a name="NatDut">4.5 Natural Duty</a></h3>

<p>

The final contenders in the political obligation debates are natural
duty accounts.  In this context, natural duties are understood to be
ones people have simply in virtue of their status as moral agents;
they need do nothing to acquire them, nor does their bearing such
duties depend on their occupying some role in a socially salient
relationship.  Natural duties are also universal in scope; they are
owed to all members of a class defined in terms of possession of some
feature, such as sentience or rationality.  John Rawls first broached
such an argument for political obligation when he asserted in <em>A
Theory of Justice</em> that everyone is subject to a natural duty of
justice that “requires us to support and to comply with just
institutions that exist and apply to us” (1999 [1971],
p. 99). More recently, Jeremy Waldron (1993, 1999), Thomas Christiano
(2008), Christopher Heath Wellman (2005), Anna Stilz (2009), and,
arguably, David Estlund (2008; see §4.1, above) have refined and
expanded upon Rawls's somewhat vague contention, some of them in ways
reminiscent of or even explicitly modeled on Kant's defense of
political obligation (see §1.5, above).</p>

<p>

Contemporary natural duty theorists differ over the natural duty that
provides the basis for political obligation.  Christiano grounds his
account in a fundamental principle of justice requiring the equal
advancement of people's interests, Wellman in a Samaritan duty of easy
rescue, and Stilz in a Kantian duty of respect for others's
freedom-as-independence, understood as a secure sphere of
self-determination defined by a person's rights.  These theorists
agree, however, that moral agents can discharge their natural duty to
others only through submission to the authority of a common legal
order.  This is so for several reasons: the demands of justice are
sometimes underdetermined; its achievement requires the resolution of
coordination problems; and most important, people reasonably disagree
over the demands of justice.  Christiano traces this disagreement to
what he calls the facts of judgment: diversity in people's natural
talents and cultural surroundings, cognitive biases in their
interpretation of people's interests and the value assigned to their
own interests relative to the value assigned to the interests of
others, and fallibility in both moral and non-moral judgment.  In
light of these facts, even those who make a good faith effort to
discern what justice requires of them in their interaction with others
will fail to reach a consensus.  Agents who act on their own, private,
judgment of justice will be perceived by others to be acting unjustly.
If some are able to unilaterally impose their conception of justice on
others, the latter will not enjoy freedom-as-independence (Stilz
2009), or will suffer the violation of their fundamental interests in
being at home in the world, in correcting for others' cognitive
biases, and in being treated by one's fellows as a person with equal
moral standing (Christiano).  Only submission to a common legal order
can provide a solution to this problem of domination and conflict,
argue the natural duty proponents of political obligation.
“There is no way other than general compliance with a single
authoritative set of rules to secure peace and protect basic moral
rights” (Wellman 2005, p. 45); law “settle[s] for
practical purposes what justice consists in by promulgating public
rules for the guidance of individual behavior” (Christiano,
p. 53); or in Stilz's Kantian terms, law replaces the unilateral
imposition of obligations on others with the omnilateral imposition of
obligations on all.</p>

<p>

Not just any legal order will do, though.  Rather, many natural duty
theorists of political obligation argue either that the law must
crafted according to democratic procedures or that it must not violate
certain individual rights, or both, if those it addresses are to have
a duty to obey it.  Christiano, for instance, argues that against a
background constituted by diversity, cognitive bias, and fallibility,
agents can be sure that their fundamental interest in judgment will
not be unjustifiably set back only if political power is exercised
within institutions that publicly realize equality, i.e., democratic
ones.  Likewise, Waldron defends the authority of a majority-rule
decision procedure on the basis of its “commitment to equality
— a determination that when we, who need to settle on a single
course of action, disagree about what to do, there is no reasonable
basis for us in designing our decision-procedures to accord greater
weight to one side than to the other in the disagreement”
(Waldron 1999, p. 117; see also Lefkowitz 2005a).  Even if a person
does not believe that the particular scheme of distributive justice
realized in the law treats her justly, she can recognize that the
process whereby that scheme was created, and can be modified or
eliminated, does treat her as an equal.  Stilz argues that law
omnilaterally imposes obligations on all only if it expresses a
general will.  It does the latter if and only if it “first,
defines rights (protected interests) that apply equally to all;
second, it defines these rights via a procedure that considers
everyone's interests equally; and third, everyone who is coerced to
obey the law has a voice in the procedure” (Stilz 2009, p. 78).
The latter two conditions, she maintains, can only be met by a
democratic procedure.</p>

<p>

Whatever its details, many natural duty theorists also argue that the
conception of the person that grounds their accounts of political
obligation also limits the scope of legitimate law.  Reasonable
disagreement over freedom-as-independence does not extend to torture,
for example, and at some perhaps indeterminate point the denial of
freedom of conscience clearly conflicts with a person's fundamental
interests in correcting for cognitive bias and being at home in the
world.  Most natural duty theorists conclude that subjects of a legal
order that recognizes no rights on the part of some or all of its
subjects against such treatment lacks legitimate authority, even if it
is democratic.</p>

<p>

Recall that natural duty accounts of political obligation begin with
duties that all moral agents owe to all other moral persons as such.
Simmons argues that this commitment renders natural duty accounts
unable to justify the particularity of political obligations; that is,
the fact that people have political obligations in virtue of their
citizenship or residence in particular states, and that they owe those
obligations to that particular state (or to their fellow citizens)
(Simmons 1979, pp. 31–35; 2005, pp. 166–79).  Even if we have a
natural duty “to support and comply with just
institutions,” as Rawls claims, why must we discharge that duty
by supporting and complying with the just institutions that comprise
the state in which we are citizens or residents?  True, those are the
institutions that “apply to us,” in the sense that they
claim jurisdiction over us.  But why think that this social fact has
any moral import, particularly if we think the political institutions
of other states more worthy of our support because they better promote
justice, or are in greater need of support?</p>

<p>

Some natural duty theorists point to the intensity and frequency of
interaction among those who live in close proximity to one another as
a justification for the duty to obey the laws of the particular
jurisdiction in which one resides (Waldron 1993, 1996).  Others
emphasize that a person who free-rides on his fellow citizens' support
for and compliance with the law to act on his own judgment of how he
can best discharge his natural duty of justice unfairly takes
advantage of them.  Absent their good-faith sacrifice of the liberty
to act on their private judgments regarding what justice requires, the
free-rider would likely be unable to act as he does (Wellman 2005,
pp. 44–45).  Finally, some natural duty theorists argue that Simmons
misconstrues the natural duty of justice.  Justice is not an outcome
or state of affairs that agents have a duty to promote via whatever
means they judge to be most effective or efficient, be it the
political institutions of their state or those of another.  Rather,
justice characterizes a particular manner of interacting with others,
such as with respect for their freedom-as-independence or their
fundamental interests, including but not limited to their interests in
judgment.  At least for a citizen of a liberal democratic state, the
latter construal of justice entails that she can only treat her fellow
citizens justly if she guides her conduct according to its law.</p>

<p>

Simmons has recently rebutted this second line of argument (Simmons
2013; but cf. Stilz 2013).  The argument entails, he claims, that
citizens of one liberal-democratic state who are forcibly subjected to
the rule of another liberal-democratic state immediately acquire
political obligations to the second state as long as they are accorded
full citizenship rights.  Simmons treats this implication as
a <em>reductio ad absurdum</em> of the democratic Kantian
justification for political obligation, a demonstration that it cannot
properly account for the particularity of such obligations.  In part,
this latest rejoinder by Simmons evidences and gives further impetus
to a shift in the debate over political obligation from the question
of what gives states a right to rule particular people, to which
correlates their duty to obey the law, to the question of what gives
states a right to rule over a particular territory.  But it also
points to the need for natural duty theorists to elaborate upon their
so far brief discussions of the contribution that a legitimate
international legal order makes to the legitimacy of domestic legal
orders.</p>

<h2><a name="ConPluPri">5. Conclusion: A Plurality of Principles?</a></h2>

<p>

The five theories of political obligation sketched above do not
exhaust the possibilities — Dorota Mokrosinska, for instance,
has recently advanced a “civil justice” theory in her <em>Rethinking
Political Obligation</em> — but they seem to represent the main
lines of argument.  Indeed, even Mokrosinska acknowledges that her
“argument from civil justice combines elements of both natural
duty accounts and associative theories” (2012, p. 174). In fact,
the search for a hybrid theory is something a number of philosophers
have undertaken, either implicitly or explicitly, in recent
years. Gilbert (2006) and Steinberger (2004), for example, seem to
have developed hybrid theories without ever advertising them as
such. Gilbert's theory fuses the consent and associative approaches
through her reliance on joint <em>commitments</em> to a <em>plural
subject</em>, or group. For his part, Steinberger combines the consent
and natural-duty approaches, arguing that any “generalized
attempt to divorce obligations from natural duties, to find
justifications for the former that are entirely independent of the
latter, is … doomed to fail” (2004, p.  211).  Wellman
evidently agrees with this point, but he explicitly acknowledges the
hybrid nature of his theory, which combines an appeal to the natural
duty of Samaritanism with reliance on the argument from fair play
(2005, esp. chap. 2).</p>

<p>

Others, notably Klosko (2005), Jonathan Wolff (1995, 2000), and Dudley
Knowles (2010), have explicitly called for a pluralistic or
multiple-principle approach to political obligation. There is no
single answer to the problem of political obligation, as they see it,
because the problem has more than one aspect. Not every
“member” of a polity will stand in the same relation to
its laws, for instance, which means that it is a mistake to think that
everyone must have the same general obligation to obey. Nor is every
obligation of equal force. Some are weak, such as the notorious
obligation to stop at a traffic signal when no one else is around, and
others are quite strong. Klosko thus thinks it necessary to rely on
the principle of fairness to supply the core of a justification, but
to supplement it with appeals to natural duty and the common good
(2006, chap. 5).</p>

<p>

As yet there has been little reaction to these attempts to fuse
approaches and draw on multiple principles in the attempt to provide a
satisfactory theory of political obligation (but see Edmundson 2004,
pp. 250–52). Those who doubt that such a theory can be constructed,
however, are likely to say that combining principles, whether in
hybrid or pluralist fashion, will not help, for combining a set of
principles that are unsatisfactory individually will hardly produce a
strong and satisfying theory (Simmons 2007, n. 17). On the other hand,
those who believe that political obligation is fundamentally a problem
of showing that those who live in a polity governed by the rule of law
do indeed have a <em>general</em> obligation to obey its laws, rather
than a bundle of obligations to obey its laws severally, in piecemeal
fashion (e.g., Mapel 2005), are likely to see no need for a plurality
of principles.  Whether a plurality of principles is necessary or even
desirable, in sum, remains one of many open questions with regard to
the vexing problem of political obligation.</p>
