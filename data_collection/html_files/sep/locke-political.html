<h1>Locke’s Political Philosophy</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Wed Nov 9, 2005; substantive revision Mon Jan 11, 2016</em></div>

<div id="preamble">
<p>
John Locke (1632–1704) is among the most influential political
philosophers of the modern period. In the <em>Two Treatises of
Government</em>, he defended the claim that men are by nature free and
equal against claims that God had made all people naturally subject to
a monarch. He argued that people have rights, such as the right to
life, liberty, and property, that have a foundation independent of the
laws of any particular society. Locke used the claim that men are
naturally free and equal as part of the justification for
understanding legitimate political government as the result of a
social contract where people in the state of nature conditionally
transfer some of their rights to the government in order to better
ensure the stable, comfortable enjoyment of their lives, liberty, and
property. Since governments exist by the consent of the people in
order to protect the rights of the people and promote the public good,
governments that fail to do so can be resisted and replaced with new
governments. Locke is thus also important for his defense of the right
of revolution. Locke also defends the principle of majority rule and
the separation of legislative and executive powers. In the <em>Letter
Concerning Toleration</em>, Locke denied that coercion should be used
to bring people to (what the ruler believes is) the true religion and
also denied that churches should have any coercive power over their
members. Locke elaborated on these themes in his later political
writings, such as the <em>Second Letter on Toleration</em> and
<em>Third Letter on Toleration</em>.</p>

<h2><a name="LawNat">1. Natural Law and Natural Rights</a></h2>

<p>
Perhaps the most central concept in Locke’s political philosophy is
his theory of natural law and natural rights. The natural law concept
existed long before Locke as a way of expressing the idea that there
were certain moral truths that applied to all people, regardless of
the particular place where they lived or the agreements they had made.
The most important early contrast was between laws that were by
nature, and thus generally applicable, and those that were
conventional and operated only in those places where the particular
convention had been established. This distinction is sometimes
formulated as the difference between natural law and positive law.</p>

<p>
Natural law is also distinct from divine law in that the latter, in
the Christian tradition, normally referred to those laws that God had
directly revealed through prophets and other inspired writers. Natural
law can be discovered by reason alone and applies to all people, while
divine law can be discovered only through God’s special revelation and
applies only to those to whom it is revealed and who God specifically
indicates are to be bound. Thus some seventeenth-century commentators,
Locke included, held that not all of the 10 commandments, much less
the rest of the Old Testament law, were binding on all people. The 10
commandments begin “Hear O Israel” and thus are only
binding on the people to whom they were addressed (<em>Works</em>
6:37). As we will see below, even though Locke thought natural law
could be known apart from special revelation, he saw no contradiction
in God playing a part in the argument, so long as the relevant aspects
of God’s character could be discovered by reason alone. In Locke’s
theory, divine law and natural law are consistent and can overlap in
content, but they are not coextensive. Thus there is no problem for
Locke if the Bible commands a moral code that is stricter than the one
that can be derived from natural law, but there is a real problem if
the Bible teaches what is contrary to natural law. In practice, Locke
avoided this problem because consistency with natural law was one of
the criteria he used when deciding the proper interpretation of
Biblical passages.</p>

<p>
In the century before Locke, the language of natural rights also
gained prominence through the writings of such thinkers as Grotius,
Hobbes, and Pufendorf. Whereas natural law emphasized duties, natural
rights normally emphasized privileges or claims to which an individual
was entitled. There is considerable disagreement as to how these
factors are to be understood in relation to each other in Locke’s
theory. Leo Strauss, and many of his followers, take rights to be
paramount, going so far as to portray Locke’s position as essentially
similar to that of Hobbes. They point out that Locke defended a
hedonist theory of human motivation (<em>Essay</em> 2.20) and claim
that he must agree with Hobbes about the essentially self-interested
nature of human beings. Locke, they claim, recognizes natural law
obligations only in those situations where our own preservation is not
in conflict, further emphasizing that our right to preserve ourselves
trumps any duties we may have.</p>

<p>
On the other end of the spectrum, more scholars have adopted the view
of Dunn, Tully, and Ashcraft that it is natural law, not natural
rights, that is primary. They hold that when Locke emphasized the
right to life, liberty, and property he was primarily making a point
about the duties we have toward other people: duties not to kill,
enslave, or steal. Most scholars also argue that Locke recognized a
general duty to assist with the preservation of mankind, including a
duty of charity to those who have no other way to procure their
subsistence (<em>Two Treatises</em> 1.42). These scholars regard
duties as primary in Locke because rights exist to ensure that we are
able to fulfill our duties. Simmons takes a position similar to the
latter group, but claims that rights are not just the flip side of
duties in Locke, nor merely a means to performing our duties. Instead,
rights and duties are equally fundamental because Locke believes in a
“robust zone of indifference” in which rights protect our
ability to make choices. While these choices cannot violate natural
law, they are not a mere means to fulfilling natural law either. Brian
Tienrey questions whether one needs to prioritize natural law or
natural right since both typically function as corollaries. He argues
that modern natural rights theories are a development from medieval
conceptions of natural law that included permissions to act or not act
in certain ways. </p>

<p>
There have been some attempts to find a compromise between these
positions. Michael Zuckert’s version of the Straussian position
acknowledges more differences between Hobbes and Locke. Zuckert still
questions the sincerity of Locke’s theism, but thinks that Locke
does develop a position that grounds property rights in the fact that
human beings own themselves, something Hobbes denied. Adam Seagrave
has gone a step further. He argues that the contradiction between
Locke’s claim that human beings are owned by God and that human
beings own themselves is only apparent. Based on passages from
Locke’s other writings (especially the <em>Essay Concnerning Human
Understanding</em>) In the passages about divine ownership, Locke is
speaking about humanity as a whole, while in the passages about
self-ownership he is taking about individual human beings with the
capacity for property ownership. God created human beings who are
capable of having property rights with respect to one another on the
basis of owning their labor. Both of them emphasize differences
between Locke’s use of natural rights and the earlier tradition of
natural law. </p>

<p>
Another point of contestation has to do with the extent to which Locke
thought natural law could, in fact, be known by reason. Both Strauss
and Peter Laslett, though very different in their interpretations of
Locke generally, see Locke’s theory of natural law as filled with
contradictions. In the <em>Essay Concerning Human Understanding</em>,
Locke defends a theory of moral knowledge that negates the possibility
of innate ideas (<em>Essay</em> Book 1) and claims that morality is
capable of demonstration in the same way that Mathematics is
(<em>Essay</em> 3.11.16, 4.3.18–20). Yet nowhere in any of his
works does Locke make a full deduction of natural law from first
premises. More than that, Locke at times seems to appeal to innate
ideas in the <em>Second Treatise</em> (2.11), and in <em>The
Reasonableness of Christianity</em> (<em>Works</em> 7:139) he admits
that no one has ever worked out all of natural law from reason alone.
Strauss infers from this that the contradictions exist to show the
attentive reader that Locke does not really believe in natural law at
all. Laslett, more conservatively, simply says that Locke the
philosopher and Locke the political writer should be kept very
separate.</p>

<p>
Many scholars reject this position. Yolton, Colman, Ashcraft, Grant,
Simmons, Tuckness and others all argue that there is nothing strictly
inconsistent in Locke’s admission in <em>The Reasonableness of
Christianity</em>. That no one has deduced all of natural law from
first principles does not mean that none of it has been deduced. The
supposedly contradictory passages in the <em>Two Treatises</em> are
far from decisive. While it is true that Locke does not provide a
deduction in the <em>Essay</em>, it is not clear that he was trying
to. Section 4.10.1–19 of that work seems more concerned to show
how reasoning with moral terms is possible, not to actually provide a
full account of natural law. Nonetheless, it must be admitted that
Locke did not treat the topic of natural law as systematically as one
might like. Attempts to work out his theory in more detail with
respect to its ground and its content must try to reconstruct it from
scattered passages in many different texts.</p>

<p>
To understand Locke’s position on the ground of natural law it must be
situated within a larger debate in natural law theory that predates
Locke, the so-called “voluntarism-intellectualism,” or
“voluntarist-rationalist” debate. At its simplest, the
voluntarist declares that right and wrong are determined by God’s will
and that we are obliged to obey the will of God simply because it is
the will of God. Unless these positions are maintained, the
voluntarist argues, God becomes superfluous to morality since both the
content and the binding force of morality can be explained without
reference to God. The intellectualist replies that this understanding
makes morality arbitrary and fails to explain why we have an
obligation to obey God.</p>

<p>
With respect to the grounds and content of natural law, Locke is not
completely clear. On the one hand, there are many instances where he
makes statements that sound voluntarist to the effect that law
requires a law giver with authority (<em>Essay</em> 1.3.6, 4.10.7).
Locke also repeatedly insists in the <em>Essays on the Law of
Nature</em> that created beings have an obligation to obey their
creator (<em>ELN</em> 6). On the other hand there are statements that
seem to imply an external moral standard to which God must conform
(<em>Two Treatises</em> 2.195; <em>Works</em> 7:6). Locke clearly
wants to avoid the implication that the content of natural law is
arbitrary. Several solutions have been proposed. One solution
suggested by Herzog makes Locke an intellectualist by grounding our
obligation to obey God on a prior duty of gratitude that exists
independent of God. A second option, suggested by Simmons, is simply
to take Locke as a voluntarist since that is where the preponderance
of his statements point. A third option, suggested by Tuckness (and
implied by Grant), is to treat the question of voluntarism as having
two different parts, grounds and content. On this view, Locke was
indeed a voluntarist with respect to the question “why should we
obey the law of nature?” Locke thought that reason, apart from
the will of a superior, could only be advisory. With respect to
content, divine reason and human reason must be sufficiently analogous
that human beings can reason about what God likely wills. Locke takes
it for granted that since God created us with reason in order to
follow God’s will, human reason and divine reason are sufficiently
similar that natural law will not seem arbitrary to us.</p>

<p>
Those interested in the contemporary relevance of Locke’s political
theory must confront its theological aspects. Straussians make Locke’s
theory relevant by claiming that the theological dimensions of his
thought are primarily rhetorical; they are “cover” to keep
him from being persecuted by the religious authorities of his day.
Others, such as Dunn, take Locke to be of only limited relevance to
contemporary politics precisely because so many of his arguments
depend on religious assumptions that are no longer widely shared. More
recently a number of authors, such as Simmons and Vernon, have tried
to separate the foundations of Locke’s argument from other aspects of
it. Simmons, for example, argues that Locke’s thought is
over-determined, containing both religious and secular arguments. He
claims that for Locke the fundamental law of nature is that “as
much as possible mankind is to be preserved” (<em>Two
Treatises</em> 135). At times, he claims, Locke presents this
principle in rule-consequentialist terms: it is the principle we use
to determine the more specific rights and duties that all have. At
other times, Locke hints at a more Kantian justification that
emphasizes the impropriety of treating our equals as if they were mere
means to our ends. Waldron, in his most recent work on Locke, explores
the opposite claim: that Locke’s theology actually provides a more
solid basis for his premise of political equality than do contemporary
secular approaches that tend to simply assert equality.</p>

<p>
With respect to the specific content of natural law, Locke never
provides a comprehensive statement of what it requires. In the <em>Two
Treatises</em>, Locke frequently states that the fundamental law of
nature is that as much as possible mankind is to be preserved. Simmons
argues that in <em>Two Treatises</em> 2.6 Locke presents 1) a duty to
preserve one’s self, 2) a duty to preserve others when
self-preservation does not conflict, 3) a duty not to take away the
life of another, and 4) a duty not to act in a way that “tends
to destroy” others. Libertarian interpreters of Locke tend to
downplay duties of type 1 and 2. Locke presents a more extensive list
in his earlier, and unpublished in his lifetime, <em>Essays on the Law
of Nature</em>. Interestingly, Locke here includes praise and honor of
the deity as required by natural law as well as what we might call
good character qualities.</p>

<h2><a name="StaNat">2. State of Nature</a></h2>

<p>
Locke’s concept of the state of nature has been interpreted by
commentators in a variety of ways. At first glance it seems quite
simple. Locke writes “want [lack] of a common judge, with
authority, puts all persons in a state of nature” and again,
“Men living according to reason, without a common superior on
earth, to judge between them, is properly the state of nature.”
(<em>Two Treatises</em> 2.19) Many commentators have taken this as
Locke’s definition, concluding that the state of nature exists
wherever there is no legitimate political authority able to judge
disputes and where people live according to the law of reason. On this
account the state of nature is distinct from political society, where
a legitimate government exists, and from a state of war where men fail
to abide by the law of reason.</p>

<p>
Simmons presents an important challenge to this view. Simmons points
out that the above statement is worded as a sufficient rather than
necessary condition. Two individuals might be able, in the state of
nature, to authorize a third to settle disputes between them without
leaving the state of nature, since the third party would not have, for
example, the power to legislate for the public good. Simmons also
claims that other interpretations often fail to account for the fact
that there are some people who live in states with legitimate
governments who are nonetheless in the state of nature: visiting
aliens (2.9), children below the age of majority (2.15, 118), and
those with a “defect” of reason (2.60). He claims that the
state of nature is a relational concept describing a particular set of
moral relations that exist between particular people, rather than a
description of a particular geographical territory. The state of
nature is just the way of describing the moral rights and
responsibilities that exist between people who have not consented to
the adjudication of their disputes by the same legitimate government.
The groups just mentioned either have not or cannot give consent, so
they remain in the state of nature. Thus A may be in the state of
nature with respect to B, but not with C.</p>

<p>
Simmons’ account stands in sharp contrast to that of Strauss.
According to Strauss, Locke presents the state of nature as a factual
description of what the earliest society is like, an account that when
read closely reveals Locke’s departure from Christian teachings. State
of nature theories, he and his followers argue, are contrary to the
Biblical account in Genesis and evidence that Locke’s teaching is
similar to that of Hobbes. As noted above, on the Straussian account
Locke’s apparently Christian statements are only a façade
designed to conceal his essentially anti-Christian views. According to
Simmons, since the state of nature is a moral account, it is
compatible with a wide variety of social accounts without
contradiction. If we know only that a group of people are in a state
of nature, we know only the rights and responsibilities they have
toward one another; we know nothing about whether they are rich or
poor, peaceful or warlike.</p>

<p>
A complementary interpretation is made by John Dunn with respect to
the relationship between Locke’s state of nature and his Christian
beliefs. Dunn claimed that Locke’s state of nature is less an exercise
in historical anthropology than a theological reflection on the
condition of man. On Dunn’s interpretation, Locke’s state of nature
thinking is an expression of his theological position, that man exists
in a world created by God for God’s purposes but that governments are
created by men in order to further those purposes.</p>

<p>
Locke’s theory of the state of nature will thus be tied closely to his
theory of natural law, since the latter defines the rights of persons
and their status as free and equal persons. The stronger the grounds
for accepting Locke’s characterization of people as free, equal, and
independent, the more helpful the state of nature becomes as a device
for representing people. Still, it is important to remember that none
of these interpretations claims that Locke’s state of nature is
<em>only</em> a thought experiment, in the way Kant and Rawls are
normally thought to use the concept. Locke did not respond to the
argument “where have there ever been people in such a
state” by saying it did not matter since it was only a thought
experiment. Instead, he argued that there are and have been people in
the state of nature. (<em>Two Treatises</em> 2.14) It seems important
to him that at least some governments have actually been formed in the
way he suggests. How much it matters whether they have been or not
will be discussed below under the topic of consent, since the central
question is whether a good government can be legitimate even if it
does not have the actual consent of the people who live under it;
hypothetical contract and actual contract theories will tend to answer
this question differently.</p>

<h2><a name="Pro">3. Property</a></h2>

<p>
Locke’s treatment of property is generally thought to be among his
most important contributions in political thought, but it is also one
of the aspects of his thought that has been most heavily criticized.
There are important debates over what exactly Locke was trying to
accomplish with his theory. One interpretation, advanced by C.B.
Macpherson, sees Locke as a defender of unrestricted capitalist
accumulation. On Macpherson’s interpretation, Locke is thought to have
set three restrictions on the accumulation of property in the state of
nature: 1) one may only appropriate as much as one can use before it
spoils (<em>Two Treatises</em> 2.31), 2) one must leave “enough
and as good” for others (the sufficiency restriction) (2.27),
and 3) one may (supposedly) only appropriate property through one’s
own labor (2.27). Macpherson claims that as the argument progresses,
each of these restrictions is transcended. The spoilage restriction
ceases to be a meaningful restriction with the invention of money
because value can be stored in a medium that does not decay
(2.46–47). The sufficiency restriction is transcended because
the creation of private property so increases productivity that even
those who no longer have the opportunity to acquire land will have
more opportunity to acquire what is necessary for life (2.37).
According to Macpherson’s view, the “enough and as good”
requirement is itself merely a derivative of a prior principle
guaranteeing the opportunity to acquire, through labor, the
necessities of life. The third restriction, Macpherson argues, was not
one Locke actually held at all. Though Locke appears to suggest that
one can only have property in what one has personally labored on when
he makes labor the source of property rights, Locke clearly recognized
that even in the state of nature, “the Turfs my Servant has
cut” (2.28) can become my property. Locke, according to
Macpherson, thus clearly recognized that labor can be alienated. As
one would guess, Macpherson is critical of the “possessive
individualism” that Locke’s theory of property represents. He
argues that its coherence depends upon the assumption of differential
rationality between capitalists and wage-laborers and on the division
of society into distinct classes. Because Locke was bound by these
constraints, we are to understand him as including only property
owners as voting members of society.</p>

<p>
Macpherson’s understanding of Locke has been criticized from several
different directions. Alan Ryan argued that since property for Locke
includes life and liberty as well as estate (<em>Two Treatises</em>
2.87), even those without land could still be members of political
society. The dispute between the two would then turn on whether Locke
was using property in the more expansive sense in some of the crucial
passages. James Tully attacked Macpherson’s interpretation by pointing
out that the <em>First Treatise</em> specifically includes a duty of
charity toward those who have no other means of subsistence (1.42).
While this duty is consistent with requiring the poor to work for low
wages, it does undermine the claim that those who have wealth have
<em>no</em> social duties to others.</p>

<p>
Tully also argued for a fundamental reinterpretation of Locke’s
theory. Previous accounts had focused on the claim that since persons
own their own labor, when they mix their labor with that which is
unowned it becomes their property. Robert Nozick criticized this
argument with his famous example of mixing tomato juice one rightfully
owns with the sea. When we mix what we own with what we do not, why
should we think we gain property instead of losing it? On Tully’s
account, focus on the mixing metaphor misses Locke’s emphasis on what
he calls the “workmanship model.” Locke believed that
makers have property rights with respect to what they make just as God
has property rights with respect to human beings because he is their
maker. Human beings are created in the image of God and share with
God, though to a much lesser extent, the ability to shape and mold the
physical environment in accordance with a rational pattern or plan.
Waldron has criticized this interpretation on the grounds that it
would make the rights of human makers absolute in the same way that
God’s right over his creation is absolute. Sreenivasan has defended
Tully’s argument against Waldron’s response by claiming a distinction
between creating and making. Only creating generates an absolute
property right, and only God can create, but making is analogous to
creating and creates an analogous, though weaker, right.</p>

<p>
Another controversial aspect of Tully’s interpretation of Locke is his
interpretation of the sufficiency condition and its implications. On
his analysis, the sufficiency argument is crucial for Locke’s argument
to be plausible. Since Locke begins with the assumption that the world
is owned by all, individual property is only justified if it can be
shown that no one is made worse off by the appropriation. In
conditions where the good taken is not scarce, where there is much
water or land available, an individual’s taking some portion of it
does no harm to others. Where this condition is not met, those who are
denied access to the good do have a legitimate objection to
appropriation. According to Tully, Locke realized that as soon as land
became scarce, previous rights acquired by labor no longer held since
“enough and as good” was no longer available for others.
Once land became scarce, property could only be legitimated by the
creation of political society.</p>

<p>
Waldron claims that, contrary to Macpherson, Tully, and others, Locke
did not recognize a sufficiency condition at all. He notes that,
strictly speaking, Locke makes sufficiency a sufficient rather than
necessary condition when he says that labor generates a title to
property “at least where there is enough, and as good left in
common for others” (<em>Two Treatises</em> 2.27). Waldron takes
Locke to be making a descriptive statement, not a normative one, about
the condition that happens to have initially existed. Waldron also
argues that in the text “enough and as good” is not
presented as a restriction and is not grouped with other restrictions.
Waldron thinks that the condition would lead Locke to the absurd
conclusion that in circumstances of scarcity everyone must starve to
death since no one would be able to obtain universal consent and any
appropriation would make others worse off.</p>

<p>
One of the strongest defenses of Tully’s position is presented by
Sreenivasan. He argues that Locke’s repetitious use of “enough
and as good” indicates that the phrase is doing some real work
in the argument. In particular, it is the only way Locke can be
thought to have provided some solution to the fact that the consent of
all is needed to justify appropriation in the state of nature. If
others are not harmed, they have no grounds to object and can be
thought to consent, whereas if they are harmed, it is implausible to
think of them as consenting. Sreenivasan does depart from Tully in
some important respects. He takes “enough and as good” to
mean “enough and as good opportunity for securing one’s
preservation,” not “enough and as good of the same
commodity (such as land).” This has the advantage of making
Locke’s account of property less radical since it does not claim that
Locke thought the point of his theory was to show that all original
property rights were invalid at the point where political communities
were created. The disadvantage of this interpretation, as Sreenivasan
admits, is that it saddles Locke with a flawed argument. Those who
merely have the opportunity to labor for others at subsistence wages
no longer have the liberty that individuals had before scarcity to
benefit from the full surplus of value they create. Moreover poor
laborers no longer enjoy equality of access to the materials from
which products can be made. Sreenivasan thinks that Locke’s theory is
thus unable to solve the problem of how individuals can obtain
individual property rights in what is initially owned by all people
without consent.</p>

<p>
Simmons presents a still different synthesis. He sides with Waldron
and against Tully and Sreenivasan in rejecting the workmanship model.
He claims that the references to “making” in chapter five
of the <em>Two Treatises</em> are not making in the right sense of the
word for the workmanship model to be correct. Locke thinks we have
property in our own persons even though we do not make or create
ourselves. Simmons claims that while Locke did believe that God had
rights as creator, human beings have a different limited right as
<em>trustees</em>, not as makers. Simmons bases this in part on his
reading of two distinct arguments he takes Locke to make: the first
justifies property based on God’s will and basic human needs, the
second based on “mixing” labor. According to the former
argument, at least some property rights can be justified by showing
that a scheme allowing appropriation of property without consent has
beneficial consequences for the preservation of mankind. This argument
is overdetermined, according to Simmons, in that it can be interpreted
either theologically or as a simple rule-consequentialist argument.
With respect to the latter argument, Simmons takes labor not to be a
substance that is literally “mixed” but rather as a
purposive activity aimed at satisfying needs and conveniences of life.
Like Sreenivasan, Simmons sees this as flowing from a prior right of
people to secure their subsistence, but Simmons also adds a prior
right to self-government. Labor can generate claims to private
property because private property makes individuals more independent
and able to direct their own actions. Simmons thinks Locke’s argument
is ultimately flawed because he underestimated the extent to which
wage labor would make the poor dependent on the rich, undermining
self-government. He also joins the chorus of those who find Locke’s
appeal to consent to the introduction of money inadequate to justify
the very unequal property holdings that now exist.</p>

<p>
Some authors have suggested that Locke may have had an additional
concern in mind in writing the chapter on property. Tully (1993) and
Barbara Arneil point out that Locke was interested in and involved in
the affairs of the American colonies and that Locke’s theory of labor
led to the convenient conclusion that the labor of Native Americans
generated property rights only over the animals they caught, not the
land on which they hunted which Locke regarded as vacant and available
for the taking. Armitage even argues that there is evidence that Locke
was actively involved in revising the <em> Fundamental Constitutions
of Carolina </em> at the same time he was drafting the chapter on
property for <em>the Second Treatise</em>. Mark Goldie, however,
cautions that we should not miss the fact that political events in
England were still Locke’s primary focus in writing the <em>the Second
Treatise</em>. </p>

<p>
A final question concerns the status of those property rights acquired
in the state of nature after civil society has come into being. It
seems clear that at the very least Locke allows taxation to take place
by the consent of the majority rather than requiring unanimous consent
(2.140). Nozick takes Locke to be a libertarian, with the government
having no right to take property to use for the common good without
the consent of the property owner. On his interpretation, the majority
may only tax at the rate needed to allow the government to
successfully protect property rights. At the other extreme, Tully
thinks that, by the time government is formed, land is already scarce
and so the initial holdings of the state of nature are no longer valid
and thus are no constraint on governmental action. Waldron’s view is
in between these, acknowledging that property rights are among the
rights from the state of nature that continue to constrain the
government, but seeing the legislature as having the power to
interpret what natural law requires in this matter in a fairly
substantial way.</p>

<h2><a name="ConPolOblEndGov">4. Consent, Political Obligation, and the Ends of Government</a></h2>

<p>
The most direct reading of Locke’s political philosophy finds the
concept of consent playing a central role. His analysis begins with
individuals in a state of nature where they are not subject to a
common legitimate authority with the power to legislate or adjudicate
disputes. From this natural state of freedom and independence, Locke
stresses individual consent as the mechanism by which political
societies are created and individuals join those societies. While
there are of course some general obligations and rights that all
people have from the law of nature, special obligations come about
only when we voluntarily undertake them. Locke clearly states that one
can only become a full member of society by an act of express consent
(<em>Two Treatises</em> 2.122). The literature on Locke’s theory of
consent tends to focus on how Locke does or does not successfully
answer the following objection: few people have actually consented to
their governments so no, or almost no, governments are actually
legitimate. This conclusion is problematic since it is clearly
contrary to Locke’s intention.</p>

<p>
Locke’s most obvious solution to this problem is his doctrine of tacit
consent. Simply by walking along the highways of a country a person
gives tacit consent to the government and agrees to obey it while
living in its territory. This, Locke thinks, explains why resident
aliens have an obligation to obey the laws of the state where they
reside, though only while they live there. Inheriting property creates
an even stronger bond, since the original owner of the property
permanently put the property under the jurisdiction of the
commonwealth. Children, when they accept the property of their
parents, consent to the jurisdiction of the commonwealth over that
property (<em>Two Treatises</em> 2.120). There is debate over whether
the inheritance of property should be regarded as tacit or express
consent. On one interpretation, by accepting the property, Locke
thinks a person becomes a full member of society, which implies that
he must regard this as an act of express consent. Grant suggests that
Locke’s ideal would have been an explicit mechanism of society
whereupon adults would give express consent and this would be a
precondition of inheriting property. On the other interpretation,
Locke recognized that people inheriting property did not in the
process of doing so make any explicit declaration about their
political obligation.</p>

<p>
However this debate is resolved, there will be in any current or
previously existing society many people who have never given express
consent, and thus some version of tacit consent seems needed to
explain how governments could still be legitimate. Simmons finds it
difficult to see how merely walking on a street or inheriting land can
be thought of as an example of a “deliberate, voluntary
alienating of rights” (69). It is one thing, he argues, for a
person to consent by actions rather than words; it is quite another to
claim a person has consented without being aware that they have done
so. To require a person to leave behind all of their property and
emigrate in order to avoid giving tacit consent is to create a
situation where continued residence is not a free and voluntary
choice. Simmons’ approach is to agree with Locke that real consent is
necessary for political obligation but disagree about whether most
people in fact have given that kind of consent. Simmons claims that
Locke’s arguments push toward “philosophical anarchism,”
the position that most people do not have a moral obligation to obey
the government, even though Locke himself would not have made this
claim.</p>

<p>
Hannah Pitkin takes a very different approach. She claims that the
logic of Locke’s argument makes consent far less important in practice
than it might appear. Tacit consent is indeed a watering down of the
concept of consent, but Locke can do this because the basic content of
what governments are to be like is set by natural law and not by
consent. If consent were truly foundational in Locke’s scheme, we
would discover the legitimate powers of any given government by
finding out what contract the original founders signed. Pitkin,
however, thinks that for Locke the form and powers of government are
determined by natural law. What really matters, therefore, is not
previous acts of consent but the quality of the present government,
whether it corresponds to what natural law requires. Locke does not
think, for example, that walking the streets or inheriting property in
a tyrannical regime means we have consented to that regime. It is thus
the quality of the government, not acts of actual consent, that
determine whether a government is legitimate. Simmons objects to this
interpretation, saying that it fails to account for the many places
where Locke does indeed say a person acquires political obligations
only by his own consent.</p>

<p>
John Dunn takes a still different approach. He claims that it is
anachronistic to read into Locke a modern conception of what counts as
“consent.” While modern theories do insist that consent is
truly consent only if it is deliberate and voluntary, Locke’s concept
of consent was far more broad. For Locke, it was enough that people be
“not unwilling.” Voluntary acquiescence, on Dunn’s
interpretation, is all that is needed. As evidence Dunn can point to
the fact that many of the instances of consent Locke uses, such as
“consenting” to the use of money, make more sense on this
broad interpretation. Simmons objects that this ignores the instances
where Locke does talk about consent as a deliberate choice and that,
in any case, it would only make Locke consistent at the price of
making him unconvincing.</p>

<p>
Recent scholarship has continued to probe these issues. Davis closely
examines Locke’s terminology and argues that we must distinguish
between political society and legitimate government. Only those who
have expressly consented are members of political society, while the
government exercises legitimate authority over various types of people
who have not so consented. The government is supreme in some respects,
but there is no sovereign. Van der Vossen makes a related argument,
claiming that the initial consent of property owners is not the
mechanism by which governments come to rule over a particular
territory. Rather, Locke thinks that people (probably fathers
initially) simply begin exercising political authority and people
tacitly consent. This is sufficient to justify a state in ruling over
those people and treaties between governments fix the territorial
borders. Hoff goes still further, arguing that we need not even think
of specific acts of tacit consent (such as deciding not to emigrate).
Instead, consent is implied if the government itself functions in ways
that show it is answerable to the people.</p>

<p>
A related question has to do with the extent of our obligation once
consent has been given. The interpretive school influenced by Strauss
emphasizes the primacy of preservation. Since the duties of natural
law apply only when our preservation is not threatened (2.6), then our
obligations cease in cases where our preservation is directly
threatened. This has important implications if we consider a soldier
who is being sent on a mission where death is extremely likely. Grant
points out that Locke believes a soldier who deserts from such a
mission (<em>Two Treatises</em> 2.139) is justly sentenced to death.
Grant takes Locke to be claiming not only that desertion laws are
legitimate in the sense that they can be blamelessly enforced
(something Hobbes would grant) but that they also imply a moral
obligation on the part of the soldier to give up his life for the
common good (something Hobbes would deny). According to Grant, Locke
thinks that our acts of consent can in fact extend to cases where
living up to our commitments will risk our lives. The decision to
enter political society is a permanent one for precisely this reason:
the society will have to be defended and if people can revoke their
consent to help protect it when attacked, the act of consent made when
entering political society would be pointless since the political
community would fail at the very point where it is most needed. People
make a calculated decision when they enter society, and the risk of
dying in combat is part of that calculation. Grant also thinks Locke
recognizes a duty based on reciprocity since others risk their lives
as well.</p>

<p>
Most of these approaches focus on Locke’s doctrine of consent as a
solution to the problem of political obligation. A different approach
asks what role consent plays in determining, here and now, the
legitimate ends that governments can pursue. One part of this debate
is captured by the debate between Seliger and Kendall, the former
viewing Locke as a constitutionalist and the latter viewing him as
giving almost untrammeled power to majorities. On the former
interpretation, a constitution is created by the consent of the people
as part of the creation of the commonwealth. On the latter
interpretation, the people create a legislature which rules by
majority vote. A third view, advanced by Tuckness, holds that Locke
was flexible at this point and gave people considerable flexibility in
constitutional drafting.</p>

<p>
A second part of the debate focuses on ends rather than institutions.
Locke states in the <em>Two Treatises</em> that the power of the
Government is limited to the public good. It is a power that hath
“no other end but preservation” and therefore cannot
justify killing, enslaving, or plundering the citizens. (2.135).
Libertarians like Nozick read this as stating that governments exist
only to protect people from infringements on their rights. An
alternate interpretation, advanced in different ways by Tuckness,
draws attention to the fact that in the following sentences the
formulation of natural law that Locke focuses on is a positive one,
that “as much as possible” mankind is to be preserved. On
this second reading, government is limited to fulfilling the purposes
of natural law, but these include positive goals as well as negative
rights. On this view, the power to promote the common good extends to
actions designed to increase population, improve the military,
strengthen the economy and infrastructure, and so on, provided these
steps are indirectly useful to the goal of preserving the society.
This would explain why Locke, in the <em>Letter</em>, describes
government promotion of “arms, riches, and multitude of
citizens” as the proper remedy for the danger of foreign attack
(<em>Works</em> 6: 42)</p>

<h2><a name="LocPun">5. Locke and Punishment</a></h2>

<p>
John Locke defined political power as “a <em>Right</em> of
making Laws with Penalties of Death, and consequently all less
Penalties” (<em>Two Treatises</em> 2.3). Locke’s theory of
punishment is thus central to his view of politics and part of what he
considered innovative about his political philosophy. But he also
referred to his account of punishment as a “very strange
doctrine” (2.9), presumably because it ran against the
assumption that only political sovereigns could punish. Locke believed
that punishment requires that there be a law, and since the state of
nature has the law of nature to govern it, it is permissible to
describe one individual as “punishing” another in that
state. Locke’s rationale is that since the fundamental law of
nature is that mankind be preserved and since that law would “be
in vain” with no human power to enforce it, it must therefore be
legitimate for individuals to punish each other even before government
exists. In arguing this, Locke was disagreeing with Samuel Pufendorf.
Samuel Pufendorf had argued strongly that the concept of punishment
made no sense apart from an established positive legal structure.</p>

<p>
Locke realized that the crucial objection to allowing people to act as
judges with power to punish in the state of nature was that such
people would end up being judges in their own cases. Locke readily
admitted that this was a serious inconvenience and a primary reason
for leaving the state of nature (<em>Two Treatises</em> 2.13). Locke
insisted on this point because it helped explain the transition into
civil society. Locke thought that in the state of nature men had a
liberty to engage in “innocent delights” (actions that are
not a violation of any applicable laws), to seek their own
preservation within the limits of natural law, and to punish
violations of natural law. The power to seek one’s preservation
is limited in civil society by the law and the power to punish is
transferred to the government. (128–130). The power to punish in
the state of nature is thus the foundation for the right of
governments to use coercive force.</p>

<p>
The situation becomes more complex, however, if we look at the
principles which are to guide punishment. Rationales for punishment
are often divided into those that are forward-looking and
backward-looking. Forward-looking rationales include deterring crime,
protecting society from dangerous persons, and rehabilitation of
criminals. Backward-looking rationales normally focus on retribution,
inflicting on the criminal harm comparable to the crime. Locke may
seem to conflate these two rationales in passages like the
following:</p>

<blockquote>
And thus in the State of Nature, <em>one Man comes by a Power</em>
<em>over another</em>; but yet no Absolute or Arbitrary Power, to use
a Criminal when he has got him in his hands, according to the
passionate heats, or boundless extravagancy of his own Will, but only
to retribute to him, so far as calm reason and conscience dictates,
what is proportionate to his Transgression, which is so much as may
serve for <em>Reparation</em> and <em>Restraint</em>. For these two
are the only reasons, why one Man may lawfully do harm to another,
which is that [which] we call punishment. (<em>Two Treatises</em> 2.8)
</blockquote>

<p>
Locke talks both of retribution and of punishing only for reparation
and restraint. Simmons argues that this is evidence that Locke is
combining both rationales for punishment in his theory. A survey of
other seventeenth-century natural rights justifications for
punishment, however, indicates that it was common to use words like
“retribute” in theories that reject what we would today
call retributive punishment. In the passage quoted above, Locke is
saying that the proper amount of punishment is the amount that will
provide restitution to injured parties, protect the public, and deter
future crime. Locke’s attitude toward punishment in his other
writings on toleration, education, and religion consistently follows
this path toward justifying punishment on grounds other than
retribution. Tuckness claims that Locke’s emphasis on restitution is
interesting because restitution is backward looking in a sense (it
seeks to restore an earlier state of affairs) but also forward looking
in that it provides tangible benefits to those who receive the
restitution. There is a link here between Locke’s understanding
of natural punishment and his understanding of legitimate state
punishment. Even in the state of nature, a primary justification for
punishment is that it helps further the positive goal of preserving
human life and human property. The emphasis on deterrence, public
safety, and restitution in punishments administered by the government
mirrors this emphasis.</p>

<p>
A second puzzle regarding punishment is the permissibility of
punishing internationally. Locke describes international relations as
a state of nature, and so in principle, states should have the same
power to punish breaches of the natural law in the international
community that individuals have in the state of nature. This would
legitimize, for example, punishment of individuals for war crimes or
crimes against humanity even in cases where neither the laws of the
particular state nor international law authorize punishment. Thus in
World War II, even if “crimes of aggression” was not at
the time recognized as a crime for which individual punishment was
justified, if the actions violated that natural law principle that one
should not deprive another of life, liberty, or property, the guilty
parties could still be liable to criminal punishment. The most common
interpretation has thus been that the power to punish internationally
is symmetrical with the power to punish in the state of nature.</p>

<p>
Tuckness, however, has argued that there is an asymmetry between the
two cases because Locke also talks about states being limited in the
goals that they can pursue. Locke often says that the power of the
government is to be used for the protection of the rights of its own
citizens, not for the rights of all people everywhere (<em>Two
Treatises</em> 1.92, 2.88, 2.95, 2.131, 2.147). Locke argues that in
the state of nature a person is to use the power to punish to preserve
his society, mankind as a whole. After states are formed, however, the
power to punish is to be used for the benefit of his own particular
society. In the state of nature, a person is not required to risk his
life for another (<em>Two Treatises</em> 2.6) and this presumably
would also mean a person is not required to punish in the state of
nature when attempting to punish would risk the life of the punisher.
Locke may therefore be objecting to the idea that soldiers can be
compelled to risk their lives for altruistic reasons. In the state of
nature, a person could refuse to attempt to punish others if doing so
would risk his life and so Locke reasons that individuals may not have
consented to allow the state to risk their lives for altruistic
punishment of international crimes.</p>

<h2><a name="SepPowDisGov">6. Separation of Powers and the Dissolution of Government</a></h2>

<p>
Locke claims that legitimate government is based on the idea of
separation of powers. First and foremost of these is the legislative
power. Locke describes the legislative power as supreme (<em>Two
Treatises</em> 2.149) in having ultimate authority over “how the
force for the commonwealth shall be employed” (2.143). The
legislature is still bound by the law of nature and much of what it
does is set down laws that further the goals of natural law and
specify appropriate punishments for them (2.135). The executive power
is then charged with enforcing the law as it is applied in specific
cases. Interestingly, Locke’s third power is called the
“federative power” and it consists of the right to act
internationally according to the law of nature. Since countries are
still in the state of nature with respect to each other, they must
follow the dictates of natural law and can punish one another for
violations of that law in order to protect the rights of their
citizens.</p>

<p>
The fact that Locke does not mention the judicial power as a separate
power becomes clearer if we distinguish powers from institutions.
Powers relate to functions. To have a power means that there is a
function (such as making the laws or enforcing the laws) that one may
legitimately perform. When Locke says that the legislative is supreme
over the executive, he is not saying that parliament is supreme over
the king. Locke is simply affirming that “what can give laws to
another, must needs be superior to him” (<em>Two Treatises</em>
2.150). Moreover, Locke thinks that it is possible for multiple
institutions to share the same power; for example, the legislative
power in his day was shared by the House of Commons, the House of
Lords, and the King. Since all three needed to agree for something to
become law, all three are part of the legislative power ( 1.151). He
also thinks that the federative power and the executive power are
normally placed in the hands of the executive, so it is possible for
the same person to exercise more than one power (or function). There
is, therefore, no one to one correspondence between powers and
institutions.</p>

<p>
Locke is not opposed to having distinct institutions called courts,
but he does not see interpretation as a distinct function or power.
For Locke, legislation is primarily about announcing a general rule
stipulating what types of actions should receive what types of
punishments. The executive power is the power to make the judgments
necessary to apply those rules to specific cases and administer force
as directed by the rule (<em>Two Treatises</em> 2.88–89). Both
of these actions involve interpretation. Locke states that positive
laws “are only so far right, as they are founded on the Law of
Nature, by which they are to be regulated and interpreted”
(2.12). In other words, the executive must interpret the laws in light
of its understanding of natural law. Similarly, legislation involves
making the laws of nature more specific and determining how to apply
them to particular circumstances ( 2.135) which also calls for
interpreting natural law. Locke did not think of interpreting law as a
distinct function because he thought it was a part of both the
legislative and executive functions (Tuckness 2002a).</p>

<p>
If we compare Locke’s formulation of separation of powers to the
later ideas of Montesquieu, we see that they are not so different as
they may initially appear. Although Montesquieu gives the more well
known division of legislative, executive, and judicial, as he explains
what he means by these terms he reaffirms the superiority of the
legislative power and describes the executive power as having to do
with international affairs (Locke’s federative power) and the
judicial power as concerned with the domestic execution of the laws
(Locke’s executive power). It is more the terminology than the
concepts that have changed. Locke considered arresting a person,
trying a person, and punishing a person as all part of the function of
executing the law rather than as a distinct function.</p>

<p>
Locke believed that it was important that the legislative power
contain an assembly of elected representatives, but as we have seen
the legislative power could contain monarchical and aristocratic
elements as well. Locke believed the people had the freedom to created
“mixed” constitutions that utilize all of these. For that
reason, Locke’s theory of separation of powers does not dictate
one particular type of constitution and does not preclude unelected
officials from having part of the legislative power. Locke was more
concerned that the people have representatives with sufficient power
to block attacks on their liberty and attempts to tax them without
justification. This is important because Locke also affirms that the
community remains the real supreme power throughout. The people retain
the right to “remove or alter” the legislative power
(<em>Two Treatises</em> 2.149). This can happen for a variety of
reasons. The entire society can be dissolved by a successful foreign
invasion (2.211), but Locke is more interested in describing the
occasions when the people take power back from the government to which
they have entrusted it. If the rule of law is ignored, if the
representatives of the people are prevented from assembling, if the
mechanisms of election are altered without popular consent, or if the
people are handed over to a foreign power, then they can take back
their original authority and overthrow the government
(2.212–17). They can also rebel if the government attempts to
take away their rights (2.222). Locke thinks this is justifiable since
oppressed people will likely rebel anyway and those who are not
oppressed will be unlikely to rebel. Moreover, the threat of possible
rebellion makes tyranny less likely to start with (2.224–6). For
all these reasons, while there are a variety of legitimate
constitutional forms, the delegation of power under any constitution
is understood to be conditional.</p>

<p>
Locke’s understanding of separation of powers is complicated by
the doctrine of prerogative. Prerogative is the right of the executive
to act without explicit authorization for a law, or even contrary to
the law, in order to better fulfill the laws that seek the
preservation of human life. A king might, for example, order that a
house be torn down in order to stop a fire from spreading throughout a
city (<em>Two Treatises</em> 1.159). Locke defines it more broadly as
“the power of doing public good without a rule” (1.167).
This poses a challenge to Locke’s doctrine of legislative
supremacy. Locke handles this by explaining that the rationale for
this power is that general rules cannot cover all possible cases and
that inflexible adherence to the rules would be detrimental to the
public good and that the legislature is not always in session to
render a judgment (2.160). The relationship between the executive and
the legislature depends on the specific constitution. If the chief
executive has no part in the supreme legislative power, then the
legislature could overrule the executive’s decisions based on
prerogative when it reconvenes. If, however, the chief executive has a
veto, the result would be a stalemate between them. Locke describes a
similar stalemate in the case where the chief executive has the power
to call parliament and can thus prevent it from meeting by refusing to
call it into session. In such a case, Locke says, there is no judge on
earth between them as to whether the executive has misused prerogative
and both sides have the right to “appeal to heaven” in the
same way that the people can appeal to heaven against a tyrannical
government (2.168).</p>

<p>
The concept of an “appeal to heaven” is an important
concept in Locke’s thought. Locke assumes that people, when they
leave the state of nature, create a government with some sort of
constitution that specifies which entities are entitled to exercise
which powers. Locke also assumes that these powers will be used to
protect the rights of the people and to promote the public good. In
cases where there is a dispute between the people and the government
about whether the government is fulfilling its obligations, there is
no higher human authority to which one can appeal. The only appeal
left, for Locke, is the appeal to God. The “appeal to
heaven,” therefore, involves taking up arms against your
opponent and letting God judge who is in the right.</p>

<h2><a name="Tol">7. Toleration</a></h2>

<p>
In Locke’s <em>Letter Concerning Toleration</em>, he develops several
lines of arguments that are intended to establish the proper spheres
for religion and politics. His central claims are that government
should not use force to try to bring people to the true religion and
that religious societies are voluntary organizations that have no
right to use coercive power over their own members or those outside
their group. One recurring line of argument that Locke uses is
explicitly religious. Locke argues that neither the example of Jesus
nor the teaching of the New Testament gives any indication that force
is a proper way to bring people to salvation. He also frequently
points out what he takes to be clear evidence of hypocrisy, namely
that those who are so quick to persecute others for small differences
in worship or doctrine are relatively unconcerned with much more
obvious moral sins that pose an even greater threat to their eternal
state.</p>

<p>
In addition to these and similar religious arguments, Locke gives
three reasons that are more philosophical in nature for barring
governments from using force to encourage people to adopt religious
beliefs (<em>Works</em> 6:10–12). First, he argues that the care
of men’s souls has not been committed to the magistrate by either God
or the consent of men. This argument resonates with the structure of
argument used so often in the <em>Two Treatises</em> to establish the
natural freedom and equality of mankind. There is no command in the
Bible telling magistrates to bring people to the true faith and people
could not consent to such a goal for government because it is not
possible for people, at will, to believe what the magistrate tells
them to believe. Their beliefs are a function of what they think is
true, not what they will. Locke’s second argument is that since the
power of the government is only force, while true religion consists of
genuine inward persuasion of the mind, force is incapable of bringing
people to the true religion. Locke’s third argument is that even if
the magistrate could change people’s minds, a situation where everyone
accepted the magistrate’s religion would not bring more people to the
true religion. Many of the magistrates of the world believe religions
that are false.</p>

<p>
Locke’s contemporary, Jonas Proast, responded by saying that Locke’s
three arguments really amount to just two, that true faith cannot be
forced and that we have no more reason to think that we are right than
anyone else has. Proast argued that force can be helpful in bringing
people to the truth “indirectly, and at a distance.” His
idea was that although force cannot directly bring about a change of
mind or heart, it can cause people to consider arguments that they
would otherwise ignore or prevent them from hearing or reading things
that would lead them astray. If force is indirectly useful in bringing
people to the true faith, then Locke has not provided a persuasive
argument. As for Locke’s argument about the harm of a magistrate whose
religion is false using force to promote it, Proast claimed that this
was irrelevant since there is a morally relevant difference between
affirming that the magistrate may promote the religion he thinks true
and affirming that he may promote the religion that actually is true.
Proast thought that unless one was a complete skeptic, one must
believe that the reasons for one’s own position are objectively better
than those for other positions.</p>

<p>
Jeremy Waldron, in an influential article, restated the substance of
Proast’s objection for a contemporary audience. He argued that,
leaving aside Locke’s Christian arguments, his main position was that
it was instrumentally irrational, from the perspective of the
persecutor, to use force in matters of religion because force acts
only on the will and belief is not something that we change at will.
Waldron pointed out that this argument blocks only one particular
reason for persecution, not all reasons. Thus it would not stop
someone who used religious persecution for some end other than
religious conversion, such as preserving the peace. Even in cases
where persecution does have a religious goal, Waldron agrees with
Proast that force may be indirectly effective in changing people’s
beliefs. Much of the current discussion about Locke’s contribution to
contemporary political philosophy in the area of toleration centers on
whether Locke has a good reply to these objections from Proast and
Waldron.</p>

<p>
Some contemporary commentators try to rescue Locke’s argument by
redefining the religious goal that the magistrate is presumed to seek.
Susan Mendus, for example, notes that successful brainwashing might
cause a person to sincerely utter a set of beliefs, but that those
beliefs might still not count as genuine. Beliefs induced by coercion
might be similarly problematic. Paul Bou Habib argues that what Locke
is really after is sincere inquiry and that Locke thinks inquiry
undertaken only because of duress is necessarily insincere. These
approaches thus try to save Locke’s argument by showing that force
really is incapable of bringing about the desired religious goal.</p>

<p>
Other commentators focus on Locke’s first argument about proper
authority, and particularly on the idea that authorization must be by
consent. David Wootton argues that even if force occasionally works at
changing a person’s belief, it does not work often enough to make it
rational for persons to consent to the government exercising that
power. A person who has good reason to think he will not change his
beliefs even when persecuted has good reason to prevent the
persecution scenario from ever happening. Richard Vernon argues that
we want not only to hold right beliefs, but also to hold them for the
right reasons. Since the balance of reasons rather than the balance of
force should determine our beliefs, we would not consent to a system
in which irrelevant reasons for belief might influence us.</p>

<p>
Other commentators focus on the third argument, that the magistrate
might be wrong. Here the question is whether Locke’s argument is
question begging or not. The two most promising lines of argument are
the following. Wootton argues that there are very good reasons, from
the standpoint of a given individual, for thinking that governments
will be wrong about which religion is true. Governments are motivated
by the quest for power, not truth, and are unlikely to be good guides
in religious matters. Since there are so many different religions held
by rulers, if only one is true then likely my own ruler’s views are
not true. Wootton thus takes Locke to be showing that it is
irrational, from the perspective of the individual, to consent to
government promotion of religion. A different interpretation of the
third argument is presented by Tuckness. He argues that the likelihood
that the magistrate may be wrong generates a principle of toleration
based on what is rational from the perspective of a legislator, not
the perspective of an individual citizen. Drawing on Locke’s later
writings on toleration, he argues that Locke’s theory of natural law
assumes that God, as author of natural law, takes into account the
fallibility of those magistrates who will carry out the commands of
natural law. If “use force to promote the true religion”
were a command of natural law addressed to all magistrates, it would
not promote the true religion in practice because so many magistrates
wrongly believe that their religion is the true one. Tuckness claims
that in Locke’s later writings on toleration he moved away from
arguments based on what it is instrumentally rational for an
individual to consent to. Instead, he emphasized testing proposed
principles based on whether they would still fulfill their goal if
universally applied by fallible human beings.</p>
