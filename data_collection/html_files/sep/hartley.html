<div id="preamble">

<p>

David Hartley (1705–57) is the author of <em>Observations on
Man, his Frame, his Duty, and his Expectations</em> (1749)—a
wide-ranging synthesis of neurology, moral psychology, and
spirituality (i.e., our “frame,” “duty,” and
“expectations”). The <em>Observations</em> gained
dedicated advocates in Britain, America, and Continental Europe, who
appreciated it both for its science and its spirituality. As science,
the work grounds consciousness in neuro-physiology, mind in brain. On
this basis, the central concept of “association,” much
discussed by other British philosophers and psychologists, receives
distinctive treatment: the term first  names the physiological
process that generates “ideas,” and then the psychological
processes by which perceptions, thoughts, and emotions either link and
fuse or break apart. In keeping with this physiological approach,
Hartley offers a conceptually novel account of how we learn and
perform skilled actions, a dimension of human nature often left
unexplored in works of philosophy. Such actions include those involved
in speech—and, by extension, the conduct of scientific
inquiry. As a work on the spiritual condition of humanity,
Hartley’s <em>Observations</em> affirms universal 
salvation—the assurance that all people will eventually become “partakers
of the divine nature.” In this regard, it presents an original
model of psychological growth, which describes how the self both forms
and transforms, as the person gains in “sympathy” and
“theopathy”—put simply, learns to love, both
others and God.</p>

<p>

The son of an Anglican clergyman, David Hartley was born in June 1705
in the vicinity of Halifax, Yorkshire. His mother died three months
after his birth, and his father when David was fifteen. After
receiving his B.A. and M.A. from Jesus College, Cambridge, Hartley
practiced medicine in Bury St. Edmunds (1730–35), London
(1735–42), and Bath, where he died on 28 August 1757. He married
twice: in 1730, Alice Rowley, who died in 1731 giving birth to their
son David (1731–1813); and in 1735, Elizabeth Packer
(1713–78), despite the opposition of her very wealthy
family. The couple had two children, Mary (1736–1803) and
Wincombe Henry (1740–94). Although severely afflicted with
bladder stones, Hartley lived a full and active life: he practiced
medicine, engaged in mathematical research, sought a cure for
“the stone,” devoted himself to intellectual and
philanthropic projects, and wrote the <em>Observations on
Man.</em></p>

<h2 id="ReceObseMan">1. Reception of the <em>Observations on Man</em></h2>

<p>

In the 18th and 19th centuries, Hartley’s <em>Observations</em> was
valued very highly by people within the realm of religious dissent,
scientific progress, and social reform. Writing in 1774, Joseph
Priestley, a leading Unitarian and the foremost scientist in Britain,
wrote that the <em>Observations</em> “contains a new and most
extensive science” and promised that “the study of it …
will be like entering upon a new world.” He added: “I think
myself more indebted to this one treatise, than to all the books I ever
read beside; the scriptures excepted” (1774, xix). </p>

<p>

Priestley and his fellow Unitarians gave the <em>Observations</em> a
central place in the curriculum in the dissenting academies. (For
admission to Oxford and Cambridge Universities, a student had to
subscribe to the doctrines of the Church of England—a requirement
which excluded Unitarians, who did not accept that Jesus is God; hence
the dissenters’ need for their own institutions of higher learning.)
From one report, we learn that students in one academy studied it for
two hours every morning. In addition, in the late 1700s student
radicals at Cambridge and Oxford also had their copies.</p>

<p>

Thus the <em>Observations</em> was the focus of sustained study and
high esteem—if you followed Priestley, the most important
book, after the Bible. The poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge, converted to
Priestleian Unitarianism at Cambridge, had his portrait painted
holding a copy of the <em>Observations</em> (see Paley 1999,
18–23), and named his first son David Hartley Coleridge. Other
writers offer similar testimonies. Few works discussed in this
encyclopedia have been the objects of such deep personal
involvement.</p>

<p>

While its admirers thought it  “a new science” of
human nature, its critics—including Thomas Reid (1785,
84–94) and the later Coleridge ([1817] 1983), no longer the
youthful radical—considered Hartley’s <em>Observations</em>
conceptually wrong and morally hazardous. For example, Sir James
Mackintosh, who sympathetically praised “the extraordinary value
of Hartley’s system” (1836, 253), nonetheless saw in Hartley’s
belief that consciousness derives from neurological processes an
“error … deeper and more fundamental than any
other,” sure to “involv[e] all nature in darkness and
confusion” (245).</p>

<p>

In the nineteenth century, James Mill, John Stuart Mill, and William
B. Carpenter (who all had studied the <em>Observations</em> in
dissenting academies), along with Alexander Bain, founded the school of
thought known as “association psychology.” They credited
Hartley with being the precursor of the science they had developed.
However, John Stuart Mill wrote in the Preface to the 1869 edition of
his father’s <em>Analysis of the Phenomena of the Human Mind</em>,
that, compared to his father’s work, Hartley’s <em>Observations</em>
“is little more than a sketch, though an eminently suggestive
one” (Mill 1869, 1:xi–12). Hardly a recommendation to read the
book that the Mills had poured over as students. Why look at the
sketch, when the fully drawn portrait is available?</p>

<p>

By the late 1800s Priestleian Unitarianism, as a tradition of
philosophical practice, had died out; academic philosophers, especially
those trained in the Scottish school of common sense (the official
philosophy taught, for example, by the Unitarians who ran Harvard),
knew that the <em>Observations</em> rested on a fundamental mistake;
and association psychologists preserved a memory of this precursor of
their science. Formal interest in Hartley’s <em>Observations</em>, as a
work to be read and pondered, discussed in lectures, written about in
articles and books, had collapsed. The last serious engagement with the
<em>Observations</em> appears in William James’s <em>Principles of
Psychology</em> (1890, 1:553), and even there a casual reader could
easily miss it.</p>

<p>

In the twentieth century, Hartley’s <em>Observations</em> remained
outside the philosophical curriculum: philosophers-in-training could
follow the well-traveled route from the “British
empiricists” to Kant without turning aside to pick it up. And
even if a person had wanted to, doing so was difficult, for after the
editions of 1749, 1775, 1791, 1810, and 1834, and translations into
French (1755 and 1802), German (1772), and Italian (1809), no further
editions were published. Today, paperback reprints of earlier editions
are available, but there is no modern critical edition.</p>

<p>

In his <em>Second Treatise of Government</em>, Locke famously stated
that “labor fixes property.” It is the labor of people in
the fields of philosophy that fixes a philosophical text as a
“property”—that marks its bounds and assesses its value.
But a work that has remained outside contemporary philosophy’s
pedagogical economy, as has Hartley’s <em>Observations</em>, is in an
indeterminate position. A person today who picks the book up would have
in hand a long book covering a multitude of topics. How to determine
its properties? And how to answer the question of economics: What is
its worth? To address these questions, let us imagine how one of
Hartley’s colleagues, a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS), might have
responded to the book on its appearance in 1749.</p>

<h2 id="HartObseFirsSigh">2. Hartley’s <em>Observations</em>—At First Sight</h2>

<p>

A FRS in regular attendance at the society’s London meetings would be
acquainted with Hartley, and would know that he had emerged the victor
in a public medical controversy ten years earlier, which established
his reputation in medical circles both in Britain and on the
Continent.  Hartley, working with Stephen Hales, researched the
chemical basis for what they thought an effective folk remedy for
bladder stones—a painful and hazardous condition that impaired
the lives of Hartley himself and many others, including Benjamin
Franklin. In the course of the controversy, Hartley had published a
self-revealing account of the prolonged and intense suffering he had
endured, while undergoing the treatment. </p>

<p>

The FRS would know that this orphaned son of a Yorkshire clergyman
was now a successful physician, thanks in part to powerful patrons
(including the Cornwallis family, and the Duke of Newcastle, who was in
effect prime minister), had come into personal wealth, thanks to his
second marriage, and that he had devoted himself to various
philanthropic projects, including the publication of the shorthand
system devised by his friend, John Byrom.</p>

<p>

If the FRS knew Hartley as a friend, he would know him to be a
mathematician with a special interest in statistics, an amateur
violinist, and a vegetarian who saw animals as bearing a “near
relation” to humans. He would know him as a husband and father
(unlike Descartes, Locke, Hume, and Kant). He would know that Hartley
was often in extreme pain, and in danger of losing his life, as he
still suffered grievously from bladder stones. And he would know him to
be a man with deeply unconventional religious beliefs.</p>

<p>

Picking up the <em>Observations</em>, such a reader would see that
the book presented itself as Newtonian science—through the use of
“Observations” in the title (compare two groundbreaking
scientific texts, Franklin’s <em>Experiments and Observations on
Electricity</em>, 1751, and Priestley’s <em>Experiments and
Observations of Different Kinds of Air</em>, 1774), and through the
geometrical format of propositions and corollaries that structure the
text. Were he to page through the opening sections, he would see that
the Hartley wrote for a reader already familiar with technical concepts
in, for example, anatomy and physiology, and in the speculative physics
in Newton’s <em>Opticks.</em></p>

<p>

Were the reader to continue beyond the opening propositions of the
<em>Observations</em>, he would encounter elements of another, older
tradition: references to “perfect self-annihilation, and the pure
love of God” (<em>OM</em> 2, prop. 67), and quotations of select
biblical passages, especially the promise of becoming “partakers
of the divine nature” (2 Pet. 1.4). These place Hartley within
the realms of pietism and mysticism.</p>

<p>

Specifically, they are expressions of the “everlasting
gospel” of universal salvation. For the <em>Observations</em>
envisions the restoration of a fallen, fragmented, and self-alienated
humanity to “perfect manhood,” in which all people, without
exception, will be “members of the mystical body of
Christ,” and as such will become “new sets of senses, and
perceptive powers, to each other, so as to increase each others
happiness without limits” (<em>OM</em> 2, prop. 68; cf. prop.
35).</p>

<p>

Neither the scientific approach to “man” nor the
affirmation of universal salvation was in itself original. One could
find the former in the medical literature, and in Descartes. For
versions of the “everlasting gospel” one could turn to
various writers, including Peter Sterry, Cromwell’s chaplain, in <em>A
Discourse of the Freedom of the Will</em> (1675), Sterry’s fellow
chaplain to Cromwell, Jeremiah White, in <em>The Restoration of All
Things</em> (1712), the visionary Jane Lead, the mathematician Thomas
Bayes, in <em>Divine Benevolence</em> (1731), and, on the continent,
Charles Hector de Marsay.</p>

<p>

What is distinctive about Hartley’s <em>Observations</em> is the
simultaneous presence of the two approaches. Although Hartley affirms
that the whole person is a “mechanism,” subject to
scientific study, he is no French atheist, no La Mettrie (author of the
notorious <em>L’Homme machine</em>, 1748), but a person of deep
religious sensibility. Similarly, Hartley affirms universal 
restoration—but with none of the hallucinatory mysticism of Lead or Marsay.
Rather, the doctrine is supported by an application of the latest
scientific thinking.</p>

<p>

Consider the full title: <em>Observations on Man, his Frame, his
Duty, and his Expectations.</em> Hartley attempts a synthesis, by
showing that bodily “frame,” moral “duty,” and
religious “expectations” all converge on the same 
point—and that point is the overcoming of the chasm between hell and heaven.
Recall that Hartley, like other Unitarians, believed the divinity of
Jesus and substitutionary atonement to be doctrines that obscured the
original light of Christianity. Thus an explanation of
“salvation” as something external and undeserved has no
part in his thinking. Rather, he offers a scientific account of how we
are framed, both physically and psychologically, so as ultimately to
attain the state in which we are all be “partakers of the divine
nature, loving and lovely, holy and happy” (<em>OM</em> 2, prop.
56).</p>

<h2 id="ScieMan">3. The Science of Man</h2>

<p>

The scientific dimension of the <em>Observations</em> is in part
methodical and in part substantive. As a matter of method, Hartley
proposes the scientific investigation of  “man.” As
noted above, this is not unique; physicians had been doing just this
for decades, and there were also the examples of Descartes’s
<em>Passions of the Soul</em> (1649) and <em>Treatise on Man</em>
(1664), and of Hume’s anonymously published <em>Treatise of Human
Nature</em> (1739–40). (There is no evidence that Hartley knew anything
about Hume, or Hume about Hartley.) What is distinctive about the
<em>Observations</em> is that it extends Newtonian science to the study
of human nature. </p>

<p>

We should assume, Hartley writes, that the body’s “component
particles” are “subjected to the same subtle laws”
(<em>OM</em> 1, prop. 9) as are all other material entities. The subtle
laws are those Newton suggested in the “Queries” to his
<em>Opticks</em>, and which Stephen Hales (1677–1761, remembered today
as the father of plant physiology and for the measurement of blood
pressure) further developed in the chemical theory in his <em>Statical
Essays</em>—i.e., <em>Vegetable Staticks</em> (1727) and
<em>Haemastaticks</em> (1733). Descartes had earlier proposed a model
of neural physiology, but in 1740s Britain the physics the model
depended upon would have looked out of date. Hartley, in contrast,
presented a “theory of vibrations” that explained how the
“component particles” that constitute the nerves and brain
interact with the physical universe suggested by Newton—a
world composed of “forces of attraction and repulsion” and
having a minimum of solid matter.</p>

<p>

As a matter of substance, Hartley proposes:</p>

<blockquote>Since therefore sensations are conveyed to the mind, by the
efficiency of corporeal causes … it seems to me, that the powers of
generating ideas, and raising them by association, must also arise from
corporeal causes, and consequently admit of an explication from the
subtle influences of the small parts of matter on each other, as soon
as these are sufficiently understood. (<em>OM</em> 1, prop.
11)</blockquote>

<p>

Note the language: “corporeal causes”
“generate” and “raise” ideas “by
association.” Unlike later “association
psychologists” such as James Mill, Hartley does not start with
“ideas” as subjective entities already experientially
present to the “mind” and then ask how these are linked.
Rather, he starts with bodily, specifically neurological processes, and
asks: how do such processes generate and raise our perceptions,
emotions, thoughts, and actions? This is a proposal for neuroscience,
not a  version of philosophical or psychological
“empiricism.” </p>

<p>

If the responses of a nervous system to its physical environment can
generate and raise one “idea,” one flash of consciousness,
they can generate any, and all. Thus “the whole superstructure of
ideas and associations observable in human life may … be built upon
as small a foundation as we please” (<em>OM</em> 1, prop. 11).
For Hartley, the foundation is simple: nerves “vibrate” (on
a molecular level, not as violin strings), change their frequencies or
amplitudes of vibration, and transmit those changes to other nerves.
But thanks to the vast number of associative connections between nerves
and within the brain, this fundamental mechanism generates all the
complexities of action we observe in living beings—both animal and
human.</p>

<p>

The first volume of the <em>Observations</em> ends with a bold
statement: if an organism “could be endued with the most simple
kinds of sensation, [it] might also arrive at all that intelligence of
which the human mind is possessed” (<em>OM</em> 1,
Conclusion).</p>

<p>

Such is an expression of the “error … deeper and more
fundamental than any other” with which Mackintosh charged
Hartley: that of overlooking ontological dualism, “the
primordial and perpetual distinction between the being that thinks and
the thing which is thought of” (1836, 245). Descartes maintained
this distinction by positing a substance dualism of mind and body (and
by treating animals as “mere” mechanisms, without
consciousness, and humans as rational, sentient beings), and such as
Hume and later James Mill respected it (or at least avoided dealing
with it) by writing about the contents of conscious minds while
keeping well clear of neurophysiology. But Hartley ignores the
distinction between “thinking” and “thought
of”; he affirms that neurological processes generate
consciousness.</p> 

<p>

In Hartley’s view, animals are conscious beings, endued with
sensation and, in neurologically complex species, their own kinds of
intelligence: hence he affirms their “near relation” to 
us—which obligates us “to be their guardians and
benefactors,” and is reason to refrain from making them suffer
for our sport or convenience, and from killing them for food
(<em>OM</em> 1, prop. 93; cf. <em>OM</em> 2, prop. 52).What separates
us from animals are simply differences in neuro-anatomy.</p>

<p>

Accept that “all that intelligence of which the human mind is
possessed”could be arrived at by an organism possessing
“the most simple kinds of sensation,” and what follows? To
many, a line of thought “involving all nature into darkness and
confusion.” To others, with Priestley, the way of “entering
upon a new world” of scientific discovery, free of the dualism of
spirit and matter.</p>

<h2 id="PercActiRoleJoinImpr">4. Perception and Action: The Role of “Joint Impression”</h2>

<p>

Hartley’s starting point is the living organism, and specifically the
physical “vibrations” present in brain and nervous system
and in the universe with which the organism interacts. From this
starting point, two important considerations follow. The first is that
sensations and ideas are products, not givens, and their
“generation” and “raising” require explanation.
The second involves the recognition that organisms are active beings.
Like other animals, humans move about in, explore, and interact with
their environments. What is more, humans become adept at performing
various kinds of learned, highly skilled actions—e.g., playing the
violin. The “ideas” humans have largely occur within, and
guide, such practices. </p>

<p>

Concerning the first consideration: although
“association” is a central concept in the
<em>Observations</em>, it is not primarily a name for the process by
which discrete experiential entities link up; rather, the
process of neurological association generates ideas, including our
categories of perception. In proposition 11, Hartley states that
“ideas, and miniature vibrations, must first be generated …
before they can be associated.” He adds:</p>

<blockquote>But then (which is very remarkable) this power of forming
ideas, and their corresponding miniature vibrations, does equally
presuppose the power of association. For since all sensations and
vibrations are infinitely divisible, in respect of time and place, they
could not leave any traces or images of themselves, i.e. any ideas, or
miniature vibrations, unless their infinitesimal parts did cohere
together through joint impression, i.e. association. (<em>OM</em> 1,
prop. 11)</blockquote>

<p>

By stating that “all sensations and vibrations are infinitely
divisible,” Hartley is elaborating on a point made by George
Berkeley, in his <em>Essay Towards a New Theory of Vision</em> ([1709]
1948), that a being born “blind” to bodily feeling and
possessing only sight would have no concept of space and would be
unable to perceive a geometrically ordered world. To such a being,
sensations would be “infinitely”—i.e., 
arbitrarily—divisible. No stable, repeatable “ideas” could
arise from them. </p>

<p>

Hartley also agrees with Berkeley’s solution to this problem: we
perceive a coherent world thanks to the generation of
“ideas” (cognitive, semantic, and pragmatic responses to
the world) through the “joint impression” of sensations
from distinct sensory modalities—sight, hearing, and especially
touch. As does Berkeley, Hartley identifies feeling or touch as
“the fundamental source of information in respect of the
essential properties of matter” and “our first and
principle key to the knowledge of the external world”
(<em>OM</em> 1, prop. 30). Thus, Hartley writes, “we call the
touch the reality, light the representative.” The sense of sight
“may be considered, agreeably to Bishop Berkeley’s remark, as a
philosophical language for the ideas of feeling” (see Berkeley
[1709] 1948, sections 6.4, 6.8, and 9.4).</p>

<p>

A “philosophical language” is one “without any
deficiency, superfluity, or equivocation” (<em>OM</em> 1, prop.
83), and what makes sight a “philosophical language” for
feeling is that the two match each other: “The same qualities are
made by means of light to impress vibrations on our eyes, which
correspond in great measure to those made on the sense of feeling, so
as to vary with their varieties” (<em>OM</em> 1, prop. 30).
Feeling and vision flow in tandem, with no missing, extraneous, or
equivocal moves. It is thus joint impression, the correlation of the
flows of sensation through two (or more) sensory modalities, so that
the sensations one  “vary with the varieties” of
another, that accounts for the fact that we have ideas at all.</p>

<p>

In contrast, a person whose visual inputs are dissociated from his
other sensory modalities, and especially his own movement and feeling,
is unable to consistently identify any “visual ideas.” Such
is the condition of a person suffering from a visual agnosia (see James
1890, 1:48–50).</p>

<p>

This first consideration thus naturally leads to the second, for
both Hartley, and Berkeley before him, are talking about the actions of
an embodied being. A living being’s capacities for sensory
discrimination, feature detection, and perceptual categorization are
all involved with the repertoires of action that being performs, either
innately or through learning.</p>

<p>

For many animals, the ways in which physical movements vary with the
varieties of visual cues is relatively fixed: cats pounce on mice (some
of cloth), and swat at moths (or moving shadows on a sunlit wall). For
human beings, thanks to the brain’s plasticity in forming “joint
impressions,” there are many ways in which the
“varieties” of one sensation “vary with the
varieties” of another: at the sight of notes on a staff, fingers
move determinately upon a piano keyboard. Expert musicians, at the
sight of the notes, hear the tune in their mind’s ear.</p>

<p>

But how to explain what it is that the expert musician (or any
expert practitioner) does? And how does one learn to do this?</p>

<h2 id="RangActiAutoDeco">5. The Range of Actions: From “Automatic” to “Decomplex”</h2>

<p>

In the <em>Observations</em>, Hartley offers a conceptually novel
treatment of physical action—a topic largely absent from other
treatises, or inquries, devoted to “human nature” or
“human understanding.” Even in James Mill’s <em>Analysis of
the Phenomena of the Human Mind</em>, a work with an acknowledged debt
to Hartley, bodily action is touched on only in the last chapter of the
book, on “The Will.” But to an attentive “observer of
man,” it should be obvious that we live by doing, by performing
tasks that depend on repertoires of perfected movement, some (like
walking) mastered in infancy, others (like typing) later in life. </p>

<p>

Hartley invented to two words to describe physical movements:
“automatic” and “decomplex.”</p>

<p>

Hartley formed the adjective “automatic” from an
existing noun, “automaton,” to describe movements such
as  “the motions of the heart, and the peristaltic motion of
the bowels” (<em>OM</em> 1, Introduction). Such 
“originally automatic” motions are homeostatic: As a heart
beats, the alternation of contraction and relaxation is maintained and
modified in response to the needs and experiences of the organism
(<em>OM</em> 1, prop. 19).</p>

<p>

Following the discussion of “originally automatic”
motion is this theorem: “If any sensation A, idea B, or motion C,
be associated … with any other sensation D, idea E, or muscular
motion F, it will, at last, excite d, the simple idea belonging to
sensation D, the very idea E, or the very muscular motion F”
(<em>OM</em> 1, prop. 20). Through the physical association or neural
impulses in the brain, any sensation, idea, or muscular motion can
become the stimulus that excites any other idea or muscular motion.
One’s heart beats faster at the sight, sound, or thought of something
one has learned to fear.</p>

<p>

The formation of such  novel associations of stimuli to
physiological responses means that “originally automatic”
motions can transform into motions that are 
“voluntary” or “secondarily automatic”
(<em>OM</em> 1, prop. 21).</p>

<p>

An action is voluntary when its stimulus is an “idea, or state
of mind … which we term the will” (<em>OM</em> 1, prop. 21).
To illustrate how ideas of the form “the will to …”
derive from “originally automatic” motions, Hartley
describes how a child gains motor control over parts and functions of
her body. “Originally automatic” motions are brought under
control through a series of substitutions of the initiating stimulus.
An infant grasps the finger placed in her palm, and then the toy she
sees, and then grasps at “the sound of the words grasp, take
hold, &amp;c., the sight of the nurse’s hand, in that state, the idea
of a hand, and particularly the child’s own hand.” These and
“innumerable other associated circumstances … will put the
child upon grasping, till, at last, that idea, or state of mind which
we may call the will to grasp, is generated and sufficiently associated
with the action to produce it instantaneously.”</p>

<p>

It is important to note that, in Hartley’s account, the performance
of a voluntary movement is not a dualistic, two-stage process, with an
executive “faculty” of the Mind, the Will, first issuing an
instruction that the body then carries out. Rather, a movement becomes
voluntary through the living being’s interaction with the
“innumerable … associated circumstances” of its
environment, which interactions bring about a series of substitutions
of the initiating stimulus. In this light,  “will”
does not name anything substantive: it is a word  we use to
describe an “idea, or state of mind.” And it is a word
people often use to express bafflement as to what this “state of
mind” amounts to. Hartley notes that adults start calling a child
willful at the time he learns to walk, because “the child, in
some cases, does not walk when desired, whilst yet the circumstances
are apparently the same as when he does. For here the unapparent cause
of walking, or not walking, is <em>will</em>” (<em>OM</em> 1,
prop. 77). But, he adds, “a careful observation … will always
shew … that when children do different things, the real
circumstances, natural or associated, are proportionally different, and
that the state of mind called will depends on the
difference.”</p>

<p>

Sequences of substitutions transform originally automatic actions
into voluntary ones. Hartley recognizes that the process continues, so
that voluntary actions in turn become what he terms “secondarily
automatic”:</p>

<blockquote>After the actions, which are most perfectly voluntary, have
been rendered so by one set of associations, they may, by another, be
made to depend upon the most diminutive sensations, ideas, and motions,
such as the mind scarce regards, or is conscious of; and which it can
therefore scarce recollect the moment after the action is over. Hence
it follows, that association not only converts automatic actions into
voluntary, but voluntary ones into automatic. For these actions …
are rather to be ascribed to the body than the mind, i.e. are to be
referred to the head of automatic motions. I shall call them automatic
motions of the secondary kind, to distinguish them from those which are
originally automatic, and from the voluntary ones. (<em>OM</em> 1,
prop. 21)</blockquote>

<p>

Think of learning to type or play the piano. At first one develops a
repertoire of voluntary motions. But fluency requires that the motions
be secondarily automatic. </p>

<p>

To his critics, notably Reid and the later Coleridge, Hartley’s
commitment to “mechanism” impeached the “freedom of
the will” and hence moral responsibility. But where such critics
were intent on affirming the adult self’s executive control over
thought and action, Hartley’s concern is the opposite: he starts with
the infant and asks, How does a child gain control of the originally
automatic processes present in infancy? Gain motor control of her
hands? Learn to walk, and dance? Play a musical instrument? Transform
spontaneous burbling and crying into articulate speech? Hartley’s
critics accuse him of reducing the human being to a “mere
mechanism.” But from a Hartleian perspective, the
“mechanism” of “secondarily automatic” actions
is an achievement, not a given—and a necessary achievement, if one
is to live a complete human life.</p>

<p>

Most human competencies, though voluntarily performed, rely upon
extensive repertoires of secondarily automatic actions. Such
performances are not prespecified and inflexible routines. When people
play music, they add flourishes, and  improvise if they are
sufficiently skilled. When they do so, the actions they perform are
what Hartley calls “decomplex.”</p>

<p>

Readers of the <em>Observations</em> would have been familiar with
the words “decompound” and 
“decomposite”—both from the late Latin <em>decompositus</em>, a rendering of the
Greek <em>parasynthetos</em>—in which the “de-” prefix
signifies “repeatedly” or “further.” They would
also know the word “complex,” from Locke’s <em>Essay
concerning Human Understanding</em>: “Ideas thus made up of
several simple ones put together, I call Complex; such as are Beauty,
Gratitude, a Man, an Army, the Universe” (Locke [1690] 1975,
2.12.1).</p>

<p>

Available to Hartley were both Locke’s distinction between
“simple” and “complex” and also instances in
which the de- prefix meant “further.” On the analogy of
“compound” to “decompound,” he wrote of ideas
and actions being either “complex” or
“decomplex.” In Hartley’s theory, the associations in a
complex action or idea are synchronic, while the associations in a
decomplex action or idea are diachronic. In playing a piano, hitting
the D key at the sight of the printed note D is a complex movement,
while playing a composition is a decomplex action.</p>

<p>

The elements of a secondarily automatic, complex movement are
tightly fused. In contrast, those in a decomplex action or idea are
more loosely associated (<em>OM</em> 1, prop. 12); this looseness makes
it possible to include a repertoire of secondarily automatic movements
in a variety of decomplex ones—the same notes in an endless number
of tunes. Hartley also observes that people find it impossible to
perform decomplex actions—play a tune, say a 
sentence—backward.</p>

<p>

Decomplex actions draw on different kinds of complex movements,
involving the association of movements with perceptions in one or more
sensory modalities: at the sight of the notes on the staff, or the
sound of the tones, the pianist hits the keys. As a person becomes
proficient at a type of decomplex action, the guiding sensory modality
can change. When learning to dance, Hartley observes, at first
“the scholar desires to look at his feet and legs, in order to
judge by seeing when they are in a proper position,” but
“by degrees he learns to judge of this by feeling”
(<em>OM</em> 1, prop. 77). Similarly, a practiced musician plays the
harpsichord from “the connexion of the several complex parts of
the decomplex motions” (<em>OM</em> 1, prop. 21). One’s hands
know the tune.</p>

<p>

Hartley improvised with language in order to articulate a new
understanding of human action. Use of the one word became …
automatic. The other never made it into circulation. In a world in
which “decompose” means “to rot,” it was
doomed. Nonetheless, we lack a widely available word for the concept
that “decomplex” names.</p>

<p>

Hartley’s account draws particular attention to the dependency of
our capacities for intentionality, flexibility, and innovation in our
decomplex actions upon the repertoires of actions we have made
secondarily automatic. It thus centers upon a key insight: “All
our voluntary powers are of the nature of memory” (<em>OM</em> 1,
prop. 90).</p>

<h2 id="LangThou">6. Language and Thought</h2>

<p>

In Hartley’s account, at birth we enter the world already humming with
“originally automatic” motions. Thanks to the activity of
our brain and nerves, these motions are self-regulating and
homeostatic, responsive to bodily feedback and external stimuli. Then,
as we grow, we gain voluntary control over some of our movements,
perfect those that become secondarily automatic, and learn to carry out
decomplex actions that draw on repertoires of secondarily automatic
components. </p>

<p>

In Hartley’s account of human nature, the concept of the
“association of ideas” plays a central role. But the
paradigmatic instances of “association” are, first, the
“joint impressions” that generate “ideas”
(including complex movements), and second, the flowing cascades of
movement that are decomplex actions. Such decomplex actions are central
to the lives we lead. And foremost among decomplex actions are the
sentences we speak.</p>

<p>

For Hartley, language is a highly “decomplex” motor
activity that involves the cementing of associations between perceived
and created sounds, and, for the literate, perceived and created marks:
“impressions made on the ear,” “actions of the organs
of speech,” “impressions made upon the eye,” and
“actions of the hand in writing” (<em>OM</em> 1, prop. 79).
Further connections must be made between perceived or created sounds
and features of the world, especially the actions of oneself and of
other people. Hartley’s approach is nearly the opposite of Locke’s, who
writes as if language were a dictionary, in which each word marks an
idea known prelinguistically to the speaker: “words being
voluntary signs, they cannot be voluntary signs imposed by [the
speaker] on things he knows not… . Till he has some ideas of his
own, he cannot suppose them to correspond with the conceptions of
another man; nor can he use any signs for them” (Locke [1690]
1975, 3.2.2).</p>

<p>

Thus while Locke seems to be saying that individuals first have
ideas, and then turn to language to communicate them to others, Hartley
describes a process whereby, as children, we burble and cry and 
listen—and gradually gain motor control of our burbling and crying,
associate it with what we hear and handle and do, and eventually learn
the meaning of what we say. Once again, the process of 
association—here the activity of hearing and speaking, and later reading and
writing—generates ideas: we have ideas because we use language, in
concrete social interactions; we do not create language to express the
ideas we, as lone individuals, already have.</p>

<p>

In this regard, consider Hume’s assertion that, if we are unsure
about the meaning of a word, “we need but enquire, <em>from what
impression is that supposed idea derived?</em>” (Hume [1748]
1975, 22), and his recommendation that we abandon words that lack such
derivations. From Hartley’s point of view, this is manifestly bad
advice.</p>

<p>

For Hartley, complex and decomplex ideas are wholes that do not
“bear any relation to [their] compounding parts.”
Specifically, “the decomplex idea belonging to any sentence is
not compounded merely of the complex ideas belonging to the words in
it” (<em>OM</em> 1, prop. 12). The meaning of an utterance is a
property of the whole—of the performance of a specific decomplex
action in a social and pragmatic context. Moreover, “both
children and adults learn the ideas belonging to whole sentences many
times in a summary way, and not by adding together the ideas of the
several words in the sentence.” Consequently, children and
illiterate adults find it hard to “separate sentences into the
several words which compound them” (<em>OM</em> 1, prop. 80).</p>

<p>

Thus the meanings of sentences are not simply derivable from the
meanings of the words in them, and the meanings of those words are not
derivable from the “impressions” to which they refer. When
children begin to speak, they utter “sentences” that,
though short (<em>Mommy!</em>) are whole, complete, and meaningful
expressions. It is only when they learn to read that they realize
sentences are composed of individual words. Over time, the sentences
increase in decomplexity, as people participate in the activities of
life. As adults, people speak a vast variety of highly decomplex
expressions—including, for example, those involved in the practice
of a science, or a religion.</p>

<h2 id="LangAlge">7. Language as Algebra</h2>

<p>

Given that meaning is a property of complete expressions, Hartley is
quick to point out that individual words often lack definite, shared
meanings. Such indefiniteness is, in Hartley’s view, hardly a defect,
but rather a valuable feature of language. Hartley writes that language
is “one species of algebra,” and algebra “nothing
more than the language … peculiarly fitted to explain quantity of
all kinds” (<em>OM</em> 1, 80). </p>

<p>

The algebraic quality of language is especially important in
scientific practice. Like <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> in algebra,
scientific terms, such as Hartley’s “vibrations” or
contemporary physicists’ “particles,” stand for unknowns,
for which vibrating strings or grains of sand provide only loose and
misleading analogies. Their presence is necessary for the practice of
scientific discovery. Scientists employ “algebraic” terms
in order to discern correlations and patterns that might otherwise
remain unobserved: “Bringing an unknown quantity into a relation
answers, in philosophy, to the art of giving names, expressing nothing
definite … and then inserting these names … in all the
enunciations of the phenomena, to see whether, from a comparison of
these terms with each other, something definite in manner, degree, or
mutual relation might result” (<em>OM</em> 1, prop. 87).</p>

<p>

In such scientific practice, the more algebraic—i.e., free from
association with sense “impressions”—words are the
better. (Thus “quark” is an inspired choice.)  Hume’s
advice, to use only terms referring to clear “impressions,”
if followed, would bring the practice of a science to a halt.</p>

<p>

However, to turn this around, the utility of words for unknowns
depends upon their proper use within ongoing practices. For examples of
how to conduct scientific inquiry, Hartley turns to mathematical
methods, and he includes an extensive discussion of these in
proposition 87 of volume 1 of the <em>Observations</em>, which is
titled: “To deduce Rules for the Ascertainment of Truth, and
Advancement of Knowledge, from the Mathematical Methods of considering
Quantity.”</p>

<p>

One deduction involves the comparison of scientific investigation to
the use of the rule of the false position in arithmetic: “Here a
first position is obtained, which, though not accurate, approaches,
however, to the truth. From this, applied to the equations, a second
position is deduced, which approaches nearer to the truth than the
first; from the second a third, etc.” Hartley adds that
“this is indeed the way, in which advances in science are carried
on; and scientific persons are aware, that it is and must be so”
(<em>OM</em> 1, prop. 87).</p>

<p>

“I frame no hypotheses.” Thus had Newton famously
written in the <em>Principia.</em> Hartley responds directly: “It
is in vain,” he writes, “to bid an inquirer form no
hypothesis” (<em>OM</em> 1, prop. 87). Remember that Hartley was
a practicing physician; on the basis of ambiguous symptoms and fallible
medical knowledge, he was every day “framing hypotheses,”
making diagnoses. The question, for Hartley, concerns the degree of
confidence we may place in our hypotheses. How do we measure how far
our “first position” is from the truth, when we don’t know
what the truth is? And how do we measure the degree to which the degree
of error in our second and third positions has diminished?</p>

<p>

In this regard, what is most interesting in proposition 87 is
Hartley’s discussion of probability. Hartley appears to have been one
of a small circle of mathematicians who read, and understood, papers
making fundamental contributions to the theory of probability by
Abraham De Moivre (1667–1754) and Thomas Bayes (1702–61). De Moivre
developed a theorem that allows for the determination of the degree of
convergence between the frequency of observed events and the
underlying probability ratio, for any finite number of events. More
important is “the solution to the inverse problem,” which
Hartley says “an ingenious friend” communicated to
him. This would be Bayes’s theorem—customarily attributed to
Thomas Bayes—which deals with determining the probability with
which probability ratios can be inferred from observed outcomes, and
which provides (a still controversial) foundation for statistical
inference. In his discussion of probability theory, and other
mathematical topics, Hartley is primarily interested in methods for
moving from observation to explanation, of assessing the 
likeliness—i.e, believability—of hypotheses.</p>

<p>

Hartley, like Hume, thought that belief was largely a matter of
sentiment. “Rational assent” is a matter of the strength of
the association between a sentence (or even some of the words in it!)
and the word “true” (<em>OM</em> 1, prop. 86)
“Practical assent,” a person’s willingness to act, depends
on the vividness the proposition—and such can even make “an
interesting event, supposed doubtful, or even fictitious, … appear
like a real one,” thereby pulling rational assent after it.
(Hartley notes, dryly, “the foundation of assent is still the
same. I here describe the fact only.”) But Hartley was not
content to stop here, an exponent of an urbane skepticism. Belief and
assent are matters of feeling, of sentiment, yes—but there are
mathematical ways of thinking about the probabilities of belief. And
people who think mathematically make better physicians and scientists.
(How many trials of an unproven treatment for bladder stones does one
have to run, to reach a threshold degree of belief in the results?) In
this regard, it is fair to say that Hartley was one of the first
Bayesians.</p>

<p>

One other consequence of Hartley’s practice-oriented,
“algebraic” approach to language concerns the validity
of  alternate languages. In the “popular” language we
use every day, we talk of our choices, intentions, and resolutions, but
in the “philosophical” language of the
<em>Observations</em>, Hartley proposed we think in terms of 
“philosophical necessity”—in which every
“voluntary” action is “excited by an associated
circumstance” (<em>OM</em> 1, 70). Some people had, and have, no
use for such talk: it denies the freedom (and indeed, the existence) of
the will. Hartley argues that the use of two incommensurable languages,
“popular” and “philosophical,” is not a
problem, provided that we use them separately and consistently:
“insuperable difficulties will arise” only “if we mix
these languages” (OM 2, prop. 15). Both languages work, in their
own contexts of practice.</p>

<p>

Hartley had a warrant for this affirmative approach to languages in
his scientific and mathematical training: Newton wrote the
<em>Principia</em> in the language of geometry, but the
“mathematical principles of natural philosophy” could be
equally (and better?) expressed in the “algebraic” language
of the calculus—for which there were rival notations. Similarly,
Hartley championed a new “notation” for the English
language—his friend John Byrom’s shorthand, which he saw as a reform
that would make our written language  more closely approximate a
“philosophical” one. When he began work on the
<em>Observations</em>, he conceived of the project as demonstrating
that language about “self-interest,” the “common
good,” and the “will of God” were different ways of
saying the same thing. The project was thus as much moral and religious
as it was scientific.</p>

<h2 id="MoraPsyc">8. Moral Psychology</h2>

<p>

As noted above, Hartley believed that all people will ultimately become
“partakers of the divine nature.” Such is the
“everlasting gospel” of universal salvation. Moreover,
Hartley sought to show that the gathering together of all humanity into
the “mystical body of Christ” is a process inherent in our
nature: the psychological dynamic of association, which generates our
ideas and perfects our secondarily automatic movements, also “has
a tendency to reduce the state of those who have eaten of the tree of
the knowledge of good and evil, back again to a paradisiacal one”
(<em>OM</em> 1, prop. 14). The question is, how does association
accomplish this? </p>

<p>

To see how it does, we must look (1) more closely at the concept of
association, (2) at Hartley’s notion of “transference,” and
(3) at the series of psychological orientations association and
transference generate. And as we do so, we should keep in mind that
many of those who studied the <em>Observations</em> in the dissenting
academies appear to have valued Hartley primarily as a moral theorist
and exemplar—for, that is, his description of the path of moral
transformation. Such is a common theme in their recollections.</p>

<p>

(1) We noted above Hartley’s collaboration with his friend Stephen
Hales to discover a medical treatment that would dissolve bladder
stones. Following Newton, Hales believed “forces of attraction
and repulsion” to be the basis of physical nature, and through
various chemical experiments he demonstrated that solid concretions,
including bladder stones, were compounds that had locked within
themselves large quantities of “air,” which normally
manifests a strongly repelling force. The “air” within a
bladder stone could be released, and the stone dissolved, through
reaction with an agent that would change the pH of the urine. Such
chemicals are plentiful in the laboratory; the two men were looking
for one that a person could safely ingest.</p>

<p>

In his <em>Statical Essays</em>, Hales proposes that
“air” is a component in many “animal, vegetable, and
mineral substances”:</p>

<blockquote> If all the parts of matter were only endued with a
strongly attracting power, whole nature would then immediately become
one unactive cohering lump; wherefore it was absolutely necessary …
that there should be every where intermixed with it a due proportion of
strongly repelling elastick particles, … [and] that these particles
should be endued with a property of resuming their elastick state, . .
. that thereby this beautiful frame of things might be maintained in a
continual round of the production and dissolution of animal and
vegetable bodies. (Hales 1769, 1:314–15)</blockquote>

<p>

A seemingly inert particle of matter contains within itself forces of
attraction and repulsion in a dynamic equilibrium. (Hence the readiness
of the particles constituting the nerves to “vibrate.”) In
such particles concretions and dissolutions occur continuously; the
materials within the bodies of living things form, dissolve, and form
again—“that thereby this beautiful frame of things might be
maintained.” </p>

<p>

Hartley extends these chemical concepts to psychology. As an analogy
to the forces of “attraction” and “repulsion,”
he writes of both “associations” and
“counter-associations” at work in generating the frame of a
person’s self. The role of association is obvious—through
“joint impression,” it generates “ideas,”
including the complex movements that are the basis of the decomplex
actions we perform every day. And as we shall see shortly,
psychological associations form (“model”) the basic
orientations of the self. But “counter-associations” are
equally vital. The counter-associations in our dreams, for example, are
“of singular use to us, by interrupting and breaking the course
of our associations. For, if we were always awake, some accidental
associations would be cemented by continuance, as that nothing could
afterwards disjoin them, which would be madness” (<em>OM</em> 1,
prop. 91). A sane mind, therefore, is one “maintained in a
continual round of the production and dissolution”—in, that
is, a dynamic balance of connection and detachment, memory and
forgetting, that holds out the possibility of change and
transformation.</p>

<p>

(2) We noted in the discussion of action that, in Hartley’s theory,
a child gains voluntary control over his body through a series of
substitutions. A similar series of substitutions, or
“transferences” of emotion, are at work in the formation of
a person’s character. For example, Hartley offers a fascinating,
detailed account of how the spontaneous gesture by which a frightened,
abused child raises his hand to ward off a blow becomes, through a
series of such transferences, the blow the abusing adult directs in
anger at a helpless child (<em>OM</em> 1, prop. 97). Here, the links by
which fear is transferred, and transmuted into anger, include the
situational, symbolic, and semantic: from, for example, being struck to
the “signs and tokens” of an impending beating—e.g., the
bottle of gin, or the words of abuse and affection, the curses and
kisses, that attend drunkenness.</p>

<p>

(3) Hartley offers an original model of psychological development.
The various emotional states (“pleasures and pains”) we
experience structure themselves into “six classes”:
imagination, ambition, self-interest, sympathy, theopathy, and the
moral sense. These form two groups of three, each consisting of two
basic orientations and a means of regulating them.</p>

<p>

The first group consists of imagination, the orientation toward
objects as sources of pleasure or displeasure, and of ambition,
whereby pleasure or pain derive from one’s awareness of one’s standing
in the eyes of others. In this group self-interest is the ego, which
attempts to manage and satisfy the demands of imagination and
ambition. The second group combines sympathy, the orientation of
personal intersubjectivity, and theopathy, the person’s relationship
with what the person takes to be the divine. (“Theopathy”
appears to be Hartley’s invention.)  Hartley calls the moral sense (a
term then in widespread use) the “monitor” of sympathy and
theopathy; it is a higher ego, or self, beyond the ego.</p>

<p>

The psychological structure the groups represent is epigenetic and
transformative. Like the accounts of twentieth-century psychologists
such as Maslow, Erikson, and Kohlberg, Hartley’s theory describes a
process of moral development as a sequence of transformations of the
self.</p>

<p>

The process is epigenetic in that the earlier orientations
“model” the orientations that follow them. A young child,
for example, enjoys a pleasure of imagination when playing with new
toys; but when that pleasure transfers to the status that derives from
being perceived by others to be a (good) child who has a collection of
prized toys, the child is now experiencing a pleasure of ambition. And
imagination and ambition then “model” self-interest, as the
child weighs the pleasures and pains, benefits and costs, of actually
playing with the toys versus keeping them on the shelf for purposes of
display. The problem remains in later life, when the pleasures of
purchased objects derive more from their symbolic value than from
actual use. This is especially the case when the purchases are made to
satisfy the pleasures of ambition—of being perceived as the kind of
person who can own a Mercedes, or who is fluent in the constantly
changing idioms of fashion.</p>

<p>

Also contributing to the epigenetic modeling of the self is the fact
that imagination, ambition, and self-interest inevitably generate
counter-associations—experiences of pain or indifference where
one anticipated pleasure. Indulgence in the pleasures of imagination,
Hartley writes, often “lead[s] men into such a degree of
solicitude, anxiety, and fearfulness, in minute affairs, as to make
them inflict upon themselves greater torments, than the most cruel
tyrant could invent” (<em>OM</em> 2, 54). Similarly with
ambition: keeping up with the “latest” fashion (in cars,
clothes, or philosophers) for the sake of winning others’ approval is
hard work.</p>

<p>

“We do, and must, upon our entrance into the world, begin with
idolatry to external things, and, as we advance in it, proceed to the
idolatry of ourselves” (<em>OM</em> 2, prop. 4). Some thus
remain, anxiously pouring their sacrifices over these concretions. In
others the inevitable, painful counter-associations act as solvents,
and cause the stony idols to disintegrate. Sympathy and theopathy
replace imagination and ambition as “primary pursuits,” the
fundamental modes of experience and interaction. Hartley calls this
reorienting transformation the “annihilation of self.”</p>

<p>

This “annihilation” is not quasi-mystical obliteration;
rather, it is a reorientation toward, or discovery of, a higher self of
sympathy, theopathy, and the moral sense. It involves liberation from
what William Blake calls the “mind-forged manacles” of a
self-created and self-regarding hell and an awakening to one’s true
humanity.</p>

<p>

Once they are “modeled,” the higher orientations
“new-model” the lower. For the person for whom sympathy and
theopathy are primary pursuits, imagination and ambition remain modes
of interaction, but modes that are transformed. Beauty may now be
perceived in people and things previously passed over with indifference
or distaste. And one’s happiness, indeed one’s hopes for one’s self,
may be linked with the happiness of people one previously sought to
avoid.</p>

<p>

This does not mean, for Hartley, that life gets easier. Rather he
describes the path as increasingly difficult. Although profoundly
optimistic about the ultimate future of humanity—he is describing,
after all, how association tends “to reduce the state of those
who have eaten of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, back
again to a paradisiacal one”—he is acutely aware of the many
bypaths of human self-deception and destructiveness. He is especially
conscious of the dangers facing those whose primary pursuit concerns
being sympathetic, theopathic, and morally perceptive. Such a person
can become “a bitter persecuting spirit” (<em>OM</em> 1,
prop. 97). In general, the “higher” the level of moral and
spiritual attainment, the greater the potential for a crippling,
demonic destructiveness. In this regard, reading Hartley one encounters
a vision of human nature as deeply conflicted, struggling against
itself—a view similar to what one finds in Dostoyevsky or
Kierkegaard.</p>

<p>

Although Hartley identifies “sympathy” and
“theopathy” as basic orientations, the orientations do not
necessarily have a positive content. Hartley does not claim that
everyone is kind to others, or loves God. In some, these modes are
pathological, and theopathy is often only rudimentarily developed. In
discussing the “associations [that] may be observed in fact to be heaped
upon” the word <em>God</em>, he observes that these begin with the
“compound fictitious idea” children form when they
“suppose [God] to stand for a man whom they have never
seen” and that they end, for many people, when this idea
“is quite obliterated, without anything of a stable precise
nature succeeding in its room” (<em>OM</em> 1, prop. 98). Many
adults live with feelings of fear, aversion, boredom, and sometimes an
ardent longing, directed at a blankness—a mental picture, from which
the central image has been effaced.</p>

<p>

Hartley’s model of the self in terms of imagination, ambition, and
self-interest, and then of sympathy, theopathy, and the moral sense, is
dynamically complex. In his moral psychology, emotions are like
electrical charges that easily jump from one object, symbol, word, or
thought to another. Through such “transferences” of
emotion, the six orientations develop content; like physical
concretions, they coalesce, as emotional energies are bonded together.
And when the energy in one is sufficiently strong, the orientation
becomes the person’s “primary pursuit”: it demands
accretion of pleasure.</p>

<p>

Still, the model is not static, with the self fossilizing into
“one unactive cohering lump.” Thanks to the interplay of
associations and counter-associations, the six orientations both
“model” and “new-model” each other.
Psycholgical bodies are, as Hales said of vegetable and animal bodies,
in “a continual round of the production and 
dissolution”—until such time, Hartley believed, as when all shall discover their
identity in that “mystical body” in which “all have
an equal care for each other’s [happiness]; all increase in love, and
come to their <em>full stature</em>, to perfect manhood, <em>by that
which every joint supplieth</em>” (<em>OM</em> 2, prop. 68; cf.
Ephesians 4.16).</p>
