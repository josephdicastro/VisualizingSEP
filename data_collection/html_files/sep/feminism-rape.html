<h1>Feminist Perspectives on Rape</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Wed May 13, 2009; substantive revision Wed Jun 21, 2017</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
Although the proper definition of ‘rape’ is itself a
matter of some dispute, rape is generally understood to involve sexual
penetration of a person by force and/or without that person's consent.
Rape is committed overwhelmingly by men and boys, usually against
women and girls, and sometimes against other men and boys. (For the
most part, this entry will assume male perpetrators and female
victims.)</p>

<p>
Virtually all feminists agree that rape is a grave wrong, one too
often ignored, mischaracterized, and legitimized. Feminists differ,
however, about how the crime of rape is best understood, and about how
rape should be combated both legally and socially.</p>

<h2><a name="ComTheLibRadCon">1. Common Themes and the Liberal-to-Radical Continuum</a></h2>

<p>
Virtually all feminist thinking about rape shares several underlying
themes. First among these is feminists' emphasis on “breaking
the silence” around rape. Feminist thought and activism have
challenged the myth that rape is rare and exceptional, showing that it
is in fact a common experience in the lives of girls and women. In
recent decades, this awareness emerged in feminist
“speakouts” and consciousness-raising groups, where women
shared their experiences of rape and other forms of abuse. It has now
been amply confirmed by research: according to one study of over
16,000 Americans, 18.3% of women report having been victims of rape or
attempted rape at some time in their lives (Black et al., 2011). Of
these women, 42.2% were under age eighteen when they were first raped;
an earlier study showed that these women were twice as likely to
report having been raped as adults (Tjaden and Thoennes, 2000).
Indeed, many women suffer multiple rapes in their lives: in the same
earlier study, among those who reported having been raped in the past
year, the average number of rapes per woman during that time period
was 2.9.</p>

<p>
An accurate estimate of rape's frequency requires a clear
understanding of rape itself and of the varied circumstances in which
it occurs. Often contributing to the underestimation of rape's
frequency is a narrow and stereotypical conception of what rape is:
for instance, the image of a stranger jumping out from behind the
bushes, brandishing a weapon at a woman he has never seen before.
While such rapes do occur, the great majority of rapes are committed
by a man or men known to the victim: dates, relatives, friends,
bosses, husbands, neighbors, co-workers, and more. (For this reason,
again contrary to stereotype, most rapes are intraracial.) In the
study of over 16,000 Americans mentioned above, 51.1% of female
victims were raped by an intimate partner, and 40.8% by an
acquaintance (Black et al., 2011). Remarkably few assailants are
punished: with estimated U.S. state conviction rates of two to nine
percent of total rapes (Kim 2012, 264), “ninety-four to
ninety-eight percent of total rapists and approximately eighty-four
percent of reported rapists go free” (Kim 2012, 272). </p>

<p>
Perhaps the most basic challenge that feminists have posed to
traditional views of rape lies in the recognition of rape as a crime
against the victim herself. For much of recorded history women were
the property of men, with their value as property measured largely by
their sexual “purity.” In this context, rape was regarded
as a property crime against a woman's husband or father
(Burgess-Jackson 1996, 44-49). A raped woman or girl was less valuable
as property, and penalties for rape often involved fines or other
compensation paid to her husband or father (Burgess-Jackson 1996, 68).
The marital rape exemption in law, which survived in the U.S. into the
1990's, is clearly a remnant of this approach, assuming as it does
that no crime is committed when a man forces intercourse upon his
wife, since she is his own property; the property status of enslaved
African-American women was also thought to entitle their owners to the
women's unrestricted sexual use. A further corollary of this view was
that women who were <em>not</em> the private property of any
individual man—for instance, prostitutes—were unrapeable,
or at least that no one important was harmed by their rape (Dworkin
1997, 196–202, Burgess-Jackson 1996, 46-47, 69). Given this
entrenched historical and cultural legacy, feminists' redefinition of
‘rape’ as a crime against the woman herself is nothing
short of revolutionary.</p>

<p>
Sadly, the rate of rape reporting remains low; studies using random
sample surveys of large numbers of women find reporting rates ranging
from 16% to 36% (Anderson 2003, 78). Rates of conviction, too, remain
substantially lower than for other violent crimes; some studies
estimate a conviction rate of 5% (Caringella 2008) in the U.S.
Feminists' recognition of the severity and pervasiveness of rape's
harms, and of how infrequently victims receive justice, has inspired
decades of activism for social and legal change. Feminists in many
U.S. states have succeeded not only in changing legal definitions of
rape (see below), but also in ending many damaging and sexist
practices in rape trials. For instance, “rape shield” laws
now restrict the admissibility of evidence about a victim's sexual
history, and most jurisdictions have eliminated the “prompt
reporting” requirement, the corroboration requirement, and the
reciting of the traditional “cautionary rule” (that rape
is a charge easy to make and hard to disprove). All of these practices
reflect sexist and false assumptions—for instance, that rape
only happens (or only matters when it happens) to sexually
“pure” or “virtuous” women, and that women are
likely to lie about having been raped—while increasing the
trauma of rape trials for victims and decreasing the likelihood of
convictions. In addition to pressing for changes in law and in police
and prosecutorial practices, feminists have founded and staffed rape
crisis centers and hotlines to support victims, whether or not they
choose to pursue charges against their attackers.</p>

<p>
Feminist views of rape can be understood as arrayed on a continuum
from liberal to radical. Liberal views tend to regard rape as a
gender-neutral assault on individual autonomy, likening it to other
forms of assault and/or illegitimate appropriation, and focusing
primarily on the harm that rape does to individual victims. More
radical views, in contrast, contend that rape must be recognized and
understood as an important pillar of patriarchy. Johnson defines
patriarchy as a social system in which men disproportionately occupy
positions of power and authority, central norms and values are
associated with manhood and masculinity (which in turn are defined in
terms of dominance and control), and men are the primary focus of
attention in most cultural spaces (2005, 4-15). Radical feminists see
rape as arising from patriarchal constructions of gender and sexuality
within the context of broader systems of male power, and emphasize the
harm that rape does to women as a group.</p>

<p>
In addition, radical feminist approaches to rape often share one or
more of the following three features. First, they regard the
deprivation of women's bodily sovereignty—in particular, male
control over the sexual and reproductive uses of women's
bodies—as a central defining element of patriarchy (Whisnant
2007). As a result, they analyze rape as one of multiple forms of
men's sexual violence and exploitation, looking at their
interconnections and how they work in concert to maintain and
reinforce women's oppression. Second, they expand the definition of
‘rape’ to encompass more than just overt physical force
and violence (or the explicit threat thereof). Recognizing the ways in
which broad patterns of male power systematically compromise women's
bodily and sexual freedom, and challenging the equation of female
submission with meaningful consent, they tend to see a kind of
continuum (rather than a bright dividing line) between rape and much
“normal” heterosexual activity. Third, the focus on
group-based oppression has also led many radical feminist thinkers to
examine the role of rape itself, and of ideologies about rape, in
creating and reproducing not only patriarchy but multiple systems of
domination, including racism and colonialism.</p>

<h2><a name="CriWhaCou">2. Criteria: What Counts?</a></h2>

<p>
Feminists are committed to ensuring that women's and girls'
experiences of sexual violation are taken seriously as such, that the
harm they suffer therein is recognized, and that those who inflict
that harm are held accountable. Achieving these goals has often
involved arguing that certain kinds of encounters that have previously
not been socially or legally recognized as rape should be so
recognized—thus, challenging overly restrictive ideas (often
encoded in law) about what counts as rape (Burgess-Jackson 1996,
77-86; Sanday 1996, 161-183; Bevacqua 2000). Obvious examples include
the abolition of marital-rape exemptions and the recognition of date
and acquaintance rape. Feminists have also challenged the idea
(derived from English common law) that, in order for an encounter to
count as rape, the victim must have displayed “utmost” (or
even any) physical resistance, as well as the assumption that rape
must involve vaginal penetration by a penis (victims are raped orally,
anally, and/or with fingers or objects).</p>

<p>
There are varying feminist views about whether and how the concept of
rape, and hence its framing in the law, requires further renegotiation
or expansion.</p>

<h3><a name="Con">2.1 Consent</a></h3>

<p>
Both social and legal understandings of rape are typically based at
least partly on the notion of consent. (Many laws also include a force
requirement, about which more below.) To consent to something is to
reverse a <em>prima facie</em> supposition about what may and may not
be done. In most contexts, there is a standing presumption that one
does not have access to and may not make use of another's body,
property, personal information, or other elements of his or her
personal domain. This presumption is reversed, however, when (and for
as long as) the other consents to such access. Consent thus alters the
structure of rights and obligations between two or more parties.</p>

<p>
Assuming for the moment that, in sexual encounters, rape exists where
consent is lacking, the question then becomes what counts as consent.
Women's sexual consent has in many instances been understood quite
expansively, as simply the absence of refusal or resistance; feminists
have criticized this approach on the grounds that, among its other
untoward implications, it regards even unconscious women as consenting
(MacKinnon 1989b, 340; Archard 1998, 85). Furthermore, it has too
often been assumed that a woman's appearance, attire, status,
location, prior sexual history, or relationship to the man in question
either function as stand-ins for consent (that is, as “asking
for it”) or render her consent irrelevant or unnecessary. A
vital task on the feminist agenda has been to challenge and discredit
such ideas—to deny that what a woman wears, where she goes and
with whom, or what sexual choices she has made in the past have any
relevance to whether she should be seen as having consented to sex on
a particular occasion.</p>

<p>
Consent in general may be understood as either attitudinal or
performative (Kazan 1998). Attitudinal accounts see consent as a
mental state of affirmation or willingness, while performative
accounts see it as a certain kind of action or utterance (for
instance, saying “yes” or nodding). Because the kinds of
behaviors mentioned above (such as wearing revealing clothes, going
somewhere alone with a man, or engaging in heavy petting) have often
been claimed by perpetrators to constitute evidence that a woman was
in a mental state of willingness to have intercourse, feminists have
often rejected attitudinal accounts in favor of performative ones;
with a performative account, in contrast, a defendant can be
challenged to articulate exactly what the woman said or did that
constituted her consent to intercourse. An added advantage of a
performative account is that it suggests that sexual consent is not a
woman's implied default state, but rather must be actively and
affirmatively granted. Again, this is in contrast to traditional
patriarchal views, which often assumed that unless a woman physically
resisted—again, even “to the utmost”—a man's
attempt to have intercourse, she was consenting (or at least he was
justified in proceeding on that assumption).</p>

<p>
One limitation of a purely performative account of consent is that it
does not take into account the context in which the relevant behavior
or utterance occurs. For instance, if a woman says “yes”
or even feigns sexual enthusiasm in order to keep a knife-wielding
attacker from becoming angry and hurting or killing her, it would be
absurd to regard her behavior or utterance as consent (or at least as
meaningful consent). The question is what other contextual constraints
and pressures may also undermine the validity of a woman's (apparent)
consent. To put the point another way, having granted that
“no” always means no, we must recognize that, in some
cases, “yes” also means no. There are many kinds of
explicit and implicit threats that render a woman's consent to sex
less than meaningful: the man may threaten to sue for custody of their
children, to derail her green card application, to evict her, or
simply to sulk and make her life miserable for days should she refuse
to have sex. Which (if any) such nonviolent coercive pressures should
be regarded as rape, either morally or legally, is a matter of some
controversy (Schulhofer 1998; Burgess-Jackson 1996, 91-106).</p>

<p>
The question is especially important from a feminist point of view,
since it is to be expected that in a patriarchal society men
frequently hold positions of social, legal, and/or institutional power
over women and are thus positioned to withhold important benefits from
women who refuse them sexual access, in addition to threatening harms
and penalties. Viewing at least certain kinds of nonviolent coercive
pressures as incompatible with meaningful consent may yield the
conclusion that some <em>quid pro quo</em> sexual harassment is also
rape (Falk 1998). Furthermore, some radical feminists' description of
prostitution as “commercial sexual violence” (Jeffreys
1997) reflects an expansive understanding of the economic and other
coercive pressures that often compel women's consent to sexual acts in
prostitution (even where physical violence does not play a role).</p>

<h3><a name="MenRea">2.2 <em>Mens rea</em></a></h3>

<p>
A further complicating question is whether the criminal law's usual
requirement of <em>mens rea</em> (or “guilty mind”) should
apply to rape and, if so, how that requirement should be interpreted.
In the most general terms, a <em>mens rea</em> requirement means that
the prosecution must show not only that nonconsensual sex occurred,
but also that the man was in a certain state of mind with regard to
the woman's lack of consent. Just what that state of mind
is—what counts as <em>mens rea</em> in cases of rape—is a
matter of some dispute (Burgess-Jackson 1996, 137–161).</p>

<p>
The most conservative position—defended most famously in the
1976 <em>DPP v Morgan</em> decision (Baron 2001, 9-14)—holds
that a man has <em>mens rea</em> only if he believes the woman is not
consenting (or that she is at least probably not consenting). On this
view, a man who sincerely believes that the woman is consenting is not
guilty of rape, no matter how unreasonable his belief may be under the
circumstances. A more moderate view is that a man has <em>mens
rea</em> if he either believes the woman is not consenting or believes
unreasonably that she is consenting. Thus, in jurisdictions where this
understanding of <em>mens rea</em> is in force, the question of
whether the woman actually consented often gives
way—particularly in cases of date and acquaintance rape—to
the question of whether the man reasonably believed she consented.</p>

<p>
Theorists have different views about the conditions under which it is
reasonable for a man to believe that a woman is consenting to sexual
intercourse. Husak and Thomas (1992) argue that there are social and
behavioral conventions (or “courtship rituals”) by which
women manifest their willingness to have sex, and that where a woman
has engaged in such conventions, it is reasonable for a man to believe
she is consenting to sexual intercourse. Archard (1997) argues
forcefully against this view, however, pointing out that any such
conventions are likely to be ambiguous and not universally understood
(particularly since research shows that men routinely interpret
women's behavior in more sexual terms than women mean or intend), that
a man risks doing serious harm by relying on his beliefs about such
conventions, and that there is a ready alternative to risking such
harm, namely, inquiring explicitly as to his partner's consent or lack
thereof.</p>

<p>
One influential interpretation of “reasonable belief” in
sexual consent is that of Lois Pineau (1989), who points out that
judgments of reasonableness in this area must be based on some
normative conception of healthy, normal sexual interaction. The
prevailing conception, which she calls the
“aggressive-contractual model,” holds that women's
sexually provocative behavior generates enforceable agreements to have
sex, that male sexuality is uncontrollable past a certain point, and
that women are not to be trusted in matters of sexuality. Pineau
believes that this model is the backdrop against which many people
base their judgments about reasonable belief in rape cases. The
aggressive-contractual model should be replaced, she argues, with a
model of “communicative sexuality,” one that emphasizes
“an atmosphere of comfort and communication, a minimum of
pressure, and an on-going checkup on one's partner's state”
(1989, 231). Communicative sexuality is most likely to be rewarding
for both parties, allows them to promote each other's sensual ends
non-manipulatively and non-paternalistically, and observes norms
appropriate to friendship and trust. Because it is through
communication that one gains knowledge of one's partner's desires or
lack thereof, Pineau contends that “where communicative
sexuality does not occur, we lack the main ground for believing that
the sex involved was consensual.” She continues:</p>

<blockquote>
where a man does not engage in communicative sexuality, he acts either
out of reckless disregard, or out of willful ignorance. For he cannot
know, except through the practice of communicative sexuality, whether
his partner has any sexual reason for continuing the encounter. And
where she does not, he runs the risk of imposing on her what she is
not willing to have. All that is needed, then, in order to provide
women with legal protection from date rape is to make both reckless
indifference and willful ignorance a sufficient condition of <em>mens
rea</em>, and to make communicative sexuality the accepted norm of sex
to which a reasonable woman would agree. (239-40)
</blockquote>

<p>
In short, if a man does not engage in communicative sexuality, then he
does not really know whether his partner is consenting; thus, if he
nonetheless believes that she is consenting, then that belief is
unreasonable.</p>

<p>
Finally, some feminists have argued that rape should be a strict
liability offense, that is, one with no <em>mens rea</em> requirement
at all. According to MacKinnon, a <em>mens rea</em> requirement means
that “the man's perceptions of the woman's desires determine
whether she is deemed violated,” and this approach is
problematic because “men are systematically conditioned not even
to notice what women want” (1989, 180-81). Adopting a
“reasonable belief” standard does not help, in her view,
because the standard for “reasonableness” masquerades as
objectivity while almost inevitably relying on patriarchal and
pornographic assumptions; thus “measuring consent from the
socially reasonable, meaning objective man's, point of view reproduces
the same problem under a more elevated label” (181).</p>

<p>
Here MacKinnon speaks to a broader debate in feminist legal theory, in
which some feminists have argued for the adoption of a
“reasonable woman standard” in matters ranging from sexual
harassment to stalking, battering, and rape. Proponents of this
approach believe that a gender-neutral standard of reasonableness is
impossible given the differences between men's and women's social
positioning. They point out, for instance, that men have greater
social and (in most cases) physical power than women and, relatedly,
that women's beliefs and reactions are shaped by the constant threat
of male violence with which women live (Kerns 2001). Because of these
differences, women and men often have divergent perceptions of
interpersonal behavior (Scheppele 1991, 45): for instance, behavior
that men see as merely flirtatious may be experienced by women as
offensive or even threatening, and women may see advances as
physically intimidating that men see as aggressively amorous.
Proponents thus contend, in the words of Hubin and Haely (who reject
this approach), that “when we seek to determine whether the
actions and words of the victim constitute or indicate consent to
sexual intercourse – it is the standard of the reasonable
<em>woman</em> we must employ” (1999, 119). Thus, for example,
in assessing the reasonableness of an alleged victim‘s judgment
that it would be dangerous to resist a particular sexual advance, a
jury would ask whether a reasonable <em>woman</em> in that situation
would so judge. Opponents of the reasonable woman standard contend
that it is both possible and desirable to account for common
differences between men's and women's physiologies, social
experiences, and perceptions without importing gender into the
definition of reasonableness itself. For instance, while granting that
a reasonable person standard should often yield different conclusions
for men than for women, Hubin and Haely contend that “this is
not because the reasonable person standard fails to present a single
(gender neutral) standard, but because the standard we are employing
is sensitive to features of the agent and the situation that are
correlated with gender” (1999, 133).</p>

<h3><a name="For">2.3 Force</a></h3>

<p>
In many jurisdictions, the law defines the crime of rape as comprising
two separate elements: force and lack of consent. As West observes, in
such jurisdictions</p>

<blockquote>
sex that is undeniably <em>forced</em> is, nevertheless, not rape if
the victim “consented” to it; and … sex that is
undeniably nonconsensual is, nevertheless, not rape if there was no
force used to obtain it. (1996, 233)
</blockquote>

<p>
West explains that, historically, rape law has seen two kinds of
forced sex as consensual: first, the sex that a man forces on his wife
(since she was thought to have “consented” permanently and
irrevocably to sex by getting married); and second, submission or
acquiescence in the face of a show of force and/or a threat of more
violence to come. Furthermore, she points out, women are often
portrayed in both pornographic and mainstream media as enjoying, and
(the assumption is) therefore consenting to, forceful and even violent
sex; such assumptions often derail rape cases, as when a defendant
claims that the encounter was simply “rough sex” that was
enjoyed by the victim. Underlying the inclusion of a nonconsent
requirement over and above the force requirement, according to West,
is the view that “women consent to forced sex all the
time—so forced sex alone can't be rape” (239). Cases of
nonconsensual but unforced sex, on the other hand, include those in
which the victim is induced to have sex through fraudulent
misrepresentation (for instance, a doctor telling her that sex with
him is necessary for her cure), and those in which she is coerced
through nonviolent means (for instance, a professor telling her that
she must have sex with him to pass the course). The tendency of the
law to see such encounters as meaningfully consensual departs
strikingly from how consent is understood in other areas; as West
observes, “fraud or coercion that vitiates consent in
<em>non</em>sexual contexts constitutes either criminal or tortious
activity” (240).</p>

<p>
Most feminists see the dual requirement of force and nonconsent as
redundant at best and, at worst, as defining many rapes out of
existence. Feminists differ, however, as to how rape laws should
ideally be structured. Perhaps the most common view is that the force
requirement should be eliminated, and rape defined simply as
nonconsensual sex, with differing degrees of severity depending on
whether and how much force and violence are employed (Estrich 1987).
While some state statutes are now written this way, they often build
physical force into the definition of non-consent; thus in practice
they function very much like the dual requirement of force and
non-consent (Anderson 2005a, 630).</p>

<p>
Another alternative is to eliminate the nonconsent requirement,
defining rape simply as forced sex. MacKinnon defends a variant of
this strategy, contending that “Rape should be defined as sex by
compulsion, of which physical force is one form. Lack of consent is
redundant and should not be a separate element of the crime”
(1989, 245). This approach has the advantage of focusing on what the
perpetrator did, rather than on how the victim responded (that is, on
whether her behavior constituted, or could reasonably have been seen
by the perpetrator as constituting, consent).</p>

<p>
A third approach is to separate the two elements into two separate
crimes, one based on the use of force and the other on the lack of
consent. McGregor defends this idea, proposing that:</p>

<blockquote>
If either the offender engaged in sexual activity through the use of
force or he failed to secure meaningful consent, then [he] has
committed an offense …. Rather than requiring both conditions,
as the current statutes do, or attempting to pack all cases into one
or the other of the conjuncts … this approach recognizes that
there are at least two different offenses … for which there are
different conditions and different levels of seriousness. (1996, 190)
</blockquote>

<p>
Schulhofer (1998) argues, in a similar vein, that the law should
recognize two different offenses: sexual assault, which involves the
use of “physical force to compel another person to submit to an
act of sexual penetration” (283); and sexual abuse, a lesser
(though still felonious) crime, which involves sexual penetration
without the other person's affirmative and freely given consent. Some
commentators have observed that developing such a lesser offense may
aid in winning convictions, as juries are reluctant to convict
nonviolent offenders of rape. Anderson (2005a) criticizes this
approach, however, pointing out that survivors of what she calls
“all-American rape” (nonconsensual sex without extrinsic
force or violence, usually committed by an acquaintance) suffer trauma
at least as severe as do survivors of forceful rape. She contends that
“all-American rape” should retain the powerful label (and
potentially severe penalty) of rape, while rapists who employ violence
extrinsic to the rape itself should be charged with rape <em>and</em>
other offenses (such as kidnapping or aggravated assault) as
appropriate.</p>

<h3><a name="OthApp">2.4 Other approaches</a></h3>

<p>
Recent scholarship includes some novel approaches to the legal
definition of rape. MacKinnon, for instance, has recommended that a
broadened understanding of force (as including hierarchies of power)
should be supplemented not by a nonconsent requirement, but by a
standard of “welcomeness.” A consent standard, she
observes, incorporates gender hierarchy by assuming that men initiate
sexual contact which women then either accept or refuse, whereas a
welcomeness standard suggests the centrality of “choice,
mutuality, and desire” (2005, 243). She explains her approach as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>
The idea here is not to prohibit sexual contact between hierarchical
unequals per se but to legally interpret sex that a hierarchical
subordinate says was unwanted in the context of the forms of force
that animate the hierarchy between the parties. To counter a claim
that sex was forced by inequality, a defendant could (among other
defenses) prove the sex was wanted—affirmatively and freely
wanted—despite the inequality, and was not forced by the
socially entrenched forms of power that distinguish the parties.
(247-48)
</blockquote>

<p>
MacKinnon also recommends the passage of new, sex-equality-based civil
rights laws that sexual assault victims can use against their
attackers. Such laws, in her view, would offer survivors a kind of
dignity and control that criminal prosecutions often do not, while
attaching the “stigma of bigotry” to perpetrators
(248).</p>

<p>
Anderson (2005b) urges the elimination of both the force requirement
and the nonconsent requirement, and the adoption in their place of
what she calls the “negotiation model.” She contrasts her
approach with the two most common “reform” positions,
which she calls the No Model and the Yes Model. According to the No
Model, a sexual act is consensual unless the victim says no or resists
physically. According to the Yes Model, a sexual act is rape unless
consent is affirmatively granted (by verbal or physical behavior).
Against the No Model, Anderson points out that many victims suffer
peritraumatic paralysis and/or dissociation—that is, conditions
at the time of trauma that render them unable to protest or resist.
Furthermore, both the No and Yes models rely heavily on men's ability
to interpret women's nonverbal behavior, despite strong evidence
showing that men routinely fail in this endeavor: the No Model, for
instance, allows a man to infer consent from a woman's silence and
lack of physical resistance. Finally, both models in practice tend to
assume that a woman's willing participation in non-penetrative sexual
activity is a reliable indicator of her consent to penetration (for
instance, Anderson points out that according to Schulhofer, an
advocate of the Yes Model, a woman's engaging in heavy sexual petting
typically indicates her affirmative willingness to have intercourse).
This assumption, Anderson emphasizes, is not only often untrue but, in
the age of AIDS, especially dangerous.</p>

<p>
Like MacKinnon, Anderson sees a fundamental problem in the notion of
sexual consent as “a woman's passive acquiescence to male sexual
initiative” (1406). Negotiation, in contrast, “suggests
not the granting of permission for the actions of another … but
an active consultation with someone else to come to a mutual
agreement” (1421). The negotiation model thus requires
“consultation, reciprocal communication, and the exchange of
views before a person initiates sexual penetration” (1421).
(This requirement of consultation before penetration distinguishes
Anderson's approach from Pineau's, despite their shared emphasis on
communication; in addition, Pineau's model retains an overall consent
standard whereas Anderson abandons that standard.) Unless and until a
relational context has been established that enables partners to
interpret reliably each other's nonverbal behavior, the negotiation
must be verbal. The negotiation model is gender-neutral, requiring
that any person who initiates sexual penetration consult verbally with
his or her partner (of either gender) to come to a mutual
understanding of whether both parties want penetration to occur. Such
communication, Anderson observes, “expresses an interest in the
other person's perspective … [and] a willingness to consider
the other person's inclinations and humanity. It expresses that the
other person matters” (1423). The negotiation model thus differs
at least in spirit from even a version of the Yes Model that requires
verbal consent, in that it emphasizes mutuality rather than a
one-sided permission-seeking.</p>

<p>
Legal theorist Jane Kim has argued that “rape tolerance”
in the United States—evidenced by low rates of arrest,
prosecution, and conviction of rapists at the state
level—indicates a need for new legal approaches (2012, 273). In
her view, “rape should be considered a form of slavery
prohibited by the Thirteenth Amendment of the Constitution, allowing
for the creation of a federal criminal regime to prosecute and
prioritize rape in conjunction with state regimes” (266). She
argues that the Thirteenth Amendment was intended to prohibit slavery
and involuntary servitude in all of its forms, and that neither the
brief duration of many rapes nor concerns about a “slippery
slope” warrant excluding rape from its purview. “In order
to construct and prosecute rape in a manner consistent with its
purported gravity,” Kim contends, “rape must be
effectively prosecuted, prohibited, protected against, and abolished
under the Thirteenth Amendment” (267).</p>

<p>
It bears noting that successful rape prosecutions depend not only on
how rape is legally defined but, at least equally importantly, on the
general public's willingness to believe women's testimony (rather than
seeing them as lying or confused) and to recognize particular
encounters as instances of the applicable legal definition (that is,
to see <em>this</em> behavior as force, or <em>this</em> utterance as
expressing nonconsent). Also posing a challenge to successful
prosecution is what Estrich calls the “assumption of risk
approach to culpability”: the common belief that, as she puts
it, “women who put themselves in compromising positions
shouldn't complain when they are compromised” (1992, 10). The
continuing prevalence of such rape-supportive beliefs can render even
well-intentioned prosecutors unwilling to pursue legitimate cases,
given the likelihood that juries will refuse to convict.</p>

<h2><a name="WroHarRap">3. The Wrongs and Harms of Rape</a></h2>

<p>
Any legal definition of ‘rape’ implies some correlative
idea of what is morally wrong with rape: its illegitimate use of
force, its disregard of the victim's nonconsent, and so on. Feminist
theorists have often sought to articulate a more richly textured sense
of rape's wrongness, and of its distinctive harms, than the law alone
can provide. They have thus developed a number of interpretive
frames—ideas about what rape is most closely akin to, and/or a
form of—for understanding rape's wrongs and harms. No doubt both
the wrong and the harm of rape are complex and multifarious; these
interpretive frames suggest emphases that may be illuminating in
different contexts and for different purposes.</p>

<h3><a name="HarIndVic">3.1 Harms to individual victims</a></h3>

<p>
The view most commonly identified with feminism in popular discourse
is that rape is a crime of “violence, not sex”—that
is, a form of assault whose sexual nature is irrelevant, and which is
analogous to other violent crimes. While this view has rarely been
defended by feminist philosophers, it has been prominent in some
feminist anti-rape public education and activism. (One feminist
theorist often claimed to have held this view is Susan Brownmiller
(1975); see Cahill 2001, 16-28.) Such efforts often seek to challenge
views of rape as a “crime of passion,” motivated by the
perpetrator's overwhelming lust (presumably in response to the
victim's sexual attractiveness and/or provocation). Thus, in addition
to challenging victim-blaming assumptions, feminists often emphasized
rapists' non-sexual motivations, such as anger and the desire for
dominance and control; on this view, the rapist is a violent criminal
like other violent criminals, not just a guy seeking sex a bit too
vigorously. Similarly, this approach emphasizes that rape victims are
real crime victims, not vaguely titillating people who had some overly
rough sex and might just have liked it.</p>

<p>
The limitations of the “violence, not sex” approach,
however, are fairly glaring. Rape's sexual nature is central to
understanding both its perpetrators' motivations and its effects on
victims, not to mention the crime's broader social and ideological
roots and consequences. While perpetrators differ in their strongest
occurrent motivations, it is important to ask why so many men who wish
to harm or violate women do so in a sexual manner. Furthermore, some
rapes do occur because a man wants to have sex, and perhaps would even
prefer it if his partner consented, but is prepared to proceed without
her consent. Rape's sexual character is central from the perspective
of both actual and potential victims; as Cahill observes, “few
women would agree that being raped is essentially equivalent to being
hit in the face” (2001, 3). Furthermore, many rape survivors are
damaged specifically in their sexuality, facing difficulties in their
sexual relationships in the months and years following the rape.
Finally, because many rapes do not involve overt extrinsic violence,
the “violence, not sex” slogan may make it more difficult
for people to recognize less obviously violent experiences of sexual
force as rape. In short, rape is forced, abusive, and/or violent
<em>sex</em>; recognizing rape's sexual nature is crucial to
understanding not only its wrongs and harms, but also the cultural and
political meaning of sex in patriarchal cultures. As MacKinnon
observes, “so long as we say that [rape, sexual harassment, and
pornography] are abuses of violence, not sex, we fail to criticize
what has been made of sex, what has been done to us through sex”
(1987, 86-87).</p>

<p>
The violation of bodily and sexual autonomy is no doubt among rape's
most central harms. In their classic discussion, Frye and Shafer
(1977) employ the concept of “domain” to elaborate on such
violation. A person's domain—“the physical, emotional,
psychological, and intellectual space it lives in”
(338)—defines the range of matters over which the person has
rightful power of consent. Because a person's body is at the very
center of her domain and is the locus of the properties and capacities
that make her a person, the intentional invasion of the body is an
especially egregious attack: “to presume to wield an effective
power of consent over the personal properties and/or the body of [a]
creature … is ipso facto to deny that there is a person there
at all” (340). Thus, rape treats the victim not as a person but
as an object, and one with a purely sexual function. Frye and Shafer
emphasize that rape's communication of this message constitutes one
significant element of its harm: “[rape] gives [the victim] a
picture of herself as a being within someone's domain and not as a
being which has domain …. Whether it is the rapist's intention
or not, being raped conveys for the woman the message that she is a
being without respect, that she is not a person” (341-42).
Hampton sounds a similar theme, contending that through its expressive
content—“representing the rapist as master and the victim
as inferior object”—rape does an objective “moral
injury” to its victim's value (1999, 135). It is not surprising,
then, that many rape survivors describe feeling not only worthless,
but also numb, absent, or deadened. The reaction is understandable
since, as Cahill observes, “Rape, in its total denial of the
victim's agency, will, and personhood, can be understood as a denial
of intersubjectivity itself …. The self is at once denied and
… stilled, silenced, overcome” (2001, 132).</p>

<p>
Some recent discussions emphasize that a full account of rape's harm
must incorporate both its denial of victims' personhood and its
intimate, sexual and bodily nature. According to Cahill, “rape
must be understood fundamentally … as an affront to the
embodied subject …. a sexually specific act that destroys (if
only temporarily) the intersubjective, embodied agency and therefore
personhood of a woman” (2001, 13). Anderson, seeking to define
rape's harm based on the “lived experience” of those who
go through it, cites “dehumanization, objectification, and
domination” as prominent in the accounts of both rapists and
rape victims (2005, 641). Rape, she concludes, is best understood not
only as the denial of sexual autonomy, but as “sexually invasive
dehumanization” (643).</p>

<p>
The humiliation and shame often experienced by rape victims are
predictable results of experiencing total subjugation and the intimate
loss of control of one's body. These reactions—not to mention
victims' feelings of contamination, of having been defiled or
desecrated—are often exacerbated by cultural judgments of raped
women as dirty and impure, or as “damaged goods.” In some
cultures, these ideas are so powerful that a woman who is raped (or
who has consensual illicit sex) is thought to bring shame on her
entire family; such women sometimes become the victims of so-called
“honor killings” at the hands of male relatives (Banerjee
2003, Baxi et al. 2006, Ruggi 1998).</p>

<p>
A distinctive set of harms enters the picture when, as is increasingly
common, women and girls are violated while unconscious, often with
pictures or videos taken and circulated. As Kelly Oliver points out,
"lack of consent is valorized within popular culture to the point that
sexual assault has become a spectator sport and creepshot
entertainment on social media … sex with unconscious girls,
especially accompanied by photographs as trophies, has become a goal
of some boys and men" (2016, 59-60). In such cases, Oliver observes,
"The trauma of victimization not only becomes public but also
infinitely repeatable. It can go viral. It doesn't go away" (91).
Cressida Heyes (2016) provides a phenomenological account of the
devastating harms of raping an unconscious victim. Raping someone who
is unconscious, Heyes contends,</p>

<blockquote>
exploits and reinforces a victim's lack of agency and exposes her body
in ways that make it especially difficult for her to reconstitute
herself as a subject. It damages both her ability to engage with the
world in four dimensions (through a temporally persisting body schema)
and her ability to retreat from it into anonymity … Sexual
assault while unconscious can make the restful anonymity of sleep
impossible, leaving only the violent exposure of a two-dimensional
life. (2016, 365)
</blockquote>

<p>
The assumption that such rapes are less harmful than the rapes of
conscious victims--since the rape itself is not directly
experienced--is therefore badly mistaken, Heyes argues. The victim of
unconscious rape, she points out, "struggles to feel safe lapsing into
the one form of anonymity that is biologically and existentially
necessary for human life, yet ultimately she will have no choice but
to revisit this place over and over … no one can avoid going to
sleep for very long" (2016, 379).</p>

<p>
Many rapes lead to additional harms beyond those intrinsic to the rape
itself. Some rapes cause pregnancy or sexually transmitted diseases
(including HIV infection), and some rapists physically injure their
victims. Victims who do not reveal their rapes to others, whether due
to shame or to the expectation that they will not be believed,
experience profound isolation and lack of support; and indeed, many
who do report their rapes are disbelieved or blamed by friends,
family, and/or police. Due to both low reporting levels and low
conviction rates, relatively few victims see their rapists punished;
many of those raped by relatives, co-workers, friends, or other
ongoing acquaintances must then face continuing interaction with the
rapist, while those raped by strangers often fear that the rapist will
find and re-victimize them.</p>

<p>
With or without these additional harms (but especially with them),
rape constitutes severe trauma. Undergoing trauma shatters the
victim's most basic assumptions about herself and her safety in the
world. According to Brison, who survived a violent rape and attempted
murder, trauma</p>

<blockquote>
introduces a “surd”—a nonsensical entry—into
the series of events in one's life, making it seem impossible to carry
on with the series … . Not only is it now impossible to carry
on with the series, but whatever sense had been made of it in the past
has been destroyed. The result is an uneasy paralysis. <em>I can't go,
I can't stay</em>. All that is left is the present, but one that has
no meaning, or has, at most, only the shifting sense of a floating
indexical, the dot of a “now” that would go for a walk, if
only it knew where to go. (2002, 103-104)
</blockquote>

<p>
With its profound effects on social connection, cognition, memory, and
emotion, trauma disrupts the continuity of the self. It is strikingly
common for a trauma survivor to feel that she is not the same person
she was prior to the trauma, and even that at least a part of her has
died; as Brison puts it, “I felt as if I was experiencing things
posthumously … as though I'd somehow outlived myself”
(8-9). To reconstitute the self in a new form, the survivor must
construct a meaningful narrative that incorporates the trauma, but
many survivors face obstacles in this endeavor such as disordered
cognition, memory gaps, feelings of despair and futility, and the lack
of an audience willing to hear, believe, and understand their story.
Such isolation is exacerbated when the trauma was humanly inflicted
(as with rape), since such assaults, as Brison puts it, “[sever]
the sustaining connection between the self and the rest of
humanity” (40). Brison's own account emphasizes the
“extent to which the self is created and sustained by others
and, thus, is able to be destroyed by them” (62); this
relational element is central both to trauma itself and to any
possible recovery. Because “violent intrusions by others
… severely impair our ability to be connected to humanity in
ways we value” (61), recovery requires slowly repairing
connections—both to others and to damaged parts of
oneself—and rebuilding a sense of trust (again, of both oneself
and others).</p>

<p>
For many women, rape is not a one-time event; rather sexual violence
and exploitation are, for at least some period of time, routine
conditions of their lives. Such women experience female sexual
slavery, defined by Barry as any situation in which</p>

<blockquote>
women or girls cannot change the immediate conditions of their
existence; where regardless of how they got into those conditions they
cannot get out; and where they are subject to sexual violence and
exploitation. (1984, 40)
</blockquote>

<p>
As Barry observes, such situations include battering relationships,
most prostitution, and the sexual abuse of girl children, all of which
are common around the world. It is thus important to consider the
distinctive effects of such repeated and routine sexual trauma. Herman
has recommended the adoption of a new diagnosis, complex
post-traumatic stress disorder, to describe accurately the
psychological impact of “prolonged, repeated trauma”
(1997, 119). (This diagnosis is intended to encompass various forms of
humanly inflicted trauma, not only sexual trauma.) The damage of such
prolonged trauma to a victim's personality may be so severe as to
constitute what Frye has called mayhem: a psychic
“maiming” in which the exploiter instills in his victim
such a grossly distorted perspective on herself, her function, and her
worth that she becomes (whether temporarily or permanently) unable to
identify or pursue her own interests, assert her rights, or defend
herself against further aggression (1983, 70).</p>

<h3><a name="HarWom">3.2 Harms to women as a group</a></h3>

<p>
Rape is unquestionably a gendered crime: 91% of rape victims are
female, while almost 99% of perpetrators are male (Greenfield 1997).
In light both of these numbers and of rape's broader ideological
dynamics and social consequences, feminists have long contended that
rape harms not only its individual victims, but also women as a class.
Brison, for instance, calls rape “gender-motivated violence
against women, which is perpetrated against women collectively, albeit
not all at once and in the same place” (2002, 98). Understanding
how rape harms women as a group requires analyzing it not only as an
individual act but also as an institution—that is, a structured
social practice with distinct positions and roles, and with (explicit
or implicit) rules that define who may (or must) do what under what
circumstances (Card 1991). Feminists have highlighted the ways in
which the institution of rape reinforces the group-based subordination
of women to men: for instance, by making women fearful, and by
enforcing patriarchal dictates both about proper female behavior and
about the conditions of male sexual entitlement to women's bodies. As
Burgess-Jackson puts it, “Rape—the act and the
practice—subjugates an entire class of individuals (women) to
another (men) …. every woman, qua woman, is wronged by
it” (2000, 289).</p>

<p>
Feminists have long claimed that, in patriarchal cultures, rape is not
anomalous but paradigmatic—that it enacts and reinforces, rather
than contradicting, widely shared cultural views about gender and
sexuality. As Dworkin puts it, “rape is not committed by
psychopaths or deviants from our social norms—rape is committed
by <em>exemplars</em> of our social norms …. Rape is no excess,
no aberration, no accident, no mistake—it embodies sexuality as
the culture defines it” (1976, 45–46). A core dynamic of
patriarchal sexuality, on this view, is the normalizing and
sexualizing of male (or masculine) control and dominance over females
(or the feminine). This dynamic finds expression in a number of
beliefs about what is natural, acceptable, and even desirable in
male-female sexual interaction: that the male will be persistent and
aggressive, the female often reluctant and passive; that the male is
invulnerable, powerful, hard, and commanding, and that women desire
such behavior from men; that “real men” are able to get
sexual access to women when, where, and how they want it; that sexual
intercourse is an act of male conquest; that women are men's sexual
objects or possessions; and that men “need” and are
entitled to sex.</p>

<p>
One study of undetected, self-reported acquaintance rapists found that
these individuals' propensity to rape was significantly related not
only to their acceptance of rape myths and of traditional ideas about
male and female sexuality, but also to their belief that male sexual
aggression is normal (Hinck and Thomas 1999, 816). Such beliefs have
repeatedly been shown to play a role not only in men's self-reported
likelihood of committing rape, but also in people's tendency to define
rape more restrictively, and to attribute responsibility and blame to
rape victims (1999, 816). (The influence of rape myths on people's
definitions of rape explains why most men who report engaging in
“sexually assaultive, abusive, or coercive behavior in order to
procure sexual intercourse” (1999, 816) do not define their own
behavior as rape.) Feminists have coined the term ‘rape
culture’ to describe the pervasiveness and acceptability of
rape-supportive messages in media and popular discourse. Some have
further contended that many rapes, being at least partially motivated
by group-based animus as expressed in rape-supportive beliefs, should
be categorized as hate crimes (Wellman 2006).</p>

<p>
On this view, rape is a political practice by which spurious beliefs
about gender and sexuality are expressed, inscribed, and enforced via
the violation and control of women's bodies. Hampton thus claims that
“rape as it occurs in our society … is a moral injury to
all women … insofar as it is part of a pattern of response of
many men toward many women that aims to establish their mastery
<em>qua male</em> over a woman <em>qua female</em> …. Rape
confirms that women are ‘for’ men: to be used, dominated,
treated as objects” (1999, 135). This underlying gender ideology
helps to explain why, when men and boys are raped (almost always by
other males), they are often seen as having been feminized, treated
like women and thus rendered shamefully woman-like. </p>

<p>
Many feminists have emphasized the role of rape in controlling women's
behavior through fear. Dworkin contends that, due to the threat of
rape, “all women live in constant jeopardy, in a virtual state
of siege” (1976, 37); and several feminists have drawn analogies
between rape and lynching as forms of terrorizing, group-based social
control (Burgess-Jackson 2000, 286-88). Card argues that rape is a
terrorist institution, one which—despite its admitted
differences from acts more normally labeled terrorism, such as bombing
and hijacking—advances its political purpose, the continued
subordination of women, by terrorizing a target population (1991).
Like all terrorism, she contends, rape has two targets: the direct
victims, who are seen as expendable, and the broader population to
whom a message is sent, and who can then be manipulated by fear into
complying with demands they would otherwise reject. In response to the
threat of rape, women scrutinize and restrict their own
choices—what they wear, where they go and with whom, whether
they drink, what “messages” they may be inadvertently
sending men, and so on—to ensure that they are following the
unwritten rules that govern female behavior and that (supposedly)
distinguish the bad girls who get raped from the good girls who do
not. Even women who, because of their conformity to these rules, do
not feel afraid of being raped have nonetheless, Card points out, been
terrorized into compliance.</p>

<p>
A central element of rape as a terrorist institution, Card claims, is
a protection racket in which men, as the group both creating the
danger and proposing to deliver women from it, dole out
protection—sometimes temporary, sometimes permanent, often
illusory—in exchange for women's service, loyalty, and
compliance. In this system, “good” men protect virtuous
and deserving women from “bad” men, and part of what
defines a woman as deserving protection is her conformity to rules of
patriarchal femininity. Women who are not offered protection, or who
decline it when offered, are then frequently blamed for being raped.
Furthermore, as Card points out, the rules of the institution often
grant “protectors”—whether husbands, boyfriends, or
pimps—sexual access to the woman or women whom they protect, so
that nothing they do to those women is taken to count as rape. The
institution thus requires a woman to give up her sexual autonomy in
relation to one man, in order to gain his (conditional and unreliable)
“protection” from other men.</p>

<p>
The threat of rape, with its false promise that by being
“good” we can avoid disaster, plays an important role in
training women in the requirements of femininity. Describing a
“feminine bodily comportment that is marked by fear,”
Cahill observes that the female body well-trained in femininity
“is that of a pre-victim” (2001, 157). The feminine body
is marked by hesitancy, relative weakness, delicacy, and
restraint—qualities that in fact render women more vulnerable to
violence—and yet the woman or girl is taught to view her sexual
body as dangerously provocative because inherently
“rapable” (159). Hence her duty to control, conceal, and
monitor her body and its movements, so as not to bring disaster upon
herself. “The socially produced feminine body,” Cahill
claims, “is the body of the <em>guilty</em> pre-victim ….
she was somewhere she should not have been, moving her body in ways
she should not have, carrying on in a manner so free and easy as to
convey an utter abandonment of her responsibilities of self-protection
and self-surveillance” (160). By molding women both to
femininity and to self-blame, the threat of rape thus systematically
undermines women's capacity to resist not only rape itself, but
various other elements of their oppression as well. The threat is so
pervasive in the cultural environment that, according to Brison, girls
“enter womanhood freighted with postmemories of sexual
violence” (2002,
 87)<sup>[<a href="notes.html#1" name="note-1">1</a>]</sup>,
 and years of peremptory warnings and cautionary tales lead many
victims to experience rape as “a threat fulfilled” (Cahill
2001, 164).</p>

<p>
Many feminists contend that even as the institution of rape
systematically disadvantages women, it benefits men as a class by
underwriting beliefs about the naturalness of male dominance, defining
women of certain kinds or in certain circumstances as “fair
game,” rendering women dependent on and thus beholden to men for
protection, and giving men a competitive advantage by restricting
women's freedom of action and movement. May and Strikwerda contend
that “just as the benefit to men distributes throughout the male
population in a given society, so the responsibility (for rape) should
distribute as well” (1994, 148); in their view, men as a group
bear collective responsibility for rape. Rape's role in increasing the
burden of fear in women's and girls' lives leads Burgess-Jackson to
highlight it as an issue of distributive justice (1996, 181-205). He
contends that the state's obligation to advance justice requires that
it take steps to redistribute fear so that women no longer bear it as
an unfair and disproportionate burden; furthermore, he claims, since
men as a class are overwhelmingly the cause of women's fear, most or
all of the costs of such redistribution should be borne by men.</p>

<h3><a name="RapRac">3.3 Rape and racism</a></h3>

<p>
Rape is a tool not only of patriarchy, but also of racism,
colonialism, nationalism, and other pernicious hierarchies. These and
other power relationships in turn make women and girls even more
vulnerable to rape. In virtually any situation where women and girls
belonging to especially desperate or powerless populations are at the
mercy of men in authority—from female inmates and girls in
foster care, to undocumented immigrants, to refugees dependent on U.N.
peacekeepers and/or humanitarian aid workers for survival—some
of those men use their authority to force or extort sexual access.</p>

<p>
In the United States, the racial dynamics of rape are shaped by a long
history of white men raping their African-American female slaves.
Because the women were chattel property, the owners (and often
overseers) could and did use them sexually at will, with complete
legal and social impunity. Because children born of slave mothers were
slaves, regardless of their paternity, many slave owners benefited
from rape by producing more slaves for themselves. Roberts emphasizes,
however, that</p>

<blockquote>
the rape of slave women by their masters was primarily a weapon of
terror that reinforced whites' domination over their human property.
Rape was an act of physical violence designed to stifle Black women's
will to resist and to remind them of their servile status … .
Whites' sexual exploitation of their slaves, therefore, should not be
viewed simply as either a method of slave-breeding or the fulfillment
of slaveholders' sexual urges. (1997, 29-30)
</blockquote>

<p>
Slaves were frequently forced into undesired sexual liaisons with each
other as well, based on the whims or the breeding plans of their
owners. Ultimately, as Collins observes, “Black women as a class
emerged from slavery as collective rape victims” (2005, 223),
and the rape of black women, like the lynching of black men, was a
centerpiece of Klan activity post-Emancipation. Collins points out,
however, that unlike lynching, black women's sexual abuse by white men
during and after slavery did not become a central or universally
understood icon of American racism. The legacy of slavery and its
attendant ideologies has meant that, both legally and socially,
“for most of American history the crime of rape of a Black woman
did not exist” (Roberts 1997, 31).</p>

<p>
Black women's unrapeability was not only written into law, but
reinforced by a racial ideology that defined them as lascivious and
promiscuous by nature. This same racial ideology stereotyped black men
as savagely oversexed and thus sexually dangerous, especially to white
women. The post-Civil War terror campaign of lynching, which continued
through the 1930's, was frequently claimed to be punishment for black
men who had raped white women, although in fact only a minority of
lynching victims were even accused of having done any such thing (Hall
1983, 334; Davis 1981, 189), and of those, many had in fact had
consensual relationships with white women (Hall 1983, 340). The racist
association of rape with black men rendered rape by white men
comparatively invisible, thus making white men as a group
unaccountable for rape (Davis 1981, 199), a dynamic that continued
well into the 20<sup>th</sup> century (Dorr 2008).</p>

<p>
These destructive racial stereotypes remain powerful today, exerting
influence on people's judgments of whether a rape has occurred, how
serious an offense it is, and who is to blame (Foley et al. 1995;
Donovan and Williams 2002; George and Martinez 2002). Popular culture
plays an important role in conveying and legitimizing these
stereotypes. For instance, the image of sexually savage and
animalistic black masculinity is a central trope of the popular
“interracial” genre of pornography, marketed to white men,
in which black men are often depicted as damaging white women's bodies
with their unusually large penises (Dines 1998, 2006). As Collins
observes, “movies, films, music videos, and other mass media
spectacles that depict Black men as violent and that punish them for
it have replaced the historical spectacles provided by live, public
lynchings” (2005, 242).</p>

<p>
The stereotype of black women as sexually deviant and aggressive
“Jezebels” finds one contemporary reflection in the
“hoochie” image, which is increasingly prominent in black
as well as white cultural and media venues (Collins 2000, 81-84). One
study, designed in part to measure the influence of the Jezebel
stereotype on young black women's perceptions of their own rapes,
found that the “stereotype of Black women as sexually loose
appeared to be internalized by Black participants and identified as an
important reason why they were raped” (Neville et al. 2004, 91).
Another researcher, having found that the African-American women in
her study were less likely than white women to have disclosed their
rapes (Wyatt 1992, 86), attributes this difference in part to the fact
that “African American women …. do not anticipate that
they will be protected by traditional authorities and
institutions” (88). Meanwhile, both the stereotypes of black
women and their structural vulnerabilities contribute to a situation
in which, for too many, sexual abuse is a routine condition of life:
“being routinely disbelieved by those who control the
definitions of violence, encountering mass media representations that
depict Black women as ‘bitches,’ ‘hoes,’ and
other controlling images, and/or experiencing daily assaults such as
having their breasts and buttocks fondled by friends and perfect
strangers … may become so routine that African American women
cannot perceive their own pain” (Collins 2005, 229).</p>

<p>
Black women who have been raped by black men are sometimes silenced,
either in order to maintain their own hard-won image as
“respectable” or to avoid further tarnishing the public
image of black manhood. They may be penalized or shunned by their
families and communities for speaking out, and thus cut off from
important sources of support (Collins 2005, 226-27).</p>

<p>
Racist ideologies about rape are also prominent in the history of
colonialism and genocide against Native Americans. Ideas about Native
men as savage rapists, Native women as downtrodden and raped squaws,
and white men as heroic saviors of both white and Native women were
essential to the “colonial imagination” that explained and
justified the taking of Native lands (Smith 2005, 7-33). These ideas
were conveyed in widely read captivity narratives,
stories—usually apocryphal, and often written by white
men—of the abduction and brutal treatment of a white woman by
the “savages” (Smith 2005, 21-22; Faludi 2007, 200-279).
The message was that white women desperately needed white men's
protection, not only in the usual form of restrictions on the women's
behavior and mobility, but also by the men's efforts to control and
kill off dangerous natives. As for supposedly downtrodden Native
women, white men proposed to deliver them from their oppression by
civilizing them, assimilating them to more enlightened European values
and culture. In short, the ideology held that “Native women can
only be free while under the dominion of white men, and both Native
and white women have to be protected from Indian men, rather than from
white men” (Smith, 23). In fact, the reality was quite the
contrary. Smith argues that rape was a key method of forcibly
instituting patriarchal values in what had been relatively egalitarian
Native cultures:</p>

<blockquote>
In order to colonize a people whose society was not hierarchical,
colonizers must first naturalize hierarchy through instituting
patriarchy. Patriarchal gender violence is the process by which
colonizers inscribe hierarchy and domination on the bodies of the
colonized. (23)
</blockquote>

<p>
History bears out Smith's claim, as white men routinely raped and
brutalized Native people—first as prisoners and in massacres
(Smith 2005, 7-23), and later in epidemic levels of sexual abuse of
Native children in white-run boarding schools (Smith 2006). </p>

<h3><a name="WarRapGenRap">3.4 War rape and genocidal rape</a></h3>

<p>
Rape is a common, indeed arguably universal, form of abuse in war. It
takes many forms, including the mass rape of female civilians as
recreation and/or as a prize for military victory, the mass rape of
female civilians as a strategy or weapon of war, and the enslavement
of women and girls to provide sexual service for soldiers and
officers. The latter is frequently practiced both by official armies
(as in the enslavement of mostly Korean and Chinese women and girls by
Japanese forces during World War II) and by rebel militias (as in the
abduction of women and girls as “bush wives” for rebels in
Sierra Leone). Additionally, as more women enter military forces, the
rape of military women by their own male colleagues is an increasingly
reported abuse (Jeffreys 2007).</p>

<p>
Seifert criticizes the common view of rape as simply a regrettable
byproduct of wartime social breakdown and lack of military discipline
(as well as of naturally aggressive male sexuality), contending that,
in fact, rape is a routine element of military strategy, aimed at
undermining the will, morale, cohesion, and self-conception of the
enemy population. She observes that, during wartime, </p>

<blockquote>
the women are those who hold the families and communities together.
Their physical and emotional destruction aims at destroying social and
cultural stability …. in many cultures [the female body]
embodies the nation as a whole …. The rape of women of a
community, culture, or nation can be regarded … as a symbolic
rape of the body of that community. (1996, 39)
</blockquote>

<p>
It is thus not surprising that rape in war often involves heightened
sadism, as well as additional abuses such as forcing men to watch the
rape of their wives or daughters and forcing women to engage in sex
with their own sons, brothers, or other family members. In these and
other cases, according to MacKinnon, the rape of female civilians is
often “a humiliation rite for the men on the other side who
cannot (in masculinity's terms) ‘protect’ their women.
Many of these acts make women's bodies into a medium of men's
expression, the means through which one group of men says what it
wants to say to another” (2006, 223). </p>

<p>
Because rape in war frequently seeks to undermine and destroy bonds of
family, community, and culture, there are important points of
connection between rape in war and genocidal rape. Genocide is the
attempt to destroy a racial, ethnic, religious, or national group as
such, in whole or in part, by committing any of a number of acts
against the group's members; the acts include not only killing, but
also causing serious bodily or mental harm, creating conditions of
life intended to destroy the group physically, and imposing
restrictions intended to prevent births within the group. When such
acts are committed with genocidal intent, the victim is not only the
individual targeted, but the group itself. As Sarah Clark Miller
observes, rape is an extraordinarily effective genocidal strategy,
since it “corrupts women's roles as caretakers of relationships,
conveyors of cultural practices, and sustainers of meaning … .
In these ways, genocidal rapists twist the way in which women are
pivotal to the life of a community, rendering them pivotal to its
destruction” (Miller 2009, 513-514). </p>

<p>
Genocidal rape has been recognized and condemned by both the
International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) and the
International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY)
(Askin 2003). In both cases, rape was employed systematically against
the women of a certain group, as part of an organized campaign to
destroy that group. In Rwanda, the <em>interahamwe</em> raped hundreds
of thousands of women and girls belonging to the Tutsi ethnic group,
as part of an effort to exterminate the Tutsi people entirely.
MacKinnon describes the genocidal rape of Muslim and Croatian women in
Bosnia-Herzegovina as </p>

<blockquote>
ethnic rape as an official policy of war in a genocidal campaign for
political control …. It is specifically rape under orders
…. It is also rape unto death, rape as massacre, rape to kill
and to make the victims wish they were dead. It is rape as an
instrument of forced exile, rape to make you leave your home and never
want to go back …. It is rape to drive a wedge through a
community, to shatter a society, to destroy a people. (2006, 187)
</blockquote>

<p>
The Serbian mass rape campaign was distinguished not only by its
extraordinary brutality and notorious “rape camps,” but
also by the systematic forced impregnation of Muslim and Croatian
women and girls. The aim was to claim and colonize the women's bodies
reproductively as well as sexually, while increasing the population of
children identified as Serb: “Croatian and Muslim women [were]
being raped, and then denied abortions, to help make a Serbian state
by making what the perpetrators imagine[d] as Serb babies”
(MacKinnon 2006, 188). Goodhart points out that in such forced
impregnation, the soldiers' (and their commanders') hope is to
“create a baby (a son) who will infiltrate, undermine, or
destroy the mother's group” (2007, 309). The resulting children
are in fact seen by the maternal community as “children of the
enemy … a sort of nascent fifth column within an already
victimized community” (310) and are thus often stigmatized,
mistreated, or abandoned. Goodhart argues that the rapist-fathers have
violated the rights not only of the women they rape, but also of the
children thereby produced. The rapists are guilty of wrongful
procreation, a “deliberate, malicious, and sadistic” use
of procreative power with the intent of creating a child who is
unlikely to be able to enjoy his or her human rights (317-18). </p>

<p>
Some have puzzled over how war rape aimed at enforced pregnancy and
birth can be genocidal, since it aims to produce rather than prevent
births within the targeted population. In the case of mass rapes in
Bosnia, some Serb perpetrators may have believed they were producing
“little Chetniks [Serbs].” But Claudia Card points out
that such a belief, even if sincerely held, does not provide good
grounds for regarding these rapes as genocidal, since “in terms
of biological parentage, the child will be as much non-Serb as Serb,
and the child's culture will almost certainly not be Serbian”
(2008, 184). Thus, she seeks to explain the genocidal nature of rape
aimed at enforced pregnancy without appealing to perpetrators' beliefs
about the ethnic identity of any resulting children. A better
explanation, in her view, emphasizes that the Serbian campaign of
forced impregnation “imposed a social death on its victims
… it turned them into living (and gestating) corpses. …
Whether the perpetrators thought they were producing little Serbs is
irrelevant. What counts is the attack on the social meanings of the
lives of the women they tortured” (185). Card also develops and
expands Beverly Allen's proposal (1996) that military rape aimed at
enforced pregnancy employs sperm as a weapon of biological warfare.
Such attacks meet the criteria for biological warfare found in
international documents, she points out, since</p>

<blockquote>
a product of a living organism (the rapist) is used to attack a
biological system (the reproductive system) in members of the enemy
population. Although this attack need not produce illness, it is
designed to produce social chaos … . Sperm so used becomes a
social and psychological toxin, poisoning the futures of victims and
their communities by producing children who, if they survive, will
remind whoever raised them of their traumatic origins in torture.
… Unlike bacteria and viruses, sperm is easily containable,
storable, preservable, and deliverable by means of men's bodies. (187)
</blockquote>

<p>
Schott takes a different approach to explaining the genocidal nature
of military rape aimed at enforced pregnancy, drawing centrally on
Hannah Arendt's concept of natality. War rape aimed at forced
impregnation, Schott observes, “[transforms] birth into a weapon
of death. This is so for women who are raped, who lose a sense of
being at home in their own bodies and of having a future, and it is so
for the children born of forced maternity, who may suffer expulsion
from the mother's community” (2011, 14). Thus such rape
undermines natality, or the capacity for new beginnings, which Arendt
regarded as fundamental to human political life. Thus, Schott
contends, “war rape can be understood not only as a tool for the
unmaking of the social and cultural world, but also a tool for the
unmaking of the political world” (2009, 86).</p>

<p>
Rape is used as an instrument of genocide because it is extremely
effective in doing what genocides do: destroying not only individual
group members, but “that aspect of the group whole that is more
than the sum of its individual parts … the substance and glue
of community that lives on when individual members die”
(MacKinnon 2006, 225). This is especially true when the rapes leave
children motherless, the victims with AIDS, other diseases,
infertility, fistulas, and/or other internal injuries, and families
broken as victims are abandoned and shunned by their husbands or other
relatives. Even absent these additional harms, however, sexual assault
may be especially well suited to creating a kind of self-annihilating
shame in its victims, a shame that can focus on one's group identity.
MacKinnon points out that </p>

<blockquote>
sexual atrocities can reasonably produce revulsion to the identity
that marked the person for the intimate violation, making the raped
want to abandon who they are forever. When the shared identity for
which one is raped is ruined, shattered in oneself and relationally
between oneself and others, the group quality of the group so defined
is destroyed. (229)
</blockquote>

<p>
Smith underlines this point, and its special applicability to
genocidal contexts, observing that “in my experience as a rape
crisis counselor, every Native survivor I ever counseled said to me at
one point, ‘I wish I was no longer Indian’” (2005,
8). </p>

<p>
In February 2001, the ICTY found three Serbian soldiers guilty of rape
as a crime against humanity. Crimes against humanity are certain
extraordinarily inhumane acts (including murder, torture, enslavement,
and deportation) when those acts are systematically committed against
civilian populations in the course of armed conflict. The ICTY
judgment marked international humanitarian law's first official
recognition of rape as a crime against humanity. According to
Campbell,</p>

<blockquote>
the axiological foundation of the crime against humanity … lies
in a conception of a fundamental trauma to a social body, which
consists of the denial of the humanity of others. This model of rape
as a crime against humanity therefore involves not only a physical and
psychic trauma to the subject but also a symbolic trauma to
“humanity.” (2003, 510)
</blockquote>

<p>
The ICTY verdict thus conveyed a judgment that the Serbian
perpetrators of mass rape, in addition to violating their individual
victims and damaging the cultural and religious groups to which those
victims belonged, also insulted and injured humanity as such. Debra
Bergoffen (2012) points out that, in addition, the ICTY verdict
created a new human right to sexual self-determination--a right
grounded neither in the agency of an autonomous and inviolable subject
(implicitly gendered male) nor in an assumed feminine weakness needing
male protection, but rather in the dignity of a humanly shared
vulnerability.</p>

<h2><a name="Conc">4. Conclusion</a></h2>

<p>
Feminist theorizing about rape draws on a rich tradition of feminist
scholarship in many disciplines, as well as on women's insights into
their own rape experiences and on the knowledge gained through decades
of feminist anti-violence activism. As such theorizing continues to
develop—growing both more radical in its challenges to
patriarchal social and sexual assumptions, and more global and
 intersectional<sup>[<a href="notes.html#2" name="note-2">2</a>]</sup>
 in its analysis—it constitutes an essential support for
feminist movements against sexual violence.</p>
