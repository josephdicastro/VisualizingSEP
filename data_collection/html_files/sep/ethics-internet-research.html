<h1>Internet Research Ethics</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Fri Jun 22, 2012; substantive revision Wed Aug 24, 2016</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
There is little research that is not impacted in some way on or
through the Internet. The Internet, as a field, a tool, and a venue,
has specific and far reaching ethical issues. Internet research ethics
is a subdiscipline that fits across many disciplines, ranging from
social sciences, arts and humanities, medical/biomedical, and hard
sciences. Extant ethical frameworks, including
 <a href="../consequentialism/">consequentialism</a>,
 <a href="../utilitarianism-history/">utilitarianism</a>,
 <a href="../ethics-deontological/">deontology</a>,
 <a href="../ethics-virtue/">virtue ethics</a>, and
 <a href="../feminism-ethics/">feminist ethics</a>
<!--pdf include (see entries) pdf include--> have contributed to the
ways in which ethical issues in Internet research are considered and
evaluated.</p>

<p>
Conceptually and historically, Internet research ethics is related to
computer and information ethics
<!--pdf include 
 (see the entry on 
 <a href="../ethics-computer/">computer and information ethics</a>)
 pdf include-->
and includes such ethical issues as participant knowledge and consent,
data privacy, security, confidentiality, and integrity of data,
intellectual property issues, and community, disciplinary, and
professional standards or norms. Throughout the Internet’s evolution,
there has been debate whether there are new ethical dilemmas emerging,
or if the existing dilemmas are similar to dilemmas in other research
realms or despite technological influence (Elgesem 2002; Walther 2002;
Ess &amp; AoIR 2002; Marhkam &amp; Buchanan, 2012). These debates are
similar to philosophical debates in computer and information
ethics. For example, many years ago, James Moor (1985) asked
“what is special about computers” in order to understand
what, if anything, is unique ethically. Today, the same question
applies to Internet research (Ess &amp; AoIR 2002; King 1996).</p>

<p>
Yet, as the Internet has evolved into a more social and communicative
tool and venue, the ethical issues have shifted from purely data
driven to more human-centered. “On-ground” or face-to-face
analogies, however, may not be applicable to online research. For
example, the concept of the public park has been used as a site where
researchers might observe others with little ethical controversy, but
online, the concepts of public versus private are much more
complex. Thus, some scholars suggest that the specificity of Internet
research ethics calls for new regulatory and/or professional and
disciplinary guidance. For these reasons, the concept of human
subjects research policy and regulation informs this entry, along with
disciplinary standards, which will explore the growing areas of
ethical and methodological complexity, including personal
identifiability, reputational risk and harm, notions of public space
and public text, ownership, and longevity of data as they relate to
Internet research. Specifically, the emergence of the social web
raises issues around subject or participant recruitment practices,
tiered informed consent models, and protection of various expectations
and forms of privacy in an ever-increasing world of diffused and
ubiquitous technologies; anonymity and confidentiality of data in
spaces where researchers and their subjects may not fully understand
the terms and conditions of those venues or tools; challenges to data
integrity as research projects can be outsourced or crowdsourced to
online labor marketplaces; and jurisdictional issues as more research
is processed, stored, and disseminated via cloud computing or in
remote server locales, presenting myriad legal complexities given
jurisdictional differences in data laws. Further, the emergence of big
data research has grown and has become the next discrete phase of
Internet research, following social media and social computing. </p>

<p>
As a result, researchers using the Internet as a tool for and/or a
space of research—and their research ethics boards (REBs), also
known as institutional review boards (IRBs) in the United States or
human research ethics committees (HRECs) in other countries such as
Australia—have been confronted with a series of new ethical
questions: What ethical obligations do researchers have to protect the
privacy of subjects engaging in activities in “public”
Internet spaces? What are such public spaces? Is there any reasonable
expectation of privacy in an era of pervasive and ubiquitous
surveillance and data tracking? How is confidentiality or anonymity
assured online? How is and should informed consent be obtained online?
How should research on minors be conducted, and how do you prove a
subject is not a minor? Is deception (pretending to be someone you are
not, withholding identifiable information, etc) online a norm or a
harm? How is “harm” possible to someone existing in an
online space? How identifiable are individuals in large data sets? Do
human subjects protections apply to big data? As more
industry-sponsored research takes place, what ethical protections
exist outside of current regulatory structures?</p>

<p>
A growing number of scholars have explored these and related questions
(see, for example, Bromseth 2002; Bruckman 2006; Buchanan 2004;
Buchanan &amp; Ess 2008; Johns, Chen &amp; Hall
2003; Kitchin 2003, 2008; King 1996; Mann 2003; Markham &amp; Baym
2008; McKee &amp; Porter 2009; Thorseth 2003; Ess 2016; Zimmer &amp;
Kinder-Kurlanda, forthcoming), scholarly associations have drafted
ethical guidelines for Internet research (Ess &amp; Association of
Internet Researchers 2002; Markham, Buchanan, and AoIR, 2012; Kraut et
al. 2004), and non-profit scholarly and scientific agencies such as
AAAS (Frankel &amp; Siang 1999) have begun to confront the myriad of
ethical concerns that Internet research poses to researchers and
research ethics boards (REBs).</p>

<h2><a name="Def">1. Definitions</a></h2>

<p>
The commonly accepted definition of Internet research ethics (IRE) has
been used by Buchanan and Ess (2008, 2009), Buchanan (2010), and Ess
&amp; Association of Internet Researchers (AoIR) (2002):</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
<em>IRE</em> is defined as the analysis of ethical issues and
application of research ethics principles as they pertain to research
conducted on and in the Internet. Internet-based research, broadly
defined, is research which utilizes the Internet to collect
information through an online tool, such as an online survey; studies
about how people use the Internet, e.g., through collecting data
and/or examining activities in or on any online environments; and/or,
uses of online datasets, databases, or repositories. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
These examples were broadened in 2012 by the United States
Secretary’s Advisory Committee to the Office for Human Research
Protections, and included under the umbrella term Internet
Research:</p>

<ul>

<li>Research studying information that is already available on or via
the Internet without direct interaction with human subjects
(harvesting, mining, profiling, scraping, observation or recording of
otherwise-existing data sets, chat room interactions, blogs, social
media postings, etc.)</li>

<li>Research that uses the Internet as a vehicle for recruiting or
interacting, directly or indirectly, with subjects (Self-testing
websites, survey tools, Amazon Mechanical Turk, etc.)</li>

<li>Research about the Internet itself and its effects (use patterns
or effects of social media, search engines, email, etc.; evolution of
privacy issues; information contagion; etc.) </li>

<li>Research about Internet users: what they do, and how the Internet
affects individuals and their behaviors Research that utilizes the
Internet as an interventional tool, for example, interventions that
influence subjects’ behavior </li>

<li>Others (emerging and cross-platform types of research and methods,
including m-research (mobile))</li>

<li>Recruitment in or through Internet locales or tools, for example
social media, push technologies</li>
</ul>

<p>
A critical distinction in the definition of Internet research ethics
is that between the Internet as a research tool versus a research
venue. The distinction between tool and venue plays out across
disciplinary and methodological orientations. As a tool, Internet
research is enabled by search engines, data aggregators, databases,
catalogs, and repositories, while venues include such places or
locales as conversation applications (IM/chat rooms, for example),
MUDs, MOOs, MMORPGs, (forms of role-playing games, virtual worlds)
newsgroups, home pages, blogs, micro-blogging (i.e., Twitter), RSS
feeds, crowdsourcing applications, or online course
software.</p>
 
<p>
Another way of conceptualizing the distinction between tool and venue
comes from Kitchin (2008), who has referred to a distinction in
Internet research using the concepts of “engaged web-based
research” versus “non-intrusive web-based research:”
“Non-intrusive analyses refer to techniques of data collection
that do not interrupt the naturally occurring state of the site or
cybercommunity, or interfere with premanufactured text. Conversely,
engaged analyses reach into the site or community and thus engage the
participants of the web source” (p. 15). These two constructs
provide researchers with a way of recognizing when considering of
human subject protections might need to occur. McKee and Porter
(2009), as well as Banks and Eble (2007) provide guidance on the
continuum of human-subjects research, noting a distinction between
person-based versus text-based.  For example, McKee and Porter provide
a range of research variables (public/private, topic sensitivity,
degree of interaction, and subject vulnerability) which are useful in
determining where on the continuum of text-based versus how
person-based the research is, and whether or not subjects would need
to consent to the research (pp.  87–88).</p>

<p>
While conceptually useful for determining human subjects
participation, the distinction between tool and venue or engaged
versus non-intrusive web-based research is increasingly blurring in
the face of social media and their third party applications. Buchanan
(2016) has conceptualized three phases or stages of Internet research,
and the emergence of social media characterize the second phase, circa
2006-2014. The concept of social media entails “A group of
Internet-based applications that build on the ideological and
technological foundations of Web 2.0, and that allow the creation and
exchange of user-generated content” (Kaplan &amp; Haenlein
2010). A “social network site” is a category of websites
with profiles, semi-persistent public commentary on the profile, and a
traversable publicly articulated social network displayed in relation
to the profile.</p>

<p>
This collapse of tool and venue can be traced primarily to the
increasing use of third party sites and applications such as Facebook,
Google+, or any of the myriad online survey tools where subject or
participant recruitment, data collection, data analysis, and data
dissemination can all occur in the same space.
Gilbert (2009) has specifically argued against the terms of use or end
user license agreement stipulations in virtual worlds, noting that
such agreements are often “flawed,” as they rely on laws
and regulations from a specific locale and attempt to enforce them in
a non place-based environment. The terms of
“inter-jurisdictional coordination” (p. 3) are inherently
challenging. Nonetheless, researchers now make frequent use of data
aggregation tools, scraping data from user profiles or transaction
logs, harvesting data from Twitter streams, or storing data on cloud
servers such as Dropbox, only after agreeing to the terms of service
that go along with those sites. The use of such third party
applications or tools changes fundamental aspects of research, and are
unique characteristics of Internet research at this time. These unique
characteristics implicate concepts and practicalities of privacy,
consent, ownership, jurisdictional boundaries, and recruitment
measures.</p>

<p>
A key moment that typified and called attention to many of these
concerns emerged with the 2014 Facebook Emotional Contagion study. By
virtue of agreeing to Facebook’s Terms of Service, did users
consent to participation in research activities? Should there have
been a debriefing after the experiment? How thoroughly did a
university research ethics board review the study? Should
industry-sponsored research undergo internal ethics review? In
response to the outcry of the Contagion study, Ok Cupid’s
Christian Rudder (2014) defended these sorts of experiments, noting
“We noticed recently that people didn’t like it when
Facebook ‘experimented’ with their news feed. Even the FTC
is getting involved. But guess what, everybody: if you use the
Internet, you’re the subject of hundreds of experiments at any
given time, on every site. That’s how websites work.” </p>

<p>
The phenomenon of the social web forces an ongoing negotiation between
researchers and their data sources or human subjects, as seen in the
Facebook contagion study and the subsequent reaction to it. Moreover,
with the growing use and concentration of mobile devices, the notion
of Internet research is expanding with a movement away from a
“place-based” Internet to a dispersed reality. Data
collection from mobile devices is on the increase. For example, mobile
devices enable the use of synchronous data collection and
dissemination from non-place based environments. Researchers using
cloud-enabled applications can send and receive data to and from
participants synchronously. The impact of such research possibilities
for epidemiological research (Leibovici et al. 2010) to
community-based participatory research (Parras et al. 2011) is
staggering for its scientific potential while demanding for the
concurrent ethical challenges. Many of these challenges require a
careful consideration of traditional notions of human subjects
research and how Internet research pushes the boundaries of these
notions.</p>

<h2><a name="HumSubRes">2. Human Subjects Research</a></h2>

<p>
The practical, professional, and theoretical implications of human
subjects protections has been covered extensively in scholarly
literature, ranging from medical/biomedical to social sciences to
computing and technical disciplines (see Beauchamp &amp; Childress
2008; Emanual et al. 2003; Sieber 1992 and forthcoming; Wright 2006).
Relevant protections and regulations continue to receive much
attention in the face of research ethics violations (see, for example,
Skloot 2010, on Henrietta Lacks; the U.S. Government’s admission and
apology to the Guatemalan Government for STD testing in the 1940s; and
Gaw &amp; Burns 2011, on how lessons from the past might inform current
research ethics and conduct).</p>

<p>
The history of human subjects protections (Sparks 2002—see Other
Internet Resources) grew out of atrocities such as Nazi human
experimentation during World War II, which resulted in the Nuremberg
Code, in 1947; subsequently followed by the Declaration of Helsinki on
Ethical Principles for Medical Research Involving Human Subjects
(World Medical Association 1964/2008). In response to the Tuskegee
syphilis experiment, an infamous clinical study conducted between 1932
and 1972 by the U.S. Public Health Service studying the natural
progression of untreated syphilis in rural African-American men in
Alabama under the guise of receiving free health care from the
government, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services put forth
a set of basic regulations governing the protection of human subjects
(45 C.F.R. § 46), followed by the publication of the
“Ethical Principles and Guidelines for the Protection of Human
Subjects of Research” by the National Commission for the
Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research,
known as the Belmont Report (NCPHSBBR 1979). The Belmont Report
identifies three fundamental ethical principles for all human subjects
research: Respect for Persons, Beneficence, and Justice.</p>

<p>
To ensure consistency across federal agencies in the United States
context in human subjects protections, in 1991, the Federal Policy for
the Protection of Human Subjects, also known as the “Common
Rule” was codified. Similar regulatory frameworks protecting
human subjects have emerged across the world, including the Canadian
Tri-Council, the Australian Research Council, The European Commission,
The Research Council of Norway and its National Committee for Research
Ethics in the Social Sciences and Humanities (NESH 2006; NESH 2014),
and the U.K.’s NHS National Research Ethics Service and the Research
Ethics Framework (REF) of the ESRC (Economic and Social Research
Council) General Guidelines, and the Forum for Ethical Review
Committees in Asia and the Western Pacific (FERCAP).</p>

<p>
To date, the various U.S. regulatory agencies bound by the Common Rule
have not issued formal guidance on Internet research. Similarly, few
regulatory bodies in other countries have changed or redefined their
regulations because of, or in light of, Internet research. However,
guidelines for researcher and reviewer considerations have begun to
emerge globally. Despite regional and cultural difference, Buchanan
(2010) has outlined the similarities in the mission, scope, and
intentions the REBs globally, predominantly around shared notions of
risk and harm, justice, and respect for persons.</p>

<p>
While stopping short of regulatory guidance, many research ethics
boards are exploring the ways in which Internet research complicates
traditional models of human subjects protections can be, or are,
applied. For example, the United States Department of Health and Human
Services (DHHS) and the Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP)
operate with the following definition of human subjects (45 C.F.R.
§ 46.102(f) 2009).</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Human subject means a living individual about whom an investigator
(whether professional or student) conducting research obtains</p>

<ol>

<li>data through intervention or interaction with the individual,
or</li>

<li>identifiable private information.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Intervention includes both physical procedures by which data are
gathered (for example, venipuncture) and manipulations of the subject
or the subject’s environment that are performed for research purposes.
Interaction includes communication or interpersonal contact between
investigator and subject. Private information includes information
about behavior that occurs in a context in which an individual can
reasonably expect that no observation or recording is taking place,
and information which has been provided for specific purposes by an
individual and which the individual can reasonably expect will not be
made public (for example, a medical record). Private information must
be individually identifiable (i.e., the identity of the subject is or
may readily be ascertained by the investigator or associated with the
information) in order for obtaining the information to constitute
research involving human subjects (OHRP, 2008).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Two novel notions entering human subjects discourse include
“human non-subjects research” and “human harming
research.” Brothers and Clayton (2010) propose human
non-subjects as a conceptual category, not as a replacement of
regulatory language but as another category for research review
considerations. Human non-subjects research is emerging in light of
technological advancements and research development which uses
deidentified information on humans, for example, genetic data, or
discrete variables from a data set, specifically in the contexts of
tissue banking or deidentified data in repositories that are used for
other research beyond when the samples or data were first collected.
An individual may have consented to the original research, say, in a
clinical trial, in such cases, reconsent may be impossible, yet the
samples may still pose reidentification risks to humans. For instance,
as data sets are shared, data may be scrubbed to remove all
identifiers, or some identifiers may be kept with the data or the data
custodian. Rothstein (2010) agrees, with a clear eye to privacy and
risk: “The use of deidentified health information and biological
specimens in research creates a range of privacy and other risks to
individuals and groups. The current regulatory system, under which
privacy protections are afforded identifiable information but no
protections apply to deidentified information, needs to be
revised” (p. 3). O’Rourke (2007) has provided guidance on the
use of human specimens and banking, which could be adapted to other
forms of data banking.</p>

<p>
Carpenter and Dittrich (2011) and Aycock et al. (2012) refer to the
notion of “human-harming research” as a variable in human
subjects review in Internet, or more specifically, computer science or
information/communication technology (ICT) research. Carpenter and
Dittrich encourage</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Review boards [to] transition from an informed consent driven review
to a risk analysis review that addresses potential harms stemming from
research in which a researcher does not directly interact with the
at-risk individuals….[The] distance between researcher and
affected individual indicates that a paradigm shift is necessary in
the research arena. We must transition our idea of research protection
from “human subjects research” to “human harming
 research.”<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-1" id="ref-1">1</a>]</sup></p>
 </blockquote>

<p>
Similarly, Aycock et al. (2012) assert that</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Researchers and boards must balance presenting risks related to the
specific research with risks related to the technologies in use. With
computer security research, major issues around risk arise, for
society at large especially. The risk may not seem evident to an
individual but in the scope of security research, larger populations
may be vulnerable. There is a significant difficulty in quantifying
risks and benefits, in the traditional sense of research
ethics….An aggregation of surfing behaviors collected by a bot
presents greater distance between researcher and respondent than an
interview done in a virtual world between avatars. This distance leads
us to suggest that computer security research focus less concern
around <em>human subjects research</em> in the traditional sense and
more concern with <em>human harming research.</em> (italics
original)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
These two conceptual notions are relevant for considering emergent
forms of identities or personally identifiable information (PII) such
as avatars, virtual beings, bots, textual and graphical information.
Within the Code of Federal Regulations (45 C.F.R. § 46.102(f)
2009): New forms of representations are considered human subjects if
PII about living individuals is obtained. PII can be obtained by
researchers through scraping data sources, profiles or avatars, or
other pieces of data made available by the human “behind the
avatar or other representation” (Odwazny &amp; Buchanan 2011).
Fairfield agrees: “An avatar, for example, does not merely
represent a collection of pixels—it represents the identity of
the user” (2012, p. 701)</p>

<p>
The multiple disciplines already long engaged in human subjects
research (medicine, sociology, anthropology, psychology,
communication) have established ethical guidelines intended to assist
researchers and those charged with ensuring that research on human
subjects follows both legal requirements and ethical practices. But
with research involving the Internet—where individuals
increasingly share personal information on platforms with porous and
shifting boundaries, where both the spread and aggregation of data
from disparate sources is increasingly the norm, and where web-based
services, and their privacy policies and terms of service statements,
morph and evolve rapidly—the ethical frameworks and assumptions
traditionally used by researchers and REBs are frequently
challenged.</p>

<p>
At the time of this revision, the Department of Health and Human
Services has been working on a revision to the Common Rule. The Notice
of Proposed Rule Making includes revisions to categories of research,
consent, and data security, among other changes that affect research
in the social-behavioral-educational and biomedical realms.</p>

<h2><a name="HisDevIREDis">3. History and Development of IRE as a Discipline</a></h2>

<p>
An extensive body of literature has developed
since the 1990s around the use of the Internet for research (Jones
1999; Hunsinger, Klastrup &amp; Allen 2010; Consalvo &amp; Ess 2010),
with a growing emphasis on the ethical dimensions of Internet
research.</p>

<p>
A flurry of Internet research, and explicit concern for the ethical
issues concurrently at play in it, began in the mid 1990s. In 1996,
Storm King recognized the growing use of the Internet as a venue for
research. His work explored the American Psychological Association’s
guidelines for human subjects research with emergent forms of email,
chat, listservs, and virtual communities. With careful attention to
risk and benefit to Internet subjects, King offered a cautionary
note:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
When a field of study is new, the fine points of ethical
considerations involved are undefined. As the field matures and
results are compiled, researchers often review earlier studies and
become concerned because of the apparent disregard for the human
subjects involved. (King 1996,119)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The 1996 issue of <em>Information Society</em> dedicated to Internet
research is considered a watershed moment, and included much seminal
research, still of impact and relevance today (Allen 1996; Boehlefeld
1996; Reid 1996).</p>

<p>
Sherry Turkle’s 1997 <em>Life on the Screen: Identity in the Age of
the Internet</em> called direct attention to the human element of
online game environments. Moving squarely towards person-based versus
text-based research, Turkle pushed researchers to consider human
subjects implications of Internet research. Similarly, Markham’s
<em>Life Online: Researching Real Experience in Virtual Space</em>
(1998) highlighted methodological complexities of online ethnographic
studies, as did Jacobson’s 1999 methodological treatment of Internet
research. The “field” of study changed the dynamics of
researcher-researched roles, identity, and representation of
participants from virtual spaces. Markham’s work in qualitative online
research has been influential across disciplines, as research in
nursing, psychology, and medicine has found the potential of this
paradigm for online research (Flicker et al. 2004; Esyenbach &amp;
Till 2001; Seaboldt &amp; Kupier 1997; Sharf 1996;).</p>

<p>
Then, in 1999, the American Association for the Advancement of Science
(AAAS), with a contract from the U.S. Office for Protection from Research
Risks (now known as the Office for Human Research
Protections), convened a workshop, with the goal of assessing the alignment
of traditional research ethics concepts to Internet research. The
workshop acknowledged </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The vast amount of social and behavioral information potentially
available on the Internet has made it a prime target for researchers
wishing to study the dynamics of human interactions and their
consequences in this virtual medium. Researchers can potentially
collect data from widely dispersed population sat relatively low cost
and in less time than similar efforts in the physical world. As a
result, there has been an increase in the number of Internet studies,
ranging from surveys to naturalistic observation. (Frankel &amp; Siang
1999)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In the medical/biomedical contexts, Internet research is growing
rapidly. Also in 1999, Gunther Eysenbach wrote the first editorial to
the newly formed <em>Journal of Medical Internet Research</em>. There
were three driving forces behind the inception of this journal, and
Eysenbach calls attention to the growing social and interpersonal
aspects of the Internet:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
First, Internet protocols are used for clinical information and
communication. In the future, Internet technology will be the platform
for many telemedical applications. Second, the Internet revolutionizes
the gathering, access and dissemination of non-clinical information in
medicine: Bibliographic and factual databases are now world-wide
accessible via graphical user interfaces, epidemiological and public
health information can be gathered using the Internet, and
increasingly the Internet is used for interactive medical education
applications. Third, the Internet plays an important role for consumer
health education, health promotion and teleprevention. (As an aside,
it should be emphasized that “health education” on the
Internet goes beyond the traditional model of health education, where
a medical professional teaches the patient: On the Internet, much
“health education” is done
“consumer-to-consumer” by means of patient self support
groups organizing in cyberspace. These patient-to-patient interchanges
are becoming an important part of healthcare and are redefining the
traditional model of preventive medicine and health promotion).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
With scholarly attention growing and with the 1999 AAAS report calling
for action, other professional associations took notice and began
drafting statements or guidelines, or addendum to their extant
professional standards. For example, The Board of Scientific Affairs
(BSA) of the American Psychological Association established an
Advisory Group on Conducting Research on the Internet in 2001; the
American Counseling Association’s 2005 revision to its Code of Ethics;
the Association of Internet Researchers (AoIR) Ethics Working Group
Guidelines, The National Committee for Research Ethics in the Social
Sciences and the Humanities Research Ethics Guidelines for Internet
Research, among others, have directed researchers and review boards to
the ethics of Internet research, with attention to the most common
areas of ethical concern (see
 <a href="#Oth">Other Internet References</a>
 for links).</p>

<p>
While many researchers focus on traditional research ethics
principles, conceptualizations of Internet research ethics depend on
disciplinary perspectives. Some disciplines, notably from the arts and
humanities, posit that Internet research is more about context and
representation than about “human subjects,” suggesting
there is no intent, and thus minimal or no harm, to engage in research
about actual persons. The debate has continued since the early 2000s.
White (2002) argued against extant regulations that favored or
privileged specific ideological, disciplinary and cultural
prerogatives, which limit the freedoms and creativity of arts and
humanities research. For example, she notes that the AAAS report
“confuses physical individuals with constructed materials and
human subjects with composite cultural works,” again calling
attention to the person versus text divide that has permeated Internet
research ethics debates. Another example of disciplinary differences
comes from the Oral History Association, which acknowledged the
growing use of the Internet as a site for research:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Simply put, oral History collects memories and personal
commentaries of historical significance through recorded interviews.
An oral history interview generally consists of a well-prepared
interviewer questioning an interviewee and recording their exchange in
audio or video format. Recordings of the interview are transcribed,
summarized, or indexed and then placed in a library or archives. These
interviews may be used for research or excerpted in a publication,
radio or video documentary, museum exhibition, dramatization or other
form of public presentation. Recordings, transcripts, catalogs,
photographs and related documentary materials can also be posted on
the Internet. (Ritchie 2003, 19)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
While the American Historical Association (Jones 2008) has argued that
such research be “explicitly exempted” from ethical review board
oversight, the use of the Internet could complicate such a stance if
such data became available in public settings or available
“downstream” with potential, unforeseeable risks to
reputation, economic standing, or psychological harm, should
identification occur.</p>

<p>
Under the concept of text rather than human subjects, Internet
research rests on arguments of publication and copyright; consider the
venue of a blog, which does not meet the definition of human subject
as in 45 C.F.R. § 46.102f (2009), as interpreted by most ethical
review boards. A researcher need not obtain consent to use text from a
blog, as it is generally considered publicly available, textual,
published material.  This argument of the “public park”
analogy that has been generally accepted by researchers is appropriate
for some Internet venues and tools, but not all: Context, intent,
sensitivity of data, and expectations of Internet participants were
identified in 2004 by Sveninngsson as crucial markers in Internet
research ethics considerations.</p>

<p>
By the mid 2000s, with three major anthologies published, and a
growing literature base, there was ample scholarly literature
documenting IRE across disciplines and methodologies, and
subsequently, there was anecdotal data emerging from the review boards
evaluating such research. In search of empirical data regarding
the actual review board processes of Internet research from a human
subjects perspective, Buchanan and Ess surveyed over 700
United States ethics review boards, and found that boards were
primarily concerned with privacy, data security and confidentiality,
and ensuring appropriate informed consent and recruitment procedures
(Buchanan and Ess 2009; Buchanan and Hvizdak 2009).</p>

<p>
In 2008, the Canadian Tri-Council’s Social Sciences and Humanities
Research Ethics Special Working Committee: A Working Committee of the
Interagency Advisory Panel on Research Ethics was convened (Blackstone
et al. 2008) ; and in 2010, a meeting at the Secretary’s Advisory
Committee to the Office for Human Research Protections highlighted
Internet research (SACHRP 2010). Such prominent professional
organizations as the Public Responsibility in Medicine and Research
(PRIM&amp;R) and the American Educational Research Association (AERA)
have begun featuring Internet research ethics regularly at their
conferences and related publications.</p>

<p>
Recently, disciplines not traditionally involved in human subjects
research have begun their own explorations of IRE. For example,
researchers in computer security are actively examining the tenets of
research ethics in CS and ICT (Aycock et al. 2012; Dittrich, Bailey,
Dietrich 2011; Carpenter &amp; Dittrich 2011; Buchanan et al. 2011).
Notably, the U.S. Federal Register requested comments on “The
Menlo Report” in January 2012, which calls for a commitment by
computer science researchers to the three principles of respect for
persons, beneficence, and justice, while also adding a fourth
principle on respect for law and public interest (Homeland Security
2011).</p>

<h2><a name="SpeEthIssIntRes">4. Key Ethical Issues in Internet Research</a></h2>

<h3><a name="Pri">4.1 Privacy</a></h3>

<p>
Principles of research ethics dictate that researchers must ensure
there are adequate provisions to protect the <a href="../privacy/">privacy</a> of subjects and
to maintain the confidentiality of any data collected. A violation of
privacy or breach of confidentiality presents a risk of serious harm
to participants, ranging from the exposure of personal or sensitive
information, the divulgence of embarrassing or illegal conduct, or the
release of data otherwise protected under law.</p>

<p>
Research ethics regulations express concern over subject privacy in
terms of the level of linkability of data to individuals, and the
potential harm disclosure of information could pose. For example, when
discussing the possible exemption of certain research from human
subject review, federal guidelines require oversight in these
circumstances:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
(i) information obtained is recorded in such a manner that human
subjects can be identified, directly or through identifiers linked to
the subjects; and (ii) any disclosure of the human subjects’ responses
outside the research could reasonably place the subjects at risk of
criminal or civil liability or be damaging to the subjects’ financial
standing, employability, or reputation (45 C.F.R. § 46.101(b)(2)
2009).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The protection of privacy and confidentiality is typically achieved
through a combination of research tactics and practices, including
engaging in data collection under controlled or anonymous
environments, the scrubbing of data to remove personally identifiable
information (PII), or the use of access restrictions and related data
security methods.</p>

<p>
Compliance with federal guidelines also rests on the definition of
what kind of data are considered PII, and therefore triggering special
privacy considerations. The National Institutes of Health (NIH), for
example, defines PII as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
any information about an individual maintained by an agency,
including, but not limited to, education, financial transactions,
medical history, and criminal or employment history and information
which can be used to distinguish or trace an individual’s identity,
such as their name, SSN, date and place of birth, mother’s maiden
name, biometric records, etc., including any other personal
information that is linked or linkable to an individual. (NIH
2008)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Typically, examples of identifying pieces of information have included
personal characteristics (such as date of birth, place of birth,
mother’s maiden name, gender, sexual orientation, and other
distinguishing features and biometrics information, such as height,
weight, physical appearance, fingerprints, DNA and retinal scans),
unique numbers or identifiers assigned to an individual (such as a
name, address, phone number, social security number, driver’s license
number, financial account numbers), and descriptions of physical
location (GIS/GPS log data, electronic bracelet monitoring
information).</p>

<p>
Internet research introduces new complications to these longstanding
definitions and regulatory frameworks intended to protect subject
privacy. For example, researchers increasingly are able continue to
collect detailed data about individuals from sources such as Facebook,
Twitter, blogs or public email archives, and these rich data sets can
more easily be processed, compared, and combined with other data (and
datasets) available online. In various cases, researchers (and
sometimes even amateurs) have been able to re-identify individuals by
analyzing and comparing such datasets, using data-fields as benign as
one’s zip code (Sweeny 2002), random Web search queries (Barbaro &amp;
Zeller 2006), or movie ratings (Narayanan &amp; Shmatikov 2008) as the
vital key for reidentification of a presumed anonymous user. Prior to
widespread Internet-based data collection and processing, few would
have considered one’s movie ratings or zip code as
personally-identifiable. Yet, these cases reveal that merely stripping
traditional “identifiable” information such as a subject’s
name, address, or social security number is no longer sufficient to
ensure data remains anonymous (Ohm 2009), and requires the
reconsideration of what is considered “personally identifiable
information” (Schwartz &amp; Solove 2011). This points to the
critical distinction between data which is kept confidential versus
data that is truly anonymous. Increasingly, data are rarely completely
anonymous, as researchers have routinely demonstrated they can often
reidentify individuals hidden in “anonymized” datasets with
ease (Ohm 2009). This reality places new pressure on ensuring datasets are
kept, at the least, suitably confidential through both physical and
computational security measures.</p>

<p>
Similarly, new types of data often collected in Internet research
might also be used to identify a subject within a previously-assumed
anonymous dataset. For example, Internet researchers might also
collect Internet Protocol (IP) addresses when conducting online
surveys or analyzing transaction logs. An IP address is a unique
identifier that is assigned to every device connected to the Internet;
in most cases, individual computers are assigned a unique IP address,
while in some cases the address is assigned to a larger node or
Internet gateway for a collection of computers. Nearly all websites
and Internet service providers store activity logs that link activity
with IP address, in many cases, eventually to specific computers or
users. Current U.S. law does not hold IP addresses to be personally
identifiable information, while other countries and regulatory bodies
do. For example, the European Data Privacy Act at Article 29, holds
that IP addresses do constitute PII. Buchanan et al. (2011), note,
however, that under the U.S. Civil Rights Act, for the purposes of the
HIPAA
 Act,<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-2" id="ref-2">2</a>]</sup>
 IP addresses are considered a form of PII (45 C.F.R. § 164.514
 2002).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-3" id="ref-3">3</a>]</sup>
There could potentially be a reconsideration by other federal
regulatory agencies over IP addresses as PII, and researchers and
boards will need to be attentive should such change occur.</p>

<p>
A similar complication emerges when we consider the meaning of
“private information” within the context of Internet-based
research. Federal regulations define “private information”
as:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
[A]ny information about behavior that occurs in a context in which an
individual can reasonably expect that no observation or recording is
taking place, and information that has been provided for specific
purposes by an individual and that the individual can reasonably
expect will not be made public (for example, a medical record) (45
C.F.R. § 46.102(f) 2009).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This standard definition of “private information” has two
key components. First, private information is that which subjects
reasonably expect is not normally monitored or collected. Second,
private information is that which subjects reasonable expect is not
normally publicly available. Conversely, the definition also suggests
the opposite is true: if users cannot reasonably expect data isn’t
being observed or recorded, or they cannot expect data isn’t publicly
available, then the data does not rise to the level of “private
information” requiring particular privacy protections.
Researchers and REBs have routinely worked with this definition of
“private information” to ensure the protection of subject
privacy.</p>

<p>
These distinctions take on greater weight, however, when considering
the data environments and collection practices common with
Internet-based research. Researchers interested in collecting or
analyzing online actions of subjects—perhaps through the mining
of online server logs, the use of tracking cookies, or the scraping of
social media profiles and feeds—could argue that subjects do not
have a reasonable expectation that such online activities are not
routinely monitored since nearly all online transactions and
interactions are routinely logged by websites and service providers.
Thus, online data trails might not rise to the level of “private
information”. However, numerous studies have indicated that
average Internet users have incomplete understandings of how their
activities are routinely tracked, and the related privacy practices
and policies of the sites they visit (Hoofnagle &amp; King 2009; Milne
&amp; Culnan 2004; Tsai et al. 2006). Hudson and Bruckman (2005)
conducted empirical research on users’ expectations and understandings
of privacy, finding that participants’ expectations of privacy within
public chatrooms conflicted with what was actually a very public
online space. Rosenberg (2010) examined the public/private distinction
in the realm of virtual worlds, suggesting researchers must determine
what kind of social norms and relations predominate an online space
before making assumptions about the “publicness” of information shared
within. Thus, it remains unclear whether Internet users truly
understand if and when their online activity is regularly monitored
and tracked, and what kind of reasonable expectations truly exist.
This ambiguity creates new challenges for researchers and REBs when
trying to apply the definition of “private information” to
ensure subject privacy is properly addressed (Zimmer 2010).</p>

<p>
This complexity in addressing subject privacy in Internet research is
further compounded with the rise of social networking as a place for
the sharing of information, and a site for research. Users
increasingly share more and more personal information on platforms
like Facebook, MySpace, or Twitter. For researchers, social media
platforms provide a rich resource for study, and much of the content
is available to be viewed and downloaded with minimal effort. Since
much of the information posted to social media sites is publicly
viewable, it thus fails to meet the standard regulatory definition of
“private information.” Therefore, researchers attempting to
collect and analyze social media postings might not treat the data as
requiring any particular privacy considerations. Yet, social media
platforms represent a complex environment of social interaction where
users are often required to place friends, lovers, colleagues, and
minor acquaintances within the same singular category of
“friends”, where privacy policies and terms of service are
not fully understood (Madejski et al. 2011), and where the technical
infrastructures fail to truly support privacy projections (Bonneau
&amp; Preibush 2009) and regularly change with little notice (Stone
2009; Zimmer 2009, Other Internet Resources). As a result, it is
difficult to understand with any certainty what a user’s intention was
when posting an item onto a social media platform (Acquisti &amp;
Gross 2006). It could be been meant to be visible to only a small
circle of friends, but the user failed to completely understand how to
adjust the privacy settings accordingly. Or, the information might
have previously been restricted to only certain friends, but a change
in the technical platform suddenly made the data more visible to
all.</p>

<p>
Ohm (2010) warns that “the utility and privacy of data are
linked, and so long as data is useful, even in the slightest, then it
is also potentially reidentifiable” (p. 1751). With the rapid
growth of Internet-based research, Ohm’s concern becomes even more
dire. The traditional definitions and approaches to understanding the
nature of privacy, anonymity, and precisely what kind of information
deserves protection becomes strained, forcing researchers and REBs to
consider more nuanced theories of privacy (Nissenbaum 2009) and
approaches to respecting and projecting subject privacy (Markham 2012;
Zimmer 2010).</p>

<h3><a name="Rec">4.2 Recruitment</a></h3>

<p>
Depending on the type of Internet research being carried out,
recruitment of participants may be done in a number of ways. As with
any form of research, the population or participants is selected for
specific purposes (i.e., an ethnographic study of a particular group
on online game players), or, can be selected from a range of sampling
techniques (i.e., a convenience sample gleaned from the users of
Amazon’s Mechanical Turk crowdsourcing
 platform<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-4" id="ref-4">4</a>]</sup>).
 In the U.S. context, a recruitment plan is considered part of the
informed consent process, and as such, any recruitment script or
posting must be reviewed and approved by an REB prior to posting or
beginning solicitation (if the project is human subjects research).
Further, selection of participants must be fair, and risks and
benefits must be justly distributed. This concept is challenging to
apply in Internet contexts, in which populations are often
self-selected and can be exclusive, depending on membership and access
status, as well as the common disparities of online access based on
economic and social variables. Researchers also face recruitment
challenges due to online subjects’ potential anonymity, especially as
it relates to the frequent use of pseudonyms online, having multiple
or alternative identities online, and the general challenges of
verifying a subject’s age and demographic information. Moreover, basic
ethical principles for approaching and recruiting participants involve
protecting their privacy and confidentiality. Internet research can
both maximize these protections, as an individual may never be known
beyond a screen name or avatar existence; or, conversely, the use of
IP addresses, placement of cookies, availability and access to more
information than necessary for the research purposes, may minimize the
protections of privacy and confidentiality.</p>

<p>
Much recruitment is taking place via social media; examples include
push technologies, a synchronous approach in which a text or tweet is
sent from a researcher to potential participants. Geolocational status
through mobile devices and push technology recruitment, in tandem,
allow for novel forms of recruitment for such research as in clinical
trials. Other methods of pull technologies recruitment include direct
email, dedicated web pages, YouTube videos, direct solicitation via
“stickies” posted on fora or web sites directing
participants to a study site, or data aggregation or scraping data for
potential recruitment. Regardless of the means used, researchers must
follow the terms of the site—from the specific norms and nuances
governing a site or locale to the legal issues in terms of service
agreements. For example, early pro-anorexia web sites (see Overbeke
2008) were often treated as sensitive spaces deserving spcicial
consideration, and researchers were asked to respect the privacy of
the participants and not engage in research (Walstrom 2004). In the
gaming context, Reynolds and de Zwart (2010) ask:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Has the researcher disclosed the fact that he or she is engaged in
research and is observing/interacting with other players for the
purposes of gathering research data? How does the research project
impact upon the community and general game play? Is the research
project permitted under the Terms of Service?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Colvin and Lanigan (2005, 38) suggest researchers </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Seek permission from Web site owners and group moderators before
posting recruitment announcements, Then, preface the recruitment
announcement with a statement that delineates the permission that has
been granted, including the contact person and date received. Identify
a concluding date (deadline) for the research study and make every
effort to remove recruitment postings, which often become embedded
within Web site postings.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Barratt and Lenton (2010), among others, agree:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
It is critical, therefore, to form partnerships with online community
moderators by not only asking their permission to post the request,
but eliciting their feedback and support as well. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Mendelson (2007) and Smith and Leigh (1997) note that recruitment
notices need to contain more than the typical flyers or advertisements
used for newspaper advertisements. Mentioning the approval of
moderators is important for establishing authenticity, and so is
providing detailed information about the study and how to contact both the
researchers and the appropriate research ethics board.</p>

<p>
Given the array of techniques possible for recruitment, the concept of
“research spam” requires attention. The Council of
American Survey Research warns</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Research Organizations should take steps to limit the number of survey
invitations sent to targeted respondents by email solicitations or
other methods over the Internet so as to avoid harassment and response
bias caused by the repeated recruitment and participation by a given
pool (or panel) of data subjects. (CASRO 2011, I.B.3)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Ultimately, researchers using Internet recruitment measures must
ensure that potential participants are getting enough information in
both the recruitment materials and any subsequent consent documents.
Researchers must ensure that recruitment methods do not lead to an
individual being identified, and if such identification is possible,
are there significant risks involved?</p>

<h3><a name="InfCon">4.3 Informed Consent</a></h3>

<p>
As the cornerstone of human subjects protections,
 <a href="../informed-consent/">informed consent</a>
 means that participants are voluntarily participating in the research
with adequate knowledge of relevant risks and benefits. Providing
informed consent typically includes the researcher explaining the
purpose of the research, the methods being used, the possible outcomes
of the research, as well as associated risks or harms that the
participants might face. The process involves providing the recipient
clear and understandable explanations of these issues in a concise
way, providing sufficient opportunity to consider them and enquire
about any aspect of the research prior to granting consent, and
ensuring the subject has not been coerced into participating. Gaining
consent in traditional research is typically done verbally, either in
a face-to-face meeting where the researcher reviews the document,
through telephone scripts, through mailed documents, fax, or video,
and can be obtained with the assistance of an advocate in the case of
vulnerable populations. Most importantly, informed consent was built
on the ideal of “process” and the verification of
understanding, and thus, requires an ongoing communicative
relationship between and among researchers and their participants. The
emergence of the Internet as both a tool and a venue for research has
introduced challenges to this traditional approach to informed
consent.</p>

<p>
In most regulatory frameworks, there are instances when informed
consent might be waived, or the standard processes of obtaining
informed consent might be modified, if approved by a research ethics
 board.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-5" id="ref-5">5</a>]</sup>
 Various forms of Internet research require different approaches to
the consent process. Some standards have emerged, depending on venue
(i.e., an online survey platform versus a virtual world island).
However, researchers are encouraged to consider waiver of consent
and/or documentation, if appropriate, by using the flexibilities of
their extant regulations.</p>

<p>
Where consent is required but documentation is waived, a
“portal” can be used to provide consent information. For
example, a researcher may send an email to the participant with a link
a separate portal or site information page where information on the
project is contained. The participant can read the documentation and
click on an “I agree” submission. Rosser et al. (2010)
recommend using a “chunked” consent document, whereby
individuals can read specific sections, agree, and then continue
onwards to completion of the consent form, until reaching the study
site.</p>

<p>
In addition to portals, researchers will often make use of consent
cards or tokens in virtual worlds; this alleviates concerns that
unannounced researcher presence is unacceptable, or, that a
researcher’s presence is intrusive to the natural flow and movement of
a given locale. Hudson and Bruckman (2004, 2005) highlighted the
unique challenges in gaining consent in chat rooms, while Lawson
(2004) offers an array of consent possibilities for synchronous
computer-mediated communication.  There are different practical
challenges in the consent process in Internet research, given the
fluidity and temporal nature of Internet spaces.</p>

<p>
If documentation of consent is required, some researchers have utilized
alternatives such as electronic signatures, which can range from a
simple electronic check box to acknowledge acceptance of the terms to
more robust means of validation using encrypted digital signatures,
although the validity of electronic signatures vary by
jurisdiction.</p>

<p>
Regardless of venue, informed consent documents are undergoing a
discursive change. While the basic elements of consent remain intact,
researchers must now acknowledge with less certainty specific aspects
of their data longevity, risks to privacy, confidentiality and
anonymity (see
 <a href="#Pri">Privacy, above</a>),
 and access to or ownership of data. Researchers must address and
inform participants/subjects about potential risk of data intrusion or
misappropriation of data if subsequently made public or available
outside of the confines of the original research. Statements should be
revised to reflect such realities as cloud storage (see
 <a href="#CloComResEth">below</a>)
 and data sharing.</p>

<p>
For example, Aycock et al. (2012, p. 141) describe a continuum of
security and access statements used in informed consent documents:</p>

<ul>

<li>“No others will have access to the data.”</li>

<li>“Anonymous identifiers will be used during all data
collection and analysis and the link to the subject identifiers will
be stored in a secure manner.”</li>

<li>“Data files that contain summaries of chart reviews and
surveys will only have study numbers but no data to identify the
subject. The key [linking] subject names and these study identifiers
will be kept in a locked file.”</li>

<li>“Electronic data will be stored on a password protected and
secure computer that will be kept in a locked office. The software
‘File Vault’ will be used to protect all study data loaded
to portable laptops, flash drives or other storage media. This will
encode all data… using Advanced Encryption Standard with
128-bit keys (AES-128)”</li>
</ul>

<p>
This use of encryption in the last statement may be necessary in
research including sensitive data, such as medical, sexual, health,
financial, and so on. Barratt and Lenton (2010), in their research on
illicit drug use and online forum behaviors, also provide guidance
about use of secure transmission and encryption as part of the consent
process.</p>

<p>
In addition to informing participants about potential risks and
employing technological protections, U.S.-based researchers working with
sensitive biomedical, behavioral, clinical or other types of research,
may choose to obtain a Certificate of Confidentiality from the
National Institutes of Health, which protects researchers and
institutions from being compelled to disclose information that could
identify research subjects in civil, criminal, or other legal demands
(NIH 2011). However, these do not protect against release of data
outside of the U.S. Given the reality of Internet research itself,
which inherently spans borders, new models may be in order to ensure
confidentiality of data and protections of data. Models of informed
consent for traditional international research are fundamentally
challenging due to cultural specificity and norms (Annas 2009; Boga et
al. 2011; Krodstad et al.  2010); with Internet research, where
researchers may be unaware of the specific location of an individual,
consent takes on significantly higher demands. While current standards
of practice show that consent models stem from the jurisdiction of the
researcher and sponsoring research institution, complications arise in
the face of age verification, age of majority/consent, reporting of
adverse effects or complaints with the research process, and
authentication of identity.  Various jurisdictional laws around
privacy are relevant for the consent process; a useful tool is
Forrester’s Data Privacy Heat Map, which relies on in-depth analyses
of the data privacy-related laws and cultures of countries around the
world, helping researchers design appropriate approaches to privacy
and data protection given the particular context (Forrester 2011).</p>

<p>
In addition, as more federal agencies and funding bodies across the
globe mandate making research data publicly-available (i.e., NSF, NIH,
Wellcome Trust, Research Councils U.K.), the language used in consent
documents will change accordingly to represent this intended longevity
of data and opportunities for future, unanticipated use. This is not
an entirely new concept nor is it specific to Internet research, but
it should be noted that new language is required for consent.</p>

<p>
Given the ease with which Internet data can flow between and among
Internet venues (a Twitter feed can automatically stream to a Facebook
page), the changes with which access to data can occur (early
“private” newsgroup conversations were made
“publicly searchable” when Google bought DejaNews), reuse
and access by others is highly possible. Current data sharing mandates
must be considered in the consent process. Alignment between a data
sharing policy and an informed consent document is imperative. Both
should include provisions for appropriate protection of privacy,
confidentiality, security, and intellectual property.</p>

<p>
There is general agreement in the U.S. that individual consent is not
necessary for researchers to use publicly available data sets, under
45 C.F.R. § 46; recommendations were made by The National Human
Subjects Protection Advisory Committee (NHRPAC) in 2002 regarding
publicly available data sets (see Other Internet Resources). Data use
or data restriction agreements are commonly used and set the
parameters of use for researchers.</p>

<p>
The U.K. Data Archive (2012) provides guidance on consent and data
sharing:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Restricting access to data should never be seen as the only way to
protect confidentiality. Obtaining appropriate informed consent and
anonymising data enable most data to be shared:</p>

<p>
For confidential data, the Archive, in discussion with the data owner,
may impose additional access regulations, which can be:</p>

<ul>

<li>needing specific authorisation from the data owner to access
data-placing confidential data under embargo for a given period of
time until confidentiality is no longer pertinent</li>

<li>providing access to approved researchers</li>

<li>only providing secure access to data by enabling remote analysis
of confidential data but excluding the ability to download data</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>
Data sharing made public headlines in 2016 when a Danish researcher
released a data set comprised of scraped data from nearly 70,000 users
of the OkCupid online dating site. The data set was highly
reidentifiable and included potentially sensitive information,
including usernames, age, gender, geographic location, what kind of
relationship (or sex) they’re interested in, personality traits,
and answers to thousands of profiling questions used by the site. The
researcher claimed the data were public and thus, such sharing and use
was unproblematic. Zimmer (2016) was among many privacy and ethics
scholars who critiqued this stance. </p>

<p>
The Danish researchers did not seek any form of consent or debriefing
on the collection and use of the data, nor did they have any ethics
oversight. Many researchers and ethics boards are, however, starting
to mitigate many of these ethical concerns by including blanket
statements in their consent processes, indicating such precautions for
research participants. For example,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
“I understand that online communications may be at greater risk
for hacking, intrusions, and other violations. Despite these
possibilities, I consent to participate.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
A more specific example comes from the Canadian context when
researchers propose to use specific online survey tools hosted in the
United States; REBs commonly recommend the following type language for
use in informed consent documents:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Please note that the online survey is hosted by Company ABC which is a
web survey company located in the U.S.A. All responses to the survey
will be stored and accessed in the U.S.A. This company is subject to
U.S. Laws, in particular, to the U.S. Patriot Act/Domestic Security
Enhancement Act that allows authorities access to the records that
your responses to the questions will be stored and accessed in the
U.S.A. The security and private policy for Company ABC can be viewed at
 http://…/.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-6" id="ref-6">6</a>]</sup></p>
 </blockquote>

<p>
Researchers are also encouraged to review the Terms of Use and Terms
of Service of the application that are being used, demonstrating its
details to the REB in the application and informing participants of
such details in the informed consent form or script.</p>

<h4>4.3.1 Minors and Consent</h4>

<p>
Internet research poses particular challenges to age verification,
assent and consent procedures, and appropriate methodological
approaches with minors. Age of consent varies across countries,
states, communities, and locales of all sorts. For research conducted
or supported by U.S. federal agencies bound by the Common Rule, children are
“persons who have not attained the legal age for consent to
treatments or procedures involved in the research, under the
applicable law of the jurisdiction in which the research will be
conducted” (45 C.F.R. § 46.402(a) 2009). Goldfarb (2008)
provides an exhaustive discussion of age of majority across the U.S.
states, with a special focus on <em>clinical research</em>, noting
children must be seven or older to assent to participation (see 45
C.F.R. § 46 Subpart D 2009).</p>

<p>
Spriggs, from the Australian context, notes that while no formal
guidance exists on Internet research and minors under the <em>National
Statement</em>, she advises:</p>

<blockquote>

<ul>

<li>Parental consent may be needed when information is potentially
identifiable. Identifiable information makes risks to individuals
higher and may mean that the safety net of parental consent is
preferable.</li>

<li>There is also a need to consider whether seeking parental consent
would make things worse e.g., by putting a young person from a
dysfunctional home at risk or result in disclosure to the researcher
of additional identifying information about the identity and location
of the young person. Parental consent may be “contrary to the
best interests” of the child or young person when it offers no
protection or makes matters worse. (Spriggs 2010, 30)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>
To assist with the consent process, age verification measures can be
used. These can range from more technical software applications to
less formal knowledge checks embedded in an information sheet or
consent document. Multiple confirmation points (asking for age, later
asking for year of birth, etc) are practical measures for researchers.
Depending on the types of data, sensitivity of data, use of data,
researchers and boards will carefully construct the appropriate
options for consent, including waiver of consent, waiver of
documentation, and/or waiver of parental consent.</p>

<h3><a name="CloComResEth">4.4 Cloud Computing and Research Ethics</a></h3>

<p>
Recent developments in cloud computing platforms have led to unique
opportunities—and ethical challenges—for researchers.
Cloud computing describes the deployment of computing resources via
the Internet, providing on-demand, flexible, and scalable computing
from remote locations. Examples include web-based email and
calendaring services provided by Google or Yahoo, online productivity
platforms like Google Docs or Microsoft Office 365, online file
storage and sharing platforms like Dropbox or Box.net, and large-scale
application development and data processing platforms such as Google
Apps, Facebook Developers Platform, and Amazon Web Services.</p>

<p>
Alongside businesses and consumers, researchers have begun utilizing
cloud computing platforms and services to assist in various tasks,
including subject recruitment, data collection and storage,
large-scale data processing, as well as communication and
collaboration (Allan 2011; Chen et al. 2010; Simmhan et al. 2008;
Yogesh et al. 2009).</p>

<p>
As reliance on cloud computing increases among researchers, so do the
ethical implications. Among the greatest concerns is ensuring data
privacy and security with cloud-based services. For researchers
sharing datasets online for collaborative processing and analysis,
steps must be taken to ensure only authorized personnel have access to
the online data, but also that suitable encryption is used for data
transfer and storage, and that the cloud service provider maintains
sufficient security to prevent breaches. Further, once research data
is uploaded to a third-party cloud provider, attention must be paid to
the terms of service for the contracted provider to determine what
level of access to the data, if any, might be allowed to advertisers,
law enforcement, or other external agents.</p>

<p>
Alongside the privacy and security concerns, researchers also have an
ethical duty of data stewardship which is further complicated when
research data is placed in the cloud for storage or processing. Cloud
providers might utilize data centers spread across the globe, meaning
research data might be located outside the United States, and its
legal jurisdictions. Terms of service might grant cloud providers a
license to access and use research data for purposes not initially
intended or approved of by the subjects involved. Stewardship may
require the prompt and complete destruction of research data, a
measure complicated if a cloud provider has distributed and backed-up
the data across multiple locations.</p>

<p>
A more unique application of cloud computing for research involves the
crowdsourcing of data analysis and processing functions, that is,
leveraging the thousands of users of various online products and
services to complete research related tasks remotely. Examples include
using a distributed network of video game players to assist in solving
protein folding problems (Markoff 2010), and leveraging Amazon’s
Mechanical Turk crowdsourcing marketplace platform to assist with
large scale data processing and coding functions that cannot be
automated (Conley &amp; Tosti-Kharas 2010; Chen et al. 2011). Using
cloud-based platforms can raise various critical ethical and
methodological issues.</p>

<p>
First, new concerns over data privacy and security emerge when
research tasks are widely distributed across a global network of
users. Researchers must take great care in ensuring sensitive research
data isn’t accessible by outsourced labor, or that none of the users
providing crowdsourced labor are able to aggregate and store their own
copy of the research dataset. Second, crowdsourcing presents ethical
concerns over trust and validity of the research process itself.
Rather than a local team of research assistants usually under a
principle investigator’s supervision and control, crowdsourcing tends to
be distributed beyond the direct management or control of the
researcher, providing less opportunity to ensure sufficient training
for the required tasks. Thus, researchers will need to create
additional means of verifying data results to confirm tasks are
completed properly and correctly.</p>

<p>
Two additional ethical concerns with crowdsourcing involve labor
management and authorship. Turks were not originally intended to be
research subjects, first and foremost. However, researchers using
Mechanical Turks must ensure that the laborers on the other end of the
cloud-based relationship are not being exploited, that they are
legally eligible to be working for hire, and that the incentives
provided are real, meaningful, and appropriate (Scholz 2008; Williams
2010, Other Internet Resources).</p>

<p>
Finally, at the end of a successful research project utilizing
crowdsourcing, a researcher may be confronted with the ethical
challenge of how to properly acknowledge the contributions made by
(typically anonymous) laborers. Ethical research requires the fair and
accurate description of authorship. Disciplines
vary as to how to report relative contributions made by collaborators and research
assistants, and this dilemma increases when crowdsourcing is used to
assist with the research project.</p>

<h3><a name="BigDataResEth">4.5 Big Data Considerations</a></h3>

<p>
Algorithmic processing is a corollary of big data research, and
newfound ethical considerations have emerged. From “algorithmic
harms” to “predictive analytics,” the power of
today’s algorithms exceeds long-standing privacy beliefs and
norms. Specifically, the National Science and Technology Council
note:</p>

<blockquote>
“Analytical algorithms” as algorithms for prioritizing,
classifying, filtering, and predicting. Their use can create privacy
issues when the information used by algorithms is inappropriate or
inaccurate, when incorrect decisions occur, when there is no
reasonable means of redress, when an individual’s autonomy is
directly related to algorithmic scoring, or when the use of predictive
algorithms chills desirable behavior or encourages other privacy
harms. (NSTC 2016, p. 18, Other Internet Resources).
</blockquote>

<p>
While the concept of big data is not new, and the term has been in
technical discourses since the 1990s, the public awareness and
response to big data research is much more recent. Following the rise
of social media-based research, Buchanan (2016) has delineated the
emergence of “big data”-based research from 2012 to the present, with
no signs of an end point. </p>

<p>
Big data research is challenging for research ethcis boards,
often presenting what the computer ethicist James Moor would call
“conceptual muddles”: the inability to properly
conceptualize the ethical values and dilemmas at play in a new
technological context. Subject privacy, for example, is typically
protected within the context of research ethics through a combination
of various tactics and practices, including engaging in data
collection under controlled or anonymous environments, limiting the
personal information gathered, scrubbing data to remove or obscure
personally identifiable information, and using access restrictions and
related data security methods to prevent unauthorized access and use
of the research data itself. The nature and understanding of privacy
become muddled, however, in the context of big data research, and as a
result, ensuring it is respected and protected in this new domain
becomes challenging.</p>

<p>
For example, the determination of what constitutes “private
information” – and thus triggering particular privacy concerns
– becomes difficult within the context of big data research.
Distinctions within the regulatory definition of “private
information” – namely, that it only applies to information
which subjects reasonably expect is not normally monitored or
collected and not normally publicly available – become less clearly
applicable when considering the data environments and collection
practices that typify big data research, such as the wholesale
scraping of Facebook news feed content or public OKCupid accounts.</p>

<p>
When considered through the lens of the regulatory definition of
“private information,” social media postings are often
considered public, especially when users take no visible, affirmative
steps to restrict access. As a result, big data researchers might
conclude subjects are not deserving of particular privacy
consideration. Yet, the social media platforms frequently used for big
data research purposes represent a complex environment of
socio-technical interactions, where users often fail to understand
fully how their social activities might be regularly monitored,
harvested, and shared with third parties, where privacy policies and
terms of service are not fully understood and change frequently, and
where the technical infrastructures and interfaces are designed to
make restricting information flows and protecting one’s privacy
difficult.</p>

<p>
As noted <a href="#Pri">above</a>) it becomes difficult to confirm a
user’s intention when sharing information on a social media
platform, and whether users recognize that providing information in a
social environment also opens it up for widespread harvesting and use
by researchers. This uncertainty in the intent and expectations of
users of social media and internet-based platforms – often fueled by
the design of the platforms themselves – create numerous conceptual
muddles in our ability to properly alleviate potential privacy
concerns in big data research.</p>

<p>
The conceptual gaps that exist regarding privacy and the definition of
personally identifiable information in the context of big data
research inevitably lead to similar gaps regarding when informed
consent is necessary. Researchers mining Facebook profile information
or public Twitter streams, for example, typically argue that no
specific consent is necessary due to the fact the information was
publicly available. It remains unknown whether users truly understood
the technical conditions under which they made information visible on
these social media platforms or if they foresaw their data being
harvested for research purposes, rather than just appearing onscreen
for fleeting glimpses by their friends and followers. In the case of
the Facebook emotional contagion experiment (Kramer,
Guillory, &amp; Hancock, 2014), the lack of obtaining consent was
initially rationalized through the notion that the research appeared
to have been carried out under Facebook’s extensive terms of
service, whose data use policy, while more than 9,000 words long, does
make passing mention to “research.” It was later revealed,
however, that the data use policy in effect when the experiment was
conducted never mentioned “research” at all (Hill, 2014).
</p>

<h3><a name="IndustryResEth">4.6 Internet Research and Industry Ethics</a></h3>

<p>
The Facebook emotional contagion experiment, discussed above, is just
one example in a larger trend of big data research conducted outside
of traditional university-based research ethics oversight mechanisms.
Nearly all online companies and platforms analyze data and test
theories that often rely on data from individual users. Industry-based
data research, once limited to marketing-oriented “A/B
testing” of benign changes in interface designs or corporate
communication messages, now encompasses information about how users
behave online, what they click and read, how they move, eat, and
sleep, the content they consume online, and even how they move about
their homes. Such research produces inferences about
individuals’ tastes and preferences, social relations,
communications, movements, and work habits. It implies pervasive
testing of products and services that are an integral part of intimate
daily life, ranging from connected home products to social networks to
smart cars. Except in cases where they are partnering with academic
institutions, companies typically do not put internal research
activities through a formal ethical review process, since results are
typically never shared publicly and the perceived impact on users is
minimal.</p>

<p>
The growth of industry-based big data research, however,
presents new risks to individuals’ privacy, on the one hand, and
to organizations’ legal compliance, reputation, and brand, on
the other hand. When organizations process personal data outside of
their original context, individuals may in some cases greatly benefit,
but in other cases may be surprised, outraged, or even harmed.
Soliciting consent from affected individuals can be impractical:
Organizations might collect data indirectly or based on identifiers
that do not directly match individuals’ contact details.
Moreover, by definition, some non-contextual uses – including the
retention of data for longer than envisaged for purposes of a newly
emergent use – may be unforeseen at the time of collection. As
Crawford and Schultz (2014) note, “how does one give notice and
get consent for innumerable and perhaps even yet-to-be-determined
queries that one might run that create ‘personal
data’?” (p. 108).</p>

<p>
With corporations developing vast “living laboratories”
for big data research, research ethics has become a critical component
of the design and oversight of these activities. For example, in
response to the controversy surrounding the emotional contagion
experiment, Facebook developed an internal ethical review process
that, according to its facilitators, “leverages the
company’s organizational structure, creating multiple training
opportunities and research review checkpoints in the existing
organizational flow” (Jackman &amp; Kanerva, 2016, p. 444).
While such efforts are important and laudable, they remain open for
improvement. Hoffmann (2016), for example, has criticized Facebook for
launching “an ethics review process that innovates on process
but tells us little about the ethical values informing their product
development.” In short, while Internet companies like Facebook
recognize the need to review the ethics of internal research projects,
such efforts remain largely perfunctory and meant for easing public
concerns, and not necessarily fully in line with the ethical
deliberations that take place in academic settings.</p>

<h2><a name="ResEthBoaGui">5. Research Ethics Boards Guidelines</a></h2>

<p>
While many researchers and review boards across the world work without
formal guidance, many REBs have developed guidelines for
Internet research. While many such guidelines exist, the following

boards developing their own policies.</p>
