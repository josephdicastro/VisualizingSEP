<h1>Philosophy of Science in Latin America</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Wed Dec 2, 2015</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>Ever since philosophy of science began as a professional field in
the late 1940s, many contributions from Latin America have joined the
forefront of the international debate. This article aims to provide an
overview of philosophy of science in the subcontinent. The primary
focus is on contributions produced in Latin America by thinkers living
in the region, with an emphasis on “mainstream philosophy of
science”—a discipline centered in the study of scientific
knowledge, metaphysics, methodology, and values, broadly analytic in
style, as exemplified by works published in such major journals
as <em>Philosophy of Science</em>, <em>Erkenntnis</em>, <em>The
British Journal for the Philosophy of Science</em>, and <em>Studies in
the History and Philosophy of Science</em>.</p>

<p>This entry has six parts. Section 1 provides historical background.
Sections 2 through 5 are devoted to philosophy of science in various
regions of the subcontinent (going roughly) from north to south. The
final section briefly considers some of the difficulties and prospects
for philosophy of science in Latin America. Effort is made to provide
an even-handed and objective picture, but of course only a selective
sketch is possible, made of choices influenced by the author’s
interpretation of the field.</p>

<h2><a id="Bac">1. Background</a></h2>

<p>It is useful to begin with a brief historical background. Science
and scientific thought have long functioned in Latin America as
beacons of civic hope and progress amidst multiple recurrent
frustrations varying in kind and texture from place to place. In most
of the region, the Enlightenment ideals that fueled independence
movements of the early 19<sup>th</sup> century were quickly
disappointed by the military chaos and general barbarism that
followed; social turmoil and economic deterioration afflicting much of
the region until the 1860s. It was different in Brazil, where
emancipation from Europe occurred gradually and orderly during the
century, but there too the problems grew as did also tensions between
the economic elite and the country’s leading liberal
thinkers.</p>

<p>Reacting against expanding frustration, many Latin Americans saw a
solution in the “scientific” ways of thinking dominant in
the industrialized countries. In the 1850s a progressive philosophy
was in full flight in the larger world, ready-made for Latin American
visionaries: French Positivism, a doctrine of progress and secular
religion, centered on hope in modern science, led by Auguste Comte.
Committed to fighting the common temptations of barbarism and its
discontents, the positivists sought to continue the project of the
Enlightenment. Against the impulsive decision-making then prevailing
in most of Latin America, local positivists sought to extend
scientific thought to philosophy and political action, convinced it
would promote objectivity, rational consensus, publicly accessible
cumulative truth in all spheres, along the material success
characteristic of modern science. Between about 1870 and 1910
positivism took strong hold in much of Latin America, with an agenda
that called for methodological improvement in the local practice of
the natural sciences, medicine and education, greatly influencing also
activity in philosophy, history, art, and the law (see, e.g., Zea 1943
&amp;1944; Frondizi 1943; Nachman 1977; Quintanilla 2006). In
Argentina, scientism and Comte’s philosophy had influential
defenders, notably Domingo Faustino Sarmiento, numerous scientists
(e.g., paleontologist Florentino Ameghino), physician-philosophers
(e.g., José Ingenieros y Alejandro Korn), educators (e.g.,
Pedro Scalabrini), and lawyers (e.g., Carlos Octavio Bunge, whose
nephew Mario A. Bunge would become a world figure in philosophy of
science in the following century). A conviction these thinkers shared
stated that a modern and efficient system of public education was
indispensable for achieving the desired transformations. Interest in
advancing the positivist approach grew to religious heights especially
in Brazil, where it was championed by distinguished political figures,
notably Miguel de Lemos, a reorganizer of the country’s
curriculum and a decisive force in the construction of the first
Humanity Temple for the propagation of Comte’s ideas in the
world. When Brazil became a republic in 1889, positivist doctrine made
its way to the new flag, the motto “Order and Progress”
lifted from Comte’s writings—in <em>Système de
Politique Positive</em> (1851), the preliminary discourse’s
conclusion begins with the words “Love for principle, order for
base, and progress for aim” (<em>L'amour pour principe, l'ordre
pour base, et le progrès pour but</em>; p. 321).</p>

<p>The influence of positivism in Mexico was not much weaker,
particularly in education, as exemplified by the labors of the
respected chemist and medical doctor Gabino Barreda, who banned
religion and traditional philosophy from the school curriculum and
centralized access to higher education and culture. In Chile two
leading advocates of Comte’s philosophy and his Humanity
Religion were the brothers Jorge and Enrique Lagarrigue. In Colombia
Rafael Nuñez, an educational reformer and three times president
of Colombia actively promoted positivism, as did in Peru (with touches
of Herbert Spencer’s evolutionism) such figures as Javier Prado,
Manuel González Prada, Celso Bambarén, and Manuel
Vicente Villarán. In Bolivia too positivism had influential
defenders from the 1870s through the 1890s, notably a circle of
writers, <em>Círculo Literario</em>, in whose journal works by
Charles Darwin, Luis Dumont, Ernst H.P.A. Haeckel and other
naturalists appeared in translation.</p>

<p>With all this intellectual and progressive enthusiasm in the air,
hopes of imminent general improvement ran high, but
“positive” results were slow in coming if at all. The
expectations of economic advancement and civic improvement did not
materialize as advertised. To compound matters, the devastation caused
by the Great War in Europe badly compromised social faith in the
products of science. Positivism waned accordingly in Latin America,
replaced in the 1920s by more radical social thought, especially
Marxism, as well as approaches distrustful of naturalist reasoning
(Bergsonian spiritualism, phenomenology, and later on existentialism).
Metaphysics unbridled by standard logic became dominant in many
university circles.</p>

<p>Interest in science remained latent however. Reactions to
excessively “high philosophy” began to form in the 1940s,
helped by the arrival of thinkers from Europe, for example Juan
D. García Bacca in the cases of Ecuador, Mexico and Venezuela;
Hans Lindemann in Argentina, and Gilles-Gaston Granger in
Brazil. Along the way came a revival of interest in logic,
science-friendly epistemology, and the study of conceptual
structures. Thanks to these developments, when philosophy of science
became a professional field late in the late 1940s, Latin America had
some scientists and philosophers ready and willing to fully join their
counterparts in Europe and North America.  Since those early days,
seventy years or so ago now, a number of philosophers of science based
in Latin America, often in uncooperative environments, have
nonetheless managed to produce work of the highest international
standards (something not so clearly apparent in the developing world
in other branches of international philosophy).</p>

<h2><a id="MexCenAme">2. Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean</a></h2>

<p>Philosophy of science has a robust presence at <em>Universidad
Nacional Autónoma de México</em> (UNAM), a major
institution at the forefront of intellectual life in the country and
the Spanish-speaking world. The discipline gained strength in the
1960s and early 1970s, through the efforts of prominent faculty,
especially Fernando Salmerón (1925–1997), Luis Villoro
(1922–2014), and Alejandro Rossi (1932–2009), who
encouraged rigor and clarity in philosophy and provided scholarship
support to enable students to do post-graduate work in Europe, the
United Kingdom, and the United States. Together they founded the
journal <em>Crítica</em> in 1967, a choice venue for philosophy
in Latin America and Spain. An influential work by
Salmerón, <em>La Filosofía de las
Matemáticas</em>, came out the following year. Major
international seminars and meetings became a regular feature at
UNAM’s Institute for Philosophical Investigations (<em>Instituto
de Investigaciones Filosóficas</em>—IIF), which in the
1970s and 1980s hosted some now legendary seminars and short courses
led by world-class figures. One of these international seminars
focused on the history and philosophy of science, started by
Argentinian-born philosopher and polymath Mario Bunge. IIF became the
host of many a spirited philosophical debate, those between Bunge and
Guatemalan-born analytic philosopher Héctor-Neri
Castañeda (1924–1991) being among the most gaudily
remembered. With Bunge’s help, in 1976 an epistemology forum was
established—<em>Asociación Mexicana de
Epistemología</em>.</p>

<p>The structuralist approach came to Mexico in a big way with Carlos
Ulises Moulines, who moved to IIF from Munich in the mid-1970s. Born
in Venezuela, he studied in Europe, first under Jesús
Mosterín in Barcelona and then under Wolfgang Stegmuller in
Munich. His early focus was on the rise of the logical empiricist
approach, particularly the projects of logical reconstruction of the
empirical world variously advocated by Bertrand Russell, Rudolf
Carnap, and Nelson Goodman, investigations which Moulines developed
into his first monograph, <em>La Estructura del Mundo Sensible</em>
(1973). He took an interest in integrating some of Stegmuller’s
original contributions into earlier structuralist work by Patrick
Suppes in the United States and Gunther Ludwig in Germany, an effort
displayed by some of his articles from this period (notably Moulines
1975 and 1976). Responding to the historical turn in philosophy of
science, Moulines, like Joseph Sneed in the United States and
Stegmuller in Germany, focused on the issue of theory change. He
devoted much of his research during the 1970s and 1980s to the
dynamics of theories, applying the resources of diachronic
structuralist reconstruction and Kuhnian analysis (in terms of
disciplinary matrices) to the development of Newtonian mechanics and
equilibrium thermodynamics. The resulting investigations found
expression in book form in <em>Exploraciones
Metacientíficas</em> (1982). Moulines became an important
intellectual force at IIF, where he stayed for over a decade, engaged
in cutting-edge research that made him a leading figure in the
international structuralist movement. In Moulines’ view,
scientific theories are cultural constructs of philosophical interest.
He regards philosophy of science as a discipline whose epistemology is
primarily interpretive rather than prescriptive or descriptive—a
theorization about theorizations. A good proportion of the philosophy
of science conducted at IIF during his tenure was directly helped by
him. A relevant point for present purposes is that his work in Mexico
during these years reached the highest levels within the worldwide
structuralist movement. In 1984 Moulines left the country, first for
Bielefeld University, then to Berlin, and finally to the Center for
Mathematical Philosophy at Ludwig-Maximilians University, Munich,
where he became Stegmuller’s successor and is now a Professor
Emeritus.  Many of his subsequent publications have a lasting impact
in Latin America, notably <em>An Architectonic for Science: The
Structuralist Program</em> (with W. Balzer and J.D. Sneed; Balzer et
al. 1987), along numerous papers (including Moulines 2000, 2006,
2010).</p>

<p>Research seminars at IIF have continued to develop and strengthen
since the 1980s, beginning with a series of international symposia of
philosophy started by Enrique Villanueva, a venture of impressive
scale that brought together world-class figures from many parts of
Latin America, the United States, Britain, and Europe. The
high-quality interactions these venues generated proved remarkably
fruitful as starting points of much subsequent research activity in
Mexico and elsewhere in the subcontinent. This period was also marked
by institutional investment in specialized research libraries and the
reinforcement of publishing programs at UNAM and other institutions in
Mexico. Scholarships programs helped researchers and students to spend
periods at major international centers. At IIF philosophical research
reached a level of support never seen before in Latin America. At this
point Mario Otero (Uruguay) formally joined IIF, to considerable
effect to studies in the philosophical history of science. Significant
papers and monographs began to flow regularly from seminars on general
philosophy of science, the philosophy of physics, and the philosophy
of biology.</p>

<p>Activity in the field also became more diverse at IIF in the 1980s.
One major area focused on the limits of scientific knowledge,
represented by Luis Villoro, whose critique of scientism in <em>Creer,
Saber, Conocer</em> (<em>Belief, Wisdom, Learning</em>), published in
1982, advocates a revaluation of “wisdom” (characterized
as knowledge drawn from lived experiences), which in Villoro’s
view is richly found in the “wise men” of traditional
cultures; in this book he explores how human reason has operated
throughout history and the extent to which it has led to situations of
domination and/or emancipation from subjection.</p>

<p>On the topic of value issues in science, technology and society,
Leon Olivé’s book <em>Knowledge, Society and Reality</em>
(1993) has enjoyed favorable reception, as have other contributions by
him focusing on realism, relativism, rationality, and naturalism. A
member of IIF since 1985 and its director for many years, Olivé
worked on an interdisciplinary project at Oxford for his doctoral
dissertation (<em>The Significance of Epistemological and Ontological
Preconceptions in three Sociological Theories of the State</em>). His
recent publications include the book <em>La Ciencia y la
Tecnología en la Sociedad del Conocimiento</em> (2007).</p>

<p>Also at IIF is Sergio Martínez, a Guatemalan thinker based
in Mexico since the 1990s. He completed a doctorate with Linda Wessels
at Indiana University on the philosophy of quantum mechanics, a field
in which he has some major international papers, especially on the
Luders Rule (1990, 1991). At the turn of the century he broadened his
interests toward how explanatory patterns play a role in the formation
and stabilization of scientific disciplines. His recent books
include <em>De los Efectos a las Causas</em> (1997),
and <em>Geografía de las Prácticas Científicas:
Racionalidad, Heurística y Normatividad</em> (2003), among
numerous articles (e.g., Martínez 2013a,b). The philosophical
history of science continues alive at IIF, as shown by valuable work
produced there in recent years. Laura Benítez, in particular,
has published extensively on early science (e.g., Benítez 2000)
and with José A. Robles the book <em>Espacio e Infinito en la
Perspectiva de la Modernidad</em> (2000). Ana-Rosa Pérez
Ransanz has a book much discussed in the Spanish-speaking
world, <em>Kuhn y el cambio científico</em> (1999), as well as
numerous papers (e.g., 1996, 2000); more recently she and Olimpia Lombardi
have published <em>Los múltiples mundos de la ciencia: Un
realismo pluralista y su aplicación a la filosofía de la
física</em> (Lombardi and Pérez Ransanz 2012). Also at
IIF, Carlos López Beltrán works on the philosophy of
biology, chiefly the impact of evolutionary studies; he is the author
of <em>El Sesgo Hereditario: Ambitos Históricos del Concepto de
Herencia Biológica</em> (2005a) and La <em>Ciencia como
Cultura</em> (2005b).</p>

<p>IIF runs a leading postgraduate program in philosophy of science
in Latin America. Among the research lines most actively pursued are
investigations on conceptual change, the semantic view, the debate
over realism, and social-philosophical studies of science. Research in
the field is also conducted at other UNAM units. For more than two
decades Lourdes Valdivia has worked on the interface between
neurobiology and the philosophy of mind. Atocha Aliseda focuses on
scientific reasoning; among her recent publications are Aliseda 2003
and the monograph, <em>Abductive Reasoning: Logical Investigations
into Discovery and Explanation</em> (2006). Claudia L. García
studies the interface between cognitive studies and the philosophy of
science (see, e.g., García 2010).</p>

<p>Centers of significant activity outside UNAM include Mexico
City’s Metropolitan University, <em>Universidad Autónoma
Metropolitana-Iztapalapa</em>, where Godfrey Guillaumin is an active
researcher on topics in the philosophical history of science. He is
the author of <em>El surgimiento de la noción de evidencia: Un
estudio de epistemología histórica sobre la idea de
evidencia científica</em> (2005). More broadly, Mexico
continues to attract significant figures from the wider world, notably
Larry and Rachel Laudan, both now living in Mexico and affiliated with
IIF. Also in residence for two terms a year and affiliated with
Universidad Panamericana, Mexico D.F., is Evandro Agazzi, whose recent
publications include <em>Scientific Objectivity and its Contexts</em>,
published in 2014.</p>

<p>Interest in philosophy of science is also strong beyond the
discipline, notably in science education, where the need to expand and
improve teaching has led to including applications from the history
and philosophy of science to both teacher education and the junior and
senior science curricula (see, e.g., Ana Barahona, José Antonio
Chamizo et al., 2014).</p>

<p>South of the border too, philosophy of science shows signs of
growth. In Guatemala, the curriculum for careers in science and
engineering commonly comprises one core course in philosophy of
science. A philosophy venue, <em>Congreso Centroamericano de
Filosofía</em>, regularly meets in the region (its most recent
gathering was held in San José, Costa Rica, in 2014). In the
Caribbean, Puerto Rico became a major stronghold in the field during
the years that Roberto Torretti spent at the Rio Piedras Campus
of <em>Universidad de Puerto Rico</em>, where he led a fruitful career
until his retirement in 1995. During most of this period he was the
editor of <em>Diálogos</em>, one of the leading philosophy
journals in Latin America. In Puerto Rico he became an internationally
recognized authority in the philosophy of 19<sup>th</sup> century
mathematical physics and the philosophical history of the theory of
relativity, subjects on which he remains a world-class figure.
Torretti’s contributions are discussed
in <a href="#AndCou">Section 4</a>. In Puerto Rico the discipline
experienced a loss when he left, but the field endures, notably in
work on the history of philosophy of science by Guillermo Rosado
Haddock, the author of numerous publications (including Rosado Haddock
2008). Also, at the Humacao Campus, Carlos Rojas Osorio—who
wrote his doctoral dissertation on the problem of causality in
Bunge’s philosophy—teaches regular courses along the lines
of Rojas (2001).</p>

<p>In Cuba, ideological fervor dominated philosophical interest in
logic and science at public centers in the 1950s and
1960s. Particularly influential in this regard were various blends of
dialectical materialism and local attempts to integrate theory and
practice in the specific context of the Cuban Revolution, a trend
exemplified by <em>Pensamiento Crítico</em>, a journal
published between 1967 to 1971. As freer approaches broke through in
the 1970s, the Cuban Academy of Science promoted the study of the
social history of science. Also at the Academy, investigations less
burdened by ideological constraints grew in the 1980s at <em>Centro de
Estudios de Historia y Organización de la Ciencia</em>, a
center for science studies, where some of the activities focused on
the debates between the philosophies of Karl Popper, Thomas Kuhn, Imre
Lakatos, and Paul Feyerabend, a topic then much discussed in
Anglo-American and West-European circles. This line of local interest
is reflected in e.g., “Indagaciones científicas acerca de
las revoluciones Científicas”, by J. Núñez
and Alonso (1985). International visits and improved communications
with the wider world expanded the field. Cuban colleagues began to
have a regular presence at international meetings, notably the World
Congress of Logic, Methodology, and Philosophy of Science held in
Moscow in 1987. A visit by Mario Bunge in the early 1990s stirred
interest in his naturalist approach to materialist philosophy and his
defense of a strong version of scientific realism. Another influential
visit, by León Olivé (UNAM), included a comprehensive
series on the interface between the philosophy and sociology of
knowledge. International seminars prospered. Academic exchanges,
especially with Spanish universities, have proved long-lasting and
fruitful. Philosophy of science remains strongly tilted towards the
history, sociology and political economy of science, branches of
science studies presently enjoying expansion in Cuba, particularly at
the University of Havana, where a master’s program in science,
technology and society studies opened in 1997, followed by the
creation of chairs in such interdisciplinary fields as bioethics and
complex systems at various universities in the country. For a
panoramic view of the field in Cuba over the last half century see
e.g., Núñez, Alonso and Ramírez (2015).</p>

<h2><a id="Bra">3. Brazil</a></h2>

<p>An influential textbook by Gilles-Gaston Granger, <em>Lógica
e Filosofía das Ciências</em>—first published in
1955—is acknowledged as the first introduction to the field in
Portuguese. A disciple of Gaston Bachelard, Granger taught at the
University of São Paulo (USP) from 1947 to 1953 and was a major
force in the development of philosophy of science in Brazil. His work
favored a historically-oriented approach hospitable to the Anglo-Saxon
analytic style. Back in Europe he associated himself with various
philosophical and social projects; in 1986 he was elected to the Chair
of Comparative Epistemology at the <em>Collège de France</em>.
The research projects Granger started in Brazil continued to prosper
after his tenure, especially thanks to the efforts of Oswaldo
Porchat.</p>

<p>In 1966 a military coup led to government action to eradicate
academics suspected of leftist sympathies, seriously disrupting many
fields, including philosophy of science. Nevertheless, faculty groups
were soon able to restore activity. In 1970, at USP João Paulo
Monteiro managed to start <em>Ciência e Filosofia</em>, a
journal dedicated to logic and philosophy of science from a plurality
of perspectives. Revitalization of the discipline continued throughout
the decade with timely research projects, often carried out in
conjunction with international visits and courses, notably ones
organized by Porchat, first at USP and after 1975 at State University
of Campinas (UNICAMP), where he headed a new unit, <em>Centro de
Lógica, Epistemologia e História da Ciência</em>
(CLE), whose members included Zeljko Loparic and other distinguished
scholars. In 1977 CLE launched the prestigious
journal <em>Manuscrito</em>, supplemented in 1980 by <em>Cadernos de
Filosofia e História da Ciência</em>, and in 1987 by a
book series (<em>Coleção</em>). CLE quickly became a
symbol of hope for philosophers and historians of science, as well as
logicians (CLE is involved in the articulation of
“Paraconsistent Logic”, a field Newton C. da Costa began
to develop in the late 1950s and early 1960s when he was working at
Federal University of Paraná). Da Costa is one of the most
charismatic and energetic thinkers in Latin America, a world-class
figure in mathematics, logic and philosophy of science, with a widely
recognized reputation for original works on non-classical logics, the
axiomatization of scientific theories, and structuralist philosophy of
science, orientations that continue active in Brazil, with such
figures as Itala Loffredo D’Ottaviano and Walter Carnielli.</p>

<p>In philosophy of science CLE supports significant research on the
character and structure of modern science, its concepts and
theories—conducted from a variety of perspectives, including
investigations into science teaching and the uses of philosophy of
science in education. Critical dialogue has been fostered through
seminars, distinguished international visits, research funding,
faculty and student exchanges, interdisciplinary studies, and the
publication of monographs and papers by Brazilian authors as well as
translations of major works into Portuguese. Post-graduate studies and
postdoctoral fellowships in logic and philosophy of science are
thriving accordingly at UNICAMP. One scheme developed by CLE to
attract promising faculty recently graduated from institutions
worldwide produced excellent results. In the 1980s Michel Ghins and
Harvey Brown energized analytic activity on space-time physics. Steven
French did likewise in advancing the model-theoretic approach and the
metaphysics of quantum mechanics at Campinas. With the help of these
and other recruits, philosophy of physics, mathematics, and formal
approaches to the philosophy of science thrived. At Campinas, French
and da Costa started a long-lasting collaboration that has proved
remarkably fertile, resulting in influential contributions to the
current debates on the metaphysics of quantum mechanics, structuralism
and the semantic approach to theories, as well as a fresher way of
looking at the concept of truth (“pragmatic truth” and
“partial truth”). These collaborations led to numerous
papers (Da Costa and French 1989, 1990, 1991, 1993), and in 2003 also
a book they coauthored, <em>Science and Partial Truth: A Unitary
Approach to Models and Scientific Reasoning</em> (French and Da Costa
2003), which has received international acclaim for the light it casts
on philosophical logic, structuralism, and current debates about
realism. Brown and French made Brazil their country, and it is easy to
imagine how different the geography of the philosophy of physics and
mathematics might have turned out, had circumstances in Brazil been a
little kinder to academic life in the 1980s. Together with da Costa,
the international recruits and the local talents they began to nurture
would have probably turned CLE and USP (where Otávio Bueno had
worked with da Costa) into top centers for philosophy of science in
the world. Destiny dictated otherwise, however; Ghins left to a
professorship at Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium; Brown moved to a
distinguished career at Oxford, where he is now professor of the
philosophy of physics; and French went to the United States and then
back to England, where he is now professor of philosophy of science at
the University of Leeds and Editor-in-Chief of <em>The British Journal
for the Philosophy of Science</em>. Brown and French have each served
terms as presidents of the prestigious British Society for the
Philosophy of Science. Happily all these international old members
maintain productive ties with Brazilian groups. CLE has continued to
prosper over the last two decades.</p>

<p>Philosophical activity has also grown in Brazil at many other
institutions. USP has a body of permanent faculty engaged in teaching
and research in the history and philosophy of science; the group
initially comprised Newton C. da Costa and Jair M. Abe, until they
moved to the Federal University of Santa Catarina in Florianópolis,
and the Universidade Paulista in São Paulo,
respectively. Current faculty includes Osvaldo Pessoa Jr., among whose
recent work is a textbook for science teachers, <em>Teoria
quântica: estudos históricos e implicações
culturais</em> (with Olival Freire Jr. and Joan Lisa Bromberg;
Bromberg et al. 2011), along with several technical papers (e.g.,
Pessoa 2011). Another active researcher is Pablo Mariconda (see his
2011). Also participating at São Paulo are Walter Bezerra and
Caetano Plastino.</p>

<p>Philosophy of science is expanding nationwide. One case already
mentioned is the Federal University of Santa Catarina in
Florianópolis, which runs an influential and prolific unit in
philosophy of science. In addition to da Costa, it has Décio
Krause, a rising philosopher in the world stage. Educated at
São Paulo University and with postdoctoral periods in Italy
(Florence) and England (Leeds and Oxford), over the last
decade. Krause’s works on structuralism, the foundations of
quantum mechanics, and philosophical logic have gained global
recognition, especially his publications on formal philosophical
approaches to the metaphysics and epistemology of scientific
theories. He is chiefly interested in the notions of
“individuality” in quantum mechanical systems,
“particle” in quantum field theories, and “entities
without identity”. In his doctoral research Krause began a
critique, now very advanced, of received ontological approaches in
quantum ontology that appeal admit indiscernible but not identical
individuals, leading Krause to develop an alternative mathematical
basis, “quasi-set theory”, a work of growing interest to
metaphysicians, naturalists, and students of formal methods in
philosophy. Krause’s ongoing collaborations with Steven French
have led to a jointly written book, recognized worldwide as a major
contribution, <em>Identity in Physics: a Historical, Philosophical,
and Formal Analysis</em> (French and Krause 2006). Krause has also
authored and coauthored more than 100 papers, including French and
Krause (1999), Krause and Magalhães (2001), Krause (2003),
Arenhart and Krause (2014a,b), all increasingly influential, putting
him along such figures as Mario Bunge (Argentina), Newton da Costa
(Brazil), Roberto Torretti (Chile and Puerto Rico) and Ulises Moulines
(Mexico), whose works demonstrate that doing world-class philosophy
from bases in Latin America is possible.</p>

<p>Other centers in Brazil are also very active. In Rio de Janeiro,
the Federal University has a graduate program in epistemology and the
history of science that includes a program of visiting faculty (past
guests include Harvey Brown, Steven French, Michel Ghins, Ulises
Moulines, Gilles-Gaston Granger, among numerous others). Also active
in the field is the State University of Rio de Janeiro, with a
well-established graduate program, among whose members is Antonio
Videira, who holds a doctorate in philosophy from Paris-7 and focuses
on applications of philosophy and history to science teaching (see,
e.g., Videira 2006, and Mendonça and Videira 2011). At the
University of Brasília there is a lively center in general
philosophy of science, where Paulo Abrantes (who earned a doctorate
from Paris-Sorbonne) works on “Compatibilism”, trying to
coordinate the view we have of ourselves with common sense and the
current scientific image. Abrantes regards human beings as complex
systems whose behavior is caused by mental states, while also
attributing mental states to other people and “making
sense” of the information they gather, which makes them also
“interpreters” (see Abrantes 2011). At Minas Gerais, the
Federal University runs a master’s and doctorate programs in
philosophy of science; one faculty member is Patricia Kauark-Leite,
who works on the interface between Kant’s philosophy and
contemporary philosophy of physics (Kauark-Leite 2010). Other centers
where interest in epistemology and the philosophy of science is on the
increase are the universities of Paraná and Rio Grande do
Sul.</p>

<p>Based at Instituto de Fisica, Federal University of Bahia, San
Salvador, Olival Freire, Jr. is the author of numerous works in the
philosophy of physics. His recent contributions include <em>The
Quantum Dissidents: Rebuilding the Foundations of Quantum Mechanics
(1950–1990)</em>, published in 2015. In this book Freire, a
former president of the Brazilian Society for the History of Science,
traces the passionate foundational controversies that accompanied the
ripening of quantum physics during the second half of the
20<sup>th</sup> century.</p>

<p>The pedagogical uses of the history and philosophy of science is a
field well developed in Brazil (see, e.g., Brzezinski et al.,
2014). At Bahia, philosophy of science began to build bridges with the
sciences and education since the time Granger taught in the country,
the successive influences enduring, often integrated into a richer
contemporary dialog. For example, the study of Bachelard’s
philosophy has a presence in a group led by Elyana Barbosa. Links with
French colleagues continue, notably with Michel Pati (Paris-7). This
trend continues. In recent times, a group of innovative scholars,
including Olival Freire, André Luís Mattedi Dias and
Robinson Tenório have developed a master’s program in
history, philosophy and science teaching, which is run jointly by the
Federal University of Bahia and the State University of Feira de
Santana.</p>

<p>These are only some of the institutions and researchers in the
country. The vigor and promise of philosophy of science in Brazil are
evidenced by the growth of its activities and their international
presence. The strength of the field in the country can be appreciated,
for example, in the essays contained in <em>Brazilian Studies in
Philosophy and History of Science</em> (Krause &amp; Videira 2011).
Brazilian philosophers play a leading role in a regional association
of growing consequence in the sub-continent (<em>Asociación de
Filosofía e Historia de la Ciencia del Cono Sur</em>), which
organizes well-attended biannual meetings.</p>

<h2><a id="AndCou">4. Andean Countries</a></h2>

<p>As with the previous regions, the field developed a presence in the
Andean countries in the early days of professional philosophy of
science.</p>

<h3><a id="Ven">4.1 Venezuela</a></h3>

<p>A critic of Francisco Franco, Juan David García Bacca
(1901–1992) was forced to emigrate from his native Spain in the
late 1930s; first to Ecuador and Mexico, then in 1946 to Caracas,
Venezuela, where he led a productive career at the Faculty of Letters
and Philosophy, Central University (<em>Universidad Central de
Venezuela</em>, UCV). In the mid-1930s, after completing a doctoral
dissertation on the logico-genetic structure of the physical sciences,
García Bacca had joined the Vienna Circle. In Latin America he
became a prolific writer, his works including <em>Teoría de la
relatividad</em> (1941), <em>La física</em>
(1962), <em>Historia filosófica de la ciencia</em>
(1963), <em>Teoría y metateoría de la ciencia</em>,
Vol. I (1977) and Vol II (1984).  In Caracas he remained a major force
until his retirement in 1971. In the 1970s and 1980s, Andrés
Kalnay led a small group interested in the foundations of quantum
mechanics, first at UCV’s School of Physics and then at
Venezuela’s leading center for scientific
research, <em>Instituto Venezolano de Investigaciones
Científicas</em>. Presently UCV runs a master’s program
in logic and philosophy of science coordinated by Franklin
Galindo.</p>

<h3><a id="Col">4.2 Colombia</a></h3>

<p>Philosophy in Colombia has long-enduring ties with Continental
European schools, but analytic philosophy of science has not been
absent. Already in the 1950s Mario Laserna (1923–2013)
at <em>Universidad de los Andes</em> (Uniandes), Bogotá,
promoted the study of logic and the scientific philosophy of Hans
Reichenbach. Subsequently, local groups, helped by international
visitors, have played a consistent role in the country, notably
Gonzalo Munévar, a Colombian philosopher of science now based
in the United States who visits regularly.</p>

<p>Interest in the discipline is growing, especially through the
efforts of faculty recently returned with doctorates from centers
abroad (Moreno 2010). An instance in point is Andres Páez (who
earned a Ph.D. from the CUNY Graduate Center), now at Uniandes and
works on explanation as a belief revision operation; his
book <em>Explanations in K</em> (2006) has received good international
reception, especially in Germany; other works by him include
Páez 2009, 2013 and 2014. He currently leads PHILOGICA, a
research group focused on logic, epistemology and philosophy of
science, based in Bogotá at Uniandes and <em>Universidad del
Rosario</em>. PHILOGICA organizes short international courses (among
its recent visitors are Susan Haack, Arnold Koslow, and Larry Laudan,
among others), also a well-attended congress that meets every other
year. At <em>Universidad del Rosario</em> Carlos Alberto Cardona works
on the history of philosophy of science, especially the first half of
the 20<sup>th</sup> century (see, e.g., Cardona, 2010a,b). Activity is
also growing at other centers in Bogotá. At <em>Universidad
Nacional de Colombia</em>, Fernando Zalamea does philosophy of
mathematics; he is the author of <em>Filosofía sintética
de las matemáticas contemporáneas</em>
(2009). At <em>Universidad Jorge Tadeo Lozano</em>, Favio Cala works
on the philosophy of spacetime. In other cities, <em>Universidad del
Valle</em> (Cali)—seemingly the first institution in Colombia to
open a faculty position specifically for philosophy of
science—maintains an lively program of doctoral and
master’s studies in the field, led by Germán Guerrero
Pino, who works on interpretations of probability and the philosophy
of physics; the papers collected in Guerrero Pino 2010 are
representative of recent activities by this group.</p>

<p>In neighboring Ecuador, visits by the Spanish philosopher Juan D.
García Bacca to Ecuador in the late 1930s and early 1940s
encouraged the study of contemporary trends, notably analytic
philosophy and the analysis of scientific proposals. Presently, the
Catholic University in Quito (<em>Pontificia Universidad
Católica del Ecuador</em>) offers a first degree in philosophy
that stresses the importance of developing a critical stance based in
part on innovations contributed by science and scientific
thinking.</p>

<h3><a id="Per">4.3 Peru</a></h3>

<p>Activity in Peru started early in the 1950s, as attested by
gatherings organized at <em>Universidad Nacional Mayor de San
Marcos</em> (UNMSM, established in 1551, thus the oldest continuosly
operating university in the Americas) and <em>Sociedad Peruana de
Filosofía</em>, both in Lima. Broad interest is also reflected
in articles published in the 1950s and 1960s in the weekly literary
supplement of “<em>El Comercio</em>” by Oscar
Miró-Quesada, Francisco Miró-Quesada, and other
intellectuals interested in logic, science and mathematics.</p>

<p>Francisco Miró-Quesada, the country’s leading
philosopher, is one of the pioneers in the development of modern
philosophical logic and science studies in Latin America, where he has
indefatigably encouraged hope in the power of human reason.
Miró-Quesada taught at UNMSM for more than two decades, and
then at <em>Universidad Cayetano Heredia</em> (UPCH) and other centers
in the country. He also headed institutes for philosophical research,
first at <em>Universidad de Lima</em>, and subsequently
at <em>Universidad Ricardo Palma</em>. Miró-Quesada is the
author of numerous works in the area of philosophy of science,
including a book in the philosophy of
mathematics, <em>Filosofía de las Matemáticas</em>
(1954). He has also been a champion of research in logic in the region
(it was Miró-Quesada who suggested to name Newton da
Costa’s approach “paraconsistent logic”, which he
helped to promote). Miró-Quesada’s most heartfelt project
focuses on the study of human reason, regarded as the capacity to
reach truth, broadly understood, as outlined in his preliminary
book <em>Apuntes para una teoría de la razón</em>
(1962), followed in 2013 by <em>Esquema de una teoría de la
razón</em>, in which Miró-Quesada discusses the pursuit
of rational validity in logic, science, metaphysics, and ethical
theory.</p>

<p>In the early1970s, young faculty trained in Europe and the United
States expanded and updated the philosophical study of science in the
country, particularly at UNMSM. Timely contributions were made,
especially by Luis Piscoya (philosophy of psychology and general
philosophy of science), Juan Abugattas (philosophy of science),
Julio-Cesar Sanz-Elguera (philosophy of science), and David Sobrevilla
(philosophy of the social sciences). Ever since, at San Marcos,
Luís Piscoya has been working on the interface between
philosophy of science and education; he is the author
of <em>Investigación científica y educacional: un
enfoque epistemológico</em> (1995), and numerous papers (e.g.,
Piscoya 1993). In the late 1970s, an innovative program in philosophy
opened at UPCH, one of the leading research universities in the
sub-continent.  Under Francisco Miró-Quesada, numerous
international workshops, seminars and courses took place in Lima as
part of this venture. From the late 1980s on, activity at UPCH
continued through a program named “Scientific Thought”,
headed by Alberto Cordero, with the collaboration of Sandro
D’Onofrio and other faculty. As the century came to a close,
philosophy of science regained strength at UNMSM, where a
post-graduate program in the discipline opened in the early 1990s
under Julio Sanz. This program was subsequently led for many years by
Oscar Augusto García Zárate, who now presides a research
center for analytic philosophy (<em>Centro de Estudios de
Filosofía Analítica</em>—CESFIA) and also directs
the journal <em>Analítica</em>; his scholarly works include
García Zárate 2001 and 2007. At UNMSM activity in the
field has growing support among young faculty, particularly David
Villena (who also teaches at Universidad Antonio Ruíz de
Montoya, also in Lima).</p>

<p>Interest in the discipline is also rising at other centers, notably
Peru’s main Catholic University (<em>Pontificia Universidad
Católica del Perú</em>—PUCP). Although long
associated with the study of phenomenology and existentialism,
PUCP’s institutional focus has expanded in recent years, thanks
in part to the incorporation of faculty with degrees from
English-speaking universities, who are encouraging analytically
oriented work at PUCP. Chief among these is Pablo Quintanilla, who has
a Ph.D. in philosophy from the University of Virginia and a M.A. from
King’s College, London. Quintanilla’s main interests lie
in naturalism and the philosophy of mind and language, also in the
history of ideas in Latin America; on the first two areas his recent
publications include Quintanilla 2006, 2011, and 2013. He
heads <em>Mente y Lenguage</em>, a unit for the naturalistic study of
mind and language that hosts regular meetings and short international
courses. In philosophy of science, selected papers from seminars and
workshops organized by this group are collected in the
volume <em>Cognición Social y Lenguaje</em> (Quintanilla
2014). Also at PUCP, Sandro D’Onofrio (Ph.D. SUNY, Buffalo)
specializes in medieval philosophy, with a concentration in medieval
and early modern science; in addition, he leads an interdisciplinary
group focused on applications of philosophy of science to
jurisprudence and real-life legal issues.</p>

<h3><a id="Chi">4.4 Chile</a></h3>

<p>In the 1960s, Gerold Stahl, Nathan Stemmer and Augusto Pescador (1910–1987)
made logic a major field in Chile. Later in the decade, Roberto
Torretti published a seminal book, <em>Manuel Kant: Estudio sobre los
fundamentos de la filosofía crítica</em> (1967, still in
print). His subsequent work on Kant led him to wider research on the
philosophical history of science, a field that had a growing audience,
especially in Santiago. However, life in Chile became increasingly
challenging as the decade progressed. In 1970 Torretti left for Puerto
Rico, where—as mentioned in Section 2—his philosophical
work continued to develop, especially on 19<sup>th</sup>-century
geometry and the theory of relativity. In 1973 a ruthless military
dictatorship took over the government. It was a difficult time for
academia; Chile’s leading journal, <em>Revista de
Filosofía</em>, ceased publication and remained dormant until
1977. Although the institutional environment suffered greatly at most
centers, quality research continued in logic, as evidenced by
internationally acclaimed contributions during the period by Rolando
Chuaqui and others.</p>

<p>Based virtually always in Latin American centers (Chile and Puerto
Rico), Torretti is an icon of rigor and philosophical sense, the
author of world-class level contributions, his writings celebrated for
his insightful commentaries and educated perspectives on the rational
development of ideas, especially in Galileo, Newton, Leibniz, Kant,
19<sup>th</sup> century mathematics, Helmholtz, Poincaré, and
Einstein.  Torretti’s major publications on these subjects have
a secure place on the reading lists of leading seminars in philosophy
of science anywhere, in particular <em>Philosophy of Geometry from
Riemann to Poincaré</em> (1978), <em>Relativity and
Geometry</em> (1985), <em>Creative Understanding: Philosophical
Reflections on Physics</em> (1990), and <em>The Philosophy of
Physics</em> (1999), each
an authoritative work in the philosophy and the philosophical history
of science.</p>

<p>In 2001 Torretti became a professor emeritus at Rio Piedras,
returning to Chile where he again became a pivotal figure in the
advancement of the discipline, teaching for a few years
at <em>Universidad de Chile</em> and at <em>Universidad Diego
Portales</em>. His subsequent production has remained strong, notably the
volumes <em>Estudios filosóficos: 1986–2006</em>
(Torretti 2007a), <em>De Eudoxo a Newton: Modelos matemáticos
en la filosofía natural</em> (2007b), <em>Crítica
filosófica y progreso científico: Cuatro ejemplos</em>
(2008a), <em>Estudios filosóficos: 2007–2009</em>
(2010a). His recent articles include Torretti 2004, 2007c, 2008b,c,
and an illuminating paper “Respuestas a mis
críticos” (2010b). An extended interview (with Eduardo
Carrasco), published in 2006, brings to memory the <em>joie de
vivre</em> that prevailed in some parts of South America until well
into the 1960s, a way of life at once charmed and serious—marked
by optimism about the possibilities of science, literature, art,
philosophy, music, the classics, and the political future of the
region. In this piece Torretti reveals himself as a practical
philosopher endowed with a refined sense of irony. In his youth he had
shown literary talent—he wrote some short stories with
Carlos Fuentes when they were schoolmates at The Grange School—a
gracious extension of England’s Cheltenham College in
Santiago. Torretti went to university in Chile and Germany (where he
completed a doctorate with Wilhelm Szilasi at the University of
Freiburg in 1954). After brief periods at the United Nations in New
York and elsewhere, Torretti returned to Santiago, where he was a
professor of philosophy at <em>Universidad de Chile</em> until his
move to Puerto Rico in 1970.  Back in Chile, in 2011Torretti received
the prestigious <em>Premio Nacional de Humanidades y Ciencias
Sociales</em>.</p>

<p>The teaching of philosophy of science has expanded in Chile in
recent years. <em>Universidad de Santiago de Chile</em> (USACH) offers
a master’s degree in philosophy of science, headed by Wilfredo
Quezada (Ph.D, King’s College, London), who also runs a study
group on causality. He specializes in logic and the philosophy of
mathematics; in the latter field his publications include Quezada
2005a,b, among other works. Also at Usach, Davide Vecchi (Ph.D.,
London School of Economics) specializes in the philosophy of the
biological and social sciences; his works include Vecchi 2011 and
2012, among other publications. Recently retired from <em>Universidad
Diego Portales</em>, Juan Manuel Garrido, who holds a doctorate in
philosophy from Marc Bloch University, Strasbourg, is interested in
areas at the interface between philosophy and biology; he is the
author of <em>On Time, Being, and Hunger: Challenging the Traditional
Way of Thinking Life</em> (2012). Also in the capital city there is a
center for the interdisciplinary philosophical study of complex
systems, <em>Instituto de Filosofía y Ciencias de la
Complejidad</em>, established in 2007. It is an autonomous center that
promotes philosophical research on complex systems, biology and the
social sciences, currently led by Pablo Razeto, who works on the
philosophy of statistical mechanics, quantum cognition, and modeling
in the social sciences; his recent publications include Razeto
2012.</p>

<p><em>Universidad de Chile</em> (Santiago), the largest and oldest
institution of higher education in the country, does not have a formal
program in philosophy of science, but the discipline is represented in
its regular curriculum; faculty in the field includes Alejandro
Ramírez, author of <em>La transformación de la
epistemología contemporánea: De la unidad a la
dispersión</em> (2009). Valparaiso University runs a
master’s program, Wilfredo Quezada (also at Santiago University)
and Carlos Verdugo. Among the latter’s publications is Verdugo
2009. Concepcion University has a group interested in the interface
between philosophy of biology and philosophy of language. One its most
active members is Julio Torres, whose papers include Torres 2011.
Francisco Varela, a Chilean philosopher who worked in France but
maintained strong ties with academic circles in the country is the
author of a book on the phenomenon of life that has had impact in the
region, <em>El Fenómeno de la Vida</em> (2000).</p>

<p>Started by Quezada and Renato Lewin, each year Chile holds a
research gathering, <em>Jornadas</em>, in memory of the outstanding
Chilean philosopher Rolando Chuaqui (1935–1994), who began as a
medical doctor and then moved to scientific methodology and
philosophical logic, especially the latter. Additionally, in 2012 the
seventh gathering of the increasingly active <em> Asociación de
Filosofía e Historia de la Ciencia del Cono Sur</em> (South
Cone Association for the History and Philosophy of Science) met in
Santiago, with Wilfredo Quezada as President.</p>

<h2><a id="ArgUru">5. Argentina and Uruguay</a></h2>

<p>The arrival of Hans Lindemann in the 1940s marked a turning point
in analytic philosophy in Argentina, where his discussions of the
philosophy of Bertrand Russell and the Vienna Circle (he had studied
under Moritz Schlick and been a member of the Circle) encouraged
further activity, in particular research seminars and courses by Julio
Rey Pastor (1888–1962), Mario Bunge, and Gregorio Klimovsky
(1922–2009). Throughout the 1950s, the Buenos Aires area enjoyed
a decade of optimism about the academic and cultural possibilities of
philosophy of science and its applications. Several centers prospered,
particularly two that opened in 1952. In one, <em>Instituto Libre de
Estudios Superiores</em>, Klimovsky and Rolando García
(1919–2012) discussed the “logical empiricist”
approach and gave courses that presented the new philosophy
systematically to wider audiences. The other center
was <em>Círculo Filosófico</em>, led by Bunge, where his
book <em>Causalidad</em> and other works of the period took shape,
their central materials presented in lectures and discussions. Bunge
and Klimovsky managed to secure chairs at <em>Universidad de Buenos
Aires</em> (UBA) in philosophy of science and logic, respectively. In
the mid-1950s, their research and courses turned the university into a
world-class place in the field. Bunge’s administrative and
cultural efforts during this period put a strong emphasis on making
professional philosophical activity possible in Argentina. A new
association for logic and scientific philosophy, <em>Agrupación
Rioplatense de Lógica y Filosofía
Científica</em>, opened in 1956, aimed at drawing together
thinkers from Argentina and Uruguay who wanted to study philosophy in
the rational and rigorous style of the new approach, with Bunge,
Klimovsky, Jorge Bosch, Gino Germani (1911–1979), and Rolando
Garcia among its members. A consistent group began to form, resulting
in such achievements as <em>Cuadernos de Epistemología</em>, a
series that gave the whole of Latin America and Spain access to key
works in the field translated into Spanish.</p>

<p>In <em>Causalidad</em>, Bunge focused on the empiricist conception
of causality and its shortcomings, blaming the empiricist outlook for
having created unnecessary confusion and pessimism in philosophy. In
this work Bunge distinguishes causal determination from other forms of
determination (structural, teleological, dialectical, and
statistical), telling apart three different senses in which the term
“causality” enters scientific discourse—as a law
stating that same causes produce same effects, as a relation between
cause and effect, and as a principle stating that everything has a
cause. The book came out in 1959, gaining considerable international
reception, especially the realist conception it
articulates.  <em>Causality</em> also marks a turning point:
philosophy books one may call “classics” were now coming
out of Latin America and finding a place in mainstream reading lists
in the English-speaking world and Europe. A citizen of the world,
perhaps the most universalist of philosophers in the subcontinent,
Bunge is nonetheless very South American (it is hard to imagine him
growing up anywhere else but in cosmopolitan Argentina).</p>

<p>Bunge has always been a socially engaged intellectual, a trend
already present in his efforts as founder and secretary general of a
college for workers, <em>Universidad Obrera Argentina</em>, from 1938
until 1943. He has remained a spirited spokesman for the need to
maintain in Latin America cultural and educational institutions
capable of promoting the practice of philosophy by minds free from
ideological pressure, financial oppression, and political or
governmental control.  First in Argentina and then elsewhere, Bunge
has been at “war” against, as he puts it, the kind of
uncritical understanding of philosophy he found prevailing at the
Faculty of Philosophy and Letters when he joined in the 1950s,
laboring to inspire in his students and collaborators a lasting sense
of professional rigor. The series he launched, <em>Cuadernos de
Epistemología</em>, had a substantial impact on scientists,
philosophers and the educated public in the Spanish-speaking world.
Bunge’s production during these years was remarkable; apart
from <em>Causality</em>, other works of consequence are Bunge (1959b,
1960, 1961a,b,c, 1962). Unfortunately, these accomplishments were not
achieved without friction with colleagues and groups sympathetic to
alternative ideas Bunge could not respect. In addition, the
country’s political and economic conditions were
deteriorating. Early in the 1960s, internal fractions within the
Argentine army began to make civic life increasingly difficult. Bunge
left the country in 1963, first to the United States (where the
Vietnam War and other political developments made him uncomfortable),
then moving in 1966 to McGill University, Montreal, where he remains
to this day.</p>

<p>Few thinkers associated with analytic philosophy strive to produce
a comprehensive philosophical system. Bunge is one of them, a thinker
trying to integrate ontology, metaphysics, epistemology, semantics,
psychology, and science coherently and fruitfully. Thus far
Bunge’s publications make more than fifty books and hundreds of
philosophical and scientific articles, mostly in English and Spanish,
his principal works translated into German, Italian, Russian, French,
Hungarian, and Portuguese, among other languages. His works of
greatest impact in mainstream philosophy of science are
arguably <em>Causality</em> (1959a), <em>The Myth of Simplicity</em>
(1963), and <em>Foundations of Physics</em> (1967). Bunge’s
search for a naturalist vision worth having was given systematic
expression in his <em>Treatise on Basic Philosophy</em> (an
eight-volume work published between 1974 and 1989). Other influential
publications by Bunge include <em>Emergence and Convergence:
Qualitative Novelty and the Unity of Knowledge</em>
(2003), <em>Chasing Reality: Strife over Realism</em> (2006),
and <em>Medical Philosophy: Conceptual Issues in Medicine</em> (2013),
as well as his much awaited autobiography “Memorias entre Dos
Mundos” (2014), to mention a fraction of his abundant
production.</p>

<p>Forcefully in his oral presentations and seminars, Bunge gives
particular attention to the evaluation of the arguments at hand,
championing the use of logic as an expediter of clarity of thought. He
is renowned for his scathing critiques of positions that demean
reason, the search for truth, and the universality of science,
scientific naturalism, as well as positions that fail to respect human
beings as individuals. Bunge enthusiastically endorses the way in
which the Enlightenment tried to disseminate conceptual and moral
tools to revise and improve human thought and life in general. Bunge's
works steadily emphasize the idea that science can lead (and has often
led) to what he regards as the only sensible foundation for social and
political action: relevant knowledge of the world. Importantly, early
on in Latin America Bunge played the role of a much needed exemplar, a
leading thinker who in the 1960s became a “possibility
proof” that philosophers working in the sub-continent could,
despite the often bizarre difficulties academics face, stand up and
join the philosophical conversation at the highest levels. No Latin
American philosopher had achieved anything comparable before in
cosmopolitan philosophy.</p>

<p>Losing Bunge was a major blow, one of many as the decade unfolded.
When the military intervened the universities in 1966, many of the
most talented minds in science and the humanities fled the country.
Klimovsky remained, however, and his presence helped keep the
discipline active during this difficult period, first at UBA and then
at Belgrano University from the late 1970s until his death. Philosophy
of science did not stop in Argentina, young talent continuing to
arise, notably Alberto Coffa (1935–1984), at <em>Universidad de la Plata</em>
until he too left for the United States. The surrounding turmoil was a
negative factor, yet a remarkable period of expansion began at the end
of the decade, marked by the foundation of the <em>Sociedad Argentina
de Análisis Filosófico</em> (SADAF), a model institution
supported by its own members, in which fellows and invited
international guests meet around topics of philosophical interest,
including many of central importance in philosophy of science. A major
journal saw the light in Buenos Aires in 1975: <em>Revista
Latinoamericana de Filosofía</em>, followed in 1981 by another
important periodical, <em>Análisis Filosófico</em>.</p>


<p>Activity in philosophy of science has grown in the country since
then. Significant projects are discernible. At UBA Olimpia Lombardi
heads <em>Grupo de Filosofía</em>, an active unit within the
Faculty of Exact and Natural Sciences. With degrees in engineering,
physics and philosophy, Lombardi has managed to form a group that has
achieved a considerable international presence. She is the author of
numerous publications, including Lombardi (2005, 2010, 2012). She is
also coauthor of various collaborative interdisciplinary works,
e.g., with Mario Castagnino (2005, 2007, 2008, 2009); with Newton Da
Costa (2014); and with Sebastián Fortin (2014).  Her books include:
<em>Introduction to the Modal-Hamiltonian Interpretation of Quantum
Mechanics</em> (with Sebastián Fortin, Juan S. Ardenghi and
Mario Castagnino; 2010), and <em>Los Múltiples Mundos de la
Ciencia</em> (with Ana Rosa Pérez Ransanz, 2012). Research in
the field is also pursued at the Faculty of Letters and Philosophy by
Nélida Gentile, who has recently published <em>La Tesis de la
Inconmensurabilidad: A 50 años de la Estructura de las
Revoluciones Científicas</em> (2013). Also at UBA is
Hernán Miguel, who specializes in applications of philosophy of
science in secondary school physics (see, e.g., Miguel 2015, in Other
Internet Resources).</p>

<p>In the greater Buenos Aires area, at <em>Universidad Nacional de
Tres de Febrero</em>, César Lorenzano has a long and
distinguished career in the field; one of his most widely read
publications is Lorenzano (1980). At <em>Universidad Nacional de
Quilmes</em>, Pablo Lorenzano and Christian C. Carman lead a lively
history and philosophy of science program. Pablo Lorenzano, who has a
doctorate from the Free University of Berlin, specializes in
structuralist metatheory and the history and philosophy of formal
Mendelian genetics, as well as general science studies. His book
<em>Geschichte und Struktur der klassischen Genetik</em> (1995) and an
ensuing paper written with Wolfgang Balzer (Balzer and Lorenzano 2000)
have been well received in Latin America, as has also Lorenzano
(2011). Carman works on scientific realism and ancient astronomy;
among his recent publications are Carman (2005 and 2009). Also in the
Buenos Aires area, the late Eduardo H. Flichman, who had studied under
Klimovsky, taught for many years at <em>Universidad Nacional de
General Sarmiento</em> (also at UBA), working on causation and
counterfactuals (see, e.g., Flichman 1995).</p>

<p>At <em>Universidad Nacional de La Plata</em>, a philosophy of
science program continues a tradition of activity in the discipline.
Further south is Jorge Roetti (<em>Universidad Nacional del Sur</em>);
although mostly known for his work in philosophical logic, he also has
contributions to the philosophical history of science and the
philosophy of the social sciences (see, e.g., Roetti 1999, 2004, and
2006). Juan Manuel Torres is a recognized researcher in the philosophy
of medicine and the history and philosophy of genetics and biology,
the author of numerous papers (including Torres 1996, 1999a,b, 2000,
2009).</p>

<p>The field also shows growth in other regions, judging by the amount
of teaching and research projects in place at various centers. In
Cordoba, in particular, annual meetings devoted to epistemology and
the history of science (<em>Jornadas de Epistemología e
Historia de la Ciencia</em>) have been held now for twenty years under
the direction of Víctor Rodríguez, with substantial
impact in Latin America. On wider sections of society, influence is
especially apparent in science education (see, e.g., Irene Arriassecq
and Alcira Rivarosa, 2014).</p>

<p>In neighboring Uruguay, meanwhile, the study of history and
philosophy of science has gained strength in recent decades. A key
development was the return of Mario Otero (1929–2013), who early in
his career had taught epistemology and chaired the department of
philosophy of science at Uruguay University. Back after many years at
UBA and Mexico’s UNAM, Otero has remained one of the forces
behind much philosophical activity in the region, particularly some
successful history and philosophy of science encounters organized
jointly by several Latin American institutions. Highly appreciated in
the entire subcontinent is a regular series of colloquia,
<em>Coloquios de Historia y Filosofía de la Ciencia</em> hosted
by <em>Universidad de la Republica</em>, Uruguay; the last meeting,
held in 2014, focused on conceptual change and theory choice.</p>

<h2><a id="ConRem">6. Concluding Remarks</a></h2>

<p>The developments reported in this entry provide only a rough
picture of the state of philosophy of science in Latin America. One
relevant lesson of the preceding sections is that, despite endemic
obstacles to academic careers, contrary to what the circumstances
might have led one to expect, a number of thinkers, working from bases
in the subcontinent, have managed to produce work of the highest
international level in philosophy of science. No comparable
development seems quite like it in other branches of standard
philosophy in Latin America, or for that matter the developing world,
except perhaps in the field of logic. As explained in the previous
sections, the works developed by—to mention some clear
cases—Bunge in Argentina, da Costa in Brazil, Torretti in Chile
and Puerto Rico, Moulines in Mexico, and most recently Krause in
Brazil show that it is possible in practice to fully actualize the
dialogical aspirations of philosophy from centers in Latin
America. These and other thinkers have engaged worldwide in real and
fruitful dialogue with leading members of the discipline, transcending
limitations imposed by “borders”, background traditions
and picturesque restrictions. Explaining this phenomenon is difficult,
as numerous factors suggest themselves. One obvious component, already
mentioned in the Introduction, is the hope many Latin Americans have
about modern science and learning, a trend fortified by the centrality
of science to contemporary life. Another factor is the comparative
clarity, precision, and translatability, of writing in mainstream
philosophy of science. A related aspect has to do with the initial
concentration of philosophers of science on highly international
themes from physics and mathematics, which facilitated communication
and dialogue across linguistic and cultural barriers.  Another factor,
also noted in the Introduction, may be that philosophy of science
arose in Latin America right at the start of the professional
discipline in the late 1940s. Last, but not least, of course, is the
considerable talent of many of the individuals involved.</p>

<p>The technical quality of the best works produced in the region has
steadily improved in recent decades. Studies in the philosophical
history of science remain high in some groups while a growing number
of history-oriented colleagues are moving closer to the interface with
the sociology and political philosophy of science. Sneed’s and
Stegmuller’s structuralist approaches remain influential in
Latin America, but seemingly less so than in the 1970s and 1980s, with
many of the most active structuralist groups now working within
perspectives closer to recent British varieties of the approach. At
the same time, other projects have been gaining strength, for example
research on the antirealist moves started in the 1980s in different
but complementary ways by Bas van Fraassen and Larry Laudan (presently
living in Mexico, as noted). On the opposite camp, there is a revival
of interest in moderate realist positions—such selectivist
approaches as those championed in in recent decades by Mario Bunge,
Ronald Giere, Philip Kitcher, Jarrett Leplin, and Stathis Psillos,
among others.</p>

<p>On the professional side, in many countries of the region
philosophers of science now have access to funding for research,
workshops and international exchanges, particularly in Mexico, Brazil,
Colombia, Chile and Argentina. Another crucial recent improvement
throughout Latin America is access to electronic libraries, especially
top periodicals. Exchange visits within the Spanish and
Portuguese-speaking worlds are increasingly frequent and vibrant.
Unfortunately, this is less widely so between Anglo-American and Latin
American groups, despite the existence of considerable room for
fruitful and mutually beneficial interaction.</p>

<p>Arguably, among the most persistent problems in the region is the
comparative hardship of academic careers, a difficulty unlikely to
improve until universities and research centers provide appropriate
stability and salaries, as well as research facilities on a regular,
long-term basis. In the view of many Latin American colleagues, having
access to proper university positions, earned on the basis of clear
academic merit, adequately funded and not conditioned to
“political” interference from central administrations,
would be the most promising line of solution to these and other
lingering problems.</p>
