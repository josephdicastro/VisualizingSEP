                                    <h2>Navigate the Graph</h2>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>There are two fundamental ways to navigate the graph: <em>Hover Mode</em> and <em>Click Mode</em>.
                                            These are exclusive modes, and the graph can only be in one mode at a time.</li>
                                        <li>The current mode is always listed in the <em>“Graph Mode”</em> box in the top right corner. Toggle between the two modes by <strong>single-clicking</strong> this box.</li>
                                        <li>Regardless of the current Graph Mode, <strong>Double-click</strong> any node or title to make a new selection and reload the graph with the new selection.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                        <h4>Hover Mode (Preview Mode)</h4>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>This is the default modal state of the graph. </li>
                                            <li>In this mode, when you <strong>hover/mouseOver</strong> over a node or title, the entire graph will be re-drawn to preview the 
                                                information from the hovered reference. The other nodes in the graph will be dimmed, the article details in the left sidebar will be temporarily 
                                                replaced with preview information for the hovered node, and, if the hovered node also links to other articles in the same 
                                                graph, a dashed line will be drawn from the hovered node to the shared links to indicate these relationships.</li> 
                                            <li>As soon as you stop hovering over that node, the graph will return to its original state. 
                                                And when you hover over another node, the graph will be redrawn, etc. </li>
                                            <li>At any point, you can always <strong>double-click</strong> a node or title to draw a brand new graph with this new node as the main selection.</li>
                                            <li>Preview Mode provides a powerful way to quickly view the relationships in the Article Graph. However,
                                                it doesn’t really allow a deep exploration of the relationships between the selected article and the links.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                        <h4>Click Mode (Explore Mode)</h4>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li><em>Click Mode (Explore Mode)</em> is for deep-diving into the relationships between the selected entry and 
                                                the linked articles, as well as to make a more detailed inquiry into the linked articles themselves. </li>
                                            <li>The power of this mode comes in when the user <strong>single-clicks</strong> a node or title. The graph will then be frozen in that state. Each time the 
                                                user clicks a new node or title, the graph updates and is then re-frozen.</li>
                                            <li>In this state, the user can more easily explore the details of the linked articles, can see how linked articles are themselves 
                                                linked to other articles in the graph, or can open the full SEP article itself, etc. </li>
                                            <li>When you <strong>hover over</strong> a node or title in Explore Mode, the data in the left sidebar will be replaced with a preview of the hovered article, 
                                                but the main graph features remain the same. The graph itself is only re-drawn when you click a node. </li>
                                            <li>At any point, you can always <strong>double-click a node or title</strong> to draw a brand new graph with this new node as the main selection.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                        <h3>Color (Same as Domain Graph)</h3>
                                        <p>Each article node and title is colored according to its <i>primary domain</i> designation, which is the domain chosen as the most representative

                                <ul>
                                    <li>There are two fundamental ways to navigate the graph: <em>Hover Mode</em> and <em>Click Mode</em>.
                                        These are exclusive modes, and the graph can only be in one mode at a time.</li>
                                    <li>The current mode is always listed in the <em>“Graph Mode”</em> box in the top right corner. Toggle between the two modes by <strong>single-clicking</strong> this box.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Double-click</strong> any node or title to select that node and then load the <em>Article Graph</em> with that node as the main selection.</li>
                                </ul>
                                    <h4>Hover Mode (Preview Mode)</h4>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>This is the default modal state of the graph. </li>
                                        <li>In this mode, when you <strong>hover/mouseOver</strong> over a node or title, the entire graph will be re-drawn to preview the 
                                            information from the hovered reference. The details of the selected article node will appear in the left sidebar; the article title will 
                                            appear on top of the graph node; the titles of the articles that this node is linked to will appear at the left and right side of the graph; 
                                            and, nodes that are not linked to the current node will be dimmed. </li>
                                        <li>As soon as you stop hovering over that node, the graph will return to its default state of all nodes displayed, with no titles. 
                                            And when you hover over another node, the graph will be redrawn in the same way, etc. </li>
                                        <li>If you <strong>double-click</strong> a node or title, the domain graph disappears and the selected node will be loaded into the Article Graph as the main selection.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <h4>Click Mode (Explore Mode)</h4>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><em>Click Mode (Explore Mode)</em> allows a much deeper dive into the structure of a domain than does Preview Mode.</li>
                                        <li>The power of this mode comes in when the user <strong>single-clicks</strong> a node or title. The graph will then be frozen in that state. Each time the 
                                            users clicks a new node, the graph updates and is then re-frozen.</li>
                                        <li>In this state, when the user selects a node and freezes the graph in its current state, not only does the user see the selected node and 
                                            the titles of the linked articles, but those titles themselves become actionable. 
                                        <li>When the user <strong>hovers</strong> a node or title in Click Mode, a dashed line
                                            is drawn from the title to its correponding node. This allows the user to see where that article lives within the 
                                            domain network. When you <strong>single-click</strong> a title, the graph is updated with that title as the selected node and the article
                                        titles that the selected article links to are drawn into the graph. In this way, the user can explore the stucture of a domain in fine-grained detail. </li>
                                        <li>If you <strong>double-click</strong> a node or title, the domain graph disappears and the selected node will be loaded into the Article Graph as the main selection.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                    <h3>Color (Same as Article Graph)</h3>
                                    <p>Each node and title is colored according to its <em>primary domain</em> designation, which is the domain chosen as the most representative 
                                        expression of the article’s topic type. In many cases though, there are fluid boundaries between domain categories and many, perhaps most, 
                                        articles are tagged as appearing in multiple domains. The color of the node and title will always flow from the article’s primary domain.</p>

                                <p>Visualizing SEP is an interactive data visualization for exploring the <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/">Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy</a>, one of the Web’s foremost resources on the history and practice of philosophy. The application uses network graphs to explore the inter-relationships of all the articles in the Encyclopedia. There have been a number of wonderful visualizations of the SEP before, but there has not been a single application that combines beauty, ease, and power of exploring the SEP in the way this application does.</p>
                                <h2>Domain Taxonomy</h2>
                                <p>The domain taxonomy used for grouping articles is not derived from the SEP itself. The domain taxonomy is adapted from the taxonomy from the <a href="https://www.inphoproject.org/taxonomy">Indiana University Philosophy Ontology Project (InPhO)</a>. Visualizing SEP uses the top-level taxonomic categories from InPhO, and mostly ignores the deeper-level sub-domain groupings that InPhO provides. The exception here is that we do use certain specific sub-domains to designate the philosophies of particular sciences (Biology, Physics, etc.). There are currently 25 individual domains. </p>
                                <p>The tagging and modeling of the articles into domains were completed with a combination of topic modeling, text search, and old-fashioned individual tagging of documents. The domain groupings should be seen more like language games with loosely fit boundaries between related articles instead of rigid determinations with bright-line differences between them. </p>
                                <p>Each article is tagged with a <em>primary domain designation</em>, which is the individual domain category that the article is best grouped with, as well as a general <em>domain_tags</em> field, which indicates other domains that the article can reasonably be tagged. In this way, an article can appear in multiple domain groups.</p>
                                <h2>Development</h2>
                                <p>The data infrastructure for the application was developed using Python, Pandas, Beautiful Soup, and MongoDB. The interactive aspects of the site were built with HTML, CSS, Javascript, and D3.
                                    A forthcoming article will describe the technical development of the application in detail. 
                                    </p>
                                <!-- <h2>Domain Color Scheme</h2>
                                <p>Article nodes and titles are colored by their primary domain designation. A color scheme was developed to group related domain designations together, so the user can understand relations between domains as well. This is the color scheme: </p>
