Intuitionistic logic encompasses the general principles of logical
reasoning which have been abstracted by logicians from intuitionistic
mathematics, as developed by
 L. E. J. Brouwer
 beginning in his [1907] and [1908]. Because these principles also
hold for Russian recursive mathematics and the constructive analysis
of E. Bishop and his followers, intuitionistic logic may be considered
the logical basis of
 constructive mathematics.
 Although intuitionistic analysis conflicts with classical analysis,
intuitionistic Heyting arithmetic is a subsystem of classical Peano
arithmetic. It follows that intuitionistic propositional logic is a
proper subsystem of classical propositional logic, and pure
intuitionistic predicate logic is a proper subsystem of pure classical
predicate logic. 

Philosophically,
 intuitionism
 differs from
 logicism
 by treating logic as a part of mathematics rather than as the
foundation of mathematics; from
 finitism
 by allowing constructive reasoning about uncountable structures
(e.g., monotone bar induction on the tree of potentially infinite
sequences of natural numbers); and from
 Platonism
 by viewing mathematical objects as mental constructs with no
independent ideal existence. Hilbert’s
 formalist program,
 to justify classical mathematics by reducing it to a formal system
whose consistency should be established by finitistic (hence
constructive) means, was the most powerful contemporary rival to
Brouwer’s developing intuitionism. In his 1912 essay
Intuitionism and Formalism Brouwer correctly predicted that
any attempt to prove the consistency of complete induction on the
natural numbers would lead to a vicious circle. 

Brouwer rejected
 formalism
per se but admitted the potential usefulness of formulating
general logical principles expressing intuitionistically correct
constructions, such as modus ponens. Formal systems for
intuitionistic propositional and predicate logic and arithmetic were
fully developed by Heyting [1930], Gentzen [1935] and Kleene [1952].
Gödel [1933] proved the equiconsistency of intuitionistic and
classical theories. Beth [1956] and Kripke [1965] provided semantics
with respect to which intuitionistic logic is correct and complete,
although the completeness proofs for intuitionistic predicate logic
require some classical reasoning. 
 
1. Rejection of Tertium Non Datur

Intuitionistic logic can be succinctly described as classical logic
without the Aristotelian law of excluded middle: 
A∨¬AA∨¬A(LEM)
\tag{LEM}
A \vee \neg A


or the classical law of double negation elimination: 
¬¬A→A¬¬A→A(DNE)
\tag{DNE}
\neg \neg A \rightarrow A


but with the law of contradiction: 
(A→B)→((A→¬B)→¬A)(A→B)→((A→¬B)→¬A)
(A \rightarrow B) \rightarrow
((A \rightarrow \neg B) \rightarrow \neg A)


and ex falso sequitur quodlibet: 
¬A→(A→B).¬A→(A→B).
\neg A \rightarrow (A \rightarrow B).


Brouwer [1908] observed that LEM was abstracted from finite
situations, then extended without justification to statements about
infinite collections. For example, let x,yx,yx, y range over the natural
numbers 0,1,2,…0,1,2,…0, 1, 2, \ldots and let B(y)B(y)B(y) abbreviate
(prime(y)&prime(y+2))(prime(y)&prime(y+2))(\primepred(y) \oldand \primepred(y+2)), where prime(y)prime(y)\primepred(y)
expresses “yyy is a prime number.” Then ∀y(B(y)∨¬B(y))∀y(B(y)∨¬B(y))\forall y
(B(y) \vee \neg B(y)) holds intuitionistically as well as
classically, because in order to determine whether or not a natural
number is prime we need only check whether or not it has a divisor
strictly between itself and 1. 

But if A(x)A(x)A(x) abbreviates ∃y(y>x&B(y))∃y(y>x&B(y))\exists y(y\gt x \oldand B(y)), then
in order to assert ∀x(A(x)∨¬A(x))∀x(A(x)∨¬A(x))\forall x (A(x) \vee \neg A(x))
intuitionistically we would need an effective (cf.
 the Church-Turing thesis)
 method to determine whether or not there is a pair of twin primes
larger than an arbitrary natural number xxx, and so far no such
method is known. An obvious semi-effective method is to list
the prime number pairs using a refinement of Eratosthenes’ sieve
(generating the natural numbers one by one and striking out every
number yyy which fails to satisfy B(y)B(y)B(y)), and if there is a pair
of twin primes larger than xxx this method will eventually find the
first one. However, ∀xA(x)∀xA(x)\forall x A(x) expresses the Twin Primes
Conjecture, which has not yet been proved or disproved, so in the
present state of our knowledge we can assert neither ∀x(A(x)∨¬A(x))∀x(A(x)∨¬A(x))\forall x (A(x)
\vee \neg A(x)) nor ∀xA(x)∨¬∀xA(x)∀xA(x)∨¬∀xA(x)\forall x A(x) \vee \neg \forall x A(x).

One may object that these examples depend on the fact that the Twin
Primes Conjecture has not yet been settled. A number of
Brouwer’s original “counterexamples” depended on
problems (such as Fermat’s Last Theorem) which have since been
solved. But to Brouwer the general LEM was equivalent to the a
priori assumption that every mathematical problem has a
solution—an assumption he rejected, anticipating
Gödel’s incompleteness theorem by a quarter of a century.


The rejection of LEM has far-reaching consequences. On the one hand,


Intuitionistically, reductio ad absurdum only proves
negative statements, since ¬¬A→A¬¬A→A\neg \neg A \rightarrow A does
not hold in general. (If it did, LEM would follow by modus
ponens from the intuitionistically provable ¬¬(A∨¬A)¬¬(A∨¬A)\neg \neg(A \vee
\neg A).)
Intuitionistic propositional logic does not have a finite
truth-table interpretation. There are infinitely many distinct
axiomatic systems between intuitionistic and classical logic.
Not every propositional formula has an intuitionistically
equivalent disjunctive or conjunctive normal form, built from prime
formulas and their negations using only ∨∨\vee and &&\oldand.
Not every predicate formula has an intuitionistically equivalent
prenex normal form, with all the quantifiers at the front.
While ∀x¬¬(A(x)∨¬A(x))∀x¬¬(A(x)∨¬A(x))\forall x \neg \neg(A(x) \vee \neg A(x)) is a theorem of
intuitionistic predicate logic, ¬¬∀x(A(x)∨¬A(x))¬¬∀x(A(x)∨¬A(x))\neg \neg \forall x(A(x) \vee \neg
A(x)) is not; so ¬∀x(A(x)∨¬A(x))¬∀x(A(x)∨¬A(x))\neg \forall x(A(x) \vee \neg A(x)) is
consistent with intuitionistic predicate logic.


On the other hand,

Every intuitionistic proof of a closed statement of the form A∨BA∨BA
\vee B can be effectively transformed into an intuitionistic proof
of AAA or an intuitionistic proof of BBB, and similarly for closed
existential statements.
Intuitionistic propositional logic is effectively decidable, in
the sense that a finite constructive process applies uniformly to
every propositional formula, either producing an intuitionistic proof
of the formula or demonstrating that no such proof can exist.
The negative fragment of intuitionistic logic (without ∨∨\vee or
∃∃\exists) contains a faithful translation of classical logic, and
similarly for intuitionistic and classical arithmetic.
Intuitionistic arithmetic can consistently be extended by axioms
which contradict classical arithmetic, enabling the formal study of
  recursive mathematics.
Brouwer’s controversial
  intuitionistic analysis,
 which conflicts with LEM, can be formalized and shown consistent
relative to a classically and intuitionistically correct
subtheory.

2. Intuitionistic First-Order Predicate Logic

Formalized intuitionistic logic is naturally motivated by the informal
Brouwer-Heyting-Kolmogorov explanation of intuitionistic truth,
outlined in the entries on
 intuitionism in the philosophy of mathematics
 and
 the development of intuitionistic logic.
 The constructive independence of the logical operations &,∨,→,¬,∀,∃&,∨,→,¬,∀,∃\oldand,
\vee , \rightarrow , \neg , \forall , \exists contrasts with the
classical situation, where e.g., A∨BA∨BA \vee B is equivalent to
¬(¬A&¬B)¬(¬A&¬B)\neg(\neg A \oldand \neg B), and ∃xA(x)∃xA(x)\exists xA(x) is equivalent
to ¬∀x¬A(x)¬∀x¬A(x)\neg \forall x \neg A(x). From the B-H-K viewpoint, a sentence
of the form A∨BA∨BA \vee B asserts that either a proof of AAA, or a
proof of BBB, has been constructed; while ¬(¬A&¬B)¬(¬A&¬B)\neg(\neg A \oldand \neg
B) asserts that an algorithm has been constructed which would
effectively convert any pair of constructions proving ¬A¬A\neg A and
¬B¬B\neg B respectively, into a proof of a known contradiction.
2.1 The formal systems H–IPCH–IPC\mathbf{H–IPC} and H–IQCH–IQC\mathbf{H–IQC}

Following is a Hilbert-style formalism H–IQCH–IQC\mathbf{H–IQC} from
Kleene [1952] (cf. Troelstra and van Dalen [1988]) for intuitionistic
first-order predicate logic. The language LLL of
H–IQCH–IQC\mathbf{H–IQC} has predicate letters P,Q(.),…P,Q(.),…P, Q(.), \ldots of
all arities and individual variables x,y,z,…x,y,z,…x, y, z, \ldots (with or
without subscripts 1,2,…1,2,…1, 2, \ldots), as well as symbols &,∨,→,¬,∀,∃&,∨,→,¬,∀,∃\oldand,
\vee , \rightarrow , \neg , \forall , \exists for the logical
connectives and quantifiers, and parentheses (, ). The atomic
(or prime) formulas of LLL are expressions such as
P,Q(x),R(x,y,x)P,Q(x),R(x,y,x)P, Q(x), R(x, y, x) where P,Q(.),R(...)P,Q(.),R(...)P, Q({.}), R({.}{.}{.}) are
000-ary, 111-ary and 333-ary predicate letters respectively;
that is, the result of filling each blank in a predicate letter by an
individual variable symbol is a prime formula. The (well-formed)
formulas of LLL are defined inductively as follows.

Each atomic formula is a formula.
If AAA and BBB are formulas, so are (A&B),(A∨B),(A→B)(A&B),(A∨B),(A→B)(A \oldand B),
(A \vee B), (A \rightarrow B) and ¬A¬A\neg A.
If AAA is a formula and xxx is a variable, then
∀xA∀xA\forall xA and ∃xA∃xA\exists xA are formulas.


In general, we use A,B,CA,B,CA, B, C as metavariables for well-formed
formulas and x,y,zx,y,zx, y, z as metavariables for individual variables.
Anticipating applications (for example to intuitionistic arithmetic)
we use s,ts,ts, t as metavariables for terms; in the case of
pure predicate logic, terms are simply individual variables. An
occurrence of a variable xxx in a formula AAA is bound if
it is within the scope of a quantifier ∀x∀x\forall x or ∃x∃x\exists x,
otherwise free. Intuitionistically as classically, (A↔B)(A↔B)(A
\leftrightarrow B) abbreviates ((A→B)&(B→A))((A→B)&(B→A))((A \rightarrow B) \oldand (B
\rightarrow A)), and parentheses will be omitted when this causes no
confusion.

There are three rules of inference:

Modus Ponens

From AAA and A→BA→BA \rightarrow B, conclude BBB. 

∀∀\forall-Introduction

From C→A(x)C→A(x)C \rightarrow A(x), where xxx is a variable which does not
occur free in CCC, conclude C→∀xA(x)C→∀xA(x)C \rightarrow \forall x A(x). 

∃∃\exists-Elimination

From A(x)→CA(x)→CA(x) \rightarrow C, where xxx is a variable which does not
occur free in CCC, conclude ∃xA(x)→C∃xA(x)→C\exists x A(x) \rightarrow C. 

The axioms are all formulas of the following forms, where in the last
two schemas the subformula A(t)A(t)A(t) is the result of substituting an
occurrence of the term ttt for every free occurrence of xxx in
A(x)A(x)A(x), and no variable free in ttt becomes bound in A(t)A(t)A(t) as a
result of the substitution.
A→(B→A)(A→B)→((A→(B→C))→(A→C))A→(B→(A&B))(A&B)→A(A&B)→BA→(A∨B)B→(A∨B)(A→C)→((B→C)→((A∨B)→C))(A→B)→((A→¬B)→¬A)¬A→(A→B)∀xA(x)→A(t)A(t)→∃xA(x)A→(B→A)(A→B)→((A→(B→C))→(A→C))A→(B→(A&B))(A&B)→A(A&B)→BA→(A∨B)B→(A∨B)(A→C)→((B→C)→((A∨B)→C))(A→B)→((A→¬B)→¬A)¬A→(A→B)∀xA(x)→A(t)A(t)→∃xA(x)\begin{array}{l}
A \rightarrow(B \rightarrow A) \\
(A \rightarrow B) \rightarrow
((A \rightarrow (B \rightarrow C)) \rightarrow(A \rightarrow C)) \\
A \rightarrow(B \rightarrow (A \oldand B)) \\
(A \oldand B) \rightarrow A \\
(A \oldand B) \rightarrow B \\
A \rightarrow (A \vee B) \\
B \rightarrow (A \vee B) \\
(A \rightarrow C) \rightarrow
((B \rightarrow C) \rightarrow((A \vee B) \rightarrow C))	\\
(A \rightarrow B) \rightarrow
((A \rightarrow \neg B) \rightarrow \neg A) \\
\neg A \rightarrow(A \rightarrow B) \\
\forall xA(x) \rightarrow A(t) \\
A(t) \rightarrow \exists xA(x)
\end{array}

A proof is any finite sequence of formulas, each of which is
an axiom or an immediate consequence, by a rule of inference, of (one
or two) preceding formulas of the sequence. Any proof is said to
prove its last formula, which is called a theorem or
provable formula of first-order intuitionistic predicate
logic. A derivation of a formula EEE from a
collection FFF of assumptions is any sequence of formulas,
each of which belongs to FFF or is an axiom or an immediate
consequence, by a rule of inference, of preceding formulas of the
sequence, such that EEE is the last formula of the sequence. If such
a derivation exists, we say EEE is derivable from FFF.


Intuitionistic propositional logic H–IPCH–IPC\mathbf{H–IPC} is the
subsystem of H–IQCH–IQC\mathbf{H–IQC} which results when the language
is restricted to formulas built from proposition letters P,Q,R,…P,Q,R,…P, Q,
R,\ldots using the propositional connectives &,∨,→&,∨,→\oldand, \vee ,
\rightarrow and ¬¬\neg, and only the propositional postulates are
used. Thus the last two rules of inference and the last two axiom
schemas are absent from the propositional subsystem. 

If, in the given list of axiom schemas for intuitionistic
propositional or first-order predicate logic, the law expressing
ex falso sequitur quodlibet:
¬A→(A→B)¬A→(A→B)\neg A \rightarrow (A \rightarrow B)

is replaced by the classical law of double negation elimination
DNE:
¬¬A→A¬¬A→A\neg \neg A \rightarrow A

(or, equivalently, if the intuitionistic law of negation
introduction:
(A→B)→((A→¬B)→¬A)(A→B)→((A→¬B)→¬A)
(A \rightarrow B) \rightarrow
((A \rightarrow \neg B) \rightarrow \neg A)


is replaced by LEM), a formal system H–CPCH–CPC\mathbf{H–CPC} for
classical propositional logic or H–CQCH–CQC\mathbf{H–CQC} for
classical predicate logic results. Since ex falso and the law
of contradiction are classical theorems, intuitionistic logic is
contained in classical logic. In a sense, classical logic is also
contained in intuitionistic logic; see Section 4.1 below.

It is important to note that while LEM and DNE are equivalent as
schemas over H–IPCH–IPC\mathbf{H–IPC}, the
implication
(¬¬A→A)→(A∨¬A)(¬¬A→A)→(A∨¬A)
(\neg \neg A \rightarrow A) \rightarrow (A \vee \neg A)


is not a theorem schema of H–IPCH–IPC\mathbf{H–IPC}. For theories
TT\mathbf{T} based on intuitionistic logic, if EEE is an arbitrary
formula of L(T)L(T)L(\mathbf{T}) then by definition:

EEE is decidable in TT\mathbf{T} if and only if
TT\mathbf{T} proves E∨¬EE∨¬EE \vee \neg E.

EEE is stable in TT\mathbf{T} if and only if
TT\mathbf{T} proves ¬¬E→E¬¬E→E\neg \neg E \rightarrow E.

EEE is testable in TT\mathbf{T} if and only if
TT\mathbf{T} proves ¬E∨¬¬E¬E∨¬¬E\neg E \vee \neg \neg E.

Decidability implies stability, but not conversely. The conjunction of
stability and testability is equivalent to decidability. Brouwer
himself proved that “absurdity of absurdity of absurdity is
equivalent to absurdity” (Brouwer [1923C]), so every formula of
the form ¬A¬A\neg A is stable; but in H–IPCH–IPC\mathbf{H–IPC} and
H–IQCH–IQC\mathbf{H–IQC} prime formulas and their negations are
undecidable, as shown in Section 5.1 below. 
2.2 Alternative formalisms, and the deduction theorem

The Hilbert-style system H–IQCH–IQC\mathbf{H–IQC} is useful for
metamathematical investigations of intuitionistic logic, but its
forced linearization of deductions and its preference for axioms over
rules make it an awkward instrument for establishing derivability. A
natural deduction system N–IQCN–IQC\mathbf{N–IQC} for intuitionistic
predicate logic results from the deductive system DD\mathbf{D},
presented in Section 3 of the entry on
 classical logic
 in this Encyclopedia, by omitting the symbol and rules for identity,
and replacing the classical rule (DNE) of double negation elimination
by the intuitionistic negation elimination rule expressing ex
falso: 

(INE) If FFF entails
AAA and FFF entails ¬A¬A\neg A, then FFF entails BBB.



The keys to proving that H–IQCH–IQC\mathbf{H–IQC} is equivalent to
N–IQCN–IQC\mathbf{N–IQC} are modus ponens and its converse,
the:

Deduction Theorem

If BBB is derivable from AAA and possibly other formulas FFF,
with all variables free in AAA held constant in the derivation (that
is, without using the second or third rule of inference on any
variable xxx occurring free in AAA, unless the assumption AAA
does not occur in the derivation before the inference in question),
then A→BA→BA \rightarrow B is derivable from FFF. 

This fundamental result, roughly expressing the rule (→I)(→I)(\rightarrow
I) of II\mathbf{I}, can be proved for H–IQCH–IQC\mathbf{H–IQC} by
induction on the definition of a derivation. The other rules of
II\mathbf{I} hold for H–IQCH–IQC\mathbf{H–IQC} essentially by
modus ponens, which corresponds to (→E)(→E)(\rightarrow E) in
N–IQCN–IQC\mathbf{N–IQC}; and all the axioms of
H–IQCH–IQC\mathbf{H–IQC} are provable in N–IQCN–IQC\mathbf{N–IQC}.

To illustrate the usefulness of the Deduction Theorem, consider the
(apparently trivial) theorem schema (A→A)(A→A)(A \rightarrow A). A correct
proof in H–IPCH–IPC\mathbf{H–IPC} takes five lines:

 1.  A→(A→A)A→(A→A)A \rightarrow (A
\rightarrow A) 
 2.  (A→(A→A))→((A→((A→A)→A))→(A→A))(A→(A→A))→((A→((A→A)→A))→(A→A))(A \rightarrow
(A \rightarrow A)) \rightarrow ((A \rightarrow ((A \rightarrow A)
\rightarrow A)) \rightarrow (A \rightarrow A)) 
 3.  (A→((A→A)→A))→(A→A)(A→((A→A)→A))→(A→A)(A \rightarrow
((A \rightarrow A) \rightarrow A)) \rightarrow(A \rightarrow A)
 
 4.  A→((A→A)→A)A→((A→A)→A)A \rightarrow((A
\rightarrow A) \rightarrow A) 
 5. A→AA→AA \rightarrow A



where 1, 2 and 4 are axioms and 3, 5 come from earlier lines by
modus ponens. However, AAA is derivable from AAA (as
assumption) in one obvious step, so the Deduction Theorem allows us to
conclude that a proof of A→AA→AA \rightarrow A exists. (In fact, the
formal proof of A→AA→AA \rightarrow A just presented is part of the
constructive proof of the Deduction Theorem!)

It is important to note that, in the definition of a derivation from
assumptions in H–IQCH–IQC\mathbf{H–IQC}, the assumption formulas are
treated as if all their free variables were universally quantified, so
that ∀xA(x)∀xA(x)\forall x A(x) is derivable from the hypothesis A(x)A(x)A(x).
However, the variable xxx will be varied (not held
constant) in that derivation, by use of the rule of
∀∀\forall-introduction; and so the Deduction Theorem cannot be used
to conclude (falsely) that A(x)→∀xA(x)A(x)→∀xA(x)A(x) \rightarrow \forall x A(x) (and
hence, by ∃∃\exists-elimination, ∃xA(x)→∀xA(x))∃xA(x)→∀xA(x))\exists x A(x) \rightarrow
\forall x A(x)) are provable in H–IQCH–IQC\mathbf{H–IQC}. As an
example of a correct use of the Deduction Theorem for predicate logic,
consider the implication ∃xA(x)→¬∀x¬A(x)∃xA(x)→¬∀x¬A(x)\exists x A(x) \rightarrow \neg \forall
x\neg A(x). To show this is provable in H–IQCH–IQC\mathbf{H–IQC}, we
first derive ¬∀x¬A(x)¬∀x¬A(x)\neg \forall x\neg A(x) from A(x)A(x)A(x) with all free
variables held constant:

1. ∀x¬A(x)→¬A(x)∀x¬A(x)→¬A(x)\forall x\neg A(x)
\rightarrow \neg A(x)
2.  A(x)→(∀x¬A(x)→A(x))A(x)→(∀x¬A(x)→A(x))A(x) \rightarrow
(\forall x\neg A(x) \rightarrow A(x))
3. A(x)A(x)A(x)
(assumption)
4. ∀x¬A(x)→A(x)∀x¬A(x)→A(x)\forall x\neg A(x)
\rightarrow A(x)
5. (∀x¬A(x)→A(x))→((∀x¬A(x)→¬A(x))→¬∀x¬A(x))(∀x¬A(x)→A(x))→((∀x¬A(x)→¬A(x))→¬∀x¬A(x))(\forall x\neg
A(x) \rightarrow A(x)) \rightarrow ((\forall x\neg A(x) \rightarrow
\neg A(x)) \rightarrow \neg \forall x\neg A(x))
6. (∀x¬A(x)→¬A(x))→¬∀x¬A(x)(∀x¬A(x)→¬A(x))→¬∀x¬A(x)(\forall x\neg
A(x) \rightarrow \neg A(x)) \rightarrow \neg \forall x\neg
A(x)
7. ¬∀x¬A(x)¬∀x¬A(x)\neg \forall x\neg
A(x)


Here 1, 2 and 5 are axioms; 4 comes from 2 and 3 by modus
ponens; and 6 and 7 come from earlier lines by modus
ponens; so no variables have been varied. The Deduction Theorem
tells us there is a proof PPP in H–IQCH–IQC\mathbf{H–IQC} of A(x)→¬∀A(x)→¬∀A(x)
\rightarrow \neg \forallx¬A(x)¬A(x)\neg A(x), and one application of
∃∃\exists-elimination converts PPP into a proof of
∃xA(x)→¬∀x¬A(x)∃xA(x)→¬∀x¬A(x)\exists x A(x) \rightarrow \neg \forall x\neg A(x). The converse
is not provable in H–IQCH–IQC\mathbf{H–IQC}, as shown in Section 5.1
below.

Other important alternatives to H–IQCH–IQC\mathbf{H–IQC} and
N–IQCN–IQC\mathbf{N–IQC} are the various sequent calculi for
intuitionistic propositional and predicate logic. The first such
calculus was defined by Gentzen [1934–5], cf. Kleene [1952].
Sequent systems, which prove exactly the same formulas as
H–IQCH–IQC\mathbf{H–IQC} and N–IQCN–IQC\mathbf{N–IQC}, keep track
explicitly of all assumptions and conclusions at each step of a proof,
replacing modus ponens (which eliminates an intermediate
formula) by a cut rule (which can be shown to be an
admissible rule (cf. Section 4.2) for the subsystem remaining when it
is omitted).

When the details of the formalism are not important, from now on we
follow Troelstra and van Dalen [1988] in letting
“IQCIQC\mathbf{IQC}” or “IPCIPC\mathbf{IPC}” refer
to any formal system for intuitionistic predicate or propositional
logic respectively, and similarly “CQCCQC\mathbf{CQC}” and
“CPCCPC\mathbf{CPC}” for classical predicate and
propositional logic.

Both IPCIPC\mathbf{IPC} and IQCIQC\mathbf{IQC} satisfy interpolation
theorems, e.g.: If AAA and BBB are propositional formulas
having at least one proposition letter in common, and if A→BA→BA
\rightarrow B is provable in IPCIPC\mathbf{IPC}, then there is a
formula CCC, containing only proposition letters which occur in both
AAA and BBB, such that both A→CA→CA \rightarrow C and C→BC→BC
\rightarrow B are provable. These topics are treated in Kleene
[1952] and Troelstra and Schwichtenberg [2000].

While identity can of course be added to intuitionistic logic, for
applications (e.g., to arithmetic) the equality symbol is generally
treated as a distinguished predicate constant satisfying the axioms
for an equivalence relation (reflexivity, symmetry and transitivity)
and additional nonlogical axioms (e.g., the primitive recursive
definitions of addition and multiplication). Identity is decidable,
intuitionistically as well as classically, but intuitionistic
extensional equality is not always decidable; see the discussion of
Brouwer’s continuity axioms in Section 3 of the entry on
 intuitionism in the philosophy of mathematics.
3. Intuitionistic Number Theory (Heyting Arithmetic) HAHA\mathbf{HA}

Intuitionistic (Heyting) arithmetic HAHA\mathbf{HA} and classical
(Peano) arithmetic PAPA\mathbf{PA} share the same first-order language
and the same non-logical axioms; only the logic is different. In
addition to the logical connectives, quantifiers and parentheses and
the individual variables x,y,z,…x,y,z,…x, y, z,\ldots (also used as
metavariables), the language L(HA)L(HA)L(\mathbf{HA}) of arithmetic has a
binary predicate symbol ===, individual constant 000, unary
function constant SSS, and finitely or countably infinitely many
additional constants for primitive recursive functions including
addition and multiplication; the precise choice is a matter of taste
and convenience. Terms are built from variables and 000
using the function constants; in particular, each natural number nnn
is expressed in the language by the numeral nn\mathbf{n}
obtained by applying SSS nnn times to 000 (e.g., S(S(0))S(S(0))S(S(0)) is
the numeral for 222). Prime formulas are of the form (s=t)(s=t)(s =
t) where s,ts,ts, t are terms, and compound formulas are
obtained from these as usual. 

The logical axioms and rules of HAHA\mathbf{HA} are those of
first-order intuitionistic predicate logic IQCIQC\mathbf{IQC}. The
nonlogical axioms include the reflexive, symmetric and transitive
properties of ===: 

∀x(x=x),∀x(x=x),
\forall x (x = x),
∀x∀y(x=y→y=x),∀x∀y(x=y→y=x),
\forall x \forall y (x = y \rightarrow y = x),
∀x∀y∀z((x=y&y=z)→x=z);∀x∀y∀z((x=y&y=z)→x=z);
\forall x \forall y \forall z ((x = y \oldand y = z) \rightarrow x = z); 

 the axiom
characterizing 000 as the least natural number: 

∀x¬(S(x)=0),∀x¬(S(x)=0),
\forall x\neg(S(x) = 0),

the axiom characterizing SSS as a one-to-one function:
∀x∀y(S(x)=S(y)→x=y),∀x∀y(S(x)=S(y)→x=y),
\forall x\forall y(S(x) = S(y) \rightarrow x = y),

the extensional equality axiom for SSS:

the primitive recursive defining equations for each function constant,
in particular for addition: 

∀x(x+0=x),∀x(x+0=x),
\forall x (x + 0 = x),
∀x∀y(x+S(y)=S(x+y));∀x∀y(x+S(y)=S(x+y));
\forall x \forall y (x + S(y) = S(x + y));

 and
multiplication: 

∀x(x⋅0=0),∀x(x⋅0=0),
\forall x (x \cdot 0 = 0),
∀x∀y(x⋅S(y)=(x⋅y)+x);∀x∀y(x⋅S(y)=(x⋅y)+x);
\forall x \forall y (x \cdot S(y) = (x \cdot y) + x); 

 and the (universal closure
of the) schema of mathematical induction, for arbitrary formulas
A(x)A(x)A(x):  

(A(0)&∀x(A(x)→A(S(x))))→∀xA(x).(A(0)&∀x(A(x)→A(S(x))))→∀xA(x).
( A(0) \oldand \forall x (A(x) \rightarrow A(S(x))) ) \rightarrow \forall x A(x).

Extensional equality axioms for all function constants are derivable
by mathematical induction from the equality axiom for SSS and the
primitive recursive function axioms. 

The natural order relation x<yx<yx \lt y can be defined in
HAHA\mathbf{HA} by ∃z(S(z)+x=y)∃z(S(z)+x=y)\exists z(S(z) + x = y), or by the
quantifier-free formula S(x)˙−y=0S(x)−˙y=0S(x) \dot{-} y = 0 if the symbol and
primitive recursive defining equations for predecessor : 

Pd(0)=0,Pd(0)=0,
Pd(0) = 0,
∀x(Pd(S(x))=x)∀x(Pd(S(x))=x)
\forall x (Pd(S(x)) = x)

 and cutoff subtraction : 

∀x(x˙−0=0),∀x(x−˙0=0),
\forall x (x \dot{-} 0 = 0),
∀x(x˙−S(y)=Pd(x˙−y))∀x(x−˙S(y)=Pd(x−˙y))
\forall x (x \dot{-} S(y) = Pd(x \dot{-} y))

 are
present in the formalism. HAHA\mathbf{HA} proves the comparative
law 

∀x∀y(x<y∨x=y∨y<x)∀x∀y(x<y∨x=y∨y<x)\forall x \forall y (x \lt y \vee x = y \vee y \lt x)

and an intuitionistic form of the least number principle, for
arbitrary formulas A(x)A(x)A(x):
∀x[∀y(y<x→(A(y)∨¬A(y)))→(∃y((y<x&A(y))&∀z(z<y→¬A(z)))∨∀y(y<x→¬A(y)))].∀x[∀y(y<x→(A(y)∨¬A(y)))→(∃y((y<x&A(y))&∀z(z<y→¬A(z)))∨∀y(y<x→¬A(y)))].
\forall x[\forall y (y \lt x \rightarrow (A(y) \vee \neg A(y))) \rightarrow  \\
(\exists y ((y \lt x \oldand A(y)) \oldand \forall z(z \lt y \rightarrow \neg A(z))) \vee \\
\forall y(y \lt x \rightarrow \neg A(y)))].


The hypothesis is needed because not all arithmetical formulas are
decidable in HAHA\mathbf{HA}. However, ∀x∀y(x=y∨¬(x=y))∀x∀y(x=y∨¬(x=y))\forall x\forall y(x = y \vee
\neg(x = y)) can be proved directly by mathematical induction, and
so 

Prime formulas (and hence all quantifier-free formulas) are
decidable and stable in HAHA\mathbf{HA}.

If A(x)A(x)A(x) is decidable in HAHA\mathbf{HA}, then by induction on
xxx so are ∀y(y<x→A(y))∀y(y<x→A(y))\forall y (y \lt x \rightarrow A(y)) and ∃y(y<x&A(y))∃y(y<x&A(y))\exists y
(y \lt x \oldand A(y)). Hence

Formulas in which all quantifiers are bounded are decidable
and stable in HAHA\mathbf{HA}.

The collection Δ0Δ0\Delta_0 of arithmetical formulas in which all
quantifiers are bounded is the lowest level of a classical
arithmetical hierarchy based on the pattern of alternations of
quantifiers in a prenex formula. In HAHA\mathbf{HA} not every formula
has a prenex form, but Burr [2004] discovered a simple intuitionistic
arithmetical hierarchy corresponding level by level to the classical.
For the purposes of the next two definitions only, ∀x∀x\forall x
denotes a block of finitely many universal number quantifiers, and
similarly ∃x∃x\exists x denotes a block of finitely many existential
number quantifiers. With these conventions, Burr’s classes
ΦnΦn\Phi_n and ΨnΨn\Psi_n are defined by:

Φ0=Ψ0=Δ0Φ0=Ψ0=Δ0\Phi_0 = \Psi_0 = \Delta_0,
Φ1Φ1\Phi_1 is the class of all formulas of the form ∀xA(x)∀xA(x)\forall x
A(x) where A(x)A(x)A(x) is in Ψ0Ψ0\Psi_0. For n≥2n≥2n \ge 2, ΦnΦn\Phi_n is
the class of all formulas of the form ∀x[A(x)→∃yB(x,y)]∀x[A(x)→∃yB(x,y)]\forall x [A(x) \rightarrow
\exists y B(x,y)] where A(x)A(x)A(x) is in Φn−1Φn−1\Phi_{n-1} and B(x,y)B(x,y)B(x,y)
is in Φn−2Φn−2\Phi_{n-2},
Ψ1Ψ1\Psi_1 is the class of all formulas of the form ∃xA(x)∃xA(x)\exists x
A(x) where A(x)A(x)A(x) is in Φ0Φ0\Phi_0. For n≥2n≥2n \ge 2, ΨnΨn\Psi_n is
the class of all formulas of the form A→BA→BA \rightarrow B where AAA
is in ΦnΦn\Phi_n and BBB is in Φn−1Φn−1\Phi_{n-1}.


The corresponding classical prenex classes are defined more simply:


Π0=Σ0=Δ0Π0=Σ0=Δ0\Pi_0 = \Sigma_0 = \Delta_0, 
Πn+1Πn+1\Pi_{n +1} is the class of all formulas of the form ∀xA(x)∀xA(x)\forall
x A(x) where A(x)A(x)A(x) is in ΣnΣn\Sigma_n,
Σn+1Σn+1\Sigma_{n +1} is the class of all formulas of the form
∃xA(x)∃xA(x)\exists x A(x) where A(x)A(x)A(x) is in ΠnΠn\Pi_n. 


Peano arithmetic PAPA\mathbf{PA} comes from Heyting arithmetic
HAHA\mathbf{HA} by adding LEM or ¬¬A→A¬¬A→A\neg \neg A \rightarrow A to the
list of logical axioms, i.e., by using classical instead of
intuitionistic logic. The following results hold even in the fragments
of HAHA\mathbf{HA} and PAPA\mathbf{PA} with the induction schema
restricted to Δ0Δ0\Delta_0 formulas.

Burr’s Theorem:

 Every arithmetical formula is provably equivalent in
HAHA\mathbf{HA} to a formula in one of the classes ΦnΦn\Phi_n.
 Every formula in ΦnΦn\Phi_n is provably equivalent in
PAPA\mathbf{PA} to a formula in ΠnΠn\Pi_n, and conversely.
 Every formula in ΨnΨn\Psi_n is provably equivalent in
PAPA\mathbf{PA} to a formula in ΣnΣn\Sigma_n, and conversely.



HAHA\mathbf{HA} and PAPA\mathbf{PA} are proof-theoretically
equivalent, as will be shown in Section 4. Each is capable of
(numeralwise) expressing its own proof predicate. By
Gödel’s famous Incompleteness Theorem, if HAHA\mathbf{HA}
is consistent then neither HAHA\mathbf{HA} nor PAPA\mathbf{PA} can
prove its own consistency. 
4. Basic Proof Theory
4.1 Translating classical into intuitionistic logic

A fundamental fact about intuitionistic logic is that it has the same
consistency strength as classical logic. For propositional logic this
was first proved by Glivenko [1929]. 

Glivenko’s Theorem

An arbitrary propositional formula AAA is classically provable, if
and only if ¬¬A¬¬A\neg \neg A is intuitionistically provable.

Glivenko’s Theorem does not extend to predicate logic, although
an arbitrary predicate formula AAA is classically provable if and
only if ¬¬A¬¬A\neg \neg A is provable in intuitionistic predicate logic
plus the “double negation shift” schema.
∀x¬¬B(x)→¬¬∀xB(x)∀x¬¬B(x)→¬¬∀xB(x)(DNS)
\tag{DNS}
\forall x\neg \neg B(x) \rightarrow \neg \neg \forall x B(x)


The more sophisticated negative translation of
classical into intuitionistic theories, due independently to
Gödel and Gentzen, associates with each formula AAA of the
language LLL another formula g(A)g(A)g(A) (with no ∨∨\vee or
∃)∃)\exists), such that

(I) Classical predicate
logic proves A↔g(A)A↔g(A)A \leftrightarrow g(A). 
(II) Intuitionistic
predicate logic proves g(A)↔¬¬g(A)g(A)↔¬¬g(A)g(A) \leftrightarrow \neg \neg g(A).

(III) If classical
predicate logic proves AAA, then intuitionistic predicate logic
proves g(A)g(A)g(A). 


The proofs are straightforward from the following inductive definition
of g(A)g(A)g(A) (using Gentzen’s direct translation of implication,
rather than Gödel’s in terms of ¬¬\neg and
&&\oldand):
g(P) is ¬¬P, if P is prime.g(A&B) is g(A)&g(B).g(A∨B) is ¬(¬g(A)&¬g(B)).g(A→B) is g(A)→g(B).g(¬A) is ¬g(A).g(∀xA(x)) is ∀xg(A(x)).g(∃xA(x)) is ¬∀x¬g(A(x)).g(P)g(A&B)g(A∨B)g(A→B)g(¬A)g(∀xA(x))g(∃xA(x)) is ¬¬P, if P is prime. is g(A)&g(B). is ¬(¬g(A)&¬g(B)). is g(A)→g(B). is ¬g(A). is ∀xg(A(x)). is ¬∀x¬g(A(x)).\begin{align*}
  g(P) &amp;\text{ is } \neg \neg P, \text{ if } P \text{ is prime}.\\
g(A \oldand B) &amp;\text{ is } g(A) \oldand g(B). \\
g(A \vee B) &amp;\text{ is } \neg(\neg g(A) \oldand \neg g(B)). \\
g(A \rightarrow B) &amp;\text{ is } g(A) \rightarrow g(B). \\
g(\neg A) &amp;\text{ is } \neg g(A). \\
g(\forall xA(x)) &amp;\text{ is }\forall x g(A(x)). \\
g(\exists xA(x)) &amp;\text{ is } \neg \forall x\neg g(A(x)).
\end{align*}

For each formula AAA, g(A)g(A)g(A) is provable intuitionistically if and
only if AAA is provable classically. In particular, if B&¬BB&¬BB \oldand
\neg B were classically provable for some formula BBB, then g(B)&¬g(B)g(B)&¬g(B)g(B)
\oldand \neg g(B) (which is g(B&¬B))g(B&¬B))g(B \oldand \neg B)) would in turn
be provable intuitionistically. Hence

(IV) Classical and
intuitionistic predicate logic are equiconsistent. 


The negative translation of classical into intuitionistic number
theory is even simpler, since prime formulas of intuitionistic
arithmetic are stable. Thus g(s=t)g(s=t)g(s=t) can be taken to be s=ts=ts=t, and
the other clauses are unchanged. The negative translation of any
instance of mathematical induction is another instance of mathematical
induction, and the other nonlogical axioms of arithmetic are their own
negative translations, so

 (I), (II), (III) and
(IV) hold also for number theory. 


Gödel [1933e] interpreted these results as showing that
intuitionistic logic and arithmetic are richer than classical
logic and arithmetic, because the intuitionistic theory distinguishes
formulas which are classically equivalent, and has the same
 consistency strength
 as the classical theory. In particular, Gödel’s
incompleteness theorems apply to HAHA\mathbf{HA} as well as to
PAPA\mathbf{PA}.

Direct attempts to extend the negative interpretation to analysis fail
because the negative translation of the countable axiom of choice is
not a theorem of intuitionistic analysis. However, it is consistent
with intuitionistic analysis, including Brouwer’s controversial
continuity principle, by the functional version of Kleene’s
recursive realizability (cf. Section 6.2 below). It follows that
intuitionistic mathematics, which can only be expressed by using all
the standard logical connectives and quantifiers, is consistent with a
faithful translation of classical mathematics avoiding ∨∨\vee and
∃∃\exists.

This is important because Brouwer’s intuitionistic analysis is
inconsistent with LEM. However, if AAA is any negative
formula (without ∨∨\vee or ∃∃\exists) then ¬¬A→A¬¬A→A\neg \neg A
\rightarrow A is provable using intuitionistic logic. A
reconciliation of intuitionistic and classical analysis along these
lines, inspired by Kripke’s notion of choice sequence, is
suggested in Moschovakis [2017].
4.2 Admissible rules of intuitionistic logic and arithmetic

Gödel [1932] observed that intuitionistic propositional logic has
the disjunction property:

  (DP)   If A∨BA∨BA \vee
B is a theorem, then AAA is a theorem or BBB is a theorem.
 


Gentzen [1935] established the disjunction property for closed
formulas of intuitionistic predicate logic. From this it follows that
if intuitionistic logic is consistent, then P∨¬PP∨¬PP \vee \neg P is not a
theorem if PPP is an atomic formula. Kleene [1945, 1952] proved that
intuitionistic first-order number theory also has the related (cf.
Friedman [1975]) existence property:

  (EP)   If ∃xA(x)∃xA(x)\exists x
A(x) is a closed theorem, then for some closed term ttt, A(t)A(t)A(t)
is a theorem.  


The disjunction and existence properties are special cases of a
general phenomenon peculiar to nonclassical theories. The
admissible rules of a theory are the rules under which the
theory is closed. For example, Harrop [1960] observed that the rule


If ¬A→(B∨C)¬A→(B∨C)\neg A \rightarrow (B \vee C) is a theorem, so is (¬A→B)∨(¬A→C)(¬A→B)∨(¬A→C)(\neg A
\rightarrow B) \vee(\neg A \rightarrow C) 

is admissible for intuitionistic propositional logic IPCIPC\mathbf{IPC}
because if AAA, BBB and CCC are any formulas such that ¬A→(B∨C)¬A→(B∨C)\neg A
\rightarrow(B \vee C) is provable in IPCIPC\mathbf{IPC}, then also
(¬A→B)∨(¬A→C)(¬A→B)∨(¬A→C)(\neg A \rightarrow B) \vee(\neg A \rightarrow C) is provable in
IPCIPC\mathbf{IPC}. Harrop’s rule is not derivable in
IPCIPC\mathbf{IPC} because (¬A→(B∨C))→(¬A→B)∨(¬A→C)(¬A→(B∨C))→(¬A→B)∨(¬A→C)(\neg A \rightarrow(B \vee C)) \rightarrow
(\neg A \rightarrow B) \vee (\neg A \rightarrow C) is not
intuitionistically provable. Another important example of an
admissible nonderivable rule of IPCIPC\mathbf{IPC} is Mints’s
rule: 

If (A→B)→(A∨C)(A→B)→(A∨C)(A \rightarrow B) \rightarrow (A \vee C) is a theorem, so is
((A→B)→A)∨((A→B)→C)((A→B)→A)∨((A→B)→C)((A \rightarrow B) \rightarrow A) \vee ((A \rightarrow B)
\rightarrow C). 

The two-valued truth table interpretation of classical propositional
logic CPCCPC\mathbf{CPC} gives rise to a simple proof that every
admissible rule of CPCCPC\mathbf{CPC} is derivable: otherwise, some
assignment to AAA, BBB, etc. would make the hypothesis true and
the conclusion false, and by substituting e.g. P→PP→PP \rightarrow P for
the letters assigned “true” and P&¬PP&¬PP \oldand \neg P for
those assigned “false” one would have a provable
hypothesis and unprovable conclusion. The fact that the intuitionistic
situation is more interesting leads to many natural questions, some of
which have recently been answered.

By generalizing Mints’s Rule, Visser and de Jongh identified a
recursively enumerable sequence of successively stronger admissible
rules (“Visser’s rules”) which, they conjectured,
formed a basis for the admissible rules of IPCIPC\mathbf{IPC}
in the sense that every admissible rule is derivable from the
disjunction property and one of the rules of the sequence. Building on
work of Ghilardi [1999], Iemhoff [2001] succeeded in proving their
conjecture. Rybakov [1997] proved that the collection of all
admissible rules of IPCIPC\mathbf{IPC} is decidable but has no finite
basis. Visser [2002] showed that his rules are also the admissible
propositional rules of HAHA\mathbf{HA}, and of HAHA\mathbf{HA}
extended by Markov’s Principle MP (defined in Section 5.2
below). More recently, Jerabek [2008] found an independent basis for
the admissible rules of IPCIPC\mathbf{IPC}, with the property that no
rule in the basis derives another.

Much less is known about the admissible rules of intuitionistic
predicate logic. Pure IQCIQC\mathbf{IQC}, without individual or
predicate constants, has the following remarkable admissible rule for
A(x)A(x)A(x) with no variables free but xxx:

If ∃xA(x)∃xA(x)\exists x A(x) is a theorem, so is ∀xA(x)∀xA(x)\forall x A(x). 

Not every admissible predicate rule of IQCIQC\mathbf{IQC} is admissible
for all formal systems based on IQCIQC\mathbf{IQC}; for example,
HAHA\mathbf{HA} evidently violates the rule just stated. Visser proved
in [1999] that the property of being an admissible predicate rule of
HAHA\mathbf{HA} is Π2Π2\Pi_2 complete, and in [2002] that
HAHA\mathbf{HA} +++ MP has the same predicate admissible rules as
HAHA\mathbf{HA}. Plisko [1992] proved that the predicate
logic of HAHA\mathbf{HA} +++ MP (the set of sentences in the
language of IQCIQC\mathbf{IQC} all of whose uniform substitution
instances in the language of arithmetic are provable in
HAHA\mathbf{HA} +++ MP) is Π2Π2\Pi_2 complete; Visser [2006]
extended this result to some constructively interesting consistent
extensions of HAHA\mathbf{HA} which are not contained in
PAPA\mathbf{PA}.

While they have not been completely classified, the admissible rules
of intuitionistic predicate logic are known to include
Markov’s Rule for decidable predicates:

If ∀x(A(x)∨¬A(x))&¬∀x¬A(x)∀x(A(x)∨¬A(x))&¬∀x¬A(x)\forall x(A(x) \vee \neg A(x)) \oldand \neg \forall x\neg A(x)
is a theorem, so is ∃xA(x)∃xA(x)\exists x A(x). 

and the following Independence-of-Premise Rule (where
yyy is assumed not to occur free in A(x))A(x))A(x)):

If ∀x(A(x)∨¬A(x))&(∀xA(x)→∃yB(y))∀x(A(x)∨¬A(x))&(∀xA(x)→∃yB(y))\forall x(A(x) \vee \neg A(x)) \oldand (\forall x A(x)
\rightarrow \exists y B(y)) is a theorem, so is ∃y(∀xA(x)→B(y))∃y(∀xA(x)→B(y))\exists y (\forall
x A(x) \rightarrow B(y)). 

Both rules are also admissible for HAHA\mathbf{HA}. The corresponding
implications (MP and IP respectively), which are not provable
intuitionistically, are verified by Gödel’s
“Dialectica” interpretation of HAHA\mathbf{HA} (cf.
Section 6.3 below). So is the implication (CT) corresponding to one of
the most interesting admissible rules of Heyting arithmetic, let us
call it the Church-Kleene Rule: 

If ∀x∃yA(x,y)∀x∃yA(x,y)\forall x \exists y A(x, y) is a closed theorem of
HAHA\mathbf{HA} then there is a number nnn such that, provably in
HAHA\mathbf{HA}, the partial recursive function with Gödel number
nnn is total and maps each xxx to a yyy satisfying A(x,y)A(x,y)A(x, y)
(and moreover A(x,y)A(x,y)A(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}) is provable, where
xx\mathbf{x} is the numeral for the natural number xxx and
yy\mathbf{y} is the numeral for y)y)y). 

Combining Markov’s Rule with the negative translation gives the
result that classical and intuitionistic arithmetic prove the same
formulas of the form ∀x∃yA(x,y)∀x∃yA(x,y)\forall x \exists y A(x, y) where A(x,y)A(x,y)A(x, y)
is quantifier-free. In general, if A(x,y)A(x,y)A(x, y) is provably decidable
in HAHA\mathbf{HA} and if ∀x∃yA(x,y)∀x∃yA(x,y)\forall x \exists y A(x, y) is a closed
theorem of classical arithmetic PAPA\mathbf{PA}, the
conclusion of the Church-Kleene Rule holds even in
intuitionistic arithmetic. For if HAHA\mathbf{HA} proves
∀x∀y(A(x,y)∨¬A(x,y))∀x∀y(A(x,y)∨¬A(x,y))\forall x \forall y (A(x,y) \vee \neg A(x,y)) then by the
Church-Kleene Rule the characteristic function of A(x,y)A(x,y)A(x,y) has a
Gödel number mmm, provably in HAHA\mathbf{HA}; so
HAHA\mathbf{HA} proves ∀x∃yA(x,y)↔∀x∃y∃zB(m,x,y,z)∀x∃yA(x,y)↔∀x∃y∃zB(m,x,y,z)\forall x \exists y A(x,y) \leftrightarrow
\forall x \exists y \exists z B(\mathbf{m},x,y,z) where BBB is
quantifier-free, and the adjacent existential quantifiers can be
contracted in HAHA\mathbf{HA}. It follows that HAHA\mathbf{HA} and
PAPA\mathbf{PA} have the same provably recursive functions.

Here is a proof that the rule “If ∀x(A∨B(x))∀x(A∨B(x))\forall x (A \vee B(x)) is
a theorem, so is A∨∀xB(x)A∨∀xB(x)A \vee \forall x B(x)” (where xxx is not
free in A)A)A) is not admissible for HAHA\mathbf{HA}, if
HAHA\mathbf{HA} is consistent. Gödel numbering provides a
quantifier-free formula G(x)G(x)G(x) which (numeralwise) expresses the
predicate “xxx is the code of a proof in HAHA\mathbf{HA} of
(0=1)(0=1)(0 = 1).” By intuitionistic logic with the decidability of
quantifier-free arithmetical formulas, HAHA\mathbf{HA} proves
∀x(∃yG(y)∨¬G(x))∀x(∃yG(y)∨¬G(x))\forall x(\exists y G(y) \vee \neg G(x)). However, if
HAHA\mathbf{HA} proved ∃yG(y)∨∀x¬G(x)∃yG(y)∨∀x¬G(x)\exists yG(y) \vee \forall x\neg G(x) then
by the disjunction property, HAHA\mathbf{HA} must prove either
∃yG(y)∃yG(y)\exists yG(y) or ∀x¬G(x)∀x¬G(x)\forall x\neg G(x). The first case is
impossible, by the existence property with the consistency assumption
and the fact that HAHA\mathbf{HA} proves all true quantifier-free
sentences. But the second case is also impossible, by
Gödel’s second incompleteness theorem, since ∀x¬G(x)∀x¬G(x)\forall
x\neg G(x) expresses the consistency of HAHA\mathbf{HA}.
5. Basic Semantics

Intuitionistic systems have inspired a variety of interpretations,
including Beth’s tableaux, Rasiowa and Sikorski’s
topological models, Heyting algebras, formulas-as-types,
Kleene’s recursive realizabilities, the Kleene and Aczel
slashes, and models based on sheafs and topoi. Of all these
interpretations Kripke’s [1965] possible-world semantics, with
respect to which intuitionistic predicate logic is complete and
consistent, most resembles classical model theory. Recursive
realizability interpretations, on the other hand, attempt to
effectively implement the B-H-K explanation of intuitionistic
truth.
5.1 Kripke semantics for intuitionistic logic

A Kripke structure KK\mathbf{K} for LLL consists of a
partially ordered set KKK of nodes and a domain
function D assigning to each node kkk in KKK an inhabited set
D(k)D(k)D(k), such that if k≤k′k \le k', then D(k)⊆D(k′)D(k) \subseteq D(k'). In
addition K\mathbf{K} has a forcing relation determined as
follows.

For each node kk let L(k)L(k) be the language extending LL by
new constants for all the elements of D(k)D(k). To each node kk and
each 00-ary predicate letter (each proposition letter) PP,
either assign f(P,k)=f(P, k) = true or leave f(P,k)f(P, k)
undefined, consistent with the requirement that if k≤k′k \le k' and
f(P,k)=f(P, k) = true then f(P,k′)=f(P, k') = true also.
Say that

kk ⊨\vDash PP if and only if f(P,k)=f(P, k) = true.


To each node kk and each (n+1)(n+1)-ary predicate letter
Q(…)Q(\ldots), assign a (possibly empty) set T(Q,k)T(Q, k) of
(n+1)(n+1)-tuples of elements of D(k)D(k) in such a way that if k≤k′k \le
k' then T(Q,k)⊆T(Q,k′)T(Q, k) \subseteq T(Q, k'). Say that 

kk ⊨\vDash Q(d0,…,dn)Q(d_0 ,\ldots, d_n) if and only if (d0,…,dn)∈T(Q,k)(d_0 ,\ldots
,d_n) \in T(Q, k). 

Now define kk ⊨\vDash EE (which may be read “ kk
forces EE ”) for compound sentences EE of
L(k)L(k) inductively as follows: 


kk ⊨\vDash (A&B)(A \oldand B)
if kk ⊨\vDash AA and kk ⊨\vDash BB. 

kk ⊨\vDash (A∨B)(A \vee B)
if kk ⊨\vDash AA or kk ⊨\vDash BB. 

kk ⊨\vDash (A→B)(A \rightarrow B)
if, for every k′≥kk' \ge k, if k′k' ⊨\vDash AA then
k′k' ⊨\vDash BB. 

kk ⊨\vDash ¬A\neg A
if for no k′≥kk' \ge k does k′k' ⊨\vDash AA. 

kk ⊨\vDash ∀xA(x)\forall x A(x)
if for every k′≥kk' \ge k and every d∈D(k′)d \in D(k'), k′k'
⊨\vDash A(d)A(d). 

kk ⊨\vDash ∃xA(x)\exists x A(x)
if for some d∈D(k)d \in D(k), kk ⊨\vDash A(d)A(d).



Any such forcing relation is consistent:

For no sentence AA and no kk is it the case that both kk
⊨\vDash AA and kk ⊨\vDash ¬A\neg A.

and monotone:

If k≤k′k \le k' and kk ⊨\vDash AA then k′k' ⊨\vDash
AA.

Kripke’s Soundness and Completeness Theorems
establish that a sentence of LL is provable in intuitionistic
predicate logic if and only if it is forced by every node of every
Kripke structure. Thus to show that ¬∀x¬P(x)→∃xP(x)\neg \forall x \neg P(x)
\rightarrow \exists x P(x) is intuitionistically unprovable, it is
enough to consider a Kripke structure with K={k,k′},K = \{k, k'\}, k<k′,k \lt
k', D(k)=D(k′)={0}D(k) = D(k') = \{0\}, T(P,k)T(P, k) empty but T(P,k′)={0}T(P, k') =
\{0\}.  And to show the converse is intuitionistically provable
(without actually exhibiting a proof), one only needs the consistency
and monotonicity properties of arbitrary Kripke models, with the
definition of ⊨\vDash.

Kripke models for languages with equality may interpret == at each
node by an arbitrary equivalence relation, subject to monotonicity.
For applications to intuitionistic arithmetic, normal models
(those in which equality is interpreted by identity at each node)
suffice because equality of natural numbers is decidable.

Propositional Kripke semantics is particularly simple, since an
arbitrary propositional formula is intuitionistically provable if and
only if it is forced by the root of every Kripke model whose
frame (the set KK of nodes together with their partial
ordering) is a finite tree with a least element (the root).
For example, the Kripke model with K={k,k′,k″},k<k′K = \{k, k', k''\}, k \lt k'
and k<k″k \lt k'', and with PP true only at k′k', shows that both
P∨¬PP \vee \neg P and ¬P∨¬¬P\neg P \vee \neg \neg P are unprovable in
IPC\mathbf{IPC}.

Each terminal node or leaf of a Kripke model is a classical
model, because a leaf forces every formula or its negation. Only those
proposition letters which occur in a formula EE, and only those
nodes k′k' such that k≤k′k\le k', are relevant to deciding whether
or not kk forces EE. Such considerations allow us to associate
effectively with each formula EE of L(IPC)L(\mathbf{IPC}) a finite
class of finite Kripke structures which will include a countermodel to
EE if one exists. Since the class of all theorems of
IPC\mathbf{IPC} is recursively enumerable, we conclude that

IPC\mathbf{IPC} is effectively decidable. There is a recursive
procedure which determines, for each propositional formula EE,
whether or not EE is a theorem of IPC\mathbf{IPC}, concluding with
either a proof of EE or a (finite) Kripke countermodel. 

The decidability of IPC\mathbf{IPC} was first obtained by Gentzen in
1935. The undecidability of IQC\mathbf{IQC} follows from the
undecidability of CQC\mathbf{CQC} by the negative interpretation.

Familiar non-intuitionistic logical schemata correspond to structural
properties of Kripke models, for example

DNS holds in every Kripke model with finite frame.
(A→B)∨(B→A)(A \rightarrow B) \vee (B \rightarrow A) holds in every Kripke
model with linearly ordered frame. Conversely, every propositional
formula which is not derivable in IPC+(A→B)∨(B→A)\mathbf{IPC} + (A \rightarrow B)
\vee (B \rightarrow A) has a Kripke countermodel with linearly
ordered frame (cf. Section 6.1 below).
If xx is not free in AA then ∀x(A∨B(x))→(A∨∀xB(x))\forall x (A \vee B(x))
\rightarrow (A \vee \forall x B(x)) holds in every Kripke model
K\mathbf{K} with constant domain (so that D(k)=D(k′)D(k) = D(k') for all
k,k′k, k' in K)K). The same is true for MP.


Kripke models and Beth models (which differ from Kripke models in
detail, but are intuitionistically equivalent) are a powerful tool for
establishing properties of intuitionistic formal systems; cf.
Troelstra and van Dalen [1988], Smorynski [1973], de Jongh and
Smorynski [1976], Ghilardi [1999] and Iemhoff [2001], [2005]. However,
there is no purely intuitionistic proof that every sentence which is
valid in all Kripke and Beth models is provable in IQC\mathbf{IQC}.
Following an observation by Gödel, Kreisel [1958] verified that
the completeness of intuitionistic predicate logic for Beth semantics
is equivalent to Markov’s Principle MP, which Brouwer
rejected.

Moreover, Dyson and Kreisel [1961] showed that if IQC\mathbf{IQC} is
weakly complete for Beth semantics (that is, if no unprovable
sentence holds in every Beth model) then the following consequence of
MP holds : 

∀αB(α)¬¬∃xR(α,x)→¬¬∀αB(α)∃xR(α,x), \tag{GDK} \forall \alpha_{B(\alpha)} \neg \neg \exists x R(\alpha,
x) \rightarrow \neg \neg \forall \alpha_{B(\alpha)} \exists x
R(\alpha, x),

 where xx ranges over all natural numbers,
α\alpha ranges over all infinite sequences of natural numbers,
B(α)B(\alpha) abbreviates ∀x(α(x)≤1)\forall x (\alpha(x) \leq 1), and RR
expresses a primitive recursive relation of α\alpha and xx.
Conversely, GDK entails the weak completeness of IQC\mathbf{IQC}.
This interesting principle, which would justify the negative
interpretation of a form of Brouwer’s Fan Theorem, is weaker
than MP but unprovable in current systems of intuitionistic analysis.
Kreisel [1962] suggested that GDK may eventually be provable on the
basis of as yet undiscovered properties of intuitionistic
mathematics.


By modifying the definition of a Kripke model to allow
“exploding nodes” which force every sentence, Veldman
[1976] found a completeness proof using only intuitionistic logic, but
he questioned whether Kripke models with exploding nodes were
intuitionistically meaningful mathematical objects.
5.2 Realizability semantics for Heyting arithmetic

One way to implement the B-H-K explanation of intuitionistic truth for
arithmetic is to associate with each sentence EE of HA\mathbf{HA}
some collection of numerical codes for algorithms which could
establish the constructive truth of EE. Following Kleene [1945], a
number ee realizes a sentence EE of the language of
arithmetic by induction on the logical form of EE: 


ee realizes r=tr = t
if r=tr = t is true. 

ee realizes A&BA \oldand B
if ee codes a pair (f,g)(f,g) such that ff realizes AA
and gg realizes BB. 

ee realizes A∨BA \vee B
if ee codes a pair (f,g)(f,g) such that if f=0f = 0 then
gg realizes AA, and if f>0f \gt 0 then gg realizes
BB. 

ee realizes A→BA\rightarrow B
if, whenever ff realizes AA, then the eeth partial
recursive function is defined at ff and its value realizes
BB. 

ee realizes ¬A\neg A
if no ff realizes AA. 

ee realizes ∀xA(x)\forall x A(x)
if, for every nn, the eeth partial recursive function is
defined at nn and its value realizes A(n)A(\mathbf{n}). 

ee realizes ∃xA(x)\exists x A(x)
if ee codes a pair (n,g)(n,g) and gg realizes
A(n)A(\mathbf{n}). 


An arbitrary formula is realizable if some number realizes its
universal closure. Observe that not both AA and ¬A\neg A are
realizable, for any formula AA. The fundamental result is 

Nelson’s Theorem [1947]

If AA is derivable in HA\mathbf{HA} from realizable formulas
FF, then AA is realizable.

Some nonintuitionistic principles can be shown to be realizable. For
example, Markov’s Principle (for decidable formulas)
can be expressed by the schema 

  (MP)   ∀x(A(x)∨¬A(x))&¬∀x¬A(x)→∃xA(x)\forall x
(A(x) \vee \neg A(x)) \oldand \neg \forall x \neg A(x) \rightarrow
\exists x A(x).  


Although unprovable in HA\mathbf{HA}, MP is realizable by an
argument which uses Markov’s Principle informally. But
realizability is a fundamentally nonclassical interpretation. In
HA\mathbf{HA} it is possible to express an axiom of recursive choice
CT (for “Church’s Thesis”), which contradicts LEM
but is (constructively) realizable. Hence by Nelson’s Theorem,
HA\mathbf{HA} ++ MP ++ CT is consistent.

Kleene used a variant of number-realizability to prove HA\mathbf{HA}
satisfies the Church-Kleene Rule; the same argument works for
HA\mathbf{HA} with MP or CT, and for HA\mathbf{HA} ++ MP ++
CT. In Kleene and Vesley [1965] and Kleene [1969], functions replace
numbers as realizing objects, establishing the consistency of
formalized intuitionistic analysis and its closure under a
second-order version of the Church-Kleene Rule.
Nelson’s Theorem establishes the unprovability in
IQC\mathbf{IQC} of some theorems of classical predicate logic. If, to
each nn-place predicate letter P(…)P(\ldots ), a formula f(P)f(P)
of L(HA)L(\mathbf{HA}) with nn free variables is assigned, and if
the formula f(A)f(A) of L(HA)L(\mathbf{HA}) comes from the formula
AA of LL by replacing each prime formula P(x1,…,xn)P(x_1, \ldots, x_n)
by f(P)(x1,…,xn)f(P)(x_1 ,\ldots ,x_n), then f(A)f(A) is called
an arithmetical substitution instance of AA.  As an
example, if a formula of L(HA)L(\mathbf{HA}) expressing “xx
codes a proof in HA\mathbf{HA} of the formula with code yy”
is assigned to P(x,y)P(x,y), the resulting arithmetical substitution
instance of ∀y(∃xP(x,y)∨¬∃xP(x,y))\forall y (\exists x P(x, y) \vee \neg \exists x P(x,
y)) is unrealizable and hence unprovable in HA\mathbf{HA}, and so
is its double negation.  It follows that ¬¬∀y(∃xP(x,y)∨¬∃xP(x,y))\neg \neg \forall y
(\exists x P(x, y) \vee \neg \exists x P(x, y)) is not provable in
IQC\mathbf{IQC}.

De Jongh [1970] combined realizability with Kripke modeling to show
that intuitionistic propositional logic IPC\mathbf{IPC} and a
fragment of IQC\mathbf{IQC} are arithmetically complete for
HA\mathbf{HA}.  A uniform assignment of simple existential formulas
to predicate letters suffices to prove

De Jongh’s Theorem (for IPC) [1970]

If a propositional formula AA of the language LL is not provable in
IPC\mathbf{IPC}, then some arithmetical substitution instance of
AA is not provable in HA\mathbf{HA}.

The proof of this version of de Jongh’s Theorem does not need
realizability; cf. Smorynski [1973]. As an example, Rosser’s
form of Gödel’s Incompleteness Theorem provides a sentence
CC of L(HA)L(\mathbf{HA}) such that PA\mathbf{PA} proves neither
CC nor ¬C\neg C, so by the disjunction property HA\mathbf{HA}
cannot prove (C∨¬C)(C \vee \neg C).  But de Jongh’s semantical
proof also established that every intuitionistically unprovable
predicate formula of a restricted kind has an arithmetical
substitution instance which is unprovable in HA\mathbf{HA}.  Using a
syntactic method, Daniel Leivant [1979] extended de Jongh’s
Theorem to all intuitionistically unprovable predicate formulas,
proving that IQC\mathbf{IQC} is arithmetically complete for
HA\bf{HA}.  See van Oosten [1991] for a historical exposition and a
simpler proof of the full theorem, using abstract realizability with
Beth models instead of Kripke models.

Without claiming that number-realizability coincides with
intuitionistic arithmetical truth, Nelson observed that for each
formula AA of L(HA)L(\mathbf{HA}) the predicate “yy
realizes AA” can be expressed in HA\mathbf{HA} by another
formula (abbreviated “yreAy \realizesrel A”), and the
schema A↔∃y(yreA)A \leftrightarrow \exists y (y \realizesrel A) is
consistent with HA\mathbf{HA}. Troelstra [1973] showed that
HA\mathbf{HA} ++ (A↔∃y(yreA))(A \leftrightarrow \exists y (y \realizesrel
A)) is equivalent to HA\mathbf{HA} ++ ECT, where ECT is a
strengthened form of CT. In HA\mathbf{HA} ++ MP ++ ECT, which
Troelstra considers to be a formalization of Russian recursive
mathematics (cf. section 3.2 of the entry on
 constructive mathematics),
 every formula of the form (yreA)(y \realizesrel A) has an equivalent
“classical” prenex form A′(y)A'(y) consisting of a
quantifier-free subformula preceded by alternating
“classical” quantifiers of the forms ¬¬∃x\neg \neg \exists x
 and ∀z¬¬\forall z \neg \neg , and so ∃yA′(y)\exists y A'(y) is a kind
of prenex form of AA.
6. Additional Topics and Further Reading
6.1 Subintuitionistic and Intermediate Logics

At present there are several other entries in this encyclopedia
treating intuitionistic logic in various contexts, but a general
treatment of weaker and stronger propositional and predicate logics
appears to be lacking. Many such logics have been identified and
studied. Here are a few examples.

A subintuitionistic propositional logic can be obtained from
IPC\mathbf{IPC} by restricting the language, or weakening the logic,
or both. An extreme example of the first is RN\mathbf{RN},
intuitionistic logic with a single propositional variable PP, which
is named after its discoverers Rieger and Nishimura [1960].
RN\mathbf{RN} is characterized by the Rieger-Nishimura
lattice of infinitely many nonequivalent formulas FnF_n such
that every formula whose only propositional variable is PP is
equivalent by intuitionistic logic to some FnF_n. Nishimura’s
version is
F∞=P→P.F0=P&¬P.F1=P.F2=¬P.F2n+3=F2n+1∨F2n+2.F2n+4=F2n+3→F2n+1.\begin{align*}
F_{\infty} &amp;= P \rightarrow P. \\
F_0 &amp;= P \oldand \neg P. \\
F_1 &amp;= P. \\
F_2 &amp;= \neg P.\\
F_{2 n + 3} &amp;= F_{2 n + 1} \vee F_{ 2n + 2}. \\
F_{2 n + 4} &amp;= F_{2 n + 3} \rightarrow F_{2 n + 1}.
\end{align*}

In RN\mathbf{RN} neither F2n+1F_{2 n + 1} nor F2n+2F_{2 n + 2} implies
the other; but F2nF_{2 n} implies F2n+1F_{2 n + 1}, and F2n+1F_{2 n +
1} implies each of F2n+3F_{2 n + 3} and F2n+4F_{2 n + 4}. 

Fragments of IPC\mathbf{IPC} missing one or more logical connectives
restrict the language and incidentally the logic, since the
intuitionistic connectives &\oldand, ∨\vee, →\rightarrow,
¬\neg are logically independent over IPC\mathbf{IPC}. Rose [1953]
proved that the implicationless fragment (without
→\rightarrow) is complete with respect to realizability, in the
sense that if every arithmetical substitution instance of a
propositional formula EE without →\rightarrow is
(number)-realizable then EE is a theorem of IPC\mathbf{IPC}. This
result contrasts with

Rose’s Theorem [1953]

IPC\mathbf{IPC} is incomplete with respect to realizability.

Let FF be the propositional formula 

((¬¬D→D)→(¬¬D∨¬D))→(¬¬D∨¬D)

( ( \neg \neg D \rightarrow D) \rightarrow
( \neg \neg D \vee \neg D ) )
\rightarrow ( \neg \neg D \vee \neg D)



 where DD is
(¬P∨¬Q)(\neg P \vee \neg Q) and PP, QQ are prime. Every
arithmetical substitution instance of FF is realizable (using
classical logic), but FF is not provable in IPC\mathbf{IPC}.


It follows that IPC\mathbf{IPC} is arithmetically incomplete for
HA\mathbf{HA} ++ ECT (cf. Section 5.2).

Minimal logic ML\mathbf{ML} comes from intuitionistic logic
by deleting ex falso. Kolmogorov [1925] showed that this
fragment already contains a negative interpretation of classical logic
retaining both quantifiers, cf. Leivant [1985]. Minimal logic does
prove the special case ¬A→(A→¬B)\neg A \rightarrow (A \rightarrow \neg B)
of ex falso for negations. Colacito, de Jongh and Vardas
[2017] study various subminimal logics, each weaker than
ML\mathbf{ML}.

Griss contested Brouwer’s use of negation, objecting to both the
law of contradiction and ex falso. It is worth noting that
negation is not really needed for intuitionistic mathematics since 0=10
= 1 is a known contradiction so ¬A\neg A can be defined by A→0=1A
\rightarrow 0 = 1. Then ex falso can be stated as 0=1→A0 = 1
\rightarrow A, and the law of contradiction is provable from the
remaining axioms of H\mathbf{H}.

An intermediate propositional logic is any consistent
collection of propositional formulas containing all the axioms of
IPC\mathbf{IPC} and closed under modus ponens and
substitution of arbitrary formulas for proposition letters. Each
intermediate propositional logic is contained in CPC\mathbf{CPC}.
Some particular intermediate propositional logics, characterized by
adding one or more classically correct but intuitionistically
unprovable axiom schemas to IPC\mathbf{IPC}, have been studied
extensively.

One of the simplest intermediate propositional logics is the
Gödel-Dummett logic LC\mathbf{LC}, obtained by adding to
IPC\mathbf{IPC} the schema (A→B)∨(B→A)(A \rightarrow B) \vee (B \rightarrow
A) which is valid on all and only those Kripke frames in which the
partial order of the nodes is linear. Gödel [1932] used an
infinite sequence of successively stronger intermediate logics to show
that IPC\mathbf{IPC} has no finite truth-table interpretation. For
each positive integer nn, let Gn\mathbf{G_n} be LC\mathbf{LC}
plus the schema (A1→A2)∨…∨(A1&…&An→An+1)(A_1 \rightarrow A_2) \vee \ldots \vee (A_1 \oldand
\ldots \oldand A_n \rightarrow A_{n + 1}). Then Gn\mathbf{G_n} is
valid on all and only those linearly ordered Kripke frames with no
more than nn nodes. 

The Jankov logic KC\mathbf{KC}, which adds to IPC\mathbf{IPC} the
principle of testability ¬A∨¬¬A\neg A \vee \neg \neg A,
obviously does not have the disjunction property. The Kreisel-Putnam
logic KP\mathbf{KP}, obtained by adding to IPC\mathbf{IPC} the
schema (¬A→B∨C)→((¬A→B)∨(¬A→C))(\neg A \rightarrow B \vee C) \rightarrow((\neg A \rightarrow
B) \vee (\neg A \rightarrow C)), has the disjunction property but
does not satisfy all the Visser rules. The intermediate logic obtained
by adding the schema ((¬¬D→D)→(D∨¬D))→(¬¬D∨¬D)((\neg \neg D \rightarrow D) \rightarrow(D \vee
\neg D)) \rightarrow (\neg \neg D \vee \neg D), corresponding to
Rose’s counterexample, to IPC\mathbf{IPC} also has the
disjunction property. Iemhoff [2005] proved that IPC\mathbf{IPC} is
the only intermediate propositional logic with the disjunction
property which is closed under all the Visser rules. Iemhoff and
Metcalfe [2009] developed a formal calculus for generalized
admissibility for IPC\mathbf{IPC} and some intermediate logics.
Goudsmit [2015] is a thorough study of the admissible rules of
intermediate logics, with a comprehensive bibliography.

An intermediate propositional logic L\mathbf{L} is said to have the
finite frame property if there is a class of finite frames on
which the Kripke-valid formulas are exactly the theorems of
L\mathbf{L}. Many intermediate logics, including LC\mathbf{LC}
and KP\mathbf{KP}, have this property. Jankov [1968] used an
infinite sequence of finite rooted Kripke frames to prove that there
are continuum many intermediate logics. De Jongh, Verbrugge and Visser
[2009] proved that every intermediate logic L\mathbf{L} with the
finite frame property is the propositional logic of
HA(L)\mathbf{HA(L)}, that is, the class of all formulas in the language
of IPC\mathbf{IPC} all of whose arithmetical substitution instances
are provable in the logical extension of HA\mathbf{HA} by
L\mathbf{L}.

An intermediate propositional logic L\mathbf{L} is structurally
complete if every rule which is admissible for L\mathbf{L} is
derivable in L\mathbf{L}, and hereditarily structurally
complete if every intermediate logic extending L\mathbf{L} is
also structurally complete. Every intermediate logic L\mathbf{L}
has a structural completion ¯L\mathbf{\overline{L}},
obtained by adjoining all its admissible rules. LC\mathbf{LC} and
Gn\mathbf{G_n} are hereditarily structurally complete. While
IPC\mathbf{IPC}, RN\mathbf{RN} and KC\mathbf{KC} are not
structurally complete, their structural completions are hereditarily
structurally complete. For these results and more, see Citkin [2016,
Other Internet Resources].

Some intermediate predicate logics, extending
IQC\mathbf{IQC} and closed under substitution, are IQC\mathbf{IQC}
++ DNS (Section 4.1), IQC\mathbf{IQC} ++ MP (cf. Section 5.2),
IQC\mathbf{IQC} ++ MP ++ IP (cf. Section 4.2), and the
intuitionistic logic of constant domains CD\mathbf{CD}
obtained by adding to IQC\mathbf{IQC} the schema ∀x(A∨B(x))→(A∨∀xB(x))\forall x (A \vee
B(x)) \rightarrow (A \vee \forall x B(x)) for all formulas AA,
B(x)B(x) with xx not occurring free in AA. Mints, Olkhovikov and
Urquhart [2012, Other Internet Resources] showed that CD\mathbf{CD}
does not have the interpolation property, refuting earlier published
proofs by other authors.
6.2 Advanced topics

Brouwer’s influence on Gödel was significant, although
Gödel never became an intuitionist. Gödel’s [1933f]
translation of intuitionistic propositional logic into the
 modal logic
S4\mathbf{S4} is described in Section 2.5 of the entry on
 Gödel
 and in Troelstra’s introductory note to the translation of
[1933f] in Volume I of Gödel’s Collected Works. See also
Mints [2012]. Kripke models for modal logic predated those for
intuitionistic logic.

Alternatives to Kripke and Beth semantics for intuitionistic
propositional and predicate logic include the topological
interpretation of Stone [1937], Tarski [1938] and Mostowski [1948]
(cf. Rasiowa and Sikorski [1963], Rasiowa [1974]), which was extended
to intuitionistic analysis by Scott [1968] and Krol [1978]. M. Hyland
[1982] defined the effective topos Eff and proved that its
logic is intuitionistic. For a very informative discussion of
semantics for intuitionistic logic and mathematics by W. Ruitenberg,
and an interesting new perspective by G. Bezhanishvili and W.
Holliday, see Other Internet Resources (below). 

One alternative to realizability semantics for intuitionistic
arithmetic is Gödel’s [1958] “Dialectica”
interpretation, which associates with each formula BB of
L(HA)L(\mathbf{HA}) a quantifier-free formula BDB_D in the language
of intuitionistic arithmetic of all finite types. The
“Dialectica” interpretation of BB, call it
BDB^D, is ∃Y∀xBD(Y,x)\exists Y\forall x B_D (Y, x). If BB is a closed
theorem of HA\mathbf{HA}, then BD(F,x)B_D (F, x) is provable for some
term FF in Gödel’s theory T\mathbf{T} of
“primitive recursive” functionals of higher type. The
translation from BB to BDB^D requires the axiom of choice (at all
finite types), MP and IP, so is not strictly constructive; however,
the number-theoretic functions expressible by terms FF of
T\mathbf{T} are precisely the provably recursive functions of
HA\mathbf{HA} (and of PA)\mathbf{PA}). The interpretation was
extended to analysis by Spector [1962]; cf. Howard [1973]. Clear
expositions, and additional references, are to be found in
Troelstra’s introduction to the English translation in
Gödel [1990] of the original Dialectica article, in
Avigad and Feferman [1998], and in Ferreira [2008].

While HA\mathbf{HA} is a proper part of classical arithmetic, the
intuitionistic attitude toward mathematical objects results in a
theory of real numbers (cf. sections 3.4–3.7 of the entry on
 intuitionism in the philosophy of mathematics)
 diverging from the classical. Kleene’s function-realizability
interpretation, developed to prove the consistency of his
formalization FIM\mathbf{FIM} of the intuitionistic theory of
sequences (“intuitionistic analysis”), changes the
interpretation of arithmetical formulas; for example, ¬¬∀x(A(x)∨¬A(x))\neg \neg
\forall x (A(x) \vee \neg A(x)) is function-realizable for every
arithmetical formula A(x)A(x). In the language of analysis,
Markov’s Principle and the negative translation of the countable
axiom of choice are among the many non-intuitionistic principles which
are function-realizable (by classical arguments) and hence consistent
with FIM\mathbf{FIM}; cf. Kleene [1965], Vesley [1972] and
Moschovakis [2003].

Concrete and abstract realizability semantics for a wide variety of
formal systems have been developed and studied by logicians and
computer scientists; cf. Troelstra [1998] and van Oosten [2002] and
[2008]. Variations of the basic notions are especially useful for
establishing relative consistency and relative independence of the
nonlogical axioms in theories based on intuitionistic logic; some
examples are Moschovakis [1971], Lifschitz [1979], and the
realizability notions for constructive and intuitionistic set theories
developed by Rathjen [2006, 2012] and Chen [2012]. Early abstract
realizability notions include the slashes of Kleene [1962,
1963] and Aczel [1968], and Läuchli [1970]. Kohlenbach, Avigad
and others have developed realizability interpretations for parts of
classical mathematics.

Artemov’s
 justification logic
 is an alternative interpretation of the B-H-K explanation of the
intuitionistic connectives and quantifiers, with (idealized) proofs
playing the part of realizing objects. See also Artemov and Iemhoff
[2007].

Another line of research in intuitionistic logic concerns
Brouwer’s very controversial “creating subject
counterexamples” to principles of classical analysis (such as
Markov’s Principle) which could not be refuted on the basis of
the theory FIM\mathbf{FIM} of Kleene and Vesley [1965]. By weakening
Kleene’s form of Brouwer’s principle of continuous choice,
and adding an axiom he called Kripke’s Schema (KP),
Myhill managed to formalize the creating subject arguments. KP is
inconsistent with FIM\mathbf{FIM}, but Vesley [1970] found an
alternative principle (Vesley’s Schema VS) which can
consistently be added to FIM\mathbf{FIM} and implies all the
counterexamples for which Brouwer required a creating subject. Krol
[1978] and Scowcroft gave topological consistency proofs for
intuitionistic analysis with Kripke’s Schema and weak
continuity.
6.3 Recommended reading

The entry on
 L. E. J. Brouwer
 discusses Brouwer’s philosophy and mathematics, with a
chronology of his life and a selected list of publications including
translations and secondary sources. The best way to learn more is to
read some of the original papers. English translations of
Brouwer’s doctoral dissertation and other papers which
originally appeared in Dutch, along with a number of articles in
German, can be found in L. E. J. Brouwer: Collected Works
[1975], edited by Heyting. Benacerraf and Putnam’s essential
source book contains Brouwer [1912] (in English translation), Brouwer
[1949] and Dummett [1975]. Mancosu’s [1998] provides English
translations of many fundamental articles by Brouwer, Heyting,
Glivenko and Kolmogorov, with illuminating introductory material by W.
van Stigt whose [1990] is another valuable resource. 

The third edition [1971] of Heyting’s classic [1956] is an
attractive introduction to intuitionistic philosophy, logic and
mathematical practice. As part of the formidable project of editing
and publishing Brouwer’s Nachlass, van Dalen [1981]
provides a comprehensive view of Brouwer’s own intuitionistic
philosophy. The English translation, in van Heijenoort [1969], of
Brouwer’s [1927] (with a fine introduction by Parsons) is still
an indispensable reference for Brouwer’s theory of the
continuum. Veldman [1990] and [2005] are authentic modern examples of
traditional intuitionistic mathematical practice. Troelstra [1991]
places intuitionistic logic in its historical context as the common
foundation of constructive mathematics in the twentieth century.
Bezhanishvili and de Jongh [2005, Other Internet Resources] includes
recent developments in intuitionistic logic.

Kleene and Vesley’s [1965] gives a careful axiomatic treatment
of intuitionistic analysis, a proof of its consistency relative to a
classically correct subtheory, and an extended application to
Brouwer’s theory of real number generators. Kleene’s
[1969] formalizes the theory of partial recursive functionals,
enabling precise formalizations of the function-realizability
interpretation used in [1965] and of a related q-realizability
interpretation which gives the Church-Kleene Rule for intuitionistic
analysis.

Troelstra’s [1973], Beeson’s [1985] and Troelstra and van
Dalen’s [1988] (with
 corrections)
 stand out as the most comprehensive studies of intuitionistic and
semi-intuitionistic formal theories, using both constructive and
classical methods, with useful bibliographies. Troelstra and
Schwichtenberg [2000] presents the proof theory of classical,
intuitionistic and minimal logic in parallel, focusing on sequent
systems. Troelstra’s [1998] presents formulas-as-types and
(Kleene and Aczel) slash interpretations for propositional and
predicate logic, as well as abstract and concrete realizabilities for
a multitude of applications. Martin-Löf’s constructive
theory of types [1984] (cf. Section 3.4 of the entry on
 constructive mathematics)
 provides another general framework within which intuitionistic
reasoning continues to develop.
