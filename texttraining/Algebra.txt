Algebra is a branch of mathematics sibling to geometry, analysis
(calculus), number theory, combinatorics, etc. Although algebra has
its roots in numerical domains such as the reals and the complex
numbers, in its full generality it differs from its siblings in
serving no specific mathematical domain. Whereas geometry treats
spatial entities, analysis continuous variation, number theory integer
arithmetic, and combinatorics discrete structures, algebra is equally
applicable to all these and other mathematical domains.


Elementary algebra, in use for centuries and taught in
secondary school, is the arithmetic of indefinite quantities or
variables x,y,…x,y,…x, y,\ldots. Whereas the definite sum 3+43+43+4 evaluates
to the definite quantity 7, the indefinite sum x+yx+yx+y has no definite
value, yet we can still say that it is always equal to y+xy+xy+x, or to
x2−y2x2−y2x^2 -y^2 if and only if xxx is either −y−y-y or y+1y+1y+1.



Elementary algebra provides finite ways of managing the infinite.  A
formula such as πr2πr2\pi r^2 for the area of a circle of radius rrr
describes infinitely many possible computations, one for each possible
valuation of its variables. A universally true law expresses
infinitely many cases, for example the single equation x+y=y+xx+y=y+xx+y = y+x
summarizes the infinitely many facts 1+2=2+1,3+7=7+31+2=2+1,3+7=7+31+2 = 2+1, 3+7 = 7+3,
etc. The equation 2x=42x=42x = 4 selects one number from an infinite set
of possibilities.  And y=2x+3y=2x+3y = 2x+3 expresses the infinitely many
points of the line with slope 2 passing through (0,3)(0,3)(0, 3) with a
finite equation whose solutions are exactly those points.



Elementary algebra ordinarily works with real or complex values.
However its general methods, if not always its specific operations and
laws, are equally applicable to other numeric domains such as the
natural numbers, the integers, the integers modulo some integer nnn,
the rationals, the quaternions, the Gaussian integers, the ppp-adic
numbers, and so on. They are also applicable to many nonnumeric
domains such as the subsets of a given set under the operations of
union and intersection, the words over a given alphabet under the
operations of concatenation and reversal, the permutations of a given
set under the operations of composition and inverse, etc. Each
such algebraic structure, or simply algebra,
consists of the set of its elements and operations on those elements
obeying the laws holding in that domain, such as the set Z={0,±1,±2,…}Z={0,±1,±2,…}Z = \{0,
\pm 1, \pm 2, \ldots \} of integers under the integer operations
x+yx+yx+y of addition, xyxyxy of multiplication, and −x−x-x, negation,
or the set 2X2X2^X of subsets of a set XXX under the set operations
X∪YX∪YX\cup Y of union, X∩YX∩YX\cap Y of intersection, and X′X′X',
complement relative to XXX.



The laws are often similar but not identical. For example integer
multiplication distributes over addition, x(y+z)=xy+xzx(y+z)=xy+xzx(y+z) = xy+xz, but not
conversely, for example 2+(3×5)=172+(3×5)=172+(3\times 5) = 17 but (2+3)×(2+5)=35(2+3)×(2+5)=35(2+3)\times(2+5)
= 35. In the analogy that makes intersection the set theoretic
counterpart of multiplication and union that of addition, intersection
distributes over union,
X∩(Y∪Z)=(X∩Y)∪(X∩Z),X∩(Y∪Z)=(X∩Y)∪(X∩Z),
X\cap(Y\cup Z) = (X\cap Y)\cup(X\cap Z),


as for the integers, but unlike the integers union also distributes
over intersection:
X∪(Y∩Z)=(X∪Y)∩(X∪Z).X∪(Y∩Z)=(X∪Y)∩(X∪Z).
X\cup(Y\cap Z) = (X\cup Y)\cap(X\cup Z).



Whereas elementary algebra is conducted in a fixed algebra,
abstract or modern algebra treats classes of algebras
having certain properties in common, typically those expressible
as equations. The subject, which emerged during the 19th century, is
traditionally introduced via the classes of groups, rings, and fields.
For example any number system under the operations of addition and
subtraction forms an abelian (commutative) group; one then passes
to rings by bringing in multiplication, and further to fields with
division. The common four-function calculator provides the four
functions of the field of reals.



The abstract concept of group in full generality is defined not in
terms of a set of numbers but rather as an arbitrary set equipped with
a binary operation xyxyxy, a unary inverse x−1x−1x^{-1}
of that operation, and a unit eee satisfying certain
equations characteristic of groups. One striking novelty with
groups not encountered in everyday elementary algebra is that their
multiplication need not be abelian: xyxyxy and yxyxyx
can be different! For example the group S3S3S_3
of the six possible permutations of three things is not abelian,
as can be seen by exchanging adjacent pairs of letters in the word
dan. If you exchange the two letters on the left before the
two on the right you get adn and then and, but if
you perform these exchanges in the other order you get dna
and then nda instead of and. Likewise the group of
43,252,003,274,489,856,000 operations on Rubik’s cube and the
infinite group SO(3)SO(3)SO(3) of rotations of the sphere are not abelian,
though the infinite group SO(2)SO(2)SO(2) of rotations of the circle is
abelian. Quaternion multiplication and matrix multiplication is also
noncommutative. Abelian groups are often called additive groups and
their group operation is referred to as addition x+yx+yx+y rather than
multiplication xyxyxy.



Groups, rings and fields only scratch the surface of abstract algebra.
Vector spaces and more generally modules are restricted forms of
rings in which the operands of multiplication are required to be a
scalar and a vector. Monoids generalize groups by dropping inverse;
for example the natural numbers form a monoid but not a group for
want of negation. Boolean algebras abstract the algebra of sets.
Lattices generalize Boolean algebras by dropping complement and
the distributivity laws. 



A number of branches of mathematics have found algebra such an
effective tool that they have spawned algebraic subbranches.
Algebraic logic, algebraic number theory, and algebraic topology
are all heavily studied, while algebraic geometry and algebraic
combinatorics have entire journals devoted to them.



Algebra is of philosophical interest for at least two reasons.
From the perspective of foundations of mathematics, algebra is
strikingly different from other branches of mathematics in both its
domain independence and its close affinity to formal logic. Furthermore
the dichotomy between elementary and abstract algebra reflects a
certain duality in reasoning that Descartes, the inventor of Cartesian
Dualism, would have appreciated, wherein the former deals with the
reasoning process and the latter that which is reasoned about, as
respectively the mind and body of mathematics.



Algebra has also played a significant role in clarifying and
highlighting notions of logic, at the core of exact philosophy
for millennia. The first step away from the Aristotelian logic of
syllogisms towards a more algebraic form of logic was taken by Boole
in an 1847 pamphlet and subsequently in a more detailed treatise,
The Laws of Thought, in 1854. The dichotomy between elementary
algebra and modern algebra then started to appear in the subsequent
development of logic, with logicians strongly divided between the
formalistic approach as espoused by Frege, Peano, and Russell, and the
algebraic approach followed by C. S. Peirce, Schroeder, and Tarski.

 
1. Elementary algebra


Elementary algebra deals with numerical terms, namely
constants 0, 1, 1.5, ππ\pi, variables x,y,…x,y,…x,
y,\ldots, and combinations thereof built with
operations such as +++, −−-, ××\times , ÷÷\div ,
√xx\sqrt{\phantom{x}}, etc. to form such terms as x+1,x×yx+1,x×yx+1, x\times y (standardly
abbreviated xyxyxy), x+3yx+3yx + 3y, and √xx\sqrt{x}. 


Terms may be used on their own in formulas such as
πr2πr2\pi r^2, or in equations serving as laws
such as x+y=y+xx+y=y+xx+y = y+x, or as
constraints such as 2x2−x+3=5x+12x2−x+3=5x+12x^2 -x+3 = 5x+1 or x2+y2=1x2+y2=1x^2 + y^2 = 1.



Laws are always true; while they have the same form as constraints they
constrain only vacuously in that every valuation of their variables
is a solution. The constraint x2+y2=1x2+y2=1x^2 +y^2 =
1 has a continuum of solutions forming a shape, in this case
a circle of radius 1. The constraint 2x2−x+3=5x+12x2−x+3=5x+12x^2 -x+3
= 5x+1 has two solutions, x=1x=1x = 1 or 2, and may
be encountered in the solution of word problems, or in
the determination of the points of intersection of two curves
such as the parabola y=2x2−x+3y=2x2−x+3y = 2x^2 -x+3 and the
line y=5x+1y=5x+1y = 5x+1.

1.1 Formulas


A formula is a term used in the computation of values by hand or
machine. Although some attributes of physical objects lend themselves
to direct measurement such as length and mass, others such as area,
volume, and density do not and must be computed from more readily
observed values with the help of the appropriate formula. For example
the area of a rectangle LLL inches long by WWW inches
wide is given by the formula LWLWLW in units of square inches,
the volume of a ball of radius rrr is 4πr3/34πr3/34\pi r^3 /3,
and the density of a solid of mass MMM and volume VVV
is given by M/VM/VM/V.



Formulas may be combined to give yet more formulas. For example the
density of a ball of mass MMM and radius rrr can be
obtained by substituting the above formula for the volume of a ball
for VVV in the above formula for the density of a solid. The
resulting formula M/(4πr3/3)M/(4πr3/3)M/(4\pi r^3 /3) is then
the desired density formula. 
1.2 Laws


Laws or identities are equations that hold for all applicable values
of their variables. For example the commutativity law
x+y=y+xx+y=y+x
x+y = y+x

holds for all real values of xxx and yyy. Likewise the
associativity law
x+(y+z)=(x+y)+zx+(y+z)=(x+y)+z
x+(y+z) = (x+y)+z

 holds for all real values of x,yx,yx, y and zzz. On the other
hand, while the law x/(y/z)=zx/yx/(y/z)=zx/yx/(y/z) = zx/y holds for all numerical values
of xxx, it holds only for nonzero values of yyy and zzz in order
to avoid the illegal operation of division by zero. 


When a law holds for all numerical values of its variables, it also
holds for all expression values of those variables. Setting x=M,y=4πr3x=M,y=4πr3x = M, y
= 4\pi r^3, and z=3z=3z = 3 in the last law of the preceding paragraph
yields M/(4πr3/3)=3M/(4πr3)M/(4πr3/3)=3M/(4πr3)M/(4\pi r^3 /3) = 3M/(4\pi r^3). The left hand side being
our density formula from the preceding section, it follows from this
instance of the above law that its right hand side is an equivalent
formula for density in the sense that it gives the same answers as the
left hand side. This new density formula replaces one of the two
divisions by a multiplication. 
1.3 Word problems


If Xavier will be three times his present age in four years time,
how old is he? We can solve this word problem using algebra
by formalizing it as the equation 3x=x+43x=x+43x = x + 4 where
xxx is Xavier’s present age. The left hand side expresses three
times Xavier’s present age, while the right hand side expresses his age
in four years’ time.



A general rule for solving such equations is that any solution
to it is also a solution to the equation obtained by applying some
operation to both sides. In this case we can simplify the equation
by subtracting xxx from both sides to give 2x=42x=42x = 4,
and then dividing both sides by 2 to give x=2x=2x = 2. So Xavier
is now two years old.



If Xavier is twice as old as Yvonne and half the square of her
age, how old is each? This is more complicated than the previous
example in three respects: it has more unknowns, more equations,
and terms of higher degree. We may take xxx for Xavier’s
age and yyy for Yvonne’s age. The two constraints may
be formalized as the equations x=2yx=2yx = 2y and
x=y2/2x=y2/2x = y^2 /2, the latter being of degree
2 or quadratic.



Since both right hand sides are equal to xxx we can infer
2y=y2/22y=y2/22y = y^2 /2. It is tempting to divide
both sides by yyy, but what if y=0y=0y = 0? In fact y=0y=0y = 0 is one solution,
for which x=2y=0x=2y=0x = 2y = 0 as well, corresponding to Xavier and Yvonne both
being newborns. Setting that solution to one side we can now look
for solutions in which yyy is not zero by dividing both sides by yyy.
This yields y=4y=4y = 4, in which case x=2y=8x=2y=8x = 2y = 8. So now we have a second
solution in which Xavier is eight years old and Yvonne four.



In the absence of any other information, both solutions are legitimate.
Had the problem further specified that Yvonne was a toddler,
or that Xavier was older than Yvonne, we could have ruled out the
first solution.

1.4 Cartesian geometry


Lines, circles, and other curves in the plane can be expressed
algebraically using Cartesian coordinates, named for
its inventor Rene Descartes. These are defined with respect to
a distinguished point in the plane called the origin,
denoted OOO. Each point is specified by how far it is to
the right of and above OOO, written as a pair of numbers.
For example the pair (2.1, 3.56) specifies the point 2.1 units to the
right of OOO, measured horizontally, and 3.56 units above it,
measured vertically; we call 2.1 the xxx coordinate and 3.56
the yyy coordinate of that point. Either coordinate can be
negative: the pair (−5,−1)(−5,−1)(-5, -1) corresponds to the point 5 units to the
left of OOO and 1 unit below it. The point OOO itself is
coordinatized as (0, 0).


Lines. Given an equation in variables xxx and
yyy, a point such as (2, 7) is said to be a solution
to that equation when setting xxx to 2 and yyy to
7 makes the equation true. For example the equation y=3x+5y=3x+5y = 3x+5 has as solutions the points (0, 5), (1, 8), (2, 11),
and so on. Other solutions include (.5, 6.5), (1.5, 9.5), and so on.
The set of all solutions constitutes the unique straight line passing
through (0, 5) and (1, 8). We then call y=3x+5y=3x+5y = 3x+5
the equation of that line.


Circles. By Pythagoras’s Theorem the square of the
distance between two points (x,y)(x,y)(x, y) and (x′,y′)(x′,y′)(x', y') is given by
(x′−x)2+(y′−y)2(x′−x)2+(y′−y)2(x'-x)^2 +(y'-y)^2.  As a special case of this, the square of the
distance of the point (x,y)(x,y)(x, y) to the origin is x2+y2x2+y2x^2 +y^2. It
follows that those point at distance rrr from the origin are the
solutions in xxx and yyy to the equation x2+y2=r2x2+y2=r2x^2 +y^2 = r^2.  But
these points are exactly those forming the circle of radius rrr
centered on OOO. We identify this equation with this circle.


Varieties The roots of any polynomial in xxx and yyy form
a curve in the plane called a one-dimensional variety
of degree that of the polynomial. Thus lines are of degree 1,
being expressed as polynomials ax+by+cax+by+cax+by+c, while circles centered on
(x′,y′)(x′,y′)(x', y') are of degree 2, being expressed as polynomials
(x−x′)2+(y−y′)2−r2(x−x′)2+(y−y′)2−r2(x-x')^2 +(y-y')^2 -r^2.  Some varieties may contain no points,
for example x2+y2+1x2+y2+1x^2 +y^2 +1, while others may contain one point, for
example x2+y2x2+y2x^2 +y^2 having the origin as its one root. In general
however a two-dimensional variety will be a curve. Such a curve may
cross itself, or have a cusp, or even separate into two or more
components not connected to each other.


Space The two-dimensional plane is generalized to
three-dimensional space by adding to the variables xxx and
yyy a third variable zzz corresponding to the third
dimension. The conventional orientation takes the first dimension to
run from west to east, the second from south to north, and the third
from below to above. Points are then triples, for example the point
(2,5,−3)(2,5,−3)(2, 5, -3) is 2 units to the east of the origin, 5 units to the north
of it, and 3 units below it.


Planes and spheres. These are the counterparts in space of
lines and circles in the plane. An equation such as z=3x+2yz=3x+2yz = 3x + 2y
defines not a straight line but rather a flat plane, in this case the
unique plane passing through the points (0, 1, 2), (1, 0, 3), and (1,
1, 5). And the sphere of radius rrr centered on the origin is given
by x2+y2+z2=r2x2+y2+z2=r2x^2 +y^2 +z^2 = r^2. The roots of a polynomial in x,yx,yx, y and
zzz form a surface in space called a two-dimensional variety, of
degree that of the polynomial, just as for one-dimensional
varieties. Thus planes are of degree 1 and spheres of degree 2.



These methods generalize to yet higher dimensions by adding yet more
variables. Although the geometric space we experience physically is
limited to three dimensions, conceptually there is no limit to the
number of dimensions of abstract mathematical space. Just as a line is
a one-dimensional subspace of the two-dimensional plane, and a plane is
a two-dimensional subspace of three-dimensional space, each specifiable
with an equation, so is a hyperplane a three-dimensional
subspace of four-dimensional space, also specifiable with an equation
such as w=2x−7y+zw=2x−7y+zw = 2x - 7y + z.

2. Abstract Algebra


Elementary algebra fixes some domain, typically the reals or complex
numbers, and works with the equations holding within that domain.
Abstract or modern algebra reverses this picture
by fixing some set AAA of equations and studying those domains
for which those equations are identities. For example if we take the
set of all identities expressible with the operations of addition,
subtraction, and multiplication and constants 0 and 1 that hold
for the integers, then the algebras in which those equations hold
identically are exactly the commutative rings with identity.



Historically the term modern algebra came from the title of the
first three editions of van der Waerden’s classic text of that name,
renamed simply “Algebra” for its fourth edition in 1955. Volume 1
treated groups, rings, general fields, vector spaces, well orderings,
and real fields, while Volume 2 considered mainly linear algebra,
algebras (as vector spaces with a compatible multiplication),
representation theory, ideal theory, integral algebraic elements,
algebraic functions, and topological algebra. On the one hand modern
algebra has since gone far beyond this curriculum, on the other this
considerable body of material is already more than what can be assumed
as common knowledge among graduating Ph.D. students in
mathematics, for whom the typical program is too short to permit
mastering all this material in parallel with focusing on their area of
specialization.



A core feature of abstract algebra is the existence of domains where
familiar laws fail to hold. A striking example is commutativity of
multiplication, which as we noted in the introduction need not hold
for the multiplication of an arbitrary group, even so simple a group as
the six permutations of three letters.

2.1 Semigroups


We begin with the concept of a binary operation on a set XXX, namely
a function f:X2→Xf:X2→Xf: X^2 \rightarrow X such that f(x,y)f(x,y)f(x, y) is an
element of XXX for all elements x,yx,yx, y of XXX.  Such an
operation is said to be associative when it satisfies
f(f(x,y),z)=f(x,f(y,z))f(f(x,y),z)=f(x,f(y,z))f(f(x, y), z) = f(x, f(y, z)) for all x,y,zx,y,zx, y, z in XXX.



A semigroup is a set together with an associative operation,
called the multiplication of the semigroup and notated
xyxyxy rather than f(x,y)f(x,y)f(x, y). 



The product xxxxxx of an element with itself is denoted
x2x2x^2. Likewise xxxxxxxxx is denoted x3x3x^3 and so on. 

Examples

 The set of all nonempty words over a given alphabet under the operation
of concatenation.
 The set of all functions f:X→Xf:X→Xf: X \rightarrow X on a set XXX
under the operation of function composition.
 The set of integer n×nn×nn\times n matrices
under matrix multiplication, for a fixed positive integer nnn.




Concatenation uvuvuv of words u,vu,vu, v is associative because when a
word is cut into two, the concatenation of the two parts is the
original word regardless of where the cut is made.  The concatenation
of al and gebra is the same as that
of algeb and ra, illustrating
associativity of concatenation for the case x=x=x =
 al, y=y=y = geb, z=z=z
= ra.



Composition f⋅gf⋅gf\cdot g of two functions fff and ggg is
associative via the reasoning

(f⋅(g⋅h))(x)=f((g⋅h)(x))=f(g(h(x)))=(f⋅g)(h(x))=((f⋅g)⋅h)(x)(f⋅(g⋅h))(x)=f((g⋅h)(x))=f(g(h(x)))=(f⋅g)(h(x))=((f⋅g)⋅h)(x)\begin{align*}
(f\cdot(g\cdot h))(x) &amp;= f((g\cdot h)(x)) \\
 &amp;= f(g(h(x)))      \\
 &amp;=(f\cdot g)(h(x)) \\
 &amp;=((f\cdot g)\cdot h)(x) 
\end{align*}


for all xxx in XXX, whence
f⋅(g⋅h)=(f⋅g)⋅hf⋅(g⋅h)=(f⋅g)⋅hf\cdot(g\cdot h) = (f\cdot g)\cdot h.



A semigroup HHH is a subsemigroup of a semigroup
GGG when HHH is a subset of GGG and the
multiplication of GGG restricted to HHH coincides with
that of HHH. Equivalently a subsemigroup of GGG is a
subset HHH of GGG such that for all x,yx,yx, y
in H,xyH,xyH, xy is in HHH.


Examples

 The semigroup of all nonempty words over a given alphabet has as
a subsemigroup the words of even length; however the words of odd length
do not form a subsemigroup because the concatenation of two odd-length
words is not of odd length.
 The semigroup of all functions f:X→Xf:X→Xf: X \rightarrow X on a set XXX under function composition has as
subsemigroups the injective or one-to-one functions, the surjective or
onto functions, and the bijections or permutations. 




A binary operation is called commutative when it satisfies
f(x,y)=f(y,x)f(x,y)=f(y,x)f(x, y) = f(y, x)
for all x,yx,yx, y in XXX. A commutative
semigroup is a semigroup whose operation is commutative. All the
examples so far have been of noncommutative semigroups. The following
illustrate the commutative case.


Examples

 The set of positive integers under addition.
 The set of all integers under addition.
 The set of words on a one-letter alphabet under concatenation.
 The set {0,1}{0,1}\{0, 1\} of bits (binary digits) under any of the
operations AND, OR, XOR.
 The set 2X2X2^X of subsets of a fixed set
XXX under any of the set theoretic operations intersection, union,
symmetric difference.
 The set of vectors in the upper right quadrant of the plane
under vector addition.
 The same but omitting the origin.
 The set of all three-dimensional vectors under vector addition.
 The set of polynomials in one variable xxx with integer
coefficients under polynomial addition.
 The set of integer m×nm×nm\times n matrices
under matrix addition, for fixed positive integers m,nm,nm,n.




An element xxx of XXX is a left identity
for fff when f(x,y)=yf(x,y)=yf(x, y) = y
for all yyy in XXX, and a right identity when
f(y,x)=yf(y,x)=yf(y, x) = y for all yyy
in XXX. An identity for fff is an element
that is both a left identity and a right identity for fff.
An operation fff can have only one identity, because when
xxx and yyy are identities they are both equal to
f(x,y)f(x,y)f(x,y).



A monoid is a semigroup containing an identity for the
multiplication of the semigroup, notated 1.


Examples

 The identity for concatenation is the empty word. Hence words under
concatenation form a monoid when the empty word is allowed.
 The identity for addition is zero, or the origin in the case of
vector addition. Hence any of the above examples of semigroups for
which the operation is addition forms a monoid if and only if it
contains zero.
 The identity for composition is the identity function
1X:X→X1X:X→X1_X : X \rightarrow X defined as
1X(x)=x1X(x)=x1_X (x) = x for all xxx in
XXX, whence the semigroup of all functions on a set XXX forms a
monoid.




A monoid HHH is a submonoid of a monoid GGG
when it is a subsemigroup of GGG that includes the identity
of GGG.

2.2 Groups


When two elements x,yx,yx, y of a monoid satisfy xy=1xy=1xy = 1 we say that
xxx is the left inverse of yyy and yyy is the right inverse of
xxx. An element yyy that is both a left and right inverse of xxx
is called simply an inverse of xxx.



A group is a monoid every element of which has an inverse.


The cardinality of a group is traditionally referred to as its
order. A group element ggg is said to be of order
nnn when nnn is the least positive integer for which
gn=1gn=1g^n = 1.


Examples

 The monoid of integers under addition, because every integer
xxx has inverse −x−x-x.
 The set {0,1}{0,1}\{0, 1\} of bits (binary digits) under the operation
XORXOR\XOR, because each bit is its own inverse: 0XOR0=1XOR1=00XOR0=1XOR1=00 \XOR 0 = 1 \XOR 1 =
0. This is just the case n=2n=2n = 2 of the monoid
{0,1,2,…,n−1}{0,1,2,…,n−1}\{0,1,2,\ldots,n-1\} of integers mod(ulo) nnn under addition mod
nnn (e.g. 3+4=23+4=23 + 4 = 2 (mod 5)). Here 0 is its own inverse and the
inverse of mmm when nonzero is n−mn−mn - m.
 The monoid SXSXS_X of bijections or
permutations f:X→Xf:X→Xf: X \rightarrow X under composition,
because every permutation has an inverse f−1f−1f^{-1}. When
XXX has nnn elements SnSnS_n
is of order n!n!n!. SnSnS_n is abelian
if and only if n≤2n≤2n \le 2.
 The monoid of rotations of the plane about a point under
composition, because every rotation can be reversed. This group is
called the circle group, denoted SO(2).
 The monoid of rotations of three-dimensional space about a
point under composition, again because every rotation can be reversed.
This group is denoted SO(3).
 The monoid of symmetries (rotations and reflections)
of the regular nnn-gon about its center that carry the
nnn-gon into itself, again by reversibility. This group is
called the dihedral group DnDnD_n,
and is of order 2n2n2n. Like Sn,DnSn,DnS_n,
D_n is abelian if and only if n≤2n≤2n \le 2; in particular D3=S3D3=S3D_3 = S_3.




A subgroup of a group GGG is a submonoid of GGG
closed under inverses. The monoids of natural numbers and of even
integers are both submonoids of the monoid of integers under addition,
but only the latter submonoid is a subgroup, being closed under
negation, unlike the natural numbers.



An abelian group is a group whose operation is commutative.
The group operation of an abelian group is conventionally referred to as
addition rather than multiplication, and abelian groups are sometimes
called additive groups.



A cyclic group is a group GGG with an
element ggg such that every element of GGG
is of the form gigig^i for some positive
integer iii. Cyclic groups are abelian because
gigj=gi+j=gjgigigj=gi+j=gjgig^{i}g^j = g^{i + j} = g^j g^{i}. The group of integers under addition,
and the groups of integers mod nnn for any positive integer
nnn, all form cyclic groups, with 1 as a generator in every
case. All cyclic groups are isomorphic to one of these. There are
always other generators when the group is of order 3 or more, for
example −1−1-1, and for groups of prime order every nonzero element is
a generator.

2.3 Rings


A ring is an abelian group that is also a monoid by virtue
of having a second operation, called the multiplication
of the ring. Zero annihilates, meaning that 0x=x0=00x=x0=00x = x0 = 0. Furthermore multiplication distributes over
addition (the group operation) in both arguments. That is,
x(y+z)=xy+xzx(y+z)=xy+xzx(y+z) = xy + xz and
(x+y)z=xz+yz(x+y)z=xz+yz(x+y)z = xz + yz.


Examples

 The (abelian) group of integers expanded with the operation of integer multiplication.
 The group of polynomials in one variable xxx with integer
coefficients under polynomial multiplication.
 The group of integer n×nn×nn\times n matrices
under matrix multiplication, for a fixed positive integer nnn.
 The group of numbers of the form a+b√2a+b2a+b\sqrt{2}
where aaa and bbb are integer, because
(a+b√2)(c+d√2)=ac+2bd+(bc+ad)√2(a+b2)(c+d2)=ac+2bd+(bc+ad)2(a+b\sqrt{2})(c+d\sqrt{2}) = ac+2bd+(bc+ad)\sqrt{2}.
 The group of integers mod nnn for n≥2n≥2n \ge 2,
because
(x+an)(y+bn)=xy+(xb+ya+abn)n(x+an)(y+bn)=xy+(xb+ya+abn)n(x+an)(y+bn) = xy + (xb + ya + abn)n.




In all but the last example the integers (other than the integer
nnn giving the size of the matrices) may be replaced by any
of the rationals, the reals, or the complex numbers. When replacing the integers with the reals the fourth example becomes simply the ring of reals because even if bbb is zero aaa can be any real. However when replacing with the rational numbers the ring includes the rationals, but is more than that because √22\sqrt{2}
is irrational, yet it does not contain for example √33\sqrt{3}.

2.4 Fields


A field is a ring for which the multiplicative monoid of
nonzero ring elements is an abelian group. That is, multiplication must
be commutative, and every nonzero element xxx must have a reciprocal
1/x1/x1/x.


Examples

 The ring of rationals, because rational multiplication is
commutative and every nonzero rational m/nm/nm/n has
reciprocal n/mn/mn/m.
 The ring of reals, and the ring of complex numbers, for the
analogous reasons.
 The ring of numbers of the form a+b√2a+b2a+b\sqrt{2}
where aaa and bbb are rational,
because a+b√2a+b2a+b\sqrt{2} is zero only when
a=b=0a=b=0a=b=0, and otherwise has reciprocal
(a−b√2)/(a2−2b2)(a−b2)/(a2−2b2)(a-b\sqrt{2})/(a^2 -2b^2 );
called the field of quadratic irrationals.
 The ring ZpZpZ_p of integers
modulo a prime ppp, because the multiplicative monoid of
nonzero numbers includes a number ggg such that
gp−1=1gp−1=1g^{p-1} = 1 and every
nonzero number has the form gigig^i
for some integer iii, and hence has an inverse, namely
gp−1−igp−1−ig^{p-1-i}.




The last example does not generalize directly to other moduli.
However for any modulus that is a power pnpnp^n
of a prime, it can be shown that there exists a unique multiplication
making the group ZpnZpnZ_{p^n}
a ring in a way that makes the nonzero elements of the ring a
cyclic (and therefore abelian) group under the multiplication, and
hence making the ring a field. The fields constructed in this way are
the only finite fields.

2.5 Applications


Why study entire classes? Well, consider for example the set
ZZZ of integers along with the binary operation of addition
x+yx+yx+y, the unary operation of negation −x−x-x,
and the constant 0. These operations and the constant satisfy
various laws such as x+(y+z)=(x+y)+z,x+y=y+x,x+0=xx+(y+z)=(x+y)+z,x+y=y+x,x+0=xx+(y+z) =
(x+y)+z, x+y = y+x, x+0 = x, and
x+(−x)=0x+(−x)=0x+(-x) = 0. Now consider any other algebra with
operations that not only have the same names but also satisfy the
same laws (and possibly more), called a model of those
laws. Such an algebra could serve any of the following purposes.



(i) It could tell us to what extent the equational laws holding of the
integers characterize the integers. Since the set {0,1}{0,1}\{0, 1\} of integers
mod 2 under addition and negation satisfies all the laws that the
integers do, we immediately see that no single equational property of
the integers tells us that there are infinitely many integers. On the
other hand any finite model of the equational theory of the integers
necessarily satisfies some law that the integers don’t satisfy, in
particular the law x+x+…+x=0x+x+…+x=0x+x+\ldots +x = 0 where
the number of xxxsss on the left hand side is the
size of the model. Since the equational theory of the integers
contains no such law we can tell from its theory as a whole that the
integers must be an infinite set. On the other hand the rational
numbers under addition and negation satisfy exactly the same
equational properties as the integers, so this theory does not
characterize the algebra of integers under addition and subtraction
with sufficient precision to distinguish it from the rationals. 


(ii) It could provide us with a useful new domain that can be
substituted for the integers in any application depending only
on equational properties of the integers, but which differs from
the integers in other (necessarily nonequational) useful respects.
For example the rationals, which satisfy the same laws as we just
noted, differ in having the density property, that between any
two rationals there lies another rational. Another difference is that
it supports division: whereas the ratio of two integers is usually
not an integer, the ratio of two rationals is always a rational.
The reals also satisfy the same equations, and like the rationals are
dense and support division. Unlike the rationals however the reals
have the completeness property, that the set of all upper
bounds of any nonempty set of reals is either empty or has a least
member, needed for convergent sequences to have a limit to converge to.



This idea extends to other operations such as multiplication and
division, as with fields. A particularly useful case of such a
generalization is given by the use of complex numbers in Cartesian
geometry. When xxx and yyy range over the field of
reals, x2+y2=1x2+y2=1x^2 +y^2 =1 describes the ordinary Euclidean
circle in two dimensions, but when the variables range over the
complex numbers this equation describes the complex counterpart of the
circle, visualizable as a two-dimensional surface embedded in four
real dimensions (regarding the complex plane as having two real
dimensions). Or if the variables range over the integers mod 7, which
form a field under the usual arithmetic operations mod 7, the circle
consists of eight points, namely (±1,0),(0,±1)(±1,0),(0,±1)(\pm 1, 0), (0, \pm 1), and
(±2,±2)(±2,±2)(\pm 2, \pm 2). Certain theorems about the Euclidean circle
provable purely algebraically remain provable about these other kinds
of circles because all the equations on which the proof depends
continue to hold in these other fields, for example the theorem that a
line intersects a circle in at most two points.


(iii) It could help us decide whether some list of equational laws
intended to axiomatize the integers is complete in the sense
that any equation holding of the integers follows from the laws in that
list. If some structure satisfies all the axioms in the list, but not
some other equation that holds of the integers, then we have a witness
to the incompleteness of the axiomatization. If on the other hand we
can show how to construct any algebra satisfying the axioms from the
algebra of integers, limiting ourselves only to certain algebraic
constructions, then by a theorem of Birkhoff applicable to those
constructions we can infer that the axiomatization is complete.



(iv) It could give another of way of defining a class, besides the
standard way of listing axioms. In the case at hand, the class of all
algebras with a constant, a unary operation, and a binary operation,
satisfying all the laws satisfied by the integers, is exactly the
class of abelian groups.


3. Universal Algebra


Universal algebra is the next level of abstraction after abstract
algebra. Whereas elementary algebra treats equational reasoning in a
particular algebra such as the field of reals or the field of complex
numbers, and abstract algebra studies particular classes of algebras
such as groups, rings, or fields, universal algebra studies classes
of classes of algebras. Much as abstract algebra numbers groups,
rings, and fields among its basic classes, so does universal algebra
count varieties, quasivarieties, and elementary classes among its
basic classes of classes.



A model of a theory is a structure for which all the equations
of that theory are identities. Terms are built up from variables and
constants using the operations of the theory. An equation is a pair of
terms; it is satisfied by an algebra when the two terms are equal under
all valuations of (assignments of values to) the nnn variables appearing in the terms,
equivalently when they denote the same nnn-ary operation.
A quasiequation is a pair consisting of a finite set of equations,
called the premises or antecedents, and another equation, the conclusion; it is satisfied
by an algebra when the two terms of the conclusion are equal under
all valuations of the nnn variables appearing in the terms
satisfying the premises. A first order formula is a quantified
Boolean combination of relational terms.



A variety is the class of all models of a set of equations.
A quasivariety is the class of all models of a set of
quasiequations. An elementary class is the class of all
models of a set of first-order formulas.

Quasivarieties have received much less attention than either
varieties or elementary classes, and we accordingly say little
about them here. Elementary classes are treated in sufficient depth
elsewhere in this encyclopedia that we need not consider them here. 
We therefore focus in this section on varieties.



Abelian groups, groups, rings, and vector spaces over a given field
all form varieties.

 A central result in this area is the theorem that a lattice arises
as the lattice of subalgebras of some algebra if and only if it arises
as the lattice of congruences on some algebra. Lattices of this sort
are called algebraic lattices. When the congruences of an
algebra permute, its congruence lattice is modular, a strong condition
facilitating the analysis of finite algebras in particular.

3.1 Concepts


Familiar theorems of number theory emerge in algebraic form for
algebras. An algebra AAA is called directly irreducible or
simple when its lattice of congruences is the two-element
lattice consisting of AAA and the one-element algebra,
paralleling the notion of prime number ppp as a number whose
lattice of divisors has two elements ppp and 1. However the
counterpart of the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, that every
positive integer factors uniquely as a product of primes, requires a
more delicate kind of product than direct product. Birkhoff’s notion
of subdirect product enabled him to prove the Subdirect Representation
Theorem, that every algebra arises as the subdirect product of its
subdirectly irreducible quotients. Whereas there are many subdirectly
irreducible groups, the only subdirectly irreducible Boolean algebra
is the initial or two-element one, while the subdirectly irreducible
rings satisfying xn=xxn=xx^n = x for some
n>1n>1n \gt 1 are exactly the finite fields.



Another central topic is duality: Boolean algebras are dual to Stone
spaces, complete atomic Boolean algebras are dual to sets, distributive
lattices with top and bottom are dual to partially ordered sets,
algebraic lattices are dual to semilattices, and so on. Duality
provides two ways of looking at an algebra, one of which may turn out
to be more insightful or easier to work with than the other depending
on the application.



The structure of varieties as classes of all models of some
equational theory is also of great interest. The earliest result in
this area is Birkhoff’s theorem that a class of algebras is a variety
if and only if it is closed under formation of quotients (homomorphic
images), subalgebras, and arbitrary (including empty and infinite)
direct products. This “modern algebra” result constitutes a
completeness theorem for equational logic in terms of its models. Its
elementary counterpart is the theorem that the equational theories on a
free algebra F(V)F(V)F(V), defined as the deductively closed
sets of equations that use variables from VVV, are exactly its
substitutive congruences.



A locally finite variety is one whose finitely generated free algebras
are finite, such as pointed sets, graphs (whether of the directed or
undirected variety), and distributive lattices. A congruence
permutable variety is a variety all of whose algebras are congruence
permutable. Maltsev characterized these in terms of a necessary and
sufficient condition on their theories, namely that FFF(3)
contain an operation t(x,y,z)t(x,y,z)t(x, y, z)
for which t(x,x,y)=t(y,x,x)=yt(x,x,y)=t(y,x,x)=yt(x, x, y) = t(y, x, x) = y are in the
theory. Analogous notions are congruence distributivity and congruence
modularity, for which there exist analogous syntactic
characterizations of varieties of algebras with these properties. A
more recently developed power tool for this area is McKenzie’s notion
of tame congruences, facilitating the study of the structure of finite
algebras. 


Within the algebraic school, varieties have been defined with the
understanding that the operations of a signature form a set. Insights
from category theory, in particular the expression of a variety as a
monad, defined as a monoid object in the category
CCCCC^C of endofunctors of a category
CCC (Set in the case of ordinary universal algebra) indicate
that a cleaner and more general notion of variety is obtained when the
operations can form a proper class. For example the important classes
of complete semilattices, CSLat, and complete atomic
 Boolean algebras,
 CABA, form varieties only with this broader notion of
signature. In the narrow algebraic sense of variety, the dual of a
variety can never be a variety, whereas in the broader monadic notion
of variety, the variety Set of sets is dual to CABA while CSLat is
self-dual.

3.2 Equational Logic

Axiom systems. Identities can also be used to transform
equations to equivalent equations. When those equations are themselves
identities for some domain, the equations they are transformed into
remain identities for that domain. One can therefore start from some
finite set of identities and manufacture an unlimited number of new
identities from them.



For example if we start from just the two identities
(x+y)+z=x+(y+z)(x+y)+z=x+(y+z)(x+y)+z = x+(y+z)
and x+y=y+xx+y=y+xx+y = y+x, we can obtain the
identity (w+x)+(y+z)=(w+y)+(x+z)(w+x)+(y+z)=(w+y)+(x+z)(w+x)+(y+z) =
(w+y)+(x+z) via the following
series of transformations.
(w+x)+(y+z)=((w+x)+y)+z=(w+(x+y))+z=(w+(y+x))+z=((w+y)+x)+z=(w+y)+(x+z)(w+x)+(y+z)=((w+x)+y)+z=(w+(x+y))+z=(w+(y+x))+z=((w+y)+x)+z=(w+y)+(x+z)\begin{align*}
(w+x)+(y+z) &amp;= ((w+x)+y)+z \\
&amp;=(w+(x+y))+z \\
&amp;=(w+(y+x))+z \\
&amp;=((w+y)+x)+z \\
&amp;=(w+y)+(x+z)
\end{align*}


This process of manufacturing new identities from old is called
deduction. Any identity that can be generated by deduction
starting from a given set AAA of identities is called a
consequence of AAA. The set of all consequences of
AAA is called the deductive closure of AAA. We
refer to AAA as an axiomatization of its deductive
closure. A set that is its own deductive closure is said to be
deductively closed. It is straightforward to show that a
set is deductively closed if and only if it is the deductive closure
of some set.



An equational theory is a deductively closed set of
equations, equivalently the set of all consequences of some set
AAA of equations. Every theory always has itself as its own
axiomatization, but it will usually also have smaller
axiomatizations. A theory that has a finite axiomatization is said to
be finitely based or finitely axiomatizable.


Effectiveness. Finitely based theories can
be effectively enumerated. That is, given a finite set AAA of
equations, one can write a computer program that prints consequences
of AAA for ever in such a way that every consequence of
AAA will appear at some finite position in the infinite list of
all consequences. The same conclusion obtains when we weaken the
requirement that AAA be finite to merely that it can be
effectively enumerated. That is, if the axiomatization is effectively
enumerable so is its deductive closure.



(In reconciling the finite with the infinite, bear in mind that if
we list all the natural numbers 0, 1, 2, … in order, we obtain an
infinite list every member of which is only finitely far from the
beginning, and also has a well-defined predecessor (except for 0) and successor. Only
if we attempt to pad this list out at the “end” with infinite numbers
does this principle break down.


One way to visualize there being an “end” that could have
more elements beyond it is to consider the rationals of the form
1/n1/n1/n for all nonzero integers nnn, in increasing order. This list
starts out −1/1,−1/2,−1/3,…−1/1,−1/2,−1/3,…-1/1, -1/2, -1/3,\ldots and after listing infinitely
many negative rationals of that form, with no greatest such, switches
over to positive rationals, with no first such, finally ending with
1/3, 1/2, 1/1. The entire list is discrete in the sense that every
rational except the endpoints −1/1−1/1-1/1 and 1/1 has a well-defined
predecessor and successor in this subset of the rationals, unlike the
situation for the set of all rationals between −1/1−1/1-1/1 and
1/11/11/1. This would no longer be the case were we to introduce the
rational 0 “in the middle”, which would have neither a
predecessor nor a successor.)


Equational Logic. Our informal account of
deduction can be formalized in terms of five rules for producing new
identities from old. In the following, sss and ttt denote
arbitrary terms.


(R1)
From nothing infer t=tt=tt = t.

(R2)
From s=ts=ts = t infer t=st=st = s.

(R3)
From s=ts=ts = t and t=ut=ut = u infer s=us=us = u.

(R4)
From s1=t1,s2=t2,…,sn=tns1=t1,s2=t2,…,sn=tns_1 = t_1, s_2 = t_2 , \ldots ,s_n = t_n
infer f(s1,s2,…,sn)=f(t1,t2,…,tn)f(s1,s2,…,sn)=f(t1,t2,…,tn)f(s_1, s_2 , \ldots ,s_n)= f(t_1, t_2 , \ldots ,t_n), where
fff is an nnn-ary operation.
(R5)
From s=ts=ts = t infer s′=t′s′=t′s' = t' where s′s′s' and
t′t′t' are the terms resulting from consistently substituting terms
for variables in sss and ttt respectively.




“Consistently” in this context means that if a term is
substituted for one occurrence of a given variable, the same term must
be substituted for all occurrences of that variable in both sss and
ttt. We could not for example appeal solely to R5 to
justify substituting u+vu+vu+v for xxx in the left hand side of x+y=y+xx+y=y+xx+y
= y+x and v+uv+uv+u for xxx in the right hand side, though some
other rule might permit it. 


An equational theory as a set of pairs of terms amounts to a binary
relation on the set of all terms. Rules R1–R3
correspond to respectively reflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity of
this binary relation, i.ei.ei.e. these three rules assert
that an equational theory is an equivalence relation. Rule
R4 expresses the further property that this binary relation
is a congruence. Rule R5 further asserts that the
relation is a substitutive congruence. It can be shown that a binary
relation on the set of terms is an equational theory if and only if it
is a substitutive congruence. These five rules therefore completely
axiomatize equational logic in the sense that every consequence of a
set AAA of equations can be produced from AAA via finitely many
applications of these five rules.

3.3 Birkhoff’s Theorem


A variety is by definition the class of models of some equational
theory. In 1935 Birkhoff provided an equivalent characterization of
varieties as any class closed under quotients (homomorphic images),
direct products, and subalgebras. These notions are defined as
follows.



Given two algebras
(X,f1,…fk)(X,f1,…fk)(X, f_1 , \ldots f_k)
and
(Y,g1,…gk)(Y,g1,…gk)(Y, g_1 , \ldots g_k), a homomorphism
h:(X,f1,…fk)→(Y,g1,…gk)h:(X,f1,…fk)→(Y,g1,…gk)h:
(X, f_1 , \ldots f_k) \rightarrow 
(Y, g_1 , \ldots g_k) is a function h:X→Yh:X→Yh: X \rightarrow Y satisfying
h(fi(x0,…,xni−1))=gi(h(x0),…,h(xni−1)))h(fi(x0,…,xni−1))=gi(h(x0),…,h(xni−1)))h(f_i (x_0 , \ldots ,x_{n_{ i}-1 }))
= g_i (h(x_0), \ldots ,h(x_{n_{ i}-1 })))
for each iii from 1 to kkk where ninin_i is the
arity of both fifif_i and gigig_i.



A subalgebra of an algebra is a set of elements of the algebra
closed under the operations of the algebra.



Let III be an arbitrary set, which may be empty, finite, or
infinite. A family ⟨Ai⟩i∈I⟨Ai⟩i∈I\langle A_{i}\rangle_{i\in I} of
algebras (Xi,fi1,…,fik)(Xi,f1i,…,fki)(X_i, f_{1}^i,\ldots, f_k^i) indexed by III consists of
one algebra AiAiA_i for each element iii of III. We define
the direct product ΠAiΠAi\Pi A_i (or Πi∈IAiΠi∈IAi\Pi_{i\in I} A_i in
full) of such a family as follows. 


The underlying set of ΠAiΠAi\Pi A_i is the cartesian product ΠXiΠXi\Pi X_i
of the underlying sets XiXiX_i, and consists of those III-tuples
whose iii-th element is some element of XiXiX_i.  (III may even be
uncountable, but in this case the nonemptiness of ΠXiΠXi\Pi X_i as a
consequence of the nonemptiness of the individual XiXiX_i’s is
equivalent to the axiom of choice. This should be kept in mind for any
constructive applications of Birkhoff’s theorem.)



The jjj-th operation of ΠAiΠAi\Pi A_i, of
arity njnjn_j, takes an
njnjn_j-tuple ttt of elements of
ΠXiΠXi\Pi X_i
and produces
the III-tuple
⟨fij(ti1,…tinj)⟩i∈I⟨fji(t1i,…tnji)⟩i∈I\langle f_{j}^i(t_{1}^i , \ldots t_{n_{ j} }^i)\rangle_{i\in I}
where
tiktkit_k^i is the iii-th component of the
kkk-th component of ttt for kkk from 1 to
njnjn_j.



Given two algebras AAA, BBB and a homomorphism
h:A→Bh:A→Bh: A \rightarrow B, the homomorphic image
h(A)h(A)h(A) is the subalgebra of BBB consisting
of elements of the form h(a)h(a)h(a) for aaa
in AAA.



Given a class CCC of algebras, we write P(C)P(C)P(C)
for the class of all algebras formed as direct products of families
of algebras of C,S(C)C,S(C)C, S(C) for the class of
all subalgebras of algebras of CCC, and H(C)H(C)H(C)
for the class of all homomorphic images of algebras of CCC.



It is relatively straightforward to show that any equation
satisfied by all the members of CCC is also satisfied by all
the members of P(C),S(C)P(C),S(C)P(C), S(C),
and H(C)H(C)H(C). Hence for a variety V,P(V)=S(V)=H(V)V,P(V)=S(V)=H(V)V,
P(V) = S(V) = H(V).



Birkhoff’s theorem is the converse: for any class CCC
such that P(C)=S(C)=H(C),CP(C)=S(C)=H(C),CP(C) = S(C)
= H(C), C is a variety. In fact
the theorem is slightly stronger: for any class CCC,
HSP(C)(C)(C) is a variety. That is, to construct all the
models of the theory of CCC it suffices to close CCC
first under direct products, then under subalgebras, and finally under
homomorphic images; that is, later closures do not compromise earlier
ones provided P,SP,SP, S, and HHH are performed
in that order.



A basic application of Birkhoff’s theorem is in proving the
completeness of a proposed axiomatization of a class CCC.
Given an arbitrary model of the axioms, it suffices to show that the
model can be constructed as the homomorphic image of a subalgebra of
a direct product of algebras of CCC.



This completeness technique complements the completeness observed in the
previous section for the rules of equational logic.

4. Linear Algebra
4.1 Vector Spaces


Sibling to groups, rings, and fields is the class of vector
spaces over any given field, constituting the universes of linear
algebra. Vector spaces lend themselves to two opposite approaches:
axiomatic or abstract, and synthetic or concrete. The axiomatic
approach takes fields (whence rings, whence groups) as a prerequisite;
it first defines a notion of RRR-module as an abelian group with
a scalar multiplication over a given ring RRR, and then defines
a vector space to be an RRR-module for which RRR is a
field. The synthetic approach proceeds via the familiar representation
of vector spaces over the reals as nnn-tuples of reals, and of
linear transformations from mmm-dimensional to
nnn-dimensional vector spaces as m×nm×nm\times n
matrices of reals. For the full generality of vector spaces including
those of infinite dimension, nnn need not be limited to finite
numbers but can be any cardinal.



The abstract approach, as adopted by such classical texts as Mac
Lane and Birkhoff, has a certain purist appeal and is ideally suited to
mathematics majors. The concrete approach has the benefit of being able
to substitute calculus or less for groups-rings-fields as a
prerequisite, suiting it to service courses for scientists and
engineers needing only finite-dimensional matrix algebra, which enjoys
enormous practical applicability. Linear algebra over other fields, in
particular finite fields, is used in coding theory, quantum computing,
etc., for which the abstract approach tends to be better suited.



For any field FFF, up to isomorphism there is exactly one
vector space over FFF of any given finite dimension. This is a
theorem in the abstract approach, but is an immediate consequence of
the representation in the concrete approach (the theorem is used in
relating the two approaches).



Another immediate consequence of the concrete approach is duality for
finite-dimensional vector spaces over FFF. To every vector space
VVV, of any dimension, corresponds its dual space V∗V∗V^* comprised
of the functionals on VVV, defined as the linear
transformations f:V→Ff:V→Ff: V\rightarrow F, viewing the field FFF as the
one-dimensional vector space. The functionals form a vector space
under coordinatewise addition (f+g)(u)=f(u)+g(u)(f+g)(u)=f(u)+g(u)(f+g)(u) = f(u)+g(u) and
multiplication (xgf)(u)=x(f(u))(xgf)(u)=x(f(u))(xgf)(u) = x(f(u)) by any scalar xxx in FFF,
and we take V∗V∗V^* to be that space. This operation on vector spaces
extends to the linear transformations f:U→Vf:U→Vf: U\rightarrow V as f∗:V∗→U∗f∗:V∗→U∗f^* :
V^*\rightarrow U^* defined such that fff maps each functional g:V→Fg:V→Fg:
V\rightarrow F to ggf:U→Fggf:U→Fggf: U\rightarrow F. Repeating this operation
produces a vector space that, in the finite-dimensional case, is
isomorphic to VVV, that is, V≅V∗∗V≅V∗∗V \cong V^{**}, making the operation
an involution. The essence of duality for finite-dimensional vector
spaces resides in its involutary nature along with the reversal of the
linear transformations.



This duality is easily visualized in the concrete approach by viewing
linear transformations from UUU to VVV as
m×nm×nm\times n matrices. The duality
simply transposes the matrices while leaving the machinery of matrix
multiplication itself unchanged. It is then immediate that this
operation is an involution that reverses maps—the
m×nm×nm\times n matrix linearly
transforming an nnn-dimensional space UUU to an
mmm-dimensional one VVV transposes to an
n×mn×mn\times m matrix linearly
transforming the mmm-dimensional space V∗V∗V^*
to the nnn-dimensional space U∗U∗U^*. 
4.2 Associative Algebras


The linear transformations f:V→Vf:V→Vf: V\rightarrow V on
a vector space VVV can be added, subtracted, and multiplied by
scalars, pointwise in each case, and hence form a vector space. When
the space has finite dimension nnn, the linear transformations
are representable as n×nn×nn\times n matrices.



In addition they can be composed, whence they form a vector space
equipped with a bilinear associative operation, namely composition. In the
finite-dimensional case, composition is just the usual matrix
product. Vector spaces furnished with such a product constitute
associative algebras. Up to isomorphism, all associative
algebras arise in this way whether of finite or infinite dimension,
providing a satisfactory and insightful characterization of the notion
in lieu of an axiomatic characterization, not given here.



Well-known examples of associative algebras are the reals, the
complex numbers, and the quaternions. Unlike
vector spaces, many nonisomorphic associative algebras of any given
dimension greater than one are possible.



A class of associative algebras of interest to physicists is that of
the Clifford algebras. Clifford algebras over the reals (which as
vector spaces are Euclidean spaces) generalize complex numbers and
quaternions by permitting any number of formal quantities eee
analogous to i=√−1i=−1i = \sqrt{-1} to be adjoined to the field
of reals. The common feature of these quantities is that each satisfies
either e2=−1e2=−1e^2 = -1 or e2=1e2=1e^2 = 1.
Whereas there are a great many associative algebras of low dimension,
only a few of them arise as Clifford algebras. The reals form the only
one-dimensional Clifford algebra, while the hyperbolic plane, defined
by e2=1e2=1e^2 = 1, and the complex plane, defined by
e2=−1e2=−1e^2 = -1, are the two two-dimensional Clifford
algebras. The hyperbolic plane is just the direct square of the real
field, meaning that its product is coordinatewise, 
(a,b)(c,d)=(agc,bgd)(a,b)(c,d)=(agc,bgd)(a, b)(c, d) = (agc, bgd), unlike that of the complex plane where it
defined by (a,b)(c,d)=(agc−bd,ad+bc)(a,b)(c,d)=(agc−bd,ad+bc)(a, b)(c, d) = (agc-bd, ad+bc).
The two four-dimensional Clifford algebras are the 2×22×22\times 2 matrices
and the quaternions. Whereas the 2×22×22\times 2 matrices contain zero
divisors (nonzero matrices whose product is zero), and so form only a
ring, the quaternions contain no zero divisors and so form a division
ring. Unlike the complex numbers however the quaternions do not form a
field because their multiplication is not commutative. Complex
multiplication however makes the complex plane a commutative division
ring, that is, a field.

5. Algebraization of mathematics


A number of branches of mathematics have benefited from the
perspective of algebra. Each of algebraic geometry and algebraic
combinatorics has an entire journal devoted to it, while algebraic
topology, algebraic logic, and algebraic number theory all have strong
followings. Many other more specialized areas of mathematics have
similarly benefited.

5.1 Algebraic geometry


Algebraic geometry begins with what we referred to in the
introduction as shapes, for example lines y=y=y = ax+b+b+b,
circles x2+y2=r2x2+y2=r2x^2 +y^2 = r^2, spheres
x2+y2+z2=r2x2+y2+z2=r2x^2 +y^2 +z^2 = r^2, conic sections f(x,y)=0f(x,y)=0f(x,
y) = 0 where fff is a quadratic polynomial in
xxx and yyy, quadric surfaces f(x,y,z)=0f(x,y,z)=0f(x,
y, z) = 0 with fff again quadratic, and so on.



It is convenient to collect the two sides of these equations on the
left so that the right side is always zero. We may then define a
shape or variety to consist of the roots or zeros of a polynomial, or more generally the common zeros of a set of polynomials.


Ordinary analytical or Cartesian geometry is conducted over the reals.
Algebraic geometry is more commonly conducted over the complex numbers,
or more generally over any algebraically closed field. The varieties
definable in this way are called affine varieties.



Sometimes however algebraic closure is not desirable, for example
when working at the boundary of algebraic geometry and number theory
where the field may be finite, or the rationals.



Many kinds of objects are characterized by what structure their maps
hold invariant. Posets transform via monotone functions, leaving order
invariant. Algebras transform via homomorphisms, leaving the algebraic
structure invariant. In algebraic geometry varieties transform via
regular nnn-ary functions f:An→Af:An→Af: A^n \rightarrow A, defined as functions that are locally rational polynomials
in nnn variables. Locally rational means that at each point of
the domain of fff there exists a neighborhood on which fff
is the ratio of two polynomials, the denominator of which is nonzero in
that neighborhood.



This notion generalizes to regular functions f:An→Amf:An→Amf: A^n \rightarrow A^m
defined as mmm-tuples of regular nnn-ary functions.



Given two varieties V,V′V,V′V, V' in
AnAnA^n and AmAmA^m
respectively, a regular function from AnAnA^n
to AmAmA^m whose restriction to VVV is
a function from VVV to V′V′V' is called a regular
function of varieties. The category of affine varieties is then
defined to have as its objects all affine varieties and as its
morphisms all regular functions thereof.


Polynomials being continuous, one would expect regular functions between
varieties to be continuous also. A difficulty arises with the shapes of
varieties, where there can be cusps, crossings, and other symptoms of
singularity. What is needed here is a suitable topology by which to
judge continuity.


The trick is to work not in affine space but its projective
space. To illustrate with Euclidean three-space, its associated
projective space is the unit sphere with antipodal points identified,
forming a two-dimensional manifold. Equivalently this is the space of
all (unoriented) lines through the origin. Given an arbitrary affine
space, its associated projective space is the space of all such lines,
understood as a manifold.


The topology on projective space appropriate for algebraic geometry
is the Zariski topology, defined not by its open sets but
rather by its closed sets, which are taken to be the algebraic sets,
namely those sets constituting the common zeros of a set of homogeneous
polynomials. The crucial theorem is then that regular maps between
affine varieties are continuous with respect to the Zariski topology.
5.2 Algebraic number theory


Algebraic number theory has adopted these generalizations of
algebraic geometry. One class of varieties in particular that has been
of great importance to number are elliptical curves.



A celebrated success of algebraic number theory has
been Andrew Wiles’ proof of Fermat’s so-called “last theorem.” This
had remained an open problem for over three and a half centuries.

5.3 Algebraic topology


Algebraic topology analyzes the holes and obstructions in connected
topological spaces. A topologist is someone who imagines all objects to
be made of unbreakable but very pliable playdough, and therefore does
not see the need to distinguish between a coffee cup and doughnut
because either can be turned into the other. Topology is concerned with
the similarities and differences between coffee cups with nnn
handles, surfaces with nnn holes, and more complicated shapes.
Algebraic topology expresses the invariants of such shapes in terms of
their homotopy groups and homology groups.

5.4 Algebraic logic


Algebraic logic got off to an early start with Boole’s introduction
of Boolean algebra in an 1847 pamphlet. The methods of modern algebra
began to be applied to Boolean algebra in the 20th
century. Algebraic logic then broadened its interests to first order
logic and modal logic. Central algebraic notions in first order logic
are ultraproducts, elementary equivalence, and elementary and
pseudoelementary varieties. Tarski’s cylindric algebras constitute a
particular abstract formulation of first order logic in terms of
diagonal relations coding equality and substitution relations encoding
variables. Modal logic as a fragment of first order logic is made
algebraic via Boolean modules.

6. Free Algebras


Given any system such as integer arithmetic or real arithmetic, we can
write TTT for the set of all definite terms such as 1+(2/3)1+(2/3)1 + (2/3)
built from constants and constituting the definite language, and
T[V]T[V]T[V] for the larger indefinite language permitting variables drawn
from a set VVV in place of some of the constant symbols, with terms
such as x+(2/y)x+(2/y)x + (2/y). When VVV contains only a single variable
“x”“x”“x”, T[{“x”}]T[{“x”}]T[\{“x”\}] is usually
abbreviated to T[“x”]T[“x”]T[“x”] or just T[xT[xT[x] which is
usually unambiguous. This convention extends to the algebra ΦΦ\Phi
of terms of TTT together with its list of operation symbols viewed
as operations for combining terms; we write Φ[VΦ[V\Phi[V] and call it
the term algebra on VVV.



This notion of term algebra is a purely syntactic one involving only the operation symbols, constants, and variables of some language. The terms 2+32+32 + 3 and 3+23+23 + 2 are distinct; likewise x+yx+yx + y and y+xy+xy + x are distinct terms. As such they can be considered concrete terms.
Now in a universe such as the integers certain concrete terms are equivalent in the sense that they always evaluate to the same element of the universe regardless of the values of their variable, for example x+yx+yx + y and y+xy+xy + x. It is convenient to collect equivalent concrete terms into equivalence classes each of which is to be thought of as an abstract term.

As a simple example of abstract terms consider linear polynomials of the form ax+byax+byax + by where aaa and bbb are nonnegative integers, for example 7x+3y7x+3y7x + 3y. The set of all such polynomials includes 0 and is closed under polynomial addition, an associative and commutative operation. This set together with the operation of addition and the zero polynomial therefore constitutes a commutative monoid.

This monoid is an example of a free algebra, namely the free commutative monoid on two generators xxx and yyy. What makes it free is that it satisfies no laws other than those of a commutative monoid. It is not however a free monoid because it satisfies the commutative law. The free monoid on two generators xxx and yyy is instead the set of all finite strings over the two-letter alphabet {x,y}{x,y}\{x,y\}.

When commutativity is introduced as a law, it identifies the
previously distinct strings xyxyxy and yxyxyx as a single polynomial;
more generally any two strings with the same number of xxxs
and yyys are identified. 

Free monoids and free commutative monoids are examples of free CCC-algebras where CCC is a class of algebras. In these two examples the class CCC is respectively that of monoids and commutative monoids.
 
A free CCC-algebra is an algebra that lives at the frontier of
syntax and semantics. On the semantic side it is a member of CCC. On
the syntactic side its elements behave like terms subject to the laws
of CCC, but no other laws expressible with its
generators. Commutativity xy=yxxy=yxxy = yx is expressible with two
generators and so a free monoid on two or more generators cannot be
commutative, though the free monoid on one generator, namely the set
of all finite strings over a one-letter alphabet does form a
commutative monoid on one generator.



On the syntactic
side, the free CCC-algebra BBB on a set XXX arises
as a quotient of the term algebra formed from XXX (viewed as
a set of variables) using the operation symbols and constants common
to the algebras of CCC. The quotient identifies those terms
that have the same value for all algebras AAA of CCC
and all valuations assigning values in AAA to the variables of
XXX. This performs just enough identifications to satisfy every
law of CCC (thereby making this quotient a CCC-algebra)
while still retaining the syntactic essence of the original term
algebra in a sense made more precise by the following paragraph.



(Since the concept of a term algebra can seem a little circular in
places, a more detailed account may clarify the concept. Given the
language of CCC, meaning the operation symbols and constant
symbols common to the algebras of CCC, along with a set
XXX of variables, we first form the underlying set of the
algebra, and then interpret the symbols of the language as operations
on and values in that set. The set itself consists of the terms built
in the usual way from those variables and constant symbols using the
operation symbols; in that sense these elements are syntactic. But now
we change our point of view by treating those elements as semantic, and
we look to the constant symbols and operation symbols of the language
as syntactic entities needing to be interpreted in this semantic domain
(albeit of terms) in order to turn this set of terms into an algebra of
terms. We interpret each constant symbol as itself. And we interpret
each nnn-ary operation symbol fff as the nnn-ary
operation that takes any nnn terms t1,…,tnt1,…,tnt_1 ,
\ldots ,t_n as its nnn arguments
and returns the single term f(t1,…,tn)f(t1,…,tn)f(t_1 , \ldots ,t_n). Note that this interpretation of
fff only returns a term, it does not actually
build it. All term building was completed when we produced the
underlying set of the algebra.)



From the semantic side, a CCC-algebra BBB together with a subset
XXX of BBB thought of as variables is said to be a free
CCC-algebra on XXX, or is freely generated by XXX, when, given
any CCC-algebra AAA, any valuation in AAA of the variables in
XXX (that is, any function f:X→Af:X→Af: X\rightarrow A) uniquely extends
to a homomorphism h:B→Ah:B→Ah: B\rightarrow A. (We say that h:B→Ah:B→Ah:
B\rightarrow A extends f:X→Af:X→Af: X\rightarrow A when the restriction of
hhh to XXX is fff.)



As a convenient shorthand a free CCC-algebra on no generators
can also be called an initial CCC-algebra. An initial
CCC-algebra has exactly one homomorphism to every
CCC-algebra.



Before proceeding to the examples it is worthwhile pointing out an
important basic property of free algebras as defined from the semantic
side.


Two free algebras B,B′B,B′B, B' on respective
generator sets X,YX,YX, Y having the same cardinality are
isomorphic.



By way of proof, pick any bijection f:X→Yf:X→Yf:
X\rightarrow Y. This, its inverse f′:Y→Xf′:Y→Xf':
Y\rightarrow X, and the two identity functions on
respectively XXX and YYY, form a system of four functions
closed under composition. Each of these functions is from a generator
set to an algebra and therefore has a unique extension to a
homomorphism. These four homomorphisms are also closed under
composition. The one from BBB to itself extends the identity
function on XXX and therefore must be the identity homomorphism
on BBB (since the latter exists and its restriction to
XXX is the identity function on X)X)X). Likewise the
homomorphism from GGG to GGG is an identity function.
Hence the homomorphisms between BBB and GGG compose in
either order to identities, which makes them isomorphisms. But this is
what it means for BBB and B′B′B' to be
isomorphic.



This fact allows us to say the free algebra on a given set,
thinking of isomorphic algebras as being “morally” the same. Were this
not the case, our quotient construction would be incomplete as it
produces a unique free algebra, whereas the above definition of free
algebra allows any algebra isomorphic to that produced by the quotient
construction to be considered free. Since all free algebras on
XXX are isomorphic, the quotient construction is as good as any,
and is furthermore one way of proving that they exist. It also
establishes that the choice of set of variables is irrelevant except
for its cardinality, as intuition would suggest.

6.1 Free monoids and groups


Take CCC to be the class of monoids. The term
algebra determined by the binary operation symbol and the constant
symbol for identity can be viewed as binary trees with variables and
copies of the constant symbol at the leaves. Identifying trees
according to associativity has the effect of flattening the trees into
words that ignore the order in which the operation was applied (without
however reversing the order of any arguments). This produces words over
the alphabet XXX together with the identity. The identity laws
then erase the identities, except in the case of a word consisting only
of the identity symbol, which we take to be the empty word.



Thus the monoid of finite words over an alphabet XXX is the
free monoid on XXX.



Another representation of the free monoid on nnn generators
is as an infinite tree, every vertex of which has nnn
descendants, one for each letter of the alphabet, with each edge
labeled by the corresponding letter. Each vertex vvv represents
the word consisting of the letters encountered along the path from the
root to vvv. The concatenation of uuu and vvv is
the vertex arrived at by taking the subtree whose root is the vertex
uuu, noticing that this tree is isomorphic to the full tree, and
locating vvv in this subtree as though it were the full
tree.



If we ignore the direction and labels of the edges in this tree we
can still identify the root: it is the only vertex with nnn
edges incident on it, all other vertices have n+1n+1n+1, namely the
one incoming edge and the nnn outgoing ones.



The free commutative monoid on a set is that monoid whose
generators behave like letters just as for free monoids (in particular
they are still atoms), but which satisfy the additional law ugv=vuugv=vuugv =
vu. We make further identifications, e.g. of
“dog” and “dgo”. Order of letters in a word is
now immaterial, all that matters is how many copies there are of each
letter. This information can be represented as an nnn-tuple of
natural numbers where nnn is the size of the alphabet. Thus the free
commutative monoid on nnn generators is NnNnN^n, the algebra of
nnn-tuples of natural numbers under addition.



It can also be obtained from the tree representation of the free
monoid by identifying vertices. Consider the case n=2n=2n = 2 of
two letters. Since the identifications do not change word length, all
identifications are of vertices at the same depth from the root. We
perform all identifications simultaneously as follows. At every vertex
vvv, identify v01v01v_{01} and
v10v10v_{10} and their subtrees. Whereas before there were
2n2n2^n vertices at depth nnn, now there are
n+1n+1n+1. Furthermore instead of a tree we have the upper right
quadrant of the plane, that is, N2N2N^2, rotated 135 degrees
clockwise, with every vertex vvv at the top of a diamond whose
other vertices are v0v0v_0 and v1v1v_1
at the next level down, and the identified pair
v01=v10v01=v10v_{01} = v_{10} below both. 


To form the free group on nnn generators, first form the free
monoid on 2n2n2n generators, with generators organized into
complementary pairs each the inverse of the other, and then delete all
adjacent complementary pairs from all words.



This view is not particularly insightful. The group counterpart of the
tree representation does a better job of presenting a free group.
Consider the free group on n=2n=2n = 2 generators AAA and
BBB. We start with the free monoid on 4 generators A,B,a,bA,B,a,bA,
B, a, b where aaa is the inverse of AAA and
bbb that of BBB. Every vertex of this tree has 4
descendants. So the root has degree 4 and the remaining vertices have
degree 5: every vertex except the root has one edge going in, say the
generator aaa, and four out. Consider any nonroot vertex vvv. The
effect of deleting adjacent complementary pairs is to identify the
immediate ancestor of vvv with one of the four descendants of
vvv, namely the one that makes the path from the ancestor to
the descendant a complementary pair. For every nonroot vertex
vvv these identifications reduce the degree of vvv from
5 to 4. The root remains at degree 4.



So now we have an infinite graph every vertex of which has degree 4.
Unlike the tree for the free monoid on 2 generators, where the root
is topologically different from the other vertices, the tree for the
free group on 2 generators is entirely homogeneous. Thus if we throw
away the vertex labels and rely only on the edge labels to navigate,
any vertex can be taken as the identity of the group.



This homogeneity remains the case for the free abelian group on 2
generators, whose vertices are still of degree 4. However the
additional identifications turns it from a tree (a graph with no
cycles) to a grid whose vertices are the lattice points of the plane.
That is, the free group on 2 generators is Z2Z2Z^2, and
on nnn generators ZnZnZ^n. The edges are
the line segments joining adjacent lattice points.
6.2 Free rings


With no generators the free monoid, free group, and free ring are
all the one-element algebra consisting of just the additive identity 0.
A ring with identity means having a multiplicative identity, that is, a
word εε\varepsilon. But this makes εε\varepsilon a generator for the additive
group of the ring, and the free abelian group on one generator is the
integers. So the free ring with identity on no generators is the
integers under addition and now multiplication.



The free ring on one generator xxx must include x2,x3x2,x3x^2 , x^3,
etc. by multiplication, but these can be added and subtracted
resulting in polynomials such as 7x3−3x2+2x7x3−3x2+2x7x^3 -3x^2 +2x but without a
constant term, with the exception of 0 itself. The distributivity law
for rings means that a term such as (7x+x2)(2x3+x)(7x+x2)(2x3+x)(7x+x^2 )(2x^3 +x) can be
expanded as 7x2+x3+14x4+2x57x2+x3+14x4+2x57x^2 +x^3 +14x^4 +2x^5. It should now be clear that
these are just ordinary polynomials with no constant term; in
particular we are missing the zero-degree polynomial 1 and so this
ring has no multiplicative identity. However it is a commutative ring
even though we did not specify this. The free ring with identity on
one generator introduces 1 as the multiplicative identity and becomes
the ordinary one-variable polynomials since now we can form all the
integers. Just as with monoids, the free ring with identity on two
generators is not commutative, the polynomials xgyxgyxgy and ygxygxygx
being distinct. The free commutative ring with identity on
two generators however consists of the ordinary two-variable
polynomials over the integers.

6.3 Free combinatorial structures


From the examples so far one might conclude that all free algebras
on one or more generators are infinite. This is by no means always the
case; as counterexamples we may point to a number of classes: sets,
pointed sets, bipointed sets, graphs, undirected graphs, Boolean
algebras, distributive lattices, etc. Each of these forms a locally
finite variety as defined earlier.



A pointed set is an algebra with one constant, say ccc. The
free pointed set on xxx and yyy has three elements,
x,yx,yx, y, and ccc. A bipointed set is an algebra
with two constants ccc and ddd, and the free bipointed
set on xxx and yyy then has four elements, x,y,cx,y,cx,
y, c, and ddd.



Graphs, of the oriented kind arising in say automata theory where
multiple edges may connect the same two vertices, can be organized as
algebras having two unary operations sss and ttt satisfying
s(s(x))=t(s(x))=s(x)s(s(x))=t(s(x))=s(x)s(s(x)) = t(s(x)) = s(x) and t(t(x))=s(t(x))=t(x)t(t(x))=s(t(x))=t(x)t(t(x)) = s(t(x)) = t(x). The
free graph on one generator xxx has three elements, x,s(x)x,s(x)x, s(x), and
t(x)t(x)t(x), constituting respectively an edge and its two endpoints
or vertices. In this framework the vertices are the elements
satisfying s(x)=xs(x)=xs(x) = x (and hence t(x)=xt(x)=xt(x) = x since x=s(x)=t(s(x))=t(x)x=s(x)=t(s(x))=t(x)x = s(x) =
t(s(x)) = t(x)); all other elements constitute edges. The free graph
on nnn generators consists of nnn such edges, all
independent. Other graphs arise by identifying elements. There is no
point identifying an edge with either another edge or a vertex since
that simply absorbs the first edge into the second entity. This leaves
only vertices; identifying two vertices yields a single vertex common
to two edges, or to the same edge in the identification s(x)=t(x)s(x)=t(x)s(x) =
t(x) creating a self-loop.



The term “oriented” is to be preferred to “directed” because a
directed graph as understood in combinatorics is an oriented graph with the
additional property that if s(x)=s(y)s(x)=s(y)s(x) = s(y) and t(x)=t(y)t(x)=t(y)t(x) = t(y) then x=yx=yx = y; that is, only one
edge is permitted between two vertices in a given direction.



Unoriented graphs are defined as for graphs with an additional unary
operation ggg satisfying g(g(x))=xg(g(x))=xg(g(x)) = x and s(g(x))=t(x)s(g(x))=t(x)s(g(x)) = t(x)
(whence s(x)=s(g(g(x)))=t(g(x)))s(x)=s(g(g(x)))=t(g(x)))s(x) = s(g(g(x))) = t(g(x))). The free undirected graph on
xxx consists of x,s(x),t(x)x,s(x),t(x)x, s(x), t(x), and g(x)g(x)g(x), with the pair x,g(x)x,g(x)x,
g(x) constituting the two one-way lanes of a two-lane highway
between s(x)=t(g(x))s(x)=t(g(x))s(x) = t(g(x)) and t(x)=s(g(x)t(x)=s(g(x)t(x) = s(g(x)). Identification of
elements of undirected graphs works as for their oriented
counterparts: it is only worth identifying vertices. However there is
one interesting twist here: vertices can be of two kinds, those
satisfying x=g(x)x=g(x)x = g(x) and those not. The latter kind of vertex is
now asymmetric: one direction of the bidirectional edge is identified
with its vertices while the other one forms an oriented loop in the
sense that its other direction is a vertex. This phenomenon does not
arise for undirected graphs defined as those satisfying “if
s(x)=s(y)s(x)=s(y)s(x) = s(y) and t(x)=t(y)t(x)=t(y)t(x) = t(y) then x=yx=yx = y.”

6.4 Free logical structures


Boolean algebras are traditionally defined axiomatically as
complemented distributive lattices, which has the benefit of showing
that they form a variety, and furthermore a finitely axiomatizable one.
However Boolean algebras are so fundamental in their own right that,
rather than go to the trouble of defining lattice, distributive, and
complemented just for this purpose, it is easier as well as more
insightful to obtain them from the initial Boolean algebra. It suffices
to define this as the two-element set {0,1}{0,1}\{0, 1\}, the constants (zeroary
operations) 0 and 1, and the 222=16222=162^{2^2} = 16 binary operations. A
Boolean algebra is then any algebra with those 16 operations and two
constants satisfying the equations satisfied by the initial Boolean
algebra.



An almost-definitive property of the class of Boolean algebras is
that their polynomials in the initial Boolean algebra are all the
operations on that algebra. The catch is that the inconsistent class
consisting of only the one-element or inconsistent algebra also has
this property. This class is easily ruled out however by adding that
Boolean algebra is consistent. But just barely—adding any new
equation to Boolean algebra (without introducing new operations)
axiomatizes the inconsistent algebra.



Sheffer has shown that the constants and the 16 operations can be
generated as polynomials in just one constant, which can be 0 or 1,
and one binary operation, which can be NAND, ¬(x∧y)¬(x∧y)\neg(x\wedge y), or
NOR, ¬(x∨y)¬(x∨y)\neg(x\vee y). Any such sufficient set is called a
basis. Along the same lines Stone has shown that conjunction,
exclusive-or, and the constant 1 form a basis. The significance of
Stone’s basis over Sheffer’s is that Boolean algebras
organized with those operations satisfy all the axioms for a
commutative ring with identity with conjunction as multiplication and
exclusive-or as addition, as well as the law x2=1x2=1x^2 = 1. Any ring
satisfying this last condition is called a Boolean ring.
Boolean rings are equivalent to Boolean algebras in the sense that
they have the same polynomials.



An atom of a Boolean algebra is an element xxx such that for
all y,x∧yy,x∧yy, x\wedge y is either xxx or 0. An
atomless Boolean algebra is one with no atoms.



There is exactly one Boolean algebra of cardinality every finite
power of 2, and it is isomorphic to the Boolean algebra of a power set
2X2X2^X of that cardinality under the set operations of
union, intersection, and complement relative to XXX. Hence all
finite Boolean algebras have cardinality a power of 2. This situation
changes with infinite Boolean algebras; in particular countable Boolean
algebras exist. One such is the free Boolean algebra on countably many
generators, which is the only countable atomless Boolean algebra. The
finite and cofinite (complement of a finite set) subsets of the set
NNN of natural numbers form a subalgebra of the powerset Boolean
algebra 2N2N2^N not isomorphic to the free Boolean
algebra, but it has atoms, namely the singleton sets.



The free Boolean algebra F(n)F(n)F(n) on nnn
generators consists of all 22nn22nn2^2 n n-ary
operations on the two-element Boolean algebra. Boolean algebras
therefore form a locally finite variety.



The equational theory of distributive lattices is obtained from that
of Boolean algebras by selecting as its operations just the monotone
binary operations on the two-element algebra, omitting the constants.
These are the operations with the property that if either argument is
changed from 0 to 1, the result does not change from 1 to 0. A
distributive lattice is any model of those Boolean equations between
terms built solely with monotone binary operations. Hence every Boolean
algebra is a distributive lattice.



Distributive lattices can be arbitrarily “thin.” At the extreme, any
chain (linear or total order, e.ge.ge.g. the reals
standardly ordered) under the usual operations of max and min forms a
distributive lattice. Since we have omitted the constants this includes
the empty lattice, which we have not excluded here as an algebra. (Some
authors disallow the empty set as an algebra but this proscription
spoils many good theorems without gaining any useful ones.) Hence there
exist distributive lattices of every possible cardinality.



Every finite-dimensional vector space is free, being generated by
any choice of basis. This extends to infinite-dimensional vector spaces
provided we accept the Axiom of Choice. Vector spaces over a finite
field therefore form a locally finite variety when scalar
multiplication is organized as one unary operation for each field
element.

6.5 Free algebras categorially


We now consider how free algebras are organized from the perspective
of category theory. We defined the free algebra BBB generated
by a subset XXX of BBB as having the property that for
every algebra AAA and every valuation f:X→Af:X→Af:
X\rightarrow A, there exists a unique homomorphism
h:B→Ah:B→Ah: B\rightarrow A. Now every homomorphism
h:B→Ah:B→Ah: B\rightarrow A necessarily arises in this way,
since its restriction to XXX, as a function from XXX to
AAA, is a valuation. Furthermore every function
f:X→Af:X→Af: X\rightarrow A arises as the
restriction to XXX of its extension to a homomorphism. Hence we
have a bijection between the functions from XXX to AAA
and the homomorphisms from BBB to AAA.



Now the typing here is a little casual, so let us clean it up. Since
XXX is a set while AAA is an algebra, fff is better typed
as f:X→U(A)f:X→U(A)f: X\rightarrow U(A) where U(A)U(A)U(A)
denotes the underlying set of AAA. And the relationship of XXX to
BBB is better understood with the notation B=F(X)B=F(X)B = F(X) denoting the free algebra generated by the set
XXX. So UUU maps algebras to sets while FFF maps
sets to algebras. FFF and UUU are not in general inverses
of each other, but they are nonetheless related in a way we now make
precise.



For any category CC\mathbf{C}, the notation C(A,B)C(A,B)\mathbf{C}(A, B) is generally used to
denote the set of all homomorphisms from object AAA to object BBB in category CC\mathbf{C}. And
the set of all functions from the set XXX to the set YYY can be
understood as the particular case Set(X,Y)Set(X,Y)\mathbf{Set}(X, Y) of this
convention where CC\mathbf{C} is taken to be the class SetSet\mathbf{Set} of all sets,
which we can think of as discrete algebras, that is, algebras
with no structure. A class of algebras along with a specified set of
homomorphisms between any two of its members is an instance of a
category. The members of the class are called the
objects of the category while the homomorphisms are called
the morphisms.



The bijection we have just observed can now be stated as

C(F(X),A)≅Set(X,U(A))C(F(X),A)≅Set(X,U(A))
\mathbf{C}(F(X), A) \cong \mathbf{Set}(X, U(A))



Such a bijection is called an adjunction between SetSet\mathbf{Set} and
CC\mathbf{C}. Here F:Set→CF:Set→CF: \mathbf{Set}\rightarrow \mathbf{C} and U:C→SetU:C→SetU:
\mathbf{C}\rightarrow \mathbf{Set} are respectively the left and right
adjoints of this adjunction; we say that FFF is left
adjoint to (or of) UUU and UUU right adjoint to
FFF.



We have only described how FFF maps sets to algebras, and
UUU maps algebras to sets. However FFF also maps
functions to homomorphisms, mapping each function fff to its unique extension
as a homomorphism, while UUU maps homomorphisms to functions,
namely the homomorphism itself as a function. Such maps between
categories are instances of functors.



In general a category CCC consists of objects a,b,ca,b,ca, b, c and
morphisms f:a→bf:a→bf: a\rightarrow b, together with an associative
composition law for “composable” morphisms f:b→cf:b→cf:
b\rightarrow c, g:a→bg:a→bg: a\rightarrow b yielding the morphism fg:a→cfg:a→cfg:
a\rightarrow c. Furthermore every object a has an identity element
1a:a→a1a:a→a1_a : a\rightarrow a which whenever composable with a morphism
fff (on one side or the other) composes with it to yield fff. A
functor F:C→DF:C→DF: C\rightarrow D maps objects of CCC to objects of
DDD and morphisms of CCC to morphisms of DDD, such that F(fg)=F(f)F(g)F(fg)=F(f)F(g)F(fg)
= F(f)F(g) and F(1a)=1F(a)F(1a)=1F(a)F(1_a) = 1_{F(a)}. That is, functors are
“homomorphisms of categories,” preserving composition and
identities.



With no further qualification such a category is considered an
abstract category. The categories we have been working with
are concrete in the sense that they come with a given
underlying set or forgetful functor U:C→U:C→U:
C\rightarrowSet. That is, algebras are based on sets, homomorphisms
are certain functions between these sets, and UUU simply
“forgets” the algebraic structure. Such forgetful functors are
faithful in the sense that for any two morphisms f,g:a→bf,g:a→bf,
g: a\rightarrow b of CCC, if U(f)=U(g)U(f)=U(g)U(f)
= U(g) then f=g,i.e.Uf=g,i.e.Uf = g,
i.e. U does not identify distinct
homomorphisms. In general a concrete category is defined as a category
CCC together with a faithful forgetful functor U:C→U:C→U:
C\rightarrowSet.



Categories themselves admit a further generalization to 2-categories
as algebras over two-dimensional graphs, with associative composition
of 1-cells generalized to the 2-associative pasting of 2-cells. A
further simplification of the free-algebra machinery then obtains,
namely via abstract adjunctions as the natural 2-dimensional
counterpart of isomorphisms in a category, which in turn is the natural
1-dimensional counterpart of equality of elements in a set, the
0-dimensional idea that two points can turn out to be one. This leads
to a notion of abstract monad as simply the composition of an adjoint
pair of 1-cells, one of which is the 1-cell abstracting the functor
FFF that manufactures the free algebra F(V)F(V)F(V)
from VVV. Ordinary or concrete monads arise as the composition
of functors as concrete 1-cells of a 2-category of categories.
