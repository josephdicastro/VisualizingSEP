Set theory is the mathematical theory of well-determined
collections, called sets, of objects that are called
members, or elements, of the set. Pure set theory
deals exclusively with sets, so the only sets under consideration are
those whose members are also sets. The theory of the
hereditarily-finite sets, namely those finite sets whose
elements are also finite sets, the elements of which are also finite,
and so on, is formally equivalent to arithmetic. So, the essence of
set theory is the study of infinite sets, and therefore it can be
defined as the mathematical theory of the actual—as opposed to
potential—infinite.
The notion of set is so simple that it is usually introduced
informally, and regarded as self-evident. In set theory, however, as
is usual in mathematics, sets are given axiomatically, so their
existence and basic properties are postulated by the appropriate
formal axioms. The axioms of set theory imply the existence of a
set-theoretic universe so rich that all mathematical objects can be
construed as sets. Also, the formal language of pure set theory allows
one to formalize all mathematical notions and arguments. Thus, set theory
has become the standard foundation for mathematics, as every
mathematical object can be viewed as a set, and every theorem of
mathematics can be logically deduced in the Predicate Calculus from
the axioms of set theory.
Both aspects of set theory, namely, as the mathematical science of
the infinite, and as the foundation of mathematics, are of
philosophical importance.
 
1. The origins
Set theory, as a separate mathematical discipline, begins in the
work of Georg Cantor. One might say that set theory was born in late
1873, when he made the amazing discovery that the linear continuum,
that is, the real line, is not countable, meaning that its points
cannot be counted using the natural numbers. So, even though the set
of natural numbers and the set of real numbers are both infinite,
there are more real numbers than there are natural numbers, which
opened the door to the investigation of the different sizes of
infinity. See the entry on the
 early development of set theory
 for a discussion of the origin of
set-theoretic ideas and their use by different mathematicians and
philosophers before and around Cantor’s time.
According to Cantor, two sets AAA and BBB have the same size, or
cardinality, if they are bijectable, i.e., the elements of
AAA can be put in a one-to-one correspondence with the elements of
BBB. Thus, the set NN\mathbb{N} of natural numbers and the set
RR\mathbb{R} of real numbers have different cardinalities. In 1878
Cantor formulated the famous Continuum Hypothesis (CH), which
asserts that every infinite set of real numbers is either countable,
i.e., it has the same cardinality as NN\mathbb{N}, or has the same
cardinality as RR\mathbb{R}. In other words, there are only two
possible sizes of infinite sets of real numbers. The CH is the most
famous problem of set theory. Cantor himself devoted much effort to
it, and so did many other leading mathematicians of the first half of
the twentieth century, such as Hilbert, who listed the CH as the first
problem in his celebrated list of 23 unsolved mathematical problems
presented in 1900 at the Second International Congress of
Mathematicians, in Paris. The attempts to prove the CH led to major
discoveries in set theory, such as the theory of constructible sets,
and the forcing technique, which showed that the CH can neither be
proved nor disproved from the usual axioms of set theory. To this day,
the CH remains open.
Early on, some inconsistencies, or paradoxes, arose from a naive
use of the notion of set; in particular, from the deceivingly natural
assumption that every property determines a set, namely the set of
objects that have the property. One example is Russell’s
Paradox, also known to Zermelo: 
 consider the property of sets of not being members of
themselves. If the property determines a set, call it AAA, then AAA is
a member of itself if and only if AAA is not a member of
itself.
 Thus, some collections, like the collection of all sets, the
collection of all ordinals numbers, or the collection of all cardinal
numbers, are not sets. Such collections are called proper
classes.
In order to avoid the paradoxes and put it on a firm footing, set
theory had to be axiomatized. The first axiomatization was due to
Zermelo (1908) and it came as a result of the need to spell out the
basic set-theoretic principles underlying his proof of Cantor’s
Well-Ordering Principle. Zermelo’s axiomatization avoids Russell’s
Paradox by means of the Separation axiom, which is formulated as
quantifying over properties of sets, and thus it is a second-order
statement. Further work by Skolem and Fraenkel led to the
formalization of the Separation axiom in terms of formulas of
first-order, instead of the informal notion of property, as well as to
the introduction of the axiom of Replacement, which is also formulated
as an axiom schema for first-order formulas (see next section). The
axiom of Replacement is needed for a proper development of the theory
of transfinite ordinals and cardinals, using transfinite recursion
(see Section 3). It is also needed to
prove the existence of such simple sets as the set of hereditarily
finite sets, i.e., those finite sets whose elements are finite, the
elements of which are also finite, and so on; or to prove basic
set-theoretic facts such as that every set is contained in a
transitive set, i.e., a set that contains all elements of its elements
(see Mathias 2001 for the weaknesses of Zermelo set theory). A further
addition, by von Neumann, of the axiom of Foundation, led to the
standard axiom system of set theory, known as the Zermelo-Fraenkel
axioms plus the Axiom of Choice, or ZFC.
Other axiomatizations of set theory, such as those of von
Neumann-Bernays-Gödel (NBG), or Morse-Kelley (MK), allow also for
a formal treatment of proper classes.
2. The axioms of set theory
ZFC is an axiom system formulated in first-order logic with
equality and with only one binary relation symbol ∈∈\in for
membership. Thus, we write A∈BA∈BA\in B to express that AAA is a member of
the set BBB. See the

Supplement on Basic Set Theory


 for further details. See also the

Supplement on Zermelo-Fraenkel Set Theory

 for a formalized version of the axioms and further comments. We
state below the axioms of ZFC informally.
2.1 The axioms of ZFC

Extensionality: If two sets AAA and BBB have
the same elements, then they are equal.
Null Set: There exists a set, denoted by
∅∅{\varnothing} and called the empty set, which has no
elements.
Pair: Given any sets AAA and BBB, there
exists a set, denoted by {A,B}{A,B}\{ A,B\}, which contains AAA and BBB as its
only elements. In particular, there exists the set {A}{A}\{ A\} which has
AAA as its only element.
Power Set: For every set AAA there exists a
set, denoted by P(A)P(A)\mathcal{P}(A) and called the power set of
AAA, whose elements are all the subsets of AAA.
Union: For every set AAA, there exists a set,
denoted by ⋃A⋃A\bigcup A and called the union of AAA, whose
elements are all the elements of the elements of AAA.
Infinity: There exists an infinite set. In
particular, there exists a set ZZZ that contains ∅∅{\varnothing} and
such that if A∈ZA∈ZA\in Z, then ⋃{A,{A}}∈Z⋃{A,{A}}∈Z\bigcup\{ A, \{ A\}\}\in Z.
Separation: For every set AAA and every given
property, there is a set containing exactly the elements of AAA that
have that property. A property is given by a formula
φφ\varphi of the first-order language of set theory.
Thus, Separation is not a single axiom but an axiom schema, that
is, an infinite list of axioms, one for each formula
φφ\varphi.
Replacement: For every given definable
function with domain a set AAA, there is a set whose elements are
all the values of the function.
Replacement is also an axiom schema, as definable functions are
given by formulas.
Foundation: Every non-empty set AAA contains
an ∈∈\in-minimal element, that is, an element such that no element of
AAA belongs to it.

These are the axioms of Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory, or ZF. The
axioms of Null Set and Pair follow from the other ZF axioms, so they
may be omitted. Also, Replacement implies Separation.
Finally, there is the Axiom of Choice (AC):

Choice: For every set AAA of
pairwise-disjoint non-empty sets, there exists a set that contains
exactly one element from each set in AAA.

The AC was, for a long time, a controversial axiom. On the one
hand, it is very useful and of wide use in mathematics. On the other
hand, it has rather unintuitive consequences, such as the
Banach-Tarski Paradox, which says that the unit ball can be
partitioned into finitely-many pieces, which can then be rearranged to
form two unit balls. The objections to the axiom arise from the fact
that it asserts the existence of sets that cannot be explicitly
defined. But Gödel’s 1938 proof of its consistency, relative to
the consistency of ZF, dispelled any suspicions left about it.
The Axiom of Choice is equivalent, modulo ZF, to the
Well-ordering Principle, which asserts that every set can be
well-ordered, i.e., it can be linearly ordered so that every non-empty
subset has a minimal element.
Although not formally necessary, besides the symbol ∈∈\in one
normally uses for convenience other auxiliary defined symbols. For
example, A⊆BA⊆BA\subseteq B expresses that AAA is a subset of
BBB, i.e., every member of AAA is a member of BBB. Other symbols are
used to denote sets obtained by performing basic operations, such as
A∪BA∪BA\cup B, which denotes the union of AAA and BBB, i.e., the
set whose elements are those of AAA and BBB; or A∩BA∩BA\cap B, which
denotes the intersection of AAA and BBB, i.e., the set whose
elements are those common to AAA and BBB. The ordered pair
(A,B)(A,B)(A,B) is defined as the set {{A},{A,B}}{{A},{A,B}}\{ \{ A\},\{ A,B\}\}. Thus, two
ordered pairs (A,B)(A,B)(A,B) and (C,D)(C,D)(C,D) are equal if and only if A=CA=CA=C and
B=DB=DB=D. And the Cartesian product A×BA×BA\times B is defined as
the set of all ordered pairs (C,D)(C,D)(C,D) such that C∈AC∈AC\in A and D∈BD∈BD\in
B. Given any formula φ(x,y1,…,yn)φ(x,y1,…,yn)\varphi(x,y_1,\ldots ,y_n), and sets
A,B1,…,BnA,B1,…,BnA,B_1,\ldots ,B_n, one can form the set of all those elements of AAA
that satisfy the formula φ(x,B1,…,Bn)φ(x,B1,…,Bn)\varphi(x,B_1,\ldots ,B_n). This set is
denoted by {a∈A:φ(a,B1,…,Bn)}{a∈A:φ(a,B1,…,Bn)}\{ a\in A: \varphi(a,B_1,\ldots ,B_n)\}. In ZF one can
easily prove that all these sets exist. See the supplement on
 Basic Set Theory for further
discussion.
3. The theory of transfinite ordinals and cardinals
In ZFC one can develop the Cantorian theory of transfinite (i.e.,
infinite) ordinal and cardinal numbers. Following the definition given
by Von Neumann in the early 1920s, the ordinal numbers, or
ordinals, for short, are obtained by starting with the empty
set and performing two operations: taking the immediate successor, and
passing to the limit. Thus, the first ordinal number is
∅∅{\varnothing}. Given an ordinal αα\alpha, its immediate
successor, denoted by α+1α+1\alpha +1, is the set α∪{α}α∪{α}\alpha \cup \{
\alpha \}. And given a non-empty set XXX of ordinals such that for
every α∈Xα∈X\alpha \in X the successor α+1α+1\alpha +1 is also in XXX, one
obtains the limit ordinal ⋃X⋃X\bigcup X. One shows that every
ordinal is (strictly) well-ordered by ∈∈\in, i.e., it is linearly
ordered by ∈∈\in and there is no infinite ∈∈\in-descending
sequence. Also, every well-ordered set is isomorphic to a unique
ordinal, called its order-type.
Note that every ordinal is the set of its predecessors. However,
the class ONONON of all ordinals is not a set. Otherwise, ONONON would be
an ordinal greater than all the ordinals, which is impossible. The
first infinite ordinal, which is the set of all finite ordinals, is
denoted by the Greek letter omega (ωω\omega). In ZFC, one identifies
the finite ordinals with the natural numbers. Thus, ∅=0∅=0{\varnothing}=0,
{∅}=1{∅}=1\{ {\varnothing}\}=1, {∅,{∅}}=2{∅,{∅}}=2\{ {\varnothing}, \{ {\varnothing}\}\}=2,
etc., hence ωω\omega is just the set NN\mathbb{N} of natural
numbers.
One can extend the operations of addition and multiplication of
natural numbers to all the ordinals. For example, the ordinal α+βα+β\alpha
+\beta is the order-type of the well-ordering obtained by
concatenating a well-ordered set of order-type αα\alpha and a
well-ordered set of order-type ββ\beta. The sequence of ordinals,
well-ordered by ∈∈\in, starts as follows

0, 1, 2,…, nnn,…, ωω\omega, ω+1ω+1\omega+1,
ω+2ω+2\omega+2,…, ω+ωω+ω\omega +\omega,…, n⋅ωn⋅ωn\cdot \omega,
…, ω⋅ωω⋅ω\omega \cdot \omega,…, ωnωn\omega^n, …,
ωωωω\omega^\omega, …

The ordinals satisfy the principle of transfinite
induction: suppose that CCC is a class of ordinals such that
whenever CCC contains all ordinals ββ\beta smaller than some ordinal
αα\alpha, then αα\alpha is also in CCC. Then the class CCC contains
all ordinals. Using transfinite induction one can prove in ZFC (and
one needs the axiom of Replacement) the important principle of
transfinite recursion, which says that, given any definable
class-function G:V→VG:V→VG:V\to V, one can define a class-function F:ON→VF:ON→VF:ON\to V
such that F(α)F(α)F(\alpha) is the value of the function GGG applied to the
function FFF restricted to αα\alpha. One uses transfinite recursion,
for example, in order to define properly the arithmetical operations
of addition, product, and exponentiation on the ordinals.
Recall that an infinite set is countable if it is
bijectable, i.e., it can be put into a one-to-one correspondence, with
ωω\omega. All the ordinals displayed above are either finite or
countable. But the set of all finite and countable ordinals is also an
ordinal, called ω1ω1\omega_1, and is not countable. Similarly, the set
of all ordinals that are bijectable with some ordinal less than or
equal to ω1ω1\omega_1 is also an ordinal, called ω2ω2\omega_2, and is not
bijectable with ω1ω1\omega_1, and so on.
3.1 Cardinals
A cardinal is an ordinal that is not bijectable with any
smaller ordinal. Thus, every finite ordinal is a cardinal, and
ωω\omega, ω1ω1\omega_1, ω2ω2\omega_2, etc. are also cardinals. The
infinite cardinals are represented by the letter aleph (ℵℵ\aleph) of
the Hebrew alphabet, and their sequence is indexed by the ordinals. It
starts like this

ℵ0ℵ0\aleph_0, ℵ1ℵ1\aleph_1, ℵ2ℵ2\aleph_2, …, ℵωℵω\aleph_\omega,
ℵω+1ℵω+1\aleph_{\omega +1}, …, ℵω+ωℵω+ω\aleph_{\omega +\omega}, …,
ℵω2ℵω2\aleph_{\omega^2}, …, ℵωωℵωω\aleph_{\omega^\omega}, …,
ℵω1ℵω1\aleph_{\omega_1}, …, ℵω2ℵω2\aleph_{\omega_2}, …

Thus, ω=ℵ0ω=ℵ0\omega=\aleph_0, ω1=ℵ1ω1=ℵ1\omega_1=\aleph_1, ω2=ℵ2ω2=ℵ2\omega_2=\aleph_2,
etc. For every cardinal there is a bigger one, and the limit of an
increasing sequence of cardinals is also a cardinal. Thus, the class
of all cardinals is not a set, but a proper class.
An infinite cardinal κκ\kappa is called regular if it is
not the union of less than κκ\kappa smaller cardinals. Thus,
ℵ0ℵ0\aleph_0 is regular, and so are all infinite successor cardinals,
such as ℵ1ℵ1\aleph_1. Non-regular infinite cardinals are called
singular. The first singular cardinal is ℵωℵω\aleph_\omega, as
it is the union of countably-many smaller cardinals, namely
ℵω=⋃n<ωℵnℵω=⋃n<ωℵn\aleph_\omega =\bigcup_{n&lt;\omega} \aleph_n.
The cofinality of a cardinal κκ\kappa, denoted by
cf(κ)cf(κ)cf(\kappa) is the smallest cardinal λλ\lambda such that κκ\kappa is
the union of λλ\lambda-many smaller ordinals. Thus,
cf(ℵω)=ℵ0cf(ℵω)=ℵ0cf(\aleph_\omega)=\aleph_0.
By the AC (in the form of the Well-Ordering Principle), every set
AAA can be well-ordered, hence it is bijectable with a unique
cardinal, called the cardinality of AAA. Given two cardinals
κκ\kappa and λλ\lambda, the sum κ+λκ+λ\kappa +\lambda is defined as the
cardinality of the set consisting of the union of any two disjoint
sets, one of cardinality κκ\kappa and one of cardinality
λλ\lambda. And the product κ⋅λκ⋅λ\kappa \cdot \lambda is defined as the
cardinality of the Cartesian product κ×λκ×λ\kappa \times \lambda. The
operations of sum and product of infinite cardinals are trivial, for
if κκ\kappa and λλ\lambda are infinite cardinals, then κ+λ=κ⋅λ=maximum{κ,λ}κ+λ=κ⋅λ=maximum{κ,λ}\kappa
+\lambda =\kappa \cdot \lambda = maximum \{ \kappa ,\lambda\}.
In contrast, cardinal exponentiation is highly non-trivial, for
even the value of the simplest non-trivial infinite exponential,
namely 2ℵ02ℵ02^{\aleph_0}, is not known and cannot be determined in ZFC
(see below). The cardinal κλκλ\kappa^\lambda is defined as the
cardinality of the Cartesian product of λλ\lambda copies of κκ\kappa;
equivalently, as the cardinality of the set of all functions from
λλ\lambda into κκ\kappa. König’s theorem asserts that
κcf(κ)>κκcf(κ)>κ\kappa^{cf(\kappa)}&gt;\kappa, which implies that the cofinality of
the cardinal 2ℵ02ℵ02^{\aleph_0}, whatever that cardinal is, must be
uncountable. But this is essentially all that ZFC can prove about the
value of the exponential 2ℵ02ℵ02^{\aleph_0}.
In the case of exponentiation of singular cardinals, ZFC has a lot
more to say. In 1989, Shelah proved the remarkable result that if
ℵωℵω\aleph_\omega is a strong limit, that is,
2ℵn<ℵω2ℵn<ℵω2^{\aleph_n}&lt;\aleph_\omega, for every n<ωn<ωn&lt;\omega, then
2ℵω<ℵω42ℵω<ℵω42^{\aleph_\omega}&lt;\aleph_{\omega_4} (see Shelah (1994)). The
technique developed by Shelah to prove this and similar theorems, in
ZFC, is called pcf theory (for possible
cofinalities), and has found many applications in other areas of
mathematics.
4. The universe VVV of all sets
A posteriori, the ZF axioms other than
Extensionality—which needs no justification because it just
states a defining property of sets—may be justified by their use
in building the cumulative hierarchy of sets. Namely, in ZF
we define using transfinite recursion the class-function that assigns
to each ordinal αα\alpha the set VαVαV_\alpha, given as follows:

V0=∅V0=∅V_0={\varnothing}
Vα+1=P(Vα)Vα+1=P(Vα)V_{\alpha +1}=\mathcal{P}(V_\alpha)
Vα=⋃β<αVβVα=⋃β<αVβV_\alpha =\bigcup_{\beta &lt;\alpha}V_\beta, whenever αα\alpha is
a limit ordinal.

The Power Set axiom is used to obtain Vα+1Vα+1V_{\alpha +1} from
VαVαV_\alpha. Replacement and Union allow one to form VαVαV_\alpha for
αα\alpha a limit ordinal. Indeed, consider the function that assigns
to each β<αβ<α\beta &lt;\alpha the set VβVβV_\beta. By Replacement, the
collection of all the VβVβV_\beta, for β<αβ<α\beta &lt;\alpha, is a set,
hence the Union axiom applied to that set yields VαVαV_\alpha. The axiom
of Infinity is needed to prove the existence of ωω\omega and hence of
the transfinite sequence of ordinals. Finally, the axiom of Foundation
is equivalent, assuming the other axioms, to the statement that every
set belongs to some VαVαV_\alpha, for some ordinal αα\alpha. Thus, ZF
proves that the set theoretic universe, denoted by VVV, is the union
of all the VαVαV_\alpha, αα\alpha an ordinal.
The proper class VVV, together with the ∈∈\in relation, satisfies
all the ZFC axioms, and is thus a model of ZFC. It is the intended
model of ZFC, and one may think of ZFC as providing a description of
VVV, a description however that is highly incomplete, as we shall see
below.
One important property of VVV is the so-called
Reflection Principle. Namely, for each formula
φ(x1,…,xn)φ(x1,…,xn)\varphi(x_1,\ldots ,x_n), ZFC proves that there exists some VαVαV_\alpha
that reflects it, that is, for every
a1,…,an∈Vαa1,…,an∈Vαa_1,\ldots,a_n\in V_\alpha,

φ(a1,…,an)φ(a1,…,an)\varphi(a_1,\ldots ,a_n) holds in VVV if and only if
φ(a1,…,an)φ(a1,…,an)\varphi(a_1,\ldots,a_n) holds in VαVαV_\alpha.

Thus, VVV cannot be characterized by any sentence, as any sentence
that is true in VVV must be also true in some initial segment
VαVαV_\alpha. In particular, ZFC is not finitely axiomatizable, for
otherwise ZFC would prove that, for unboundedly many ordinals
αα\alpha, VαVαV_\alpha is a model of ZFC, contradicting Gödel’s
second incompleteness theorem (see
 Section 5.2).
The Reflection Principle encapsulates the essence of ZF set theory,
for as shown by Levy (1960), the axioms of Extensionality, Separation,
and Foundation, together with the Reflection Principle, formulated as
the axiom schema asserting that each formula is reflected by some set
that contains all elements and all subsets of its elements (note that
the VαVαV_\alpha are like this), is equivalent to ZF.
5. Set theory as the foundation of mathematics
Every mathematical object may be viewed as a set. For example, the
natural numbers are identified with the finite ordinals, so
N=ωN=ω\mathbb{N}=\omega. The set of integers ZZ\mathbb{Z} may be defined
as the set of equivalence classes of pairs of natural numbers under
the equivalence relation (n,m)≡(n′,m′)(n,m)≡(n′,m′)(n, m)\equiv (n',m') if and only if
n+m′=m+n′n+m′=m+n′n+m'=m+n'. By identifying every natural number nnn with the
equivalence class of the pair (n,0)(n,0)(n,0), one may extend naturally the
operations of sum and product of natural numbers to ZZ\mathbb{Z} (see
Enderton (1977) for details, and Levy (1979) for a different
construction). Further, one may define the rationals QQ\mathbb{Q} as
the set of equivalence classes of pairs (n,m)(n,m)(n,m) of integers, where
m≠0m≠0m\ne 0, under the equivalence relation (n,m)≡(n′,m′)(n,m)≡(n′,m′)(n,m)\equiv (n',m') if and
only if n⋅m′=m⋅n′n⋅m′=m⋅n′n\cdot m'=m\cdot n'. Again, the operations +++ and ⋅⋅\cdot
on ZZ\mathbb{Z} may be extended naturally to QQ\mathbb{Q}. Moreover,
the ordering ≤Q≤Q\leq_{\mathbb{Q}} on the rationals is given by: r≤Qsr≤Qsr
\leq_{\mathbb{Q}} s if and only if there exists t∈Qt∈Qt\in \mathbb{Q}
such that s=r+ts=r+ts=r+t. The real numbers may be defined as Dedekind cuts of
QQ\mathbb{Q}, namely, a real number is given by a pair (A,B)(A,B)(A,B) of
non-empty disjoint sets such that A∪B=QA∪B=QA\cup B=\mathbb{Q}, and
a≤Qba≤Qba\leq_{\mathbb{Q}}b for every a∈Aa∈Aa\in A and b∈Bb∈Bb\in B. One can then
extend again the operations of +++ and ⋅⋅\cdot on QQ\mathbb{Q}, as
well as the ordering ≤Q≤Q\leq_{\mathbb{Q}}, to the set of real numbers
RR\mathbb{R}.
Let us emphasize that it is not claimed that, e.g., real numbers
are Dedekind cuts of rationals, as they could also be defined
using Cauchy sequences, or in other different ways. What is important,
from a foundational point of view, is that the set-theoretic version
of RR\mathbb{R}, together with the usual algebraic operations,
satisfies the categorical axioms that the real numbers satisfy, namely
those of a complete ordered field. The metaphysical question of what
the real numbers really are is irrelevant here.
Algebraic structures can also be viewed as sets, as any nnn-ary
relation on the elements of a set AAA can be viewed as a set of
nnn-tuples (a1,…,an)(a1,…,an)(a_1,\ldots ,a_n) of elements of AAA. And any nnn-ary
function fff on AAA, with values on some set BBB, can be seen as the
set of n+1n+1n+1-tuples ((a1,…,an),b)((a1,…,an),b)((a_1,\ldots ,a_n),b) such that bbb is the value
of fff on (a1,…,am)(a1,…,am)(a_1,\ldots ,a_m). Thus, for example, a group is
just a triple (A,+,0)(A,+,0)(A, +, 0), where AAA is a non-empty set, +++ is a
binary function on AAA that is associative, 000 is an element of AAA
such that a+0=0+a=aa+0=0+a=aa+0=0+a=a, for all a∈Aa∈Aa\in A, and for every a∈Aa∈Aa\in A there
is an element of AAA, denoted by −a−a-a, such that
a+(−a)=(−a)+a=0a+(−a)=(−a)+a=0a+(-a)=(-a)+a=0. Also, a topological space is just a set
XXX together with a topology ττ\tau on it, i.e., ττ\tau is a subset of
P(X)P(X)\mathcal{P}(X) containing XXX and ∅∅{\varnothing}, and closed under
arbitrary unions and finite intersections. Any mathematical object
whatsoever can always be viewed as a set, or a proper class. The
properties of the object can then be expressed in the language of set
theory. Any mathematical statement can be formalized into the language
of set theory, and any mathematical theorem can be derived, using the
calculus of first-order logic, from the axioms of ZFC, or from some
extension of ZFC. It is in this sense that set theory provides a
foundation for mathematics.
The foundational role of set theory for mathematics, while
significant, is by no means the only justification for its study. The
ideas and techniques developed within set theory, such as infinite
combinatorics, forcing, or the theory of large cardinals, have turned
it into a deep and fascinating mathematical theory, worthy of study by
itself, and with important applications to practically all areas of
mathematics.
5.1 Metamathematics
The remarkable fact that virtually all of mathematics can be
formalized within ZFC, makes possible a mathematical study of
mathematics itself. Thus, any questions about the existence of some
mathematical object, or the provability of a conjecture or hypothesis
can be given a mathematically precise formulation. This makes
metamathematics possible, namely the mathematical study of
mathematics itself. So, the question about the provability or
unprovability of any given mathematical statement becomes a sensible
mathematical question. When faced with an open mathematical problem or
conjecture, it makes sense to ask for its provability or unprovability
in the ZFC formal system. Unfortunately, the answer may be neither,
because ZFC, if consistent, is incomplete.
5.2 The incompleteness phenomenon
Gödel’s completeness theorem for first-order logic implies
that ZFC is consistent—i.e., no contradiction can be
derived from it—if and only if it has a model. A model
of ZFC is a pair (M,E)(M,E)(M,E), where MMM is a non-empty set and EEE is a
binary relation on MMM such that all the axioms of ZFC are true when
interpreted in (M,E)(M,E)(M,E), i.e., when the variables that appear in the
axioms range over elements of MMM, and ∈∈\in is interpreted as
EEE. Thus, if φφ\varphi is a sentence of the language of set theory
and one can find a model of ZFC in which φφ\varphi holds, then its
negation ¬φ¬φ\neg \varphi cannot be proved in ZFC. Hence, if one can
find a model of φφ\varphi and also a model of ¬φ¬φ\neg \varphi, then
φφ\varphi is neither provable nor disprovable in ZFC, in which case we
say that φφ\varphi is undecidable in, or independent
of, ZFC.
In 1931, Gödel announced his striking incompleteness theorems,
which assert that any reasonable formal system for mathematics is
necessarily incomplete. In particular, if ZFC is consistent, then
there are undecidable propositions in ZFC. Moreover, Gödel’s
second incompleteness theorem implies that the formal (arithmetical)
statement CON(ZFC)CON(ZFC)CON(ZFC), which asserts that ZFC is consistent, while
true, cannot be proved in ZFC. And neither can its negation. Thus,
CON(ZFC)CON(ZFC)CON(ZFC) is undecidable in ZFC.
If ZFC is consistent, then it cannot prove the existence of a model
of ZFC, for otherwise ZFC would prove its own consistency. Thus, a
proof of consistency or of undecidability of a given sentence
φφ\varphi is always a relative consistency proof. That is,
one assumes that ZFC is consistent, hence it has a model, and then one
constructs another model of ZFC where the sentence φφ\varphi is
true. We shall see several examples in the next sections.
6. The set theory of the continuum
From Cantor and until about 1940, set theory developed mostly
around the study of the continuum, that is, the real line
RR\mathbb{R}. The main topic was the study of the so-called regularity
properties, as well as other structural properties, of
simply-definable sets of real numbers, an area of mathematics that is
known as Descriptive Set Theory.
6.1 Descriptive Set Theory
Descriptive Set Theory is the study of the properties and structure
of definable sets of real numbers and, more generally, of definable
subsets of RnRn\mathbb{R}^n and other Polish spaces (i.e.,
topological spaces that are homeomorphic to a separable complete metric space), such as the Baire space
NN\mathcal{N} of all functions f:N→Nf:N→Nf:\mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}, the
space of complex numbers, Hilbert space, and separable Banach
spaces. The simplest sets of real numbers are the basic open sets
(i.e., the open intervals with rational endpoints), and their
complements. The sets that are obtained in a countable number of steps
by starting from the basic open sets and applying the operations of
taking the complement and forming a countable union of previously
obtained sets are the Borel sets. All Borel sets are
regular, that is, they enjoy all the classical regularity
properties. One example of a regularity property is the
Lebesgue measurability: a set of reals is Lebesgue measurable
if it differs from a Borel set by a null set, namely, a set that can
be covered by sets of basic open intervals of arbitrarily-small total
length. Thus, trivially, every Borel set is Lebesgue measurable, but
sets more complicated than the Borel ones may not be. Other classical
regularity properties are the Baire property (a set of reals
has the Baire property if it differs from an open set by a meager set,
namely, a set that is a countable union of sets that are not dense in
any interval), and the perfect set property (a set of reals
has the perfect set property if it is either countable or contains a
perfect set, namely, a nonempty closed set with no isolated points). In ZFC one
can prove that there exist non-regular sets of reals, but the AC is
necessary for this (Solovay 1970).
The analytic sets, also called Σ11Σ11\mathbf{\Sigma}^1_1, are
the continuous images of Borel sets. And the co-analytic, or
Π11Π11\mathbf{\Pi}^1_1, sets are the complements of analytic sets.
Starting from the analytic (or the co-analytic) sets and applying
the operations of projection (from the product space R×NR×N\mathbb{R}\times
\mathcal{N} to RR\mathbb{R}) and complementation, one obtains the
projective sets. The projective sets form a hierarchy of
increasing complexity. For example, if A⊆R×NA⊆R×NA\subseteq \mathbb{R}\times
\mathcal{N} is co-analytic, then the projection {x∈R:∃y∈N((x,y)∈A)}{x∈R:∃y∈N((x,y)∈A)}\{ x\in \mathbb{R}:
\exists y\in \mathcal{N}((x,y)\in A)\} is a projective set in the
next level of complexity above the co-analytic sets. Those sets are
called Σ12Σ21\mathbf{\Sigma}^1_2, and their complements are called
Π12Π21\mathbf{\Pi}^1_2.
The projective sets come up very naturally in mathematical
practice, for it turns out that a set AAA of reals is projective if
and only if it is definable in the structure
R=(R,+,⋅,Z).R=(R,+,⋅,Z).\mathcal{R}=(\mathbb{R}, +,\cdot ,\mathbb{Z}).
That is, there is a first-order formula φ(x,y1,…,yn)φ(x,y1,…,yn)\varphi ( x, y_1,\ldots,
y_n) in the language for the structure such that for some r1,…,rn∈Rr1,…,rn∈Rr_1,\ldots
,r_n\in \mathbb{R},
A={x∈R:R⊨φ(x,r1,…,rn)}.A={x∈R:R⊨φ(x,r1,…,rn)}.A=\{ x\in \mathbb{R}: \mathcal{R}\models \varphi(x,r_1,\ldots
,r_n)\}.
ZFC proves that every analytic set, and therefore every co-analytic
set, is Lebesgue measurable and has the Baire property. It also proves
that every analytic set has the perfect set property. But the perfect
set property for co-analytic sets implies that the first uncountable
cardinal, ℵ1ℵ1\aleph_1, is a large cardinal in the constructible
universe LLL (see Section 7), namely a
so-called inaccessible cardinal (see
 Section 10), 
which implies that one cannot prove in ZFC that every
co-analytic set has the perfect set property.
The theory of projective sets of complexity greater than
co-analytic is completely undetermined by ZFC. For example, in LLL
there is a Σ12Σ21\mathbf{\Sigma}^1_2 set that is not Lebesgue measurable
and does not have the Baire property, whereas if Martin’s axiom holds
(see Section 11), every such set has those
regularity properties. There is, however, an axiom, called the axiom
of Projective Determinacy, or PD, that is consistent with ZFC, modulo
the consistency of some large cardinals (in fact, it follows from the existence of some large cardinals), and implies that all
projective sets are regular. Moreover, PD settles essentially all
questions about the projective sets. See the entry on
 large cardinals and determinacy
 for further details.
6.2 Determinacy
A regularity property of sets that subsumes all other classical
regularity properties is that of being determined. For
simplicity, we shall work with the Baire space NN\mathcal{N}. Recall
that the elements of NN\mathcal{N} are functions f:N→Nf:N→Nf:\mathbb{N} \to
\mathbb{N}, that is, sequences of natural numbers of length
ωω\omega. The space NN\mathcal{N} is topologically equivalent (i.e.,
homeomorphic) to the set of irrational points of RR\mathbb{R}. So,
since we are interested in the regularity properties of subsets of
RR\mathbb{R}, and since countable sets, such as the set of rationals,
are negligible in terms of those properties, we may as well work with
NN\mathcal{N}, instead of RR\mathbb{R}.
Given A⊆NA⊆NA\subseteq \mathcal{N}, the game
associated to AAA, denoted by GAGA{\mathcal G}_A, has two players, I and
II, who play alternatively ni∈Nni∈Nn_i\in \mathbb{N}: I plays n0n0n_0, then II
plays n1n1n_1, then I plays n2n2n_2, and so on. So, at stage 2k2k2k, player
I plays n2kn2kn_{2k} and at stage 2k+12k+12k+1, player II plays n2k+1n2k+1n_{2k+1} . We
may visualize a run of the game as follows:


II\mathbf{I}
n0n0n_0

n2n2n_2

n4n4n_4

⋯⋯\cdots

n2kn2kn_{2k}

⋯⋯\cdots



IIII\mathbf{II}

n1n1n_1

n3n3n_3

⋯⋯\cdots

⋯⋯\cdots

n2k+1n2k+1n_{2k+1}

⋯⋯\cdots


After infinitely many moves, the two players produce an infinite
sequence n0,n1,n2,…n0,n1,n2,…n_0, n_1,n_2,\ldots of natural numbers. Player I wins the
game if the sequence belongs to AAA. Otherwise, player II wins.
The game GAGA{\mathcal{G}}_A is determined if
there is a winning strategy for one of the players. A winning
strategy for one of the players, say for player II, is a function
σσ\sigma from the set of finite sequences of natural numbers into
NN\mathbb{N}, such that if the player plays according to this
function, i.e., she plays σ(n0,…,n2k)σ(n0,…,n2k)\sigma (n_0,\ldots ,n_{2k}) at the kkk-th
turn, she will always win the game, no matter what the other player
does.
We say that a subset AAA of NN\mathcal{N} is determined if
and only if the game GAGA{\mathcal{G}}_A is determined.
One can prove in ZFC—and the use of the AC is
necessary—that there are non-determined sets. Thus, the
Axiom of Determinacy (AD), which asserts that all subsets of
NN\mathcal{N} are determined, is incompatible with the AC. But Donald
Martin proved, in ZFC, that every Borel set is determined. Further, he
showed that if there exists a large cardinal called measurable (see
 Section 10), then even the analytic sets are
determined. The axiom of Projective Determinacy (PD) asserts
that every projective set is determined. It turns out that PD implies
that all projective sets of reals are regular, and Woodin has shown
that, in a certain sense, PD settles essentially all questions about
the projective sets. Moreover, PD seems to be necessary for
this. Another axiom, ADL(R)ADL(R)AD^{L(\Bbb R )}, asserts that the AD holds in
L(R)L(R)L(\Bbb R), which is the least transitive class that contains all the
ordinals and all the real numbers, and satisfies the ZF axioms (see
 Section 7). So, ADL(R)ADL(R)AD^{L(\Bbb R )} implies that
every set of reals that belongs to L(R)L(R)L(\Bbb R) is regular. Also, since
L(R)L(R)L(\Bbb R) contains all projective sets, ADL(R)ADL(R)AD^{L(\Bbb R )} implies
PD.
6.3 The Continuum Hypothesis
The Continuum Hypothesis (CH), formulated by Cantor in 1878,
asserts that every infinite set of real numbers has cardinality either
ℵ0ℵ0\aleph_0 or the same cardinality as RR\mathbb{R}. Thus, the CH is
equivalent to 2ℵ0=ℵ12ℵ0=ℵ12^{\aleph_0}=\aleph_1.
Cantor proved in 1883 that closed sets of real numbers have the
perfect set property, from which it follows that every uncountable
closed set of real numbers has the same cardinality as
RR\mathbb{R}. Thus, the CH holds for closed sets. More than thirty
years later, Pavel Aleksandrov extended the result to all Borel sets,
and then Mikhail Suslin to all analytic sets. Thus, all analytic sets
satisfy the CH. However, the efforts to prove that co-analytic sets
satisfy the CH would not succeed, as this is not provable in ZFC.
In 1938 Gödel proved the consistency of the CH with
ZFC. Assuming that ZF is consistent, he built a model of ZFC, known as
the constructible universe, in which the CH holds. Thus, the
proof shows that if ZF is consistent, then so is ZF together with the
AC and the CH. Hence, assuming ZF is consistent, the AC cannot be
disproved in ZF and the CH cannot be disproved in ZFC.
See the entry on the
 continuum hypothesis
 for the current status of the problem, including the
latest results by Woodin.
7. Gödel’s constructible universe
Gödel’s constructible universe, denoted by LLL, is defined by
transfinite recursion on the ordinals, similarly as VVV, but at
successor steps, instead of taking the power set of VαVαV_\alpha to
obtain Vα+1Vα+1V_{\alpha +1}, one only takes those subsets of LαLαL_\alpha
that are definable in LαLαL_\alpha, using elements of LαLαL_\alpha as
parameters. Thus, letting PDef(X)PDef(X)\mathcal{P}^{Def}(X) to denote the set of
all the subsets of XXX that are definable in the structure (X,∈)(X,∈)(X,\in )
by a formula of the language of set theory, using elements of XXX as
parameters of the definition, we let

L0=∅L0=∅L_0={\varnothing}
Lα+1=PDef(Lα)Lα+1=PDef(Lα)L_{\alpha +1}=\mathcal{P}^{Def}(L_\alpha)
Lλ=⋃α<λLαLλ=⋃α<λLαL_\lambda =\bigcup_{\alpha &lt;\lambda}L_\alpha, whenever
λλ\lambda is a limit ordinal.

Then LLL is the union of all the LαLαL_\alpha, for αα\alpha an
ordinal, i.e., L=⋃α∈ONLαL=⋃α∈ONLαL=\bigcup_{\alpha \in ON}L_\alpha.
Gödel showed that LLL satisfies all the ZFC axioms, and also
the CH. In fact, it satisfies the Generalized Continuum
Hypothesis (GCH), namely 2ℵα=ℵα+12ℵα=ℵα+12^{\aleph_\alpha}=\aleph_{\alpha +1},
for every ordinal αα\alpha.
The statement V=LV=LV=L, called the axiom of constructibility,
asserts that every set belongs to LLL. It holds in LLL, hence it is
consistent with ZFC, and implies both the AC and the GCH.
The proper class LLL, together with the ∈∈\in relation restricted
to LLL, is an inner model of ZFC, that is, a
transitive (i.e., it contains all elements of its elements)
class that contains all ordinals and satisfies all the ZFC axioms. It
is in fact the smallest inner model of ZFC, as any other inner model
contains it.
More generally, given any set AAA, one can build the smallest
transitive model of ZF that contains AAA and all the ordinals in a
similar manner as LLL, but now starting with the transitive closure of
{A}{A}\{A \}, i.e., the smallest transitive set that contains AAA, instead
of ∅∅{\varnothing}. The resulting model, L(A)L(A)L(A), need not be however a
model of the AC. One very important such model is L(R)L(R)L(\mathbb{R}), the
smallest transitive model of ZF that contains all the ordinals and all
the real numbers.
The theory of constructible sets owes much to the work of Ronald
Jensen. He developed the so-called fine structure theory of
LLL and isolated some combinatorial principles, such as the diamond
(♢♢\diamondsuit) and square (□◻\Box), which can be used to carry out
complicated constructions of uncountable mathematical objects. Fine
structure theory plays also an important role in the analysis of
bigger LLL-like models, such as L(R)L(R)L(\mathbb{R}) or the inner models
for large cardinals (see 
Section 10.1).
8. Forcing
In 1963, twenty-five years after Gödel’s proof of the
consistency of the CH and the AC, relative to the consistency of ZF, Paul Cohen (1966)
proved the consistency of the negation of the CH, and also of the negation of the AC, relative to the
consistency of ZF. Thus, if ZF is consistent, then the CH is
undecidable in ZFC, and the AC is undecidable in ZF.  To achieve this, Cohen
devised a new and extremely powerful technique, called
forcing, for expanding countable transitive models of ZF.
Since the axiom V=LV=LV=L implies the AC and the CH, any model of the
negation of the AC or the CH must violate V=LV=LV=L. So, let’s illustrate
the idea of forcing in the case of building a model for the negation
of V=LV=LV=L. We start with a transitive model MMM of ZFC, which we may
assume, without loss of generality, to be a model of V=LV=LV=L. To violate
V=LV=LV=L we need to expand MMM by adding a new set rrr so that, in the
expanded model, rrr will be non-constructible. Since all
hereditarily-finite sets are constructible, we aim to add an infinite
set of natural numbers. The first problem we face is that MMM may
contain already all subsets of ωω\omega. Fortunately, by the
Löwenheim-Skolem theorem for first-order logic, MMM has a
countable elementary submodel NNN. So, since we are only interested in
the statements that hold in MMM, and not in MMM itself, we may as well
work with NNN instead of MMM, and so we may assume that MMM itself is
countable. Then, since P(ω)P(ω)\mathcal{P}(\omega) is uncountable, there are
plenty of subsets of ωω\omega that do not belong to MMM. But,
unfortunately, we cannot just pick any infinite subset rrr of ωω\omega
that does not belong to MMM and add it to MMM. The reason is that rrr
may encode a lot of information, so that when added to MMM, MMM is no
longer a model of ZFC, or it is still a model of V=LV=LV=L. To avoid this,
one needs to pick rrr with great care. The idea is to pick rrr
generic over MMM, meaning that rrr is built from its finite
approximations in such a way that it does not have any property that
is definable in MMM and can be avoided. For example, by viewing rrr as
an infinite sequence of natural numbers in the increasing order, the
property of rrr containing only finitely-many even numbers can be
avoided, because given any finite approximation to rrr—i.e., any
finite increasing sequence of natural numbers—one can always
extend it by adding more even numbers, so that at the end of the
construction rrr will contain infinitely-many even numbers; while the
property of containing the number 7 cannot be avoided, because when a
finite approximation to rrr contains the number 7, then it stays there
no matter how the construction of rrr proceeds. Since MMM is
countable, there are such generic rrr. Then the expanded model M[r]M[r]M[r],
which includes MMM and contains the new set rrr, is called a
generic extension of MMM. Since we assumed MMM is a
transitive model of V=LV=LV=L, the model M[r]M[r]M[r] is just Lα(r)Lα(r)L_\alpha (r),
where αα\alpha is the supremum of the ordinals of MMM. Then one can
show, using the forcing relation between finite
approximations to rrr and formulas in the language of set theory
expanded with so-called names for sets in the generic
extension, that M[r]M[r]M[r] is a model of ZFC and rrr is not constructible
in M[r]M[r]M[r], hence the axiom of constructibility V=LV=LV=L fails.
In general, a forcing extension of a model MMM is obtained by
adding to MMM a generic subset GGG of some partially ordered set
PP\mathbb{P} that belongs to MMM. In the above example, PP\mathbb{P}
would be the set of all finite increasing sequences of natural
numbers, seen as finite approximations to the infinite sequence rrr,
ordered by ⊆⊆\subseteq; and GGG would be the set of all finite initial
segments of rrr.
In the case of the consistency proof of the negation of the CH, one
starts from a model MMM and adds ℵ2ℵ2\aleph_2 new subsets of ωω\omega,
so that in the generic extension the CH fails. In this case one needs
to use an appropriate partial ordering PP\mathbb{P} so that the
ℵ2ℵ2\aleph_2 of MMM is not collapsed, i.e., it is the same as
the ℵ2ℵ2\aleph_2 of the generic extension, and thus the generic
extension M[G]M[G]M[G] will satisfy the sentence that says that there are
ℵ2ℵ2\aleph_2 real numbers.
8.1 Other applications of forcing
Besides the CH, many other mathematical conjectures and problems
about the continuum, and other infinite mathematical objects, have
been shown undecidable in ZFC using the forcing technique.
One important example is Suslin’s Hypothesis (SH). Cantor
had shown that every linearly ordered set SSS without endpoints that
is dense (i.e., between any two different elements of SSS there is
another one), complete (i.e., every subset of SSS that is bounded
above has a supremum), and with a countable dense subset is isomorphic
to the real line. Suslin conjectured that this is still true if one
relaxes the requirement of containing a countable dense subset to
being ccc, i.e., every collection of pairwise-disjoint
intervals is countable. In the early 1970s, Thomas Jech produced a
consistent counterexample using forcing, and Ronald Jensen showed that
a counterexample exists in LLL. About the same time, Robert Solovay
and Stanley Tennenbaum (1971) developed and used for the first time
the iterated forcing technique to produce a model where the SH holds,
thus showing its independence from ZFC. In order to make sure that the
SH holds in the generic extension, one needs to destroy all
counterexamples, but by destroying one particular counterexample one
may inadvertently create new ones, and so one needs to force again and
again; in fact one needs to go on for at least ω2ω2\omega_2-many
steps. This is why a forcing iteration is needed.
Among other famous mathematical problems that have been shown
undecidable in ZFC thanks to the forcing technique, especially using
iterated forcing and sometimes combined with large cardinals, we may
mention the Measure Problem and the Borel Conjecture in measure
theory, Kaplansky’s Conjecture on Banach algebras, and Whitehead’s
Problem in group theory.
9. The search for new axioms
As a result of 50 years of development of the forcing technique,
and its applications to many open problems in mathematics, there are
now literally thousands of questions, in practically all areas of
mathematics, that have been shown independent of ZFC. These include
almost all questions about the structure of uncountable sets. One
might say that the undecidability phenomenon is pervasive, to the
point that the investigation of the uncountable has been rendered
nearly impossible in ZFC alone (see however Shelah (1994) for
remarkable exceptions).
This prompts the question about the truth-value of the statements
that are undecided by ZFC. Should one be content with them being
undecidable? Does it make sense at all to ask for their truth-value?
There are several possible reactions to this. One is the skeptic’s
position: the statements that are undecidable in ZFC have no definite
answer; and they may even be inherently vague. Another, the common one
among mathematicians, is Gödel’s position: the undecidability
only shows that the ZFC system is too weak to answer those questions,
and therefore one should search for new axioms that once added to ZFC
would answer them. The search for new axioms has been known as
Gödel’s Program. See Hauser (2006) for a thorough
philosophical discussion of the Program, and also the entry on
  large cardinals and determinacy
 for philosophical considerations on the justification
of new axioms for set theory.
A central theme of set theory is thus the search and classification
of new axioms. These fall currently into two main types: the axioms of
large cardinals and the forcing axioms.
10. Large cardinals
One cannot prove in ZFC that there exists a regular limit cardinal
κκ\kappa, for if κκ\kappa is such a cardinal, then LκLκL_\kappa is a
model of ZFC, and so ZFC would prove its own consistency,
contradicting Gödel’s second incompleteness theorem. Thus, the
existence of a regular limit cardinal must be postulated as a new
axiom. Such a cardinal is called weakly inaccessible. If, in
addition κκ\kappa is a strong limit, i.e., 2λ<κ2λ<κ2^\lambda &lt;\kappa, for
every cardinal λ<κλ<κ\lambda &lt;\kappa, then κκ\kappa is called
strongly inaccessible. A cardinal κκ\kappa is strongly
inaccessible if and only if it is regular and VκVκV_\kappa  is a model
of ZFC. If the GCH holds, then every weakly inaccessible cardinal is
strongly inaccessible.
Large cardinals are uncountable cardinals satisfying some
properties that make them very large, and whose existence cannot be
proved in ZFC. The first weakly inaccessible cardinal is just the
smallest of all large cardinals. Beyond inaccessible cardinals there
is a rich and complex variety of large cardinals, which form a linear
hierarchy in terms of consistency strength, and in many cases also in
terms of outright implication. See the entry on
 independence and large cardinals
 for more details.
To formulate the next stronger large-cardinal notion, let us say
that a subset CCC of an infinite cardinal κκ\kappa is closed
if every limit of elements of CCC is also in CCC; and is
unbounded if for every α<κα<κ\alpha &lt;\kappa there exists
β∈Cβ∈C\beta\in C greater than αα\alpha. For example, the set of limit
ordinals less than κκ\kappa is closed and unbounded. Also, a subset
SSS of κκ\kappa is called stationary if it intersects every
closed unbounded subset of κκ\kappa. If κκ\kappa is regular and
uncountable, then the set of all ordinals less than κκ\kappa of
cofinality ωω\omega is an example of a stationary set. A regular
cardinal κκ\kappa is called Mahlo if the set of strongly
inaccessible cardinals smaller than κκ\kappa is stationary. Thus, the
first Mahlo cardinal is much larger than the first strongly
inaccessible cardinal, as there are κκ\kappa-many strongly
inaccessible cardinals smaller than κκ\kappa.
Much stronger large cardinal notions arise from considering strong
reflection properties. Recall that the Reflection Principle
 (Section 4), which is provable in ZFC, asserts
that every true sentence (i.e., every sentence that holds in
VVV) is true in some VαVαV_\alpha. A strengthening of this principle to
second-order sentences yields some large cardinals. For example,
κκ\kappa is strongly inaccessible if and only if every Σ11Σ11\Sigma^1_1
sentence (i.e., existential second-order sentence in the language of
set theory, with one additional predicate symbol) true in any 
structure of the form (Vκ,∈,A)(Vκ,∈,A)(V_\kappa ,\in, A), where A⊆VκA⊆VκA\subseteq V_\kappa, is true
in some (Vα,∈,A∩Vα)(Vα,∈,A∩Vα)(V_\alpha ,\in ,A\cap V_\alpha), with α<κα<κ\alpha &lt;\kappa. The
same type of reflection, but now for Π11Π11\Pi^1_1 sentences (i.e.,
universal second-order sentences), yields a much stronger large
cardinal property of κκ\kappa, called weak compactness. Every
weakly compact cardinal κκ\kappa is Mahlo, and the set of Mahlo
cardinals smaller than κκ\kappa is stationary. By allowing reflection
for more complex second-order, or even higher-order, sentences one
obtains large cardinal notions stronger than weak compactness.
The most famous large cardinals, called measurable, were
discovered by Stanisław Ulam in 1930 as a result of his solution
to the Measure Problem. A (two-valued) measure, or
ultrafilter, on a cardinal κκ\kappa is a subset UUU of
P(κ)P(κ)\mathcal{P}(\kappa) that has the following properties: (i) the
intersection of any two elements of UUU is in UUU; (ii) if X∈UX∈UX\in U and
YYY is a subset of κκ\kappa such that X⊆YX⊆YX\subseteq Y, then Y∈UY∈UY\in U;
and (iii) for every X⊆κX⊆κX\subseteq\kappa, either X∈UX∈UX\in U or κ−X∈Uκ−X∈U\kappa
-X\in U, but not both. A measure UUU is called
κκ\kappa-complete if every intersection of less than κκ\kappa
elements of UUU is also in UUU. And a measure is called
non-principal if there is no α<κα<κ\alpha &lt;\kappa that belongs
to all elements of UUU. A cardinal κκ\kappa is called
measurable if there exists a measure on κκ\kappa that is
κκ\kappa-complete and non-principal.
Measurable cardinals can be characterized by elementary embeddings
of the universe VVV into some transitive class MMM. That such an
embedding j:V→Mj:V→Mj:V\to M is elementary means that jjj preserves
truth, i.e., for every formula φ(x1,…,xn)φ(x1,…,xn)\varphi (x_1,\ldots ,x_n) of the
language of set theory, and every a1,…,ana1,…,ana_1,\ldots ,a_n, the sentence
φ(a1,…,an)φ(a1,…,an)\varphi (a_1,\ldots ,a_n) holds in VVV if and only if φ(j(a1),…,j(an))φ(j(a1),…,j(an))\varphi
(j(a_1),\ldots ,j(a_n)) holds in MMM. It turns out that a cardinal
κκ\kappa is measurable if and only if there exists an elementary
embedding j:V→Mj:V→Mj:V\to M, with MMM transitive, so that κκ\kappa is the
first ordinal moved by jjj, i.e., the first ordinal such that
j(κ)≠κj(κ)≠κj(\kappa)\ne \kappa. We say that κκ\kappa is the critical
point of jjj, and write crit(j)=κcrit(j)=κcrit(j)=\kappa. The embedding jjj is
definable from a κκ\kappa-complete non-principal measure on κκ\kappa,
using the so-called ultrapower construction. Conversely, if
j:V→Mj:V→Mj:V\to M is an elementary embedding, with MMM transitive and
κ=crit(j)κ=crit(j)\kappa=crit(j), then the set U={X⊆κ:κ∈j(X)}U={X⊆κ:κ∈j(X)}U=\{ X\subseteq \kappa:\kappa\in
j(X)\} is a κκ\kappa-complete non-principal ultrafilter on
κκ\kappa. A measure UUU obtained in this way from jjj is called
normal.
Every measurable cardinal κκ\kappa is weakly compact, and there are
many weakly compact cardinals smaller than κκ\kappa. In fact, below
κκ\kappa there are many cardinals that are totally
indescribable, i.e., they reflect all sentences, of any
complexity, and in any higher-order language.
If κκ\kappa is measurable and j:V→Mj:V→Mj:V\to M is given by the ultrapower
construction, then Vκ⊆MVκ⊆MV_\kappa \subseteq M, and every sequence of
length less than or equal to κκ\kappa of elements of MMM belongs to
MMM. Thus, MMM is quite similar to VVV, but it cannot be VVV
itself. Indeed, a famous theorem of Kenneth Kunen shows that there
cannot be any elementary embedding j:V→Vj:V→Vj:V\to V, other than the trivial
one, i.e., the identity. All known proofs of this result use the Axiom
of Choice, and it is an outstanding important question if the axiom is
necessary. Kunen’s Theorem opens the door to formulating large
cardinal notions stronger than measurability by requiring that MMM is
closer to VVV.
For example, κκ\kappa is called strong if for every
ordinal αα\alpha there exists an elementary embedding j:V→Mj:V→Mj:V\to M, for
some MMM transitive, such that κ=crit(j)κ=crit(j)\kappa =crit(j) and Vα⊆MVα⊆MV_\alpha
\subseteq M.
Another important, and much stronger large cardinal notion is
supercompactness. A cardinal κκ\kappa is supercompact if for
every αα\alpha there exists an elementary embedding j:V→Mj:V→Mj:V\to M, with
MMM transitive and critical point κκ\kappa, so that
j(κ)>αj(κ)>αj(\kappa)&gt;\alpha and every sequence of elements of MMM of length
αα\alpha belongs to MMM.
Woodin cardinals fall between strong and supercompact. Every
supercompact cardinal is Woodin, and if δδ\delta is Woodin, then
VδVδV_\delta is a model of ZFC in which there is a proper class of
strong cardinals. Thus, while a Woodin cardinal δδ\delta need not be
itself very strong—the first one is not even weakly
compact—it implies the existence of many large cardinals in
VδVδV_\delta.
Beyond supercompact cardinals we find the extendible
cardinals, the huge, the super huge, etc.
Kunen’s theorem about the non-existence of a non-trivial elementary
embedding j:V→Vj:V→Vj:V\to V actually shows that there cannot be an elementary
embedding j:Vλ+2→Vλ+2j:Vλ+2→Vλ+2j:V_{\lambda +2}\to V_{\lambda +2} different from the
identity, for any λλ\lambda.
The strongest large cardinal notions not known to be inconsistent,
modulo ZFC, are the following:

There exists an elementary embedding j:Vλ+1→Vλ+1j:Vλ+1→Vλ+1j:V_{\lambda +1}\to
V_{\lambda +1} different from the identity.
There exists an elementary embedding j:L(Vλ+1)→L(Vλ+1)j:L(Vλ+1)→L(Vλ+1)j:L(V_{\lambda +1})\to
L(V_{\lambda +1}) different from the identity.

Large cardinals form a linear hierarchy of increasing consistency
strength. In fact they are the stepping stones of the interpretability
hierarchy of mathematical theories. See the entry on
 independence and large cardinals
 for more details. Given any sentence φφ\varphi, exactly
one the following three possibilities holds about the theory ZFC plus
φφ\varphi:

ZFC plus φφ\varphi is inconsistent.
ZFC plus φφ\varphi is equiconsistent with ZFC.
ZFC plus φφ\varphi is equiconsistent with ZFC plus the existence of
some large cardinal.

Thus, large cardinals can be used to prove that a given sentence
φφ\varphi does not imply another sentence ψψ\psi, modulo ZFC, by
showing that ZFC plus ψψ\psi implies the consistency of some large
cardinal, whereas ZFC plus φφ\varphi is consistent assuming the
existence of a smaller large cardinal, or just assuming the
consistency of ZFC. In other words, ψψ\psi has higher consistency
strength than φφ\varphi, modulo ZFC. Then, by Gödel’s second
incompleteness theorem, ZFC plus φφ\varphi cannot prove ψψ\psi,
assuming ZFC plus φφ\varphi is consistent.
As we already pointed out, one cannot prove in ZFC that large
cardinals exist. But everything indicates that their existence not
only cannot be disproved, but in fact the assumption of their
existence is a very reasonable axiom of set theory. For one thing,
there is a lot of evidence for their consistency, especially for those
large cardinals for which it is possible to construct an inner
model.
10.1 Inner models of large cardinals
An inner model of ZFC is a transitive proper class that
contains all the ordinals and satisfies all ZFC axioms. Thus, LLL is
the smallest inner model, while VVV is the largest. Some large
cardinals, such as inaccessible, Mahlo, or weakly-compact, may exist
in LLL. That is, if κκ\kappa has one of these large cardinal
properties, then it also has the property in LLL. But some large
cardinals cannot exist in LLL. Indeed, Scott (1961) showed that if
there exists a measurable cardinal κκ\kappa, then V≠LV≠LV\ne L. It is
important to notice that κκ\kappa does belong to LLL, since LLL
contains all ordinals, but it is not measurable in LLL because a
κκ\kappa-complete non-principal measure on κκ\kappa cannot exist
there.
If κκ\kappa is a measurable cardinal, then one can construct an
LLL-like model in which κκ\kappa is measurable by taking a
κκ\kappa-complete non-principal and normal measure UUU on κκ\kappa,
and proceeding as in the definition of LLL, but now using UUU as an
additional predicate. The resulting model, called L[U]L[U]L[U], is an inner
model of ZFC in which κκ\kappa is measurable, and in fact κκ\kappa is
the only measurable cardinal. The model is canonical, in the sense
that any other normal measure witnessing the measurability of κκ\kappa
would yield the same model, and has many of the properties of LLL. For
instance, it has a projective well ordering of the reals, and it
satisfies the GCH.
Building similar LLL-like models for stronger large cardinals, such
as strong, or Woodin, is much harder. Those models are of the form
L[E]L[E]L[E], where EEE is a sequence of extenders, each extender
being a system of measures, that encode the relevant elementary
embeddings.
The largest LLL-like inner models for large cardinals that have
been obtained so far can contain Woodin limits of Woodin cardinals
(Neeman 2002). However, building an LLL-like model for a supercompact
cardinal is still a challenge. The supercompact barrier seems to be
the crucial one, for Woodin has shown that for a kind of LLL-like
inner model for a supercompact cardinal, which he calls the
Ultimate-LLL, all stronger large cardinals that may exist in VVV, such as
extendible, huge, I1, etc. would also exist in the model. The
construction of Ultimate-LLL is still incomplete, and it is not clear
yet that it will succeed, for it rests upon some technical hypotheses
that need to be confirmed.
10.2 Consequences of large cardinals
The existence of large cardinals has dramatic consequences, even
for simply-definable small sets, like the projective sets of real
numbers. For example, Solovay (1970) proved, assuming that there
exists a measurable cardinal, that all Σ12Σ21\mathbf{\Sigma}^1_2 sets of
reals are Lebesgue measurable and have the Baire property, which
cannot be proved in ZFC alone. And Shelah and Woodin (1990) showed
that the existence of a proper class of Woodin cardinals implies that
the theory of L(R)L(R)L(\mathbb{R}), even with real numbers as parameters,
cannot be changed by forcing, which implies that all sets of real
numbers that belong to L(R)L(R)L(\mathbb{R}) are regular. Further, under a
weaker large-cardinal hypothesis, namely the existence of infinitely
many Woodin cardinals, Martin and Steel (1989) proved that every
projective set of real numbers is determined, i.e., the axiom of PD
holds, hence all projective sets are regular. Moreover, Woodin showed
that the existence of infinitely many Woodin cardinals, plus a
measurable cardinal above all of them, implies that every set of reals
in L(R)L(R)L(\mathbb{R}) is determined, i.e., the axiom ADL(R)ADL(R)AD^{L(\mathbb{R})}
holds, hence all sets of real numbers that belong to L(R)L(R)L(\mathbb{R}),
and therefore all projective sets, are regular. He also showed that
Woodin cardinals provide the optimal large cardinal assumptions by
proving that the following two statements:

There are infinitely many Woodin cardinals.
ADL(R)ADL(R)AD^{L({\Bbb R})}.

are equiconsistent, i.e., ZFC plus 1 is consistent if and only if
ZFC plus 2 is consistent. See the entry on
 large cardinals and determinacy
 for more details and related results.
Another area in which large cardinals play an important role is the
exponentiation of singular cardinals. The so-called Singular
Cardinal Hypothesis (SCH) completely determines the behavior of
the exponentiation for singular cardinals, modulo the exponentiation
for regular cardinals. The SCH follows from the GCH, and so it holds
in LLL. A consequence of the SCH is that if
2ℵn<ℵω2ℵn<ℵω2^{\aleph_n}&lt;\aleph_\omega, for all finite nnn, then
2ℵω=ℵω+12ℵω=ℵω+12^{\aleph_{\omega}}=\aleph_{\omega +1}. Thus, if the GCH holds for
cardinals smaller than ℵωℵω\aleph_\omega, then it also holds at
ℵωℵω\aleph_\omega. The SCH holds above the first supercompact cardinal
(Solovay). But Magidor (1977) showed that, remarkably, assuming the
existence of large cardinals it is possible to build a model of ZFC
where the GCH first fails at ℵωℵω\aleph_\omega, hence the SCH
fails. Large cardinals stronger than measurable are actually needed
for this. In contrast, however, ZFC alone suffices to prove that if
the SCH holds for all cardinals smaller than ℵω1ℵω1\aleph_{\omega_1}, then
it also holds for ℵω1ℵω1\aleph_{\omega_1}. Moreover, if the SCH holds for
all singular cardinals of countable cofinality, then it holds for all
singular cardinals (Silver).
11. Forcing axioms
Forcing axioms are axioms of set theory that assert that certain
existential statements are absolute between the universe VVV of all
sets and its (ideal) forcing extensions, i.e., some existential
statements that hold in some forcing extensions of VVV are already
true in VVV. The first forcing axiom was formulated by Donald Martin
in the wake of the Solovay-Tennenbaum proof of the consistency of
Suslin’s Hypothesis, and is now known as Martin’s Axiom
(MA). Before we state it, let us say that a partial ordering
is a non-empty set PPP together with a binary relation ≤≤\leq on PPP
that is reflexive and transitive. Two elements, ppp and qqq, of PPP
are called compatible if there exists r∈Pr∈Pr\in P such that
r≤pr≤pr\leq p and r≤qr≤qr\leq q. An antichain of PPP is a subset of
PPP whose elements are pairwise-incompatible. A partial ordering PPP
is called ccc if every antichain of PPP is countable. A
non-empty subset GGG of PPP is called a filter if (i) every
two elements of GGG are compatible, and (ii) if p∈Gp∈Gp\in G and p≤qp≤qp\leq
q, then also q∈Gq∈Gq\in G. Finally, a subset DDD of PPP is called
dense if for every p∈Pp∈Pp\in P there is q∈Dq∈Dq\in D such that
q≤pq≤pq\leq p.
MA asserts the following:

For every ccc partial ordering PPP and every set {Dα:α<ω1}{Dα:α<ω1}\{ D_\alpha
:\alpha &lt;\omega_1\} of dense subsets of PPP, there exists a filter
G⊆PG⊆PG\subseteq P that is generic for the set, i.e., G∩Dα≠∅G∩Dα≠∅G\cap
D_\alpha \ne {\varnothing}, for all α<ω1α<ω1\alpha
&lt;\omega_1.
Martin and Solovay (1970) proved that MA is consistent with ZFC,
using iterated forcing with the ccc property. At first sight, MA may
not look like an axiom, namely an obvious, or at least reasonable,
assertion about sets, but rather like a technical statement about ccc
partial orderings. It does look more natural, however, when expressed
in topological terms, for it is simply a generalization of the
well-known Baire Category Theorem, which asserts that in every compact
Hausdorff topological space the intersection of countably-many dense
open sets is non-empty. Indeed, MA is equivalent to:

In every compact Hausdorff ccc topological space, the intersection
of ℵ1ℵ1\aleph_1-many dense open sets is non-empty.
MA has many different equivalent formulations and has been used
very successfully to settle a large number of open problems in other
areas of mathematics. For example, it implies Suslin’s Hypothesis and
that every Σ12Σ21\mathbf{\Sigma}^1_2 set of reals is Lebesgue measurable
and has the Baire property. It also implies the negation of the CH and
that 2ℵ02ℵ02^{\aleph_0} is a regular cardinal, but it does not decide what
cardinal it is. See Fremlin (1984) for many more consequences of MA
and other equivalent formulations. In spite of this, the status of MA
as an axiom of set theory is still unclear. Perhaps the most natural
formulation of MA, from a foundational point of view, is in terms of
reflection. Writing HC for the set of hereditarily-countable sets
(i.e., countable sets whose elements are countable, the elements of
which are also countable, and so on), MA is equivalent to:

For every ccc partial ordering PPP, if an existential statement
about HCHCHC holds in an (ideal) generic extension of VVV obtained by
forcing with PPP, then the statement is true, i.e., it holds in
VVV. In other words, if a set having a property that depends only on
sets in HCHCHC exists in some (ideal) generic extension of VVV obtained
by forcing with a ccc partial ordering, then a set with that property
already exists in VVV.
The notion of ideal generic extension of VVV can be made precise in
terms of so-called Boolean-valued models, which provide an alternative
version of forcing.
Much stronger forcing axioms than MA were introduced in the 1980s,
such as J. Baumgartner’s Proper Forcing Axiom (PFA), and the
stronger Martin’s Maximum (MM) of Foreman, Magidor, and
Shelah (1988), which is essentially the strongest possible forcing
axiom. Both the PFA and MM are consistent relative to the existence of
a supercompact cardinal. The PFA asserts the same as MA, but for
partial orderings that have a property weaker than the ccc, called
properness, introduced by Shelah. And MM asserts the same for
the wider class of partial orderings that, when forcing with them, do
not destroy stationary subsets of ω1ω1\omega_1.
Strong forcing axioms, such as the PFA and MM imply that all
projective sets of reals are determined (PD), and have many other
strong consequences in infinite combinatorics. Notably, they imply
that the cardinality of the continuum is ℵ2ℵ2\aleph_2.
