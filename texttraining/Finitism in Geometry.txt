In our representations of the world, especially in physics,
(mathematical) infinities play a crucial role. The continuum of the
real numbers, Rℜ\Re, as a representation of time or of
one-dimensional space is surely the best known example and, by
extension, the nnn-fold cartesian product, Rnℜn\Re^{n}, for
nnn-dimensional space. However, these same infinities also cause
problems. One just has to think about Zeno’s paradoxes or the
present-day continuation of that discussion, namely the discussion
about supertasks, to see the difficulties (see
the entry on supertasks in this
encyclopedia for a full treatment). Hence, it is a very tempting
idea to investigate whether it is possible to eliminate these
infinities and still be able to do physics. The first step towards an
answer to that question is to examine whether or not a discrete
geometry is possible that can approximate classical continuous
geometry as closely as possible. For, if such is the case, the latter
geometry can easily be replaced by a discrete version in any physical
theory that makes use of this particular mathematical background.
Straightforward as the task may seem, there are however at least
two ways in which the concept of approximation can be
understood. Suppose that TTT is a physical theory that is based on
classical geometry. Then an approximation to TTT can mean two
different things:

For all concepts in TTT, including the geometrical concepts, a
discrete analog is proposed (if such a thing exists), or
An underlying theory T′T′T^\prime is formulated using possibly
different concepts in such a way that the classical concepts can be
derived from T′T′T^\prime.

In the sections that follow an overview will be presented of (some
of) the various attempts that fall under (a) or (b). However, before
embarking on this journey, several caveats have to be
mentioned.
 
1. Some general considerations
The most important thing to take into account is, given a
particular proposal for a discrete geometry, what the scientific
and/or philosophical background is of the author(s) and, related to
that, what their intentions are. Are they logicians, mathematicians,
computer scientists, physicists or philosophers (to list the five most
frequently occurring cases)? Do they want to solve a mere technical, a
physical or a philosophical problem? Are they worried about
foundational aspects or is the object of their research to further
develop existing theories? It is worthwhile to go into some more
detail for each of the five types of author(s) mentioned to illustrate
these questions.
1.1 Logicians
Logicians are often interested in displaying the underlying logical
structure of a theory, physical or mathematical, and in exploring
whether or not there are alternatives, usually by changing the
underlying logical principles. One could imagine a geometry based not
on classical logic, but, e.g., on intuitionistic logic, where
principles such as the excluded third, i.e., ppp or not-ppp, for
any statement ppp, or double negation, i.e., if not-not-ppp then
ppp, no longer hold. Often the goal is to find a complete
classification of all possibilities. This approach implies that the
logician working on and developing discrete models, does not
necessarily believe that these models are correct or true in some
sense. They merely help to understand better what classical geometry
is.
A perfect illustration of such an approach is the work on spatial
logic, see Aiello et al. (2007) for an excellent overview. The authors
compare their approach to the work done in temporal logic (see
the entry on temporal logic in this
encyclopedia). There are plenty of ways to model time: with a
starting and/or final point, discrete or continuous, linear, cyclic or
branching, …. The logical task is to construct a language that
allows one to “talk” about all these structures and to be
able to differentiate between them. In temporal logic such a language
uses the operators FpFpFp (“I will be the case that
ppp”) and PpPpPp (“It has been the case that
ppp”). One example: if time is linear in the future, then this
property can be expressed as follows. Suppose that FpFpFp and FqFqFq
are given, then only three things are possible: either F(p&q)F(p&q)F(p \amp
q), i.e., ppp and qqq will be the case, or F(p&Fq)F(p&Fq)F(p \amp Fq),
i.e., ppp will happen first and then qqq, or F(Fp&q)F(Fp&q)F(Fp \amp q),
i.e., the other way round.  In one formula: (Fp&Fq)→(F(p&q)(Fp&Fq)→(F(p&q)(Fp \amp Fq) \rightarrow
(F(p \amp q) or F(p&Fq)F(p&Fq)F(p \amp Fq) or F(Fp&q))F(Fp&q))F(Fp \amp q)). In an
entirely similar way, to construct such a language is what spatial
logic wants to achieve for geometry and is thus related to the
proposals that we will discuss in section
3.
1.2 Mathematicians
A mathematician might be looking at or studying a discrete or
finite counterpart of an existing theory just to see, e.g., what
theorems remain provable in both cases. This in itself is interesting
from the perspective of so-called reverse mathematics. The core
question is to find out what is necessarily required to prove certain
theorems? See, e.g., Simpson (2005) and Stillwell (2016). Proofs that also hold in a
discrete geometry are thus independent from any assumption about
discreteness or continuity.  One might however go deeper into the
foundations of mathematics and study finite geometries from a
foundational perspective. One such approach is strict finitism
(although sometimes the terms ultra-finitism or ultra-intuitionism are
used as well) that is not meant as a subtheory of other foundational
theories but as an alternative on its own. It shares with the many
forms of constructivism the fundamental view that mathematical objects
and concepts have to be accessible to the mathematician in terms of
constructions that can be executed or performed. The various forms are
distinguished from one another as to how the concepts of
“execution” or “performance” are to be
understood. Most constructivists allow for the potentially infinite,
i.e., if a procedure or algorithm will (provably) terminate at some
moment in the future, then the outcome is accepted as
constructable. See Bridges & Richman
(1987) for an overview
and the entry on
  constructive mathematics.
Strict finitism wants to go one step further and argues that an
indefinite outcome is not be accepted as an outcome, since, as all
computational resources are finite, it could very well be that these
resources have been used up before the outcome has been reached. The
additional qualification serves to make the distinction with
Hilbert’s finitism which, roughly speaking, can be seen as a
form of finitism on the meta-level (e.g., although mathematical
theories can talk about infinite structures, still the proofs in such
theories must have a finite length). As might be expected, strict
finitism is not a popular view in the philosophy of
mathematics. Nevertheless a number of proposals have been put
forward. A history and an account of the actual (though now somewhat
dated) state of affairs can be found in Welti
(1987). In section 2 more will be said
about such proposals.
1.3 Computer scientists
In the computer sciences the theories and proposals that have been
put forward are of a quite different nature than the logical and
mathematical ones, although they do inspire one another. The problem
one faces here is precisely to set up a translation from a classical
geometrical, analogous model to a model whereof the domain (usually)
consists of the finite set of pixels or cells that make up the
(computer) screen. The obvious drawback (from the perspective of this
entry) is that nearly all these models assume the classical (infinite)
model in the background and, hence, do not have a proper foundation of
their own—a situation quite analogous to numerical analysis that
relies on classical analysis for proving the correctness of the
procedures. Most attention is paid to the problem of proving
correspondences between the original and the discrete model to make
sure that the image obtained is, in certain respects, faithful to the
original. A simple mathematical example concerns the number of holes
in a 3-dimensional Euclidean surface. One wants to be sure that every
hole that shows up in the digital picture does indeed correspond to a
hole in the original mathematical object. See Borwein & Devlin
(2009) for more examples. However, that being said, there is some work being done that does not want to rely on the classical continuous background but instead looks for “proper” axiomatisations and/or formalisations of a pixel geometry. See Kulpa (1979) and, more recently, Danielsson (2002) for some nice examples.
Note also that these theories should not be confused with computer
programs that have the ability to reason about geometrical
objects. This is part of the research area of automated
reasoning—see Chou et al. (1994) for a nice introduction —
and its basic objects are proofs, not necessarily the mathematical
objects the proofs are about.
1.4 Physicists
As is commonly known, one of the hot topics in physics is the
search for the unification of quantum (field) theory and general
relativity theory. If successful, the famous “Theory of
Everything” would result. As is equally well-known, the hardest
problem to solve is how to deal with space-time. Quantum (field)
theory requires space and time as a background, whereas in general
relativity the structure of space-time is largely determined by the
masses and the energy present.  One way out—and most
of section 3 deals with such
examples—is to find a “deeper” structure that
underlies both theories and that, in a sense, generates space and time
from more fundamental concepts. Clearly, if such a theory were to be
found, it would not merely produce “just” a model, but it
would actually be considered as a genuine representation of
reality. Most of these models, speculative as some of them may be at
the present moment, turn out to be discrete and hence these proposals,
in contradistinction, e.g., with the logicians, do claim to be a
correct description. For a recent informal overview, see Rovelli (2016), especially chapter 11, “The End of Infinity”.
From the historical perspective, it must be added that on and off
some physicist tried to find out what discrete counterparts of
existing classical physical theories could look like. Usually the
philosophical underpinnings of such an attempt tend to be rather
idiosyncratic. In section 2 one such
example will be presented. Typically such attempts did not create a
major stir, they quickly disappeared into the background, but
nevertheless they do contain some interesting and relevant ideas.
1.5 Philosophers
In a rather straightforward sense, all of the above involves
philosophers as well. Discussions about logical systems, about
foundational mathematical theories, about Zeno paradoxes, about
supertasks, about what a model and a representation are, …, are
typically topics that belong to the domain of the philosophers. In
addition they bring in arguments from other philosophical and/or
scientific domains. Suppose that there are excellent arguments from an
epistemological or ontological perspective, claiming that the world
should be considered discrete, then these arguments can support the
search for such a discrete worldview, including the elaboration of a
discrete geometry. Even if from the mathematical point of view, the
theory looks rather clumsy or difficult to work with, nevertheless,
because of the philosophical considerations, it has to be so. Without
such supporting arguments, one’s position in such a case would
be much weaker. Finally, they also pay attention to the historical
side of the matter. It is rather striking, but this will not be
presented here, to see that many proposals have been put forward in
the course of our history to demonstrate that space, time and man
should be considered finite and/or discrete. See, e.g., Sorabji (1983)
and Moore (1993) for excellent historical overviews, White (1992)
for twentieth-century developments, and Franklin (2017) and Lyons (2017) for some recent contributions.
As said, these five groups are the most important ones so
completeness has not been demonstrated and neither has mutual
exclusiveness been shown. This short overview only meant to list the
different intentions, motivations, purposes and methodologies of the
parties involved.
2. Discrete geometries as direct analogs
The first question to settle is what the classical theory will be.
As most of the work that has been done has been limited to the plane,
this presentation will also be restricted to that particular case (in
most proposals the extension to higher dimensional geometries is
considered to be completely straightforward). But that is not
sufficient, for there are different routes to follow as to the
presentation of plane geometry. One possibility is to take any
axiomatisation of the (Euclidean) plane—say, Hilbert’s
formulation of 1899 in his Grundlagen der Geometrie—and
show what changes are required to have (a) finite models of the
axiomatic theory, and (b) finite models that approximate the classical
(infinite, Euclidean) models as closely as possible. One of the very
first attempts dates back to the late 40s, early 50s and will
therefore be presented here as an exemplar (in the sense that it has
both all the positive qualities required as well as the oddities that
seem to go together with such attempts). More specifically, it
concerns the work of Paul Kustaanheimo in partial collaboration with
G. Järnefelt in the period between 1949 and 1957. Next a recent
proposal will be discussed, along totally different lines, of Patrick
Suppes and a somewhat older proposal of Ludwik Silberstein, where the
geometry is directly imbedded in a physical theory, special relativity
theory to be precise. The concluding section of this part deals with
some specific problems and tentative solutions.
2.1 A standard axiomatisation for Euclidean plane geometry
What does a Hilbert-type axiomatisation look like? The first thing
one has to do is to fix a (formal) language. Usually one chooses
first-order predicate logic with identity, i.e., a language containing
names for variables (and, possibly, for constants), names for
functions (if necessary), names for predicates including the identity
predicate, logical connectives and quantifiers, and a set of
grammatical rules to form sentences. The restriction to first-order
logic means that only variables can be quantified over. Without going
into details, it should be remarked that a more expressive language
can be chosen, e.g., whereby quantification over predicates is allowed
as well.
Once a language has been chosen, the next problem is to determine
the primitive terms of the language. For plane Euclidean geometry,
these are points and lines, although sometimes lines are defined as
particular sets of points. Next the basic predicates have to be
selected. There exist a number of different axiomatisations at the
present moment. The most frequently used predicates are: the incidence
relation (“a point aaa lies on a line AAA”), the
betweenness relation (“point aaa lies between points bbb and
ccc”), the equidistance relation (“the distance from
point aaa to bbb is the same as the distance from point ccc to
ddd”), the congruence relation (“a part of a line,
determined by two point aaa and bbb is congruent to a part of a
line, determined by two points ccc and ddd”). Note that it
is not necessary that all of them occur in an axiomatisation. As an
example, if lines are not introduced as primitive terms, then usually
there is no incidence relation.
The next step is the introduction of a set of axioms to determine
certain properties of the above mentioned relations. As an example, if
the axiomatisation uses the incidence relation, then the typical
axioms for that relation are:

Through two points exactly one straight line can be drawn.
There are at least two points on every straight line.
There are at least three points that are not on the same straight line.

Finally, one looks for an interpretation or a model of the
axiomatisation. This means that we search for a meaning of the
primitive terms, such as points and lines, of the functions (if any)
and of the predicates in such a way that the axioms become true
statements relative to the interpretation. Although we often have a
particular interpretation in mind when we develop an axiomatisation,
it does not exclude the possibility of the existence of rather
unexpected models. In a sense finitist models rely on this very
possibility as the next paragraph shows.
2.2 The Finnish school and natural geometry
Paul Kustaanheimo was a member of a group of mathematicians based
at Helsinki, who were all interested in some form of finite
geometry. The most prominent members were G. Järnefelt,
P. Kustaanheimo, and R.  Lehti. The origin of their inspiration is to
be found in the work of J.T. Hjelmslev who developed so-called
“natural” geometry (“Die natürliche
Geometrie”, see his 1923 book), also referred to sometimes
as “physical” geometry. Their approach has not known any continuation, one exception being Reisler and Smith (1969). However, in a strange way there is a
connection with Suppes’ approach to be discussed later in the
sense that geometry is primarily seen as (almost) an experimental
science, i.e., the geometer deals with rulers and compasses, creates
flat surfaces to measure, and so on. Of course, since we humans can
only manipulate finite objects in finite ways, a discrete geometry
must result.
Kustaanheimo’s proposal—I reproduce here in rough
outline the excellent presentation of his proposal in Welti (1987:
487–521), which is far more accessible than the original
work—is based on the following line of reasoning. A standard
model for the classical axiomatic theory of Euclidean geometry
consists of the cartesian product of the real numbers with itself. Or,
as it is usually formulated, a point in the plane is mapped onto a
couple of real numbers, its coordinates. The real numbers have the
mathematical structure of an infinite field. But finite fields exist
as well. So why not replace the infinite real number field with a
finite field, a so-called Galois field?
The best result one could obtain would be that every finite Galois
field satisfies most of the axioms of Euclidean geometry. That however
is not the case. The outcome of Kustaanheimo’s research is
slightly more complicated:

Not all finite fields will do. If we call ppp the number of
elements in the domain of the finite field, then ppp has to satisfy
some conditions. This means that only finite fields of a particular
size, i.e., a specific value for ppp, are potential candidates.
For the “good” values of ppp, the full model will
not do. As an example, take straight lines. According to their
definition in a finite field, it turns out that there are two sorts of
straight lines: open and closed ones. The latter ones violate some of
the axioms, hence you restrict the model to the open ones. This
restriction of the model is called the Euclidean “kernel”
of the model.

In short, one cannot claim that any finite field will do, but only
some and for that matter only part of it.
This approach raises some important philosophical questions:

It is clear that the size of the model is an important
feature. Does this have any meaning? Or, negatively, what does it mean
that fields of a different size are not suitable as models? Suppose as
a thought experiment that Euclidean geometry is a good model for the
geometrical structure of the universe. Does it make sense to claim
that the universe must contain exactly ppp points (not p−1p−1p-1, not
p+1p+1p+1)? A new sort of Pythagoreanism seems to be lurking around the
corner here.
The example of the straight lines shows that there are
“nice” geometrical objects (those that satisfy most of the
axioms) and “bad” geometrical objects. Ignoring
the bad ones is perhaps a mathematically interesting strategy, but it
does not eliminate them from the full model. In other words,
although they do not play any relevant part in the
“kernel” of the model, they are there. What is the meaning
of that? To continue the above thought experiment, the question is
what corresponds to the “bad” objects in the universe? If
they do not correspond to anything, why do we need them in the first
place to find the “good” objects?

In defense of Kustaanheimo’s approach it must be said that
the connections between infinite and finite models are usually far
more complex than one expects. A finite model is not merely a
scaled-down version of an infinite model. Very often a different
structure appears.  As an analogy take the (infinite set of) natural
numbers. Take a finite part, say the numbers 1 up to LLL. In the
finite case it makes sense to talk about small and large numbers
compared to LLL.  This is classically not possible. So one finds
additional structure.  Metaphorically speaking, by making things
finite, a more detailed or “fine-grained” structure
appears, that is wiped out in the presence of infinities. Perhaps the
distinction between “good” and “bad”
geometrical objects is such an additional feature that disappears in
the classical Euclidean model.  Thus perhaps the prime numbers do have
a significance. But still the question remains: is this a new sort of
Pythagoreanism? More details about Kustaanheimo’s approach are
to be found in the supplementary document:
Finite Fields as Models for Euclidean Plane Geometry.
2.3 A constructive approach
The originality of Suppes’ approach resides in the fact that
he proposes to formulate geometry as a practice of constructions,
comparable to Hjelmslev’s work yet quite distinct. A
construction is here to be understood in the elementary sense of
producing drawings or diagrams, using certain instruments, such as a
ruler and/or a compass, and not in the modern sense in foundational
terms, i.e., a constructive, axiomatic foundation for geometry.
Two elements are important from the (strict) finitist perspective.
Firstly, constructions can be formulated in a quantifier-free way; the
expression “draw a line” does not imply that we need to
speak about the complete set of lines in a plane. “Draw a
line” will result in a specific finite object, namely a line
fragment on, e.g., a piece of paper. Secondly, all models considered
will be finite, because no matter what constructions are performed,
the starting point will always be a finite set of points.
Suppes considers two basic operations: the operation BBB, that
corresponds with bisecting a line ababab and the operation DDD, that
corresponds with doubling a line ababab. A step CiCiC_{i} in a
construction consists of three elements: the first element is the
(new) point to be constructed, the second element is a pair of points
that are already present, and the third element is either BBB or
DDD, according to what operation is selected. The starting position
consists of three given points, a,ba,ba, b, and ccc.
Example: consider the construction ((d,ac,B),(e,bd,D))((d,ac,B),(e,bd,D))((d, ac, B), (e, bd, D))
consisting of two steps. The first step says to start with acacac and
construct the mid-point ddd, and in the second step we take the
segment bdbdbd and double it. A diagrammatic representation makes
clear what is happening:


Figure 1

Starting from the triple a,ba,ba, b, and ccc, we have constructed
the parallelogram abce.
Of course, merely listing a set of constructions is not sufficient
to talk about a geometrical theory, so it has to be shown, as it is
indeed done by Suppes, that a formal-axiomatic treatment is possible.
It suffices to list a set of necessary axioms about the BBB and
DDD operations, so that one can prove that the figure drawn in the
example above is indeed a parallelogram. In addition a representation
theorem is proven such that points are attributed rational
coordinates.
Two important comments must be made. First, it remains to be shown
that this elementary geometrical theory can be expanded all the way
into a full-fledged geometrical theory that can be considered a
plausible alternative to classical geometry. Suppes himself seems
quite confident as he writes:
my own conviction is that one can go the entire
distance, or certainly almost the entire distance, in a purely
finitistic way, … (2001: 136)
Secondly, the focus on constructions opens up a novel way to deal
with the problem of the distance function. We do not need a general
distance function, but, for each separate case, we have to be able to
attribute coordinates to the points present in the diagram and nothing
more. It remains to be seen however whether the basic operations,
BBB and DDD, can be extended without losing this important
property.
In section 2.5, I will return to the
distance problem to present some other solutions that have been put
forward. First, however, a quite different approach from the physical
side.
2.4 A direct physical example: a discrete version of special relativity theory
In 1936 Silberstein proposes a fairly straightforward discrete
theory. The only thing we use in physics are labels, x,y,z,tx,y,z,tx, y, z, t
and, when discrete, these can always be labelled with integers. In the
short booklet that brings together the five lectures on this theme,
Silberstein restricts himself to one spatial and one time
parameter. Although he acknowledges the problem (1936: 15) of higher
dimensions, he does not deal with it. So the distance problem becomes
rather trivial since on a line, the discrete distance function and the
Euclidean distance function coincide. His proposal is elementary in
the sense that the smallest distance, viz. the distance between two
adjacent points xixix_{i} and xi+1xi+1x_{i+1} is equal to 1 and likewise
for the time coordinate, so that 1 becomes the maximum velocity, put
equal to ccc, so c=1c=1c = 1. Analogs for derivatives are defined,
differential equations are replaced by difference equations, an analog
in terms of finite differences is derived of the Taylor series and
most of classical physics can be imitated. It is worth mentioning that
the lectures include a rough calculation of the size of the chronons,
i.e., the smallest unit of time, and hodons, i.e., the smallest unit
of (one-dimensional) space. Suppose that aaa is the number of hodons
in one centimetre and bbb the number of chronons in one second, then
(1/a)(1/b)=ba=c=3.1010cm/s, or b=3.1010⋅a.(1/a)(1/b)=ba=c=3.1010cm/s, or b=3.1010⋅a. \frac{(1/a)}{(1/b)} = \frac{b}{a} = c = 3.10^{10}\text{cm/s,}\quad
\text{ or }\quad b = 3.10^{10}\cdot a. If we fix a lower limit for
aaa, say 10−810−810^{-8} cm (this is actually Silberstein’s
suggestion!), then b=3.1010⋅a≥3.1018b=3.1010⋅a≥3.1018b = 3.10^{10}\cdot a \geq 3.10^{18}, being the
number of chronons in one second. He further applies the discrete
spacetime framework to special relativity and here too, an analog is
found. Quite interesting in this approach is the fact that additional
conditions appear that are not needed in the classical case. Here is
one illustration.

Special relativity theory relies on the expression, here restricted
to one spatial dimension, viz., x2−c2t2x2−c2t2x^{2} - c^{2}t^{2}. Thus any
change to new coordinates x′x′x', t′t′t', has to satisfy x2−c2t2=x′2−c2t′2x2−c2t2=x′2−c2t′2x^{2} -
c^{2}t^{2} = x'^{2} - c^{2}t'^{2}. Suppose that we write x=ax′+bt′x=ax′+bt′x = ax' +
bt' and t=cx′+dt′t=cx′+dt′t = cx' + dt', then the inverse relations will be x′=(dx′−bt′)(ad−bc) and t′=(ax′−ct′)(ad−bc).x′=(dx′−bt′)(ad−bc) and t′=(ax′−ct′)(ad−bc).x' =
\frac{(dx' - bt')}{(ad - bc)} \quad\text{ and }\quad t' = \frac{(ax' -
ct')}{(ad - bc)}. If however, xxx, x′x′x', ttt and t′t′t' all
have to be integers, then necessarily ad−bc=1ad−bc=1ad - bc = 1. This last
condition is a pure consequence of the fact that we are thinking in a
discrete way, using integers.

2.5 Some partial solutions and problems to deal with
In this section three specific problems will be discussed that need
to be solved if any proposal for a discrete geometry is to be taken
seriously: the distance function problem, the dimension problem, the
anisotropy problem, and the identification problem.
The distance function problem. There is a rather
devastating argument that shows the impossibility of a genuine
distance function for a discrete geometry. It dates back to 1949 and
was first formulated by Hermann Weyl:
If a square is built up of miniature tiles, then
there are as many tiles along the diagonal as there are along the
sides; thus the diagonal should be equal in length to the side. (Weyl
1949: 43)
At least three solutions to this problem have been formulated.
 Van Bendegem (1987) argued that in a finite geometry it should be
a basic fact that lines and points have extensions. In particular,
lines are supposed to have a constant width (independent of the
orientation of the line) NDNDN_{D} Thus NDNDN_{D} represents a large
(finite) number, corresponding to the number of squares that form
NDNDN_{D}. Given a line, the width is always defined as perpendicular
to that line. Now suppose that the line has an orientation
corresponding to an angle αα\alpha between the line and the
xxx-axis. Then the width NDNDN_{D} of that line, when projected on
the xxx-axis will be [NDsinα][NDsin⁡α]\left[\frac{N_{D}}{\sin \alpha}\right]
where the expression [x][x][x] indicates the greatest integer less than
or equal to xxx.  


Figure 2

The distance ddd between two points ppp and qqq is then
defined as the number of squares in the rectangle formed by the line
from ppp to qqq and the width NDNDN_{D}, divided by NDNDN_{D}. The
idea is that, although in a discrete geometry lines must necessarily
have a width, this is not an essential feature, so it can be divided
out.  Hence:
d(p,q)=NL⋅[NDsinα](divND).d(p,q)=NL⋅[NDsin⁡α](divND).d(p,q) = N_{L} \cdot \left[ \frac{N_{D}}{\sin \alpha}\right] (\mathrm{div}\, N_{D}).
NLNLN_{L} here corresponds to the number of layers parallel to the
xxx-axis between ppp and qqq and n(divm)n(divm)n (\mathrm{div}\, m) is the
quotient of the division of nnn by m.m.m.
 As an illustration, consider the Weyl problem.


Figure 3.

We have a right-angled triangle pqr such that for
simplicity the right sides pqpqpq and qrqrqr are equal to one another
and are aligned with the axes of the grid. Suppose that the number of
squares in the right sides is NLNLN_{L}.  Then
d(p,q)=d(q,r)=NL⋅[ND](divND)=NL,d(p,q)=d(q,r)=NL⋅[ND](divND)=NL,
\begin{align*}
d(p,q) &amp;= d(q,r) \\
&amp;= N_{L} \cdot [ N_{D}] (\mbox{div}\, N_{D}) \\
&amp;= N_{L},\\
\end{align*}

since, of course, [ND][ND][N_{D}] = NDNDN_{D}.  However, the hypotenuse
has an angle of α=2√2α=22\alpha = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}.  Thus,
d(p,r)=NL⋅[NDsinα](divND)=NL⋅[2–√⋅ND](divND)=NL⋅[2–√]n,d(p,r)=NL⋅[NDsin⁡α](divND)=NL⋅[2⋅ND](divND)=NL⋅[2]n,
\begin{align*}
d(p,r) &amp; = N_{L} \cdot \left[ \frac{N_{D}}{\sin \alpha}\right] (\mbox{div}\, N_{D})\\
       &amp; = N_{L}\cdot [\sqrt{2} \cdot N_{D}] (\mbox{div}\, N_{D})\\
       &amp; = N_{L}\cdot   [\sqrt{2}]_{n},
\end{align*}
  
where [r]n[r]n[r]_{n} means the number rrr up to nnn decimals. No
calculations are needed to show that (a close approximation of) the
Pythagorean theorem holds, i.e., d2(p,q)+d2(q,r)=d2(p,r)d2(p,q)+d2(q,r)=d2(p,r)d^{2}(p,q) + d^{2}(q,r) =
d^{2}(p,r). Finally, there is an easy explanation why the Weyl
problem occurs: it corresponds to the limiting case ND=1ND=1N_{D} =
1. When ND=1ND=1N_{D} = 1, then [2–√⋅ND]=[2–√]=1[2⋅ND]=[2]=1[\sqrt{2} \cdot N_{D}] = [\sqrt{2}] =
1, hence d(p,r)=NL⋅1=NLd(p,r)=NL⋅1=NLd(p,r) = N_{L} \cdot 1 = N_{L} and Pythagoras’
theorem fails.
Although the introduction of a width NDNDN_{D} apparently solves
the problem, it is equally clear what the drawbacks are. Without
classical Euclidean geometry in the background, there is really no way
to get the construction going. There is no definition of a line in
terms of the discrete geometry itself, and, above all, the projected
width on the xxx-axis of a line LLL is calculated according to a
Euclidean distance function that is not explicitly mentioned. In
short, there is a mixture of two distance functions.
Peter Forrest (1995) presents another solution. He starts by
introducing a family of discrete spaces En,mEn,mE_{n,m}, where nnn
corresponds to the “classical” dimension of space and
mmm is a scale factor, to be understood as follows: mmm is a
parameter to decide when two points are or are not adjacent, which is
the basic (and sole) concept of his geometry. Thus in the case n=2n=2n =
2, points are labeled by couples of integers (i,j)(i,j)(i,j) and two
points (i,j)(i,j)(i, j) and (i′,j′)(i′,j′)(i', j') are adjacent if they are distinct,
and (i−i′)2+(j−j′)2≤m2(i−i′)2+(j−j′)2≤m2(i-i')^{2} + (j-j') ^{2} \le m^{2}.
Once adjacency has been stipulated, a distance function can be
easily derived: the distance between ppp and qqq, d(p,q)d(p,q)d(p,q), is
the smallest number of “links” in a chain of points
connecting ppp and qqq such that each one is adjacent to the
previous one. Next there is no problem to show that a straight line
passing through two points is that chain of points that has the
shortest distance.
If the parameter mmm has a small value, then the resulting
distance function is not Euclidean. More specifically, if m=1m=1m = 1,
then we have, once again, the situation presented by Weyl. But if,
say, m=1030m=1030m = 10^{30} (the figure proposed by Forrest himself), then
the situation changes. Then it is possible to show that the distance
function on the discrete space will approximate the Euclidean distance
function as close as one wants. Without presenting all the details,
one can show that a Euclidean distance function dEdEd_{E} and the
discrete distance function ddd are related by a scale factor, i.e.,
dE(p,q)d(p,q)=constant(m)dE(p,q)d(p,q)=constant(m)d_{E} \frac{(p,q)}{d(p, q)} = \mbox{constant} (m), where the
constant is determined by the value of mmm. No calculations are
needed once again, to show that the original distance function ddd
satisfies the Pythagorean theorem.
If one is looking for a weak point in this approach, then
inevitably one must end up with the basic notion of adjacency. What is
the reason for defining adjacency in Euclidean terms? For, after all,
a condition such as (i−i′)2+(j−j′)2≤m2(i−i′)2+(j−j′)2≤m2(i-i')^{2} + (j-j')^{2} \le m^{2} looks as
Euclidean as can be. A possible way out is suggested in Van Bendegem
(1997). One of the
advantages of a discrete approach—and, as a matter of fact, this
seems to hold in general for strict finitist proposals—is that
definitions that are classically equivalent turn out to be distinct in
a strict finitist framework. Thus, more specifically, a circle can be
defined in (at least) two ways:

as the set of points ppp that have a fixed distance to a fixed
point,
as the set of points ppp such that, given a fixed line segment
ababab, the angle formed by apbapbapb is a right angle.

Classically speaking, these two definitions are
equivalent. However, they are not in a discrete geometry. If, e.g.,
the distance function is defined as the lowest number of hodons that
connect two given points, then the two definitions are not
equivalent. Using definition (a), the circle will have the shape of a
square (a well-known fact in so-called taxicab geometry) and thus
useless to define adjacency as done above.  Definition (b) on the
other hand produces a figure that can approximate a Euclidean circle
as close as one likes. In that way Forrest’s definition for
adjacency is acceptable within a discrete framework, as no reference
is made to a Euclidean distance function.
The third solution is to be found in Crouse and Skufca (2019),
which presents an interesting synthesis of the two previous proposals
to solve the distance function problem. What they suggest is a kind of
physical interpretation that makes three things possible. Firstly, it
allows to determine the lowest sizes for hodons and chronons in terms
of Planck length and time. Secondly, it suggests a definition of the
distance from A to B in terms of the distance travelled by a
“test” hodon (in discrete minimal steps, of course). This
solves immediately the anisotropy problem as no directions are
privileged. Thirdly, it does not suppose the a priori existence
of a grid (or a similar structure) as an absolute frame of
reference. This opens up the possibility to reformulate special
relativity theory, which they do. Although Silberstein’s approach
(see section 2.4 above) is not mentioned, it
is clearly related and can be considered to be an improvement, as the
physical basis is philosophically better motivated.
If these proposals and suggestions can be considered to be adequate
responses to Weyl’s tile problem, recently another fine example
of a no-go approach (and accompanying theorem) is to be found in Fritz
(2013). Start out with an abstract formulation of a periodic graph,
i.e., a set of vertices and a set of edges. For practical purposes,
the periodicity can be thought of as a crystalline structure. This
means that we have a basic finite unit that can cover the whole of the
graph through iterated copies of that basic unit. Take as an example a
two-dimensional structure. The vertices can be labeled or
“weighted” by two numbers (i,j)(i,j)(i, j). A trajectory
(fn)n∈N(fn)n∈N(f_{n})_{n\in N} is a sequence of weights of vertices, such that
the vertices carrying fnfnf_{n} and fn+1fn+1f_{n+1} are connected by an
edge. Next we define the (macroscopic) velocity of such a trajectory
as
u=limn→∞(fn−f0)n,u=limn→∞(fn−f0)n,
u= \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\frac{(f_n - f_0)}{n},

which sounds perfectly acceptable. Example: the trajectory such
that fn=(n,0)fn=(n,0)f_{n} = (n, 0), starting from f0=(0,0)f0=(0,0)f_{0} = (0, 0) will have
macroscopic velocity 1, as fn−f0=(n,0)fn−f0=(n,0)f_{n} - f_{0} = (n, 0) and, divided by
nnn, this leaves (1, 0). Without going into the details, he then
shows that the geometrical structure of all (macroscopic) velocities
in such a graph cannot correspond to that of Euclidean space. The
reason is quite simple (though the proofs are not): in the graph there
will always be singled-out, “special” directions and
anisotropy will remain detectable even at the macroscopic
level. Therefore a transition from the discrete level to the
macroscopic, continuous, Euclidean and isotropic level is
excluded. This is a truly interesting result as it casts a shadow on
all attempts to use a direct, often rather naive transition from the
discrete to the continuous level. At the same time, it pleads in favor
of more complex transitions from the microscopic to the macroscopic
level, e.g., by taking into account the width of a line.
The dimension problem. Not much attention has been paid to
this problem although it is fundamental. If the plane consists of a
discrete set of elements, hodons or atoms, then this set must have
dimension zero. For, in order to determine the dimension, this set
must be equipped with a topology and the only possible candidate is
the discrete topology. This entails that the dimension is zero. Either
one takes the option to simply drop the notion of dimension on the
basis of the argument that the concept of dimension presupposes a
concept of continuity and topology and hence has no finitist
meaning. Or one searches for an analog, but it is not clear at all
what that could be.  Something one should not try to do is to derive a
notion of dimension from an ordering relation. Suppose that the hodons
are labeled by integers (i,j)(i,j)(i, j) in some appropriate coordinate
system, such that −L≤i−L≤i-L\le i, j≤Lj≤Lj\le L, where LLL is some upper
bound. Then quite different ordering relations are possible. One
possibility is to define (i,j)<(k,l)(i,j)<(k,l)(i, j) \lt(k, l) if and only if i+j<k+li+j<k+li + j
\lt k + l. But another possibility is to define (i,j)<(k,l)(i,j)<(k,l)(i, j) \lt(k, l)
if and only if either i<ki<ki \lt k or, if i=ki=ki = k, then j<lj<lj \lt
l. It therefore requires additional arguments to claim that among
all possible order relations on a given set, one and only one has a
special status. However in section 3 we
will see that, using the tools of graph theory, a definition of
dimension can indeed be given.
The isotropy problem. If the plane is built up from square
hodons, as in the paragraph above, then the hodons are arranged in
such a way that every hodon touches four other hodons, i.e., the plane
can be modeled as a square grid, then it is obvious that there are
preferred directions, in this case, there will be two preferred
directions. However if instead of squares, hexagons are taken as
hodons, then there are three preferred directions. Thus no matter what
the shape is of the hodon, there will be preferred directions and this
implies that the space is anisotropic. Note that these cases are
nothing but special instances of the general approach of Tobias Fritz,
discussed above. However, for physical applications one would like to
have isotropy (or at least as close as possible).
Two approaches are possible, that do not fall under the Fritz no-go
theorem. Either the hodons have a definite shape or they do not. In
the first case it has been suggested that instead of a regular
periodic tiling of the plane, one should look for an irregular
aperiodic tiling, such as the Penrose tiling.


Figure 4

Although no worked-out examples are available, it seems a promising
line of attack. In the case of the Penrose tiling it is interesting to
see that there are no classically straight lines anymore, precisely
because of the aperiodicity. In the second case vagueness is a
possible way out. As Peter Forrest in his (1995), and Crouse and Skufca in their (2019) defend, the whole
idea of a specific representation of a discrete space, e.g., as built
up from tiny squares is fundamentally mistaken. If a hodon has a
specific form, then one cannot avoid asking questions about parts of a
hodon, such as its border, but that does not make sense if hodons are
the smallest spatial entities possible. An intermediate position
defended in Van Bendegem (1997) is to consider a series of discrete
geometries GiGiG_{i}, each with a hodon of a particular size,
hihih_{i}, such that hi≠hjhi≠hjh_{i}\ne h_{j}, for i≠ji≠ji\ne j and, in
addition, there are MMM and NNN such that M<hi<NM<hi<NM \lt h_{i} \lt N,
for all iii. One can then apply a supervaluation technique to the
series. This means that a statement will be True (False) if it is true
(false) in every geometry GiGiG_{i}.  In all other cases it is
Undecided, i.e., true in some and false in some others. Now if AAA
is the statement “hodons have size αα\alpha” (where
αα\alpha is a specific number), this will be Undecided, if a
corresponds to at least one of the hihih_{i}. Such an approach however
introduces all problems connected with vagueness into the discussion,
which is not necessarily an encouraging situation. For this problem
too, an original answer can be given from within the framework of
graph theory.
The identification problem. Suppose that we do have a
full-fledged discrete geometry and suppose that we replace the
classical geometry of a physical theory with the discrete version. We
will now be talking about hodons and chronons. The
“natural” question that arises is what is to be identified
with what? Imagine that, in line with Silberstein, we are a bit
naïve and would be tempted to identify the hodon with the Planck
length, lp=10−35mlp=10−35ml_{p} = 10^{-35}\text{m} and the chronon with Planck time,
tp=10−43stp=10−43st_{p} = 10^{-43}\text{s}. If one now accepts that the maximum
speed is one hodon per chronon, then what comes out of this
identification is that the maximum speed is indeed c=3.108m/sc=3.108m/sc =
3.10^{8}\text{m/s}. (Note: nothing amazing is happening here, since
in classical physics, lplpl_{p} is defined as ℏG/c3−−−−−√,ℏG/c3,\sqrt{\hbar G/c^3},
and tptpt_{p} as ℏG/c5−−−−−√,ℏG/c5,\sqrt{\hbar G/c^5}, so that it is immediately
obvious that lp/tp=clp/tp=cl_{p}/t_{p} = c. Now ask the simple question what
the next speed will be, just below ccc? The answer must be: one
hodon per two chronons, but that means a velocity of c/2c/2c/2. We seem
to have missed out the whole range between c/2c/2c/2 and ccc. There is
a way out, but it supposes that “jerky” motion is
considered possible, an aesthetically quite ugly idea. An object moves
two hodons in two chronons and then waits for one chronon and then
repeats the same motion. The average velocity is then 2c/32c/32c/3. One
possible way out, that will be briefly mentioned
in section 3.2, is to introduce an element
of randomness into the structure. For an appreciation of the full complexity of this topic, going beyond merely numerical relationships, see the excellent overview and discussion of Hagar (2014).
3. Discrete geometries as generators of classical geometry
3.1 The general framework
As stated in section 1, here we will
discuss proposals that search for a theory or model, underlying a
geometrical theory, such that therefrom the classical geometrical
concepts can be derived. Obviously one needs to be extremely careful
as the “danger” is constantly present that infinities
enter into the picture somewhere unseen or unnoticed. Suppose, to give
a simple example, that only a set of finite points is allowed for, but
also an operation that generates between any pair of points a third
point different from all points present and there are no restrictions
on the number of times the operation can be applied, then clearly we
have here an in infinite number of points “in
disguise”. To call such a model a discrete geometrical model
seems quite inappropriate.
One also needs to be very careful about, e.g., claims that quantum
mechanics deals with discrete values, usually in relation to
Heisenberg uncertainty principles, hence physics at the basic level is
a discrete theory. That, however, is extremely misleading. It is
sufficient to consult any handbook on quantum mechanics to observe
that the mathematics used requires the full use of infinities. No
matter whether one uses Heisenberg’s matrix approach,
Hilbert’s operator formalism, Schrödinger’s wave
equation or some other formalism, the mathematics involves integrals,
derivatives, infinite (convergent) sums, spaces with infinite
dimension, and so on (see the entry on  
quantum mechanics). 
Not much discreteness to be found here.  This implies
that for quantum mechanics as well it is a genuine problem to find a
discrete counterpart. That is clearly demonstrated by the attempts of
Gerard ’t Hooft to reformulate quantum mechanics in a truly
discrete fashion, see ’t Hooft (2014). Interesting to note is
that it affects issues such as determinism versus indeterminism.
From the historical point of view, no doubt the work of Tullio
Regge can be seen as a first attempt to develop a model out of which
geometrical concepts could be developed. The original paper dates from
1961, see Regge (1961). More specifically, we are concerned here with
general relativity theory (GRT). Although the original intention of
Regge was to construct techniques for solving the equations of GRT in
the “difficult” cases, i.e., where there is no symmetry
present and perturbation theory is not applicable. Rather than
transcribing the differential equations of GRT into difference
equations, Regge looked for a technique that leads to different
equations altogether. Without presenting the full details, the core
concept of his approach is the “deficit angle”. In GRT we
are dealing with curved spaces. Take a two-dimensional curved surface.
If it is flat, then it can be covered with triangles. If it is curved,
it can be approximated with triangles, but with an important
difference. Suppose that triangles meet at vertices, then we can look
at one particular point and all the triangles that meet in that point.
If that part of the surface is flattened out, there will be a gap
somewhere. To this gap corresponds an angle and that is precisely the
deficit angle. The larger the curvature, the larger the deficit angle.
The same technique works for the four-dimensional case, where instead
of triangles, simplexes are used. The beauty of this approach is that
the equations of GRT can be rewritten in terms of deficit angles and
lengths of the edges of the simplexes and solved in terms of these
concepts. Misner et al. (1973) contains a chapter (42: “The
Regge Calculus”) that explains Regge’s approach in a
compact and perfectly accessible way.
Today there is a rather impressive amount of attempts being made.
Most of them are to be considered as highly speculative as they truly
reflect the present state of affairs in full development. However
there is a remaining set of approaches that slowly start to emerge and
that seems to be viable candidates and of interest for a finitist view
of geometry (in terms of spacetime). It should be noted that for the
authors concerned their principal aim is not so much to formulate a
discrete form of geometry but rather to establish whether this or that
model will serve as a common foundation to quantum (field) theory and
GRT, hence to the whole of physics, so to speak or, if one likes, the
“Theory of Everything”. Our concern here is actually more
modest: do these models tell us anything about how discrete geometries
can be formulated such that they generate classical geometry? So, even
if the physicists were to reject such a model on the basis of good
solid physical reasons, it might still be of interest to the question
of the possibility of discrete geometry.
Huggett & Wuthrich (2013a) presents a nice overview of the
present-day situation as far as the remaining set is concerned. It is
worth mentioning that this paper is part of a special issue, Huggett
& Wuthrich (2013b), on the emergence of spacetime in quantum
theories of gravity. Altogether they discuss and evaluate six types of
proposals but we will consider here only three. The remaining three
are either too speculative at the present moment or do not involve
discrete spacetimes (such as string theory and non-commutative
geometry). The three approaches relevant for our topic are:

Lattice spacetime: this is close to Regge’s approach in the
sense that continuous space (and time) are replaced by a discrete
structure, in this case a lattice. If these lattices are equipped with
some form of—obviously discrete—metric, the connections
between continuous and discrete space (and time) become very
close. The next section presents such a proposal (leaving out the
physics),
Non-metrical lattices: the best known example under this heading
are causal lattices. The connections between the “points”
in the lattice are causal relations and this requires a lot more work
to derive a space-time structure from it. In fact, in many cases we
have no-go theorems in the sense that the discrete lattices
“fail to have well-behaved continuum limits resembling
relativistic spacetimes” (p. 278), thus “echoing”
the already mentioned negative result of Fritz (2013),
Loop quantum gravity: this theory is one of the attempts, taken
seriously, to unify quantum (field) theory and general relativity. The
basic structures are so-called three-dimensional spin networks. If
these networks are allowed to evolve over time, then a
four-dimensional structure emerges, so-called spin foam, that in the
limit should generate the relativistic space-time
structure. A caveat should be inserted here: although the
structure of a spin network is that of a graph with a set of nodes and
a set of edges, nevertheless these nodes and edges are labeled by
physically meaningful quantities that involve continuous structures
such as Lie groups.  Without going into details this short extract of
Reisenberger (1999) is highly illustrative:
 
  
In general the edges of a spin network carry non-trivial irreducible
representations (irreps) of the gauge group, and the vertices carry
intertwiners. The intertwiner for a vertex can be any invariant tensor
of the product representation RRR formed by the product of the
irreps carried by the incoming edges and the duals of the irreps on
the outgoing edges. (p.  2047)
  

In order to appreciate how quickly things are evolving in this
research area, one should make a comparison between Huggett &
Wüthrich (2013a) and Meschini et al. (2005), also meant to be a
survey paper. Interestingly enough, Huggett and Wüthrich describe
their survey as complementary to the other one. In the latter paper
the work of Manfred Requardt is briefly presented and this will serve
as a prototypical example because it does not introduce the physical
side of things right from the start. To have a taste of more
sophisticated approaches that do involve physics right from the start,
see Smolin (2018), where also quantum loop gravity, mentioned directly
above, is discussed. Although such approaches, both the basic and the
sophisticated cases, are not mentioned in the literature on spatial
logics, nevertheless the connections between the two are very deep and
close and definitely need to be explored further.
3.2 A prototypical example, using graphs
The starting point is a discrete graph G=⟨N,C⟩G=⟨N,C⟩G = \langle N, C\rangle
consisting of a set NNN of nodes, ninin_{i}, and a set CCC of
connections, cijcijc_{ij}, such that no node is connected to itself and
nodes ninin_{i} and njnjn_{j} have one connection at most. What seems
most obvious is how to define a distance function and in nearly all
proposals, this is indeed the strategy followed (similar to the
definitions proposed in section
2.5):

D(ni,njD(ni,njD(n_{i}, n_{j}) = the smallest number of connections
that lead from ninin_{i} to njnjn_{j}.

It is easy to see that the classical properties of a distance
function are satisfied:

D(ni,ni)=0,D(ni,ni)=0,D(n_i, n_i) = 0,
D(ni,nj)=D(nj,ni),D(ni,nj)=D(nj,ni),D(n_i, n_j) = D(n_j, n_i),
D(ni,nj)+D(nj,nk)≥D(ni,nk).D(ni,nj)+D(nj,nk)≥D(ni,nk).D(n_i, n_j) + D(n_j, n_k) \ge D(n_i, n_k).

At first sight it is not obvious at all how one should proceed
further, but, if one reads the ninin_{i} and the cijcijc_{ij} as a kind
of vector, then linear combinations can be formed, where fifif_{i} and
gijgijg_{ij} are, e.g., natural or rational numbers:
f=∑ifini and g=∑ikgikcik.f=∑ifini and g=∑ikgikcik.
f=\sum_i f_i n_i \quad\mbox{ and }\quad g=\sum_{ik} g_{ik}c_{ik}.

These two expressions can be read as functions over ninin_{i} and
cijcijc_{ij}. What one needs now is a relation between nodes and
connections, so introduce a special function ddd:
d:ni→∑kcik.d:ni→∑kcik.
d: n_i \rightarrow \sum_k c_{ik}.

It is quite interesting to see what happens if we extend the
function ddd in a linear way so that it can be applied to arbitrary
functions fff:
df=∑ifi∑kcik.df=∑ifi∑kcik.
df = \sum_i f_i \sum_k c_{ik}.

If we now stipulate that cik=−ckicik=−ckic_{ik} = -c_{ki} (as a kind of vector
equation, stating that the connections have a direction) then the
above expression can be rewritten as follows (take into account that,
since no loops are allowed, cii=0)cii=0)c_{ii} = 0):
df=12∑ik(fk−fi)cikdf=12∑ik(fk−fi)cik
df = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{ik} (f_k-f_i)c_{ik}

Although it is still a long way off, this expression dfdfdf already
has some nice properties that reminds one of a derivative of a
function fff:

It is linear: d(f+g)=df+dgd(f+g)=df+dgd(f + g) = df + dg,
If fff is a constant function in the sense that at every node
fifif_{i} has the same value, then it is immediate that dfdfdf, for
fff constant, is 0,
If fff is such that at two directly related nodes ninin_{i} and
ni+1ni+1n_{i+1}, fi+1fi+1f_{i+1} = fi+1fi+1f_{i} + 1, in other words, this
expresses that f(i)=if(i)=if(i) = i, then dfdfdf is 1, where 1 is the function
represented by ∑ini∑ini\sum_i n_i.  So the derivative of the identity
function is the constant function 1.

However, as is easy to check with the above definitions, the
product rule fails, i.e., d(f⋅g)d(f⋅g)d(f\cdot g) is not equal to df⋅g+f⋅dgdf⋅g+f⋅dgdf\cdot g
+ f\cdot dg.
So, to a certain extent, it is possible to construct a basic form
of calculus on discrete graphs. It does require some ingenuity and
creative thought to find the “right” counterparts, but
this simple example shows that quite a lot of structure can be derived
from a discrete graph. There is actually more. Discrete graphs allow
for a nice solution to the dimension problem, that was mentioned
in section 2.5. This is the rough
outline of the idea:
Consider a node ninin_{i}, then U1U1U_{1} is the set of nodes
njnjn_{j} such that D(ni,nj)=1D(ni,nj)=1D(n_{i}, n_{j}) = 1, i.e.,
U1U1U_{1} brings together the closest neighbours of
ninin_{i}. Likewise, we can define U2U2U_{2} as the set of nodes
nknkn_{k} such that D(ni,nk)D(ni,nk)D(n_{i}, n_{k}) is at most 2. It
follows that Un⊆Un+1Un⊆Un+1U_{n} \subseteq U_{n+1} and so we obtain a nested
series of neighbourhoods of ninin_{i}. If one understands dimension as
a measure of the “growth” of the neighbourhoods, then
dimension can be defined as:
Dim=limm→∞ln|Um|lnmDim=limm→∞ln⁡|Um|ln⁡m
\mbox{Dim} = \lim_{m\rightarrow \infty} \frac{\ln \lvert U_m \rvert}{\ln m}

One of the interesting features of this definition is that it need
not be uniform over the whole graph, for all depends on the choice of
the initial node ninin_{i}. But in the case where the graph is
sufficiently uniform, the dimension will be a constant.  Furthermore
if we take a classical case, such as 3-dimensional Euclidean space,
then the dimensions match. Suppose we have a regular lattice as the
underlying graph, then a particular node has a cube as the set of
nearest neighbours U1U1U_{1} consisting of 33=2733=273^{3} = 27 points, and
a neighbourhood UmUmU_{m} will count (m+2)3(m+2)3(m+2)^{3}
nodes. Therefore
Dim=limm→∞ln(m+2)3lnm or Dim=limm→∞3⋅ln(m+2)lnmDim=limm→∞ln⁡(m+2)3ln⁡m or Dim=limm→∞3⋅ln⁡(m+2)ln⁡m
\mbox{Dim} = \lim_{m\rightarrow \infty} \frac{\ln (m+2)^3}{\ln m} \quad\mbox{ or }\quad
\mbox{Dim} = \lim_{m\rightarrow \infty}  3\cdot\frac{\ln (m+2)}{\ln m}

Since for mmm sufficiently large, ln(m+2)lnmln⁡(m+2)ln⁡m\frac{\ln (m+2)}{\ln m}
approximates 1, it follows that Dim=3Dim=3\mbox{Dim} = 3. What this shows is
that, starting from discrete graphs, we have obtained an extension of
the concept of dimension. One may have noticed that this type of
definition is quite similar to some of the definitions used to define
the dimension of fractal images.
In addition, discrete graphs make it possible to handle the
anisotropy problem as well. It is sufficient to introduce an element
of randomness in the network by, e.g., taking averages over a
connected set of nodes, to avoid any privileged directions. There are
clearly similarities here with the irregular tiling scheme or the
introduction of vagueness, but the important distinction is that
statistical and probabilistic concepts are (fairly) well understood,
whereas the tiling problem is, as mentioned, an open problem, and
vagueness remains a notoriously difficult concept to grasp (see
the entry on vagueness in this encyclopedia).
3.3 A special case: the combinatorial hierarchy
It would be a mistake to believe that the different attempts listed
above, somehow form a complete catalogue that allows to classify all
possible approaches. In this paragraph such an exotic example,
viz. the combinatorial hierarchy, is briefly presented. In this
approach the focus is not on the equations of physics themselves, but
on the physical constants occurring in them, such as the velocity of
light ccc, the Planck constant hhh, the mass of the electron
memem_{e}, and so on. As these values are necessarily finite, it seems
worthwhile to investigate whether a finitist approach can explain why
these constants have the values they happen to have.  Such approaches
are sometimes referred to as “number games”.
Let me give one very simple example. Starting from a universe
consisting of a finite number of bits, i.e., either 0 or 1, a basic
operation is introduced, viz., to make a “discrimination”.
To express this operation, another operation is needed: addition
modulo 2: 0+0=1+1=00+0=1+1=00 + 0 = 1 + 1 = 0 and 0+1=1+0=10+1=1+0=10 + 1 = 1 + 0 = 1. If the
outcome is 0, then the elements of the sum are not distinguished, else
they are. Look now at sets that contain 0 and/or 1, and such that, if
two elements are distinguishable, that element belongs to the set as
well. There are exactly 3 (=22−1)(=22−1)(= 2^{2}-1) such sets: {0},{1}{0},{1}\{0\}, \{1\}
and {0,1}{0,1}\{0,1\}. If these 3 elements are now taken as a new basis
instead of 0 and 1, a clever construction shows that 7 (=23−1)(=23−1)(= 2^{3}-1)
such sets exists and, in a next step, 127 (=27−1)(=27−1)(= 2^{7}-1) pops up.
Now 3+7+127=1373+7+127=1373 + 7 + 127 = 137 and that number is close to the
electromagnetic coupling constant.
The success of this program has been rather modest as these models
do not connect easily to existing physical theories. A self-contained
presentation of this program is to be found in Bastin & Kilmister
(1995). There is a very strong similarity with the work of A.S.
Eddington. Not very surprisingly, a presentation of the work of
Eddington on his fundamental theory has been written by Kilmister
(1994).
3.4 Can it be an empirical problem?
So far we have explored several theoretical possibilities of a
discrete geometry as a counterpart of classical geometry. Given the
examples we discussed in the preceding sections, the relevance for
physics seems obvious. Although one might be tempted to believe that
the discreteness of space and/or time is a purely theoretical matter,
nevertheless it is an intriguing question whether the matter could
also be of an empirical nature. More concretely, is it imaginable that
somehow we could design an experiment such that the outcome is either
that space is discrete or that space is continuous? This might sound
really far-fetched, but nevertheless the matter has drawn the
attention of philosophers and a specific experiment has indeed been
proposed, though at present the circumstances to execute the
experiment are unfortunately not feasible.
It is quite interesting to see that already in 1961 Paul Feyerabend
suggested such a possibility. However not much more is said, as
the difficulty of the present situation seems to
lie in the fact that discrete alternatives for the mathematics, which
at the present moment is being used in physics, are missing. (1961:
160)
Equally interesting is the fact that Feyerabend too mentions the
standard argument that the lack of a Pythagorean theorem is a genuine
problem.  His proposal is that
we need only assume that measurements in different
directions do not commute; and then perhaps we can retain the theorem
as an operator equation. (1961: 161)
Here too, unfortunately, nothing more is said. Peter Forrest (1995)
maintains that such an experiment is possible. The fundamental reason
is that classical mathematics uses continuous variables whereas strict
finitist mathematics uses discrete variables. Thus for differentation
and integration finite analogs must be found and they will approximate
the classical case, but never coincide with it. Hence, there will
always be small differences and it cannot be excluded that these could
be detectable.
One such possibility for detection concerns the following curious
phenomenon. Take the differential equation, df/dx=ax(1−x)df/dx=ax(1−x)df/dx = ax(1 - x). It
is a straightforward exercise to solve it and one will find a very
neat continuous solution, whereas if one takes for the discrete case
the corresponding difference equation, Δf/Δx=ax(1−x)Δf/Δx=ax(1−x)\Delta f/\Delta x = ax(1 -
x), depending on the value of the parameter aaa, the behaviour of
the function fff produces chaotic effects, which are absent in the
continuous case. See Van Bendegem (2000) and Welti (1987:
516–518). The outcome of such an experiment would not be as
clear-cut as wished for, but to observe chaotic effects means that
space is discrete, whereas to observe no chaotic effects means that
either space is continuous or the hodons are far smaller than we
imagined. No further progress is to be reported at the present
moment.
It has been indicated several times in this lemma that different
scientists with different intentions and aims and with different
backgrounds have proposed or propose equally different ideas about
discrete geometry as an alternative for classical geometry. Many
authors do not necessarily present more or less complete theories, but
rather limit themselves to making suggestions and exploring some
particular idea. These papers are to be seen as sources of inspiration
in the search for a full-fledged theory. A few examples are: Hahn
(1934), Biser (1941), Coish (1959), Ahmavaara (1965a,b), Finkelstein
(1969) (this is the first of a five paper series with the same title
in the same journal), Dadić & Pisk (1979), Finkelstein &
Rodriguez (1986), Meessen (1989), Buot (1989), to name but a very
few. For the period 1925–1936, Kragh and Carazza (1994) is an
excellent overview showing that many physicists were playing around
with finitist ideas.
4. What needs to be done next?
The first task to do seems rather straightforward: take any of the
proposals presented here and elaborate them into a full-fledged
geometry. Then it will be possible to make a comparison with, e.g.,
Hilbert’s axiomatisation that was mentioned. The second task
seems rather forbidding: using this discrete geometry, show how to do
physics. In general terms, this is indeed a huge undertaking, but
there are two possible routes to follow. The first route is to show
that this approach works, say, for classical mechanics. If successful,
this would surely count as a major argument in favor of discrete
proposals. As it happens, some very important work has already been
done, for what we will need, is a fully formalized version of
classical mechanics, not the textbook versions that leave many things
unmentioned, but that might prove to be crucial for the underlying
geometry. Such versions exist at the present moment, see, e.g., Ax
(1978), Andréka et al. (2008), Benda (2008), for just a few
examples. As it happens, one of the earliest versions involves Patrick
Suppes, see McKinsey, Sugar & Suppes (1953). Thus the enterprise
seems to be a genuine possibility. The second route is to explore the
fundamental research going on in the search for a unification of QFT
and GRT. Up to some years ago this was all highly speculative, today a
few serious contestants are emerging and worth following up. That
being said, both on the mathematical as on the physical level an
enormous amount of work remains to be done. Probably the best way to
characterize the present-day situation is that some
“famous” objections to a discrete or finitist approach in
geometry have been (partially) answered and that a host of
mathematical, physical and philosophical suggestions and ideas have
been presented, and partial models have been developed or are being
elaborated. In other words, the conditions are satisfied that make it
interesting to continue this research program.
