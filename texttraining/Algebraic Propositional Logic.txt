George Boole was the first to present logic as a mathematical theory
in algebraic style. In his work, and in that of the other algebraists
of the algebraic tradition of logic of the nineteenth century, the
distinction between a formal language and a mathematically rigorous
semantics for it was still not drawn. What the algebraists in this
tradition did was to build algebraic theories (of Boolean algebras,
and relation algebras) with among other interpretations a logical one.


The works of Frege and Russell introduced a different perspective on
the way to approach logic. In those works, a logic system was given by
a formal language and a deductive calculus, namely a set of axioms and
a set of inference rules. Let us (for this entry) call such a pair a
logical deduction system, and the formulas derivable in the
calculus its theorems (nowadays it is common practice in
algebraic logic to refer to this kind of calculi as Hilbert-style and
in proof complexity theory as Frege systems). In Frege and
Russell’s approach, a formal (mathematical) semantics of
whatever kind (algebraic, model-theoretic, etc.) for the formal
languages they used was lacking. The only semantics present was of an
intuitive, informal kind. 

The systems introduced by Frege and Russell were systems of classical
logic, but soon after systems of non-classical logics were considered
by other logicians. The first influential attempts to introduce logics
different from classical logic remained within the Frege-Russell
tradition of presenting a logical deduction system without any formal
semantics. These attempts lead to the first modal systems of C.I.
Lewis (1918, 1932) and to the
axiomatization of intuitionistic logic by Heyting (1930).

The idea underlying the design of Frege and Russell’s logical
deduction systems is that the theorems should be the formulas that
correspond (intuitively) to the logical truths or logical validities.
The concept of logical consequence was not central to the development,
and this was also the case in the many systems of non-classical logics
that were to be designed following in the footsteps of the first modal
systems of C.I. Lewis. This situation influenced the way in which the
research on some non-classical logics has usually been presented and
sometimes also its real evolution. However, the concept of logical
consequence has been the one that logic has traditionally dealt with.
Tarski put it once again into the center of modern logic, both
semantically and syntactically. Nowadays, a general theory of the
algebraization of logics around the concept of logical consequence has
grown from the different algebraic treatments of the different logics
obtained during the last century. 

The concept of logical consequence has proved much more fruitful than
those of theorem and of logical validity for the development of such a
general theory. The first attempts in the process of building the
general theory of the algebraization of logics can be found in the
study of the class of implicative logics by Rasiowa (1974) and in the
systematic presentation by Wójcicki (1988) of the
investigations of a general nature on propositional logics as
consequence operations carried out mainly by Polish logicians,
following the studies of Tarski, Lindenbaum, Łukasiewicz and
others in the first part of the twentieth century. 

It was only in the 1920s that algebras and logical matrices (an
algebra together with a set of designated elements) started to be
taken as models of logical deduction systems, that is, as providing a
formal semantics for formal languages of logic. Moreover, they were
also used to define sets of formulas with similar properties to the
ones the sets of theorems of the known logical deduction systems have,
in particular the property of being closed under substitution
instances; more recently logical matrices have also been used to
define logics as consequence relations. 

Algebraic logic can be described in very general terms as the
discipline that studies logics by associating with them classes of
algebras, classes of logical matrices and other algebra related
mathematical structures and that relates the properties that the
logics may have with properties of the associated algebras (or algebra
related structures) with the purpose that the understanding of these
algebras can be used to better understand the logic at hand. 

From the algebraic study of particular logics a general theory of the
algebraization of logics slowly emerged during the last century with
the aim, more or less explicitly stated during the process, of
obtaining general and informative results relating the properties a
logic may have with the algebraic properties the class of algebras (or
algebra related structures) associated with it might enjoy. Those
algebraic studies assumed somehow an implicit conception of what is
the process by which to associate with any given logic a class of
algebras as its natural algebraic counterpart. The development of the
general theory speeded up and consolidated at the beginning of the
1980s with the introduction of the notion of algebraizable logic, and
at that time the assumptions about the class of algebras that deserve
to be taken as the natural to associate with a given logic started to
be made more and more explicit. 

In this entry we concentrate on the general theory of the
algebraization of propositional logics taken as consequence relations.
This theory has evolved into the field known as Abstract Algebraic
Logic (AAL). The entry can be taken as a mild introduction to this
field. 
 
1. Abstract consequence relations

Tarski’s work (1930a, 1930b, 1935, 1936) on the methodology of
the deductive sciences of the 1920s and 1930s studies the axiomatic
method abstractly and introduces for the first time the abstract
concept of consequence operation. Tarski had in mind mainly the
different mathematical axiomatic theories. On these theories, the
sentences that are proved from the axioms are consequences of them but
(of course) almost all of them are not logical truths; under a
suitable formalization of these theories, a logical calculus like
Frege’s or Russell’s can be used to derive the
consequences of the axioms. Tarski set the framework to study the most
general properties of the operation that assigns to a set of axioms
its consequences.

Given a logical deduction system HH and an arbitrary set of
formulas XX, a formula aa is deducible in HH from
XX if there is a finite sequence of formulas any one of which
belongs to XX or is an axiom of HH or is obtained from previous
formulas in the sequence by one of the inference rules of HH. Such
a sequence is a deduction (or proof) in HH of aa with premises
or hypotheses in XX. Let Cn(X)Cn(X) be the set of formulas deducible
in HH from the formulas in XX taken as premises or hypothesis.
This set is called the set of consequences of XX (relative to the
logical deduction system HH). CnCn is then an operation that is
applied to sets of formulas to obtain new sets of formulas. It has the
following properties: For every set of formulas XX

X⊆Cn(X)X \subseteq Cn(X)
Cn(Cn(X))=Cn(X)Cn(Cn(X)) = Cn(X)
Cn(X)=⋃{Cn(Y):Y⊆X,Y finite}Cn(X) = \bigcup\{Cn(Y): Y \subseteq X, Y \textrm{
finite}\}


Clause 3 stipulates that Cn(X)Cn(X) is equal to the union of the set of
formulas derivable from finite subsets of XX. Tarski took these
properties to define the notion of consequence operation
axiomatically. In fact he added that there is a formula xx such
that Cn({x})Cn(\{x\}) is the set AA of all the formulas and that this
set must be finite or of the cardinality of the natural numbers.
Condition (3) implies the weaker, and important, condition of
monotonicity

if X⊆Y⊆AX \subseteq Y \subseteq A, then Cn(X)⊆Cn(Y)Cn(X)
\subseteq Cn(Y).


To encompass the whole class of logic systems one finds in the
literature, a slightly more general definition than Tarski’s is
required. We will say that an abstract consequence operation
CC on an arbitrary set AA is an operation that applied to
subsets of AA gives subsets of AA and for all X,Y⊆AX, Y \subseteq
A satisfies conditions (1), (2) and (4) above. If in addition CC
satisfies (3) we say that it is a finitary consequence
operation. 

Consequence operations are present not only in logic but in many areas
of mathematics. Abstract consequence operations are known as closure
operators in universal algebra and lattice theory, for instance. In
topology the operation that sends a subset of a topological space to
its topological closure is a closure operator. In fact the topologies
on a set AA can be identified with the closure operators on AA
that satisfy the additional conditions that C(∅)=∅C(\varnothing) =
\varnothing and C(X∪Y)=C(X)∪C(Y)C(X \cup Y) = C(X) \cup C(Y) for all X,Y⊆AX, Y
\subseteq A. 

Given a consequence operation CC on a set AA, a subset XX of
AA is said to be CC-closed, or a closed set of
CC, if C(X)=XC(X) = X. 

A different, but mathematically equivalent, (formal) approach is to
consider consequence relations on a set of formulas instead of
consequence operations. A(n) (abstract) consequence relation
on the set of formulas of a formal language is a relation ⊢\vdash
between sets of formulas and formulas that satisfies the following
conditions:

if a∈Xa \in X, then X⊢aX \vdash a
if X⊢aX \vdash a and X⊆YX \subseteq Y, then Y⊢aY \vdash a
if X⊢aX \vdash a and for every b∈X,Y⊢bb \in X, Y \vdash b, then Y⊢aY
\vdash a.


It is finitary if in addition it satisfies

if X⊢aX \vdash a, then there is a finite set Y⊆XY \subseteq X
such that Y⊢aY \vdash a.


Given a logical deduction system HH, the relation ⊢\vdash
defined by X⊢aX \vdash a if aa is deducible from XX in HH is
a finitary consequence relation. Nonetheless, we are used not only to
syntactic definitions of consequence relations but also to semantic
definitions. For example, we define classical propositional
consequence using truth valuations, first-order consequence relation
using structures, intuitionistic consequence relation using Kripke
models, etc. Sometimes these model-theoretic definitions of
consequence relations define non-finitary consequence relations, for
example, the consequence relations for infinitary formal languages and
the consequence relation of second-order logic with the so-called
standard semantics. 

In general, an abstract consequence relation on a set AA
(not necessarily the set of formulas of some formal language) is a
relation ⊢\vdash between subsets of AA and elements of AA
that satisfies conditions (1)–(3) above. If it also satisfies
(4) it is said to be finitary. If ⊢\vdash is an abstract
consequence relation and X⊢aX \vdash a we can say that XX is a set
of premises or hypothesis with conclusion aa according to
⊢\vdash and that aa follows from XX, or is entailed by XX
(according to ⊢)\vdash). These relations correspond to
Koslow’s implication structures; see Koslow 1992 for the closely
related but different approach to logics (in a broad sense) as
consequence relations introduced by this author. 

Consequence operations on a set AA are in one-to-one correspondence
with abstract consequence relations on AA. The move from a
consequence operation CC to a consequence relation ⊢C\vdash_C
and, conversely, from a consequence relation ⊢\vdash to a
consequence operation C⊢C_{\vdash} is easy and given by the
definitions:
X⊢Ca iff a∈C(X) and a∈C⊢(X) iff X⊢a.
X \vdash_C a \txtiff  a \in C(X) \textrm{ and }  a \in C_{\vdash}(X) \txtiff  X \vdash a.


Moreover, if CC is finitary, so is ⊢C\vdash_C and if ⊢\vdash
is finitary, so is C⊢C_{\vdash}. 

For a general discussion on logical consequence see the entry
 Logical Consequence.
2. Logics as consequence relations

In this section we define what propositional logics are and explain
the basic concepts relating to them. We will call the propositional
logics (as defined below) simply logic systems. 

One of the main traits of the consequence relations we study in logic
is their formal character. This roughly means that if a sentence aa
follows from a set of sentences XX and we have another sentence
bb and another set of sentences YY that share the same form with
aa and XX respectively, then bb also follows from YY. In
propositional logics this boils down to saying that if we uniformly
replace basic sub-sentences of the sentences in X∪{a}X \cup \{a\} by
other sentences obtaining YY and bb, then bb follows from
YY. (The reader can find more information on the idea of formality
in the entry
 Logical Consequence.)
 

To turn the idea of the formal character of logics into a rigorous
definition we need to introduce the concept of propositional language
and the concept of substitution. 

A propositional language LL is a set of connectives, that
is, a set of symbols each one of which has an arity nn that tells
us in case that n=0n = 0 that the symbol is a propositional constant,
and in case that n>0n \gt 0 whether the connective is unary, binary,
ternary, etc. For example {∧,∨,→,⊥,⊤}\{\wedge , \vee , \rightarrow , \bot ,
\top \} is (or can be) the language of several logics, like
classical and intuitionistic, (⊥(\bot and ⊤\top are 0-ary and the
other connectives are binary), {¬,∧,∨→,◻,◊}\{\neg , \wedge , \vee \rightarrow ,
\Box , \Diamond \} is the language of several modal logics, (¬,◻,◊(\neg
, \Box , \Diamond are unary and the other connectives binary) and
{∧,∨,→,∗,⊤,⊥,1,0}\{ \wedge , \vee , \rightarrow , * , \top , \bot , 1, 0\} is the
language of many-valued logics and also of a fragment of linear logic
(⊥,⊤,1(\bot , \top , 1, and 0 are propositional constants and the other
symbols binary connectives). 

Given a language LL and a set of propositional variables VV
(which is disjoint from L)L), the formulas of LL, or
LL-formulas, are defined inductively as follows:

Every variable is a formula. 
Every 0-ary symbol is a formula.
If ∗* is a connective and n>0n \gt 0 is its arity, then for
all formulas ϕ1,…,ϕn,∗ϕ1…ϕn\phi_1 ,\ldots ,\phi_n, * \phi_1 \ldots \phi_n is
also a formula.


A substitution σ\sigma for LL is a map from the set of
variables VV to the set of formulas of LL. It tells us which
formula must replace which variable when we perform the substitution.
If pp is a variable, σ(p)\sigma(p) denotes the formula that the
substitution σ\sigma assigns to pp. The result of applying a
substitution σ\sigma to a formula ϕ\phi is the formula
σ(ϕ)\bsigma(\phi) obtained from ϕ\phi by simultaneously replacing
the variables in ϕ\phi, say p1,…,pkp_1 , \ldots ,p_k, by,
respectively, the formulas σ(p1),…,σ(pk)\sigma(p_1), \ldots ,\sigma(p_k). In
this way a substitution σ\sigma gives a unique map σ\bsigma from
the set of formulas to itself that satisfies

σ(p)=σ(p)\bsigma(p) = \sigma(p), for every variable pp,
σ(†)=†\bsigma(\dagger) = \dagger, for every 0-ary connective
†\dagger,
σ(∗ϕ1…ϕn)=∗σ(ϕ1)…σ(ϕn)\bsigma(* \phi_1 \ldots \phi_n) = * \bsigma(\phi_1)\ldots
\bsigma(\phi_n), for every connective ∗* of arity n>0n \gt 0 and
formulas ϕ1,…,ϕn\phi_1 , \ldots ,\phi_n.


A formula ψ\psi is a substitution instance of a formula
ϕ\phi if there is a substitution σ\sigma such that when applied
to ϕ\phi gives ψ\psi, that is, if σ(ϕ)=ψ\bsigma(\phi) = \psi. 

In order to avoid unnecessary complications we will assume in the
sequel that all the logics use the same set VV of variables, so
that the definition of formula of LL depends only on LL. A
logic system (or logic for short) is given by a
language LL and a consequence relation ⊢\vdash on the set of
formulas of LL that is formal in the sense that for every
substitution σ\sigma, every set of formulas Γ\Gamma and every
formula ϕ\phi,
if Γ⊢ϕ, then σ[Γ]⊢σ(ϕ)
\textrm{if } \Gamma \vdash \phi, \textrm{ then } \bsigma[\Gamma] \vdash\bsigma(\phi)


where σ[Γ]\bsigma[\Gamma] is the set of the formulas obtained by
applying the substitution σ\sigma to the formulas in Γ\Gamma.
The consequence relations on the set of formulas of a language that
satisfy this property are called structural and also
substitution-invariant in the literature. They were
considered for the first time in Łoś & Suszko 1958.
Tarski only explicitly considered closed sets also closed under
substitution instances for some consequence relations; he never
considered (at least explicitly) the substitution invariance condition
for consequence relations. 

We will refer to logic systems by the letter L\bL with possible
subindices, and we set L=⟨L,⊢L⟩\bL = \langle L, \vdash_{\bL } \rangle and
Ln=⟨Ln,⊢Ln⟩\bL_n = \langle L_n, \vdash_{\bL_n } \rangle with the
understanding that L(Ln)L \; (L_n) is the language of L(Ln)\bL \;(\bL_n) and
⊢L(⊢Ln)\vdash_{\bL }\; (\vdash_{\bL_n }) its consequence relation. A logic
system L\bL is finitary if ⊢L\vdash_{\bL} is a finitary
consequence relation. 

The consequence relation of a logic system can be given in several
ways, some using proof-theoretic tools, others semantic means. One can
define a substitution-invariant consequence relation using a proof
system like a Hilbert-style axiom system, a Gentzen-style sequent
calculus or a natural deduction style calculus, etc. One can also
define a substitution-invariant consequence relation semantically
using a class of mathematical objects (algebras, Kripke models,
topological models, etc.) and a satisfaction relation. 

If L1=⟨L,⊢L1⟩\bL_1 = \langle L,\vdash_{\bL_1 } \rangle is a logic system
with ⊢L1\vdash_{\bL_1} defined by a proof-system and L2=⟨L,⊢L2⟩\bL_2 =
\langle L, \vdash_{\bL_2 } \rangle is a logic system over the same
language with ⊢L2\vdash_{\bL_2} defined semantically, we say that the
proof-system used to define ⊢L1\vdash_{\bL_1} is sound for
the semantics used to define ⊢L2\vdash_{\bL_2} if ⊢L1\vdash_{\bL_1}
is included in ⊢L2\vdash_{\bL_2}, namely if Γ⊢L1ϕ\Gamma \vdash_{\bL_1 }
\phi implies Γ⊢L2ϕ\Gamma \vdash_{\bL_2 } \phi. If the other inclusion
holds the proof-system is said to be complete with respect to
the semantics that defines ⊢L2\vdash_{\bL_2}, that is when Γ⊢L2ϕ\Gamma
\vdash_{\bL_2 } \phi implies Γ⊢L1ϕ\Gamma \vdash_{\bL_1 } \phi. 

A set of LL-formulas Γ\Gamma is called a theory of a
logic system L\bL, or L\bL-theory, if it is closed under the
relation ⊢L\vdash_{\bL}, that is, if whenever Γ⊢Lϕ\Gamma \vdash_{\bL }
\phi it also holds that ϕ∈Γ\phi \in \Gamma. In other words, the
theories of L\bL are the closed sets of the consequence operation
C⊢LC_{\vdash_{ \bL}} on the set of LL-formulas. In order to
simplify the notation we denote this consequence operation by
CLC_{\bL}. A formula ϕ\phi is a theorem (or validity) of
L\bL if ∅⊢Lϕ\varnothing \vdash_{\bL } \phi. Then CL(∅)C_{\bL
}(\varnothing) is the set of theorems of L\bL and is the least
theory of L\bL. The set of all theories of L\bL will be denoted
by Th(L)\tTH(\bL). 

Given a logic L\bL, the consequence operation CLC_{\bL} is
substitution-invariant, which means that for every set of
LL-formulas Γ\Gamma and every substitution
σ,σ[CL(Γ)]⊆CL(σ[Γ]\sigma,\bsigma[C_{\bL}(\Gamma)] \subseteq C_{\bL}(\bsigma[\Gamma]). Moreover,
for every theory TT of L\bL we have a new consequence operation
defined as follows: 

CTL(Γ)=CL(T∪Γ)C_{\bL }^T (\Gamma) = C_{\bL }(T \cup \Gamma)

 that is, CTL(Γ)C_{\bL }^T (\Gamma) is
the set of formulas that follow from Γ\Gamma and TT according to
L\bL. It turns out that TT is closed under substitutions if and
only if CTLC_{\bL }^T is substitution-invariant. 


If L\bL is a logic and Γ,Δ\Gamma , \Delta are sets of
LL-formulas, we will use the notation Γ⊢LΔ\Gamma \vdash_{\bL }
\Delta to state that for every ψ∈Δ,Γ⊢Lψ\psi \in \Delta , \Gamma
\vdash_{\bL } \psi. Thus Γ⊢LΔ\Gamma \vdash_{\bL } \Delta if and only
if Δ⊆CL(Γ)\Delta \subseteq C_{\bL }(\Gamma).

If L=⟨L,⊢L⟩\bL = \langle L, \vdash_{\bL } \rangle is a logic system L′=⟨L′,⊢L′⟩\bL'
= \langle L', \vdash_{\bL' } \rangle whose language is L′L' (hence
all the L′L'-formulas are LL-formulas) and whose consequence
relation is defined by 

Γ⊢L′ϕ iff Γ⊢Lϕ,\Gamma \vdash_{\bL' } \phi \txtiff \Gamma \vdash_{\bL } \phi,

 for every set of L′L'-formulas
Γ\Gamma and every L′L'-formula ϕ\phi. In this situation we
also say that L\bL is an expansion of L′\bL'. 

3. Some examples of logics

We give some examples of logic systems that we will refer to in the
course of this essay, which are assembled here for the reader’s
convenience. Whenever possible we refer to the corresponding
entries.

We use the standard convention of writing (ϕ∗ψ)(\phi * \psi) instead of
∗ϕψ* \phi \psi for binary connectives and omit the external
parenthesis in the formulas. 
3.1 Classical propositional logic

We take the language of Classical propositional logic CPL\bCPL to be
the set Lc={∧,∨,→,⊤,⊥},L_c = \{\wedge , \vee , \rightarrow , \top , \bot \}, 
where 
∧,∨,→\wedge , \vee , \rightarrow are binary connectives and ⊤,⊥\top , \bot
propositional constants. We
assume the consequence relation defined by the usual truth-table
method (⊤(\top is interpreted as true
and ⊥\bot as false), that is,

Γ⊢CPLϕ iff \Gamma \vdash_{\bCPL } \phi\txtiff every truth valuation that
assigns true to all ψ∈Γ\psi \in \Gamma
assigns true to ϕ\phi.

The formulas ϕ\phi such that ∅⊢CPLϕ\varnothing \vdash_{\bCPL } \phi
are the tautologies. Note that using the language LcL_c,
the negation of a formula ϕ\phi is defined as ϕ→⊥\phi \rightarrow
\bot. For more information, see the entry on
 classical logic

3.2 Intuitionistic propositional logic

We take the language of Intuitionistic propositional logic to be the
same as that of classical propositional logic, namely the set
{∧,∨,→,⊤,⊥}\{\wedge , \vee , \rightarrow , \top , \bot \}. The consequence
relation is defined by the following Hilbert-style calculus.
Axioms:

All the formulas of the forms

C0.  ⊤\top

C1.  ϕ→(ψ→ϕ)\phi
\rightarrow(\psi \rightarrow \phi) 
C2.  ϕ→(ψ→(ϕ∧ψ))\phi
\rightarrow(\psi \rightarrow(\phi \wedge \psi)) 
C3.  (ϕ∧ψ)→ϕ(\phi \wedge
\psi) \rightarrow \phi 
C4.  (ϕ∧ψ)→ψ(\phi \wedge
\psi) \rightarrow \psi  
C5.  ϕ→(ϕ∨ψ)\phi
\rightarrow(\phi \vee \psi) 
C6.  ψ→(ϕ∨ψ)\psi
\rightarrow(\phi \vee \psi) 
C7.  (ϕ∨ψ)→((ϕ→δ)→((ψ→δ)→δ))(\phi \vee \psi)
\rightarrow((\phi \rightarrow \delta) \rightarrow((\psi \rightarrow
\delta) \rightarrow \delta)) 
C8.  (ϕ→ψ)→((ϕ→(ψ→δ))→(ϕ→δ))(\phi
\rightarrow \psi) \rightarrow((\phi \rightarrow(\psi \rightarrow
\delta)) \rightarrow(\phi \rightarrow \delta)) 
C9.  ⊥→ϕ\bot \rightarrow
\phi

3.3 Local Normal Modal logics

The language of modal logic we consider here is the set Lm={∧,∨,→,¬,◻,⊤,⊥}L_m =
\{\wedge , \vee , \rightarrow , \neg , \Box , \top , \bot \} that
expands LcL_c by adding the unary connective ◻\Box. In the standard literature on
modal logic a normal modal logic is defined not as a consequence
relation but as a set of formulas with certain properties. A
normal modal logic is a set Λ\Lambda of formulas of
LmL_m which contains all the tautologies of the language of
classical logic, the formulas of the form 

◻(ϕ→ψ)→(◻ϕ→◻ψ)\Box(\phi \rightarrow \psi) \rightarrow(\Box \phi \rightarrow \Box \psi)

 and is closed
under the rules  

ϕ,ϕ→ψ/ψϕ/◻ϕϕ/σ(ϕ), for every substitution σ
\begin{align*}
\phi , \phi \rightarrow \psi / \psi \tag{Modus Ponens}\\
\phi / \Box \phi \tag{Modal Generalization}\\
\phi/ \bsigma(\phi), \textrm{ for every substitution } \sigma \tag{Substitution}\\
\end{align*}


Note that the set Λ\Lambda is closed under substitution instances,
namely for every substitution σ\sigma, if ϕ∈Lm\phi \in L_m, then
σ(ϕ)∈Lm\bsigma(\phi) \in L_m. 

The least normal modal logic is called KK and can be axiomatized by
the Hilbert-style calculus with axioms the tautologies of classical logic
and the formulas ◻(ϕ→ψ)→(◻ϕ→◻ψ)\Box(\phi \rightarrow \psi) \rightarrow(\Box \phi
\rightarrow \Box \psi), and with rules of inference Modus Ponens,
Modal Generalization and Substitution. 

With a normal modal logic Λ\Lambda it is associated the consequence
relation defined by the calculus that takes as axioms all the formulas
in Λ\Lambda and as the only rule of inference Modus Ponens. The
logic system given by this consequence relation is called the
local consequence of Λ\Lambda. We denote it by
lΛ\blLambda. Its theorems are the elements of Λ\Lambda. It holds
that

Γ⊢lΛϕ iff ϕ∈Λ\Gamma \vdash_{\blLambda} \phi\txtiff\phi \in \Lambda or there are
ϕ1,…,ϕn∈Γ\phi_1 , \ldots ,\phi_n \in \Gamma such that (ϕ1∧…∧ϕn)→ϕ∈Λ(\phi_1 \wedge
\ldots \wedge \phi_n) \rightarrow \phi \in \Lambda.
3.4 Global Normal Modal logics

Another consequence relation is associated with each normal modal
logic Λ\Lambda. It is defined by the calculus that has as axioms
the formulas of Λ\Lambda and as rules of inference Modus Ponens and
Modal Generalization. The logic system given by this consequence
relation is called the global consequence of Λ\Lambda and
will be denoted by gΛ\bgLambda. It has the same theorems as the
local lΛ\blLambda, namely the elements of Λ\Lambda. The
difference between lΛ\blLambda and gΛ\bgLambda lies in the
consequences they allow to draw from nonempty sets of premises. This
difference has an enormous effect on their algebraic behavior.

For more information on modal logic, see the entry on
 modal logic.
 The reader can find specific information on modal logics as
consequence relations in Kracht 2006.
3.5 Intuitionistic Linear Logic without exponentials

We take as the language of Intuitionistic Linear Logic without
exponentials the set {∧,∨,→,∗,0,1,⊤,⊥}\{\wedge , \vee , \rightarrow , * , 0, 1, \top
, \bot \}, where ∧,∨,→,∗\wedge , \vee , \rightarrow, * are binary connectives and 0,1,⊤,⊥0, 1,\top , \bot 
propositional constants. We denote the logic by ILL\bILL. The axioms and rule of
inference below provide a Hilbert-style axiomatization of this logic.

Axioms:

L1.  1 
L2.  (ϕ→ψ)→((ψ→δ)→(ϕ→δ))(\phi
\rightarrow \psi) \rightarrow((\psi \rightarrow \delta)
\rightarrow(\phi \rightarrow \delta)) 
L3.  (ϕ→(ψ→δ))→(ψ→(ϕ→δ))(\phi
\rightarrow(\psi \rightarrow \delta)) \rightarrow(\psi
\rightarrow(\phi \rightarrow \delta)) 
L4.  ϕ→(ψ→(ϕ∗ψ))\phi
\rightarrow(\psi \rightarrow(\phi * \psi)) 
L5.  (ϕ→(ψ→δ))→((ϕ∗ψ)→δ)(\phi
\rightarrow(\psi \rightarrow \delta)) \rightarrow((\phi * \psi)
\rightarrow \delta) 
L6.  1→(ϕ→ϕ)1
\rightarrow(\phi \rightarrow \phi) 
L7.  (ϕ∧ψ)→ϕ(\phi \wedge
\psi) \rightarrow \phi 
L8.  (ϕ∧ψ)→ψ(\phi \wedge
\psi) \rightarrow \psi 
L9.  ψ→(ϕ∨ψ)\psi
\rightarrow(\phi \vee \psi) 
L10.  ϕ→(ϕ∨ψ)\phi
\rightarrow(\phi \vee \psi) 
L11.  ((ϕ→ψ)∧(ϕ→δ))→(ϕ→(ψ∧δ))((\phi
\rightarrow \psi) \wedge(\phi \rightarrow \delta)) \rightarrow(\phi
\rightarrow(\psi \wedge \delta)) 
L12.  ((ϕ→δ)∧(ψ→δ))→((ϕ∨ψ)→δ)((\phi
\rightarrow \delta) \wedge(\psi \rightarrow \delta)) \rightarrow((\phi
\vee \psi) \rightarrow \delta) 
L13.  ϕ→⊤\phi
\rightarrow \top 
L14.  ⊥→ψ\bot

3.6 The system R\bR of Relevance Logic

The language we consider is the set {∧,∨,→,¬}\{\wedge , \vee , \rightarrow ,
\neg \}, where ∧,∨,→\wedge , \vee , \rightarrow are binary connectives and ¬\neg a unary connective. A Hilbert style axiomatization for R\bR can be given by
the rules of Intuitionistic Linear Logic without exponentials and the
axioms L2, L3, L7-L12 of this logic together with the axioms

 (ϕ→(ϕ→ψ))→(ϕ→ψ)(\phi \rightarrow(\phi \rightarrow \psi)) \rightarrow(\phi
\rightarrow \psi)
 (ϕ→¬ψ)→(ψ→¬ψ)(\phi \rightarrow \neg \psi) \rightarrow(\psi \rightarrow \neg

4. Algebras

The algebraic study of a particular logic has to provide first of all
its formal language with an algebraic semantics using a class of
algebras whose properties are exploited to understand which properties
the logic has. In this section, we present how the formal languages of
propositional logics are given an algebraic interpretation. In the
next section, we address the question of what is an algebraic
semantics for a logic system.

We start by describing the first two steps involved in the algebraic
study of propositional logics. Both are needed in order to endow
propositional languages with algebraic interpretations. To expound
them we will assume knowledge of first-order logic (see the entries on
 classical logic
 and
 first-order model theory)
 and we will call algebraic first-order languages, or simply
algebraic languages, the first-order languages with equality
and without any relational symbols, so that these languages have only
operation symbols (also called function symbols), if any, in the set
of their non-logical symbols. 

The two steps we are about to expound can be summarized in the slogan:


Propositional formulas are terms.

The first step consist in looking at the formulas of any
propositional language LL as the terms of the algebraic first-order
language with LL as its set of operation symbols. This means that
(i) every connective of LL of arity nn is taken as an operation
symbol of arity nn (thus every 0-ary symbol of LL is taken as an
individual constant) and that (ii) the propositional formulas of LL
are taken as the terms of this first-order language; in particular the
propositional variables are the variables of the first-order language.
From this point of view the definition of LL-formula is exactly the
definition of LL-term. We will refer to the algebraic language with
LL as its set of operation symbols as the LL-algebraic
language. 

The second step is to interpret the propositional formulas in
the same manner in which terms of a first-order language are
interpreted in a structure. In this way the concept of LL-algebra
comes into play. On a given set AA, an nn-ary connective is
interpreted by a nn-ary function on AA (a map that assigns an
element of AA to every sequence ⟨a1,…,an⟩\langle a_1 , \ldots
,a_n\rangle of elements of A)A). This procedure is a
generalization of the truth-table interpretations of the languages of
logic systems like classical logic and Łukasiewicz and
Post’s finite-valued logics. In those cases, given the set of
truth-values at play the function that interprets a connective is
given by its truth-table.

A way to introduce algebras is as the models of some algebraic
first-order language. We follow an equivalent route and give the
definition of algebra using the setting of propositional languages.
Let LL be a propositional language. An algebra A\bA of
type LL, or LL-algebra for short, is a set AA, called the
carrier of A\bA, together with a function ∗A* ^{\bA} on AA of
the arity of ∗*, for every connective ∗* in LL (if ∗* is
0-ary, ∗A* ^{\bA} is an element of A)A). An algebra A\bA is
trivial if its carrier is a one element set.

A valuation on an LL-algebra A\bA is a map vv from
the set of variables into its carrier AA. Algebras together with
valuations are used to interpret in a compositional way the formulas
of LL, assuming that a connective ∗* of LL is interpreted in
an LL-algebra A\bA by the function ∗A* ^{\bA}. Let A\bA be
an algebra of type LL and vv a valuation on A\bA. The value
of a compound formula ∗ϕ1…ϕn* \phi_1 \ldots \phi_n is computed by
applying the function ∗A* ^{\bA} that interprets ∗* in A\bA to
the previously computed values v(ϕ1),…,v(ϕn)\bv(\phi_1), \ldots ,\bv(\phi_n) of
the formulas ϕ1,…,ϕn\phi_1 ,\ldots ,\phi_n. Precisely speaking the value
v(ϕ)\bv(\phi) of a formula ϕ\phi is defined inductively as
follows:

v(p)=v(p)\bv(p) = v(p), for each variable pp,
v(†)=†A\bv(\dagger) = \dagger^{\bA}, if †\dagger is a 0-ary
connective
v(∗ϕ1…ϕn)=∗A(v(ϕ1),…,v(ϕn))\bv(* \phi_1 \ldots \phi_n) = * ^{\bA }(\bv(\phi_1), \ldots
,\bv(\phi_n)), if ∗* is a nn-ary (n>0)(n \gt 0)
connective.


Note that in this way we have obtained a map v\bv from the set of
LL-formulas to the carrier of A\bA. It is important to notice
that the value of a formula under a valuation depends only on the
propositional variables that actually appear in the formula.
Accordingly, if ϕ\phi is a formula we use the notation ϕ(p1,…,pn)\phi(p_1 ,
\ldots ,p_n) to indicate that the variables that appear in ϕ\phi
are in the list p1,…,pnp_1 , \ldots ,p_n, and given elements a1,…,ana_1 ,
\ldots ,a_n of an algebra A\bA by ϕA[a1,…,an]\phi^{\bA }[a_1 , \ldots
,a_n] we refer to the value of ϕ(p1,…,pn)\phi(p_1 , \ldots ,p_n) under any
valuation vv on A\bA such that v(p1)=a1,…,v(pn)=anv(p_1) = a_1 , \ldots ,v(p_n) =
a_n. 

A third and fundamental step in the algebraic study
of logics is to turn the set of formulas of a language LL into an
algebra, the algebra of formulas of LL, denoted by
FmL\bFm_L. This algebra has the set of LL-formulas as carrier and
the operations are defined as follows. For every nn-ary connective
∗* with n>0n \gt 0, the function ∗FmL* ^{\bFm_L} is the map that
sends each tuple of formulas (ϕ1,…,ϕn)(\phi_1 , \ldots ,\phi_n) (where
nn is the arity of ∗)* ) to the formula ∗ϕ1…ϕn* \phi_1 \ldots
\phi_n, and for every 0-ary connective †,†FmL\dagger ,
\dagger^{\bFm_L} is †\dagger. If no confusion is likely we
suppress the subindex in FmL\bFm_L and write Fm\bFm instead. 
4.1 Some concepts of universal algebra and model theory

Algebras are a particular type of structure or model. An LL-algebra
is a structure or model for the LL-algebraic first-order language.
Therefore the concepts of model theory for the first-order languages
apply to them (see the entries on
 classical logic
 and
 first-order model theory).
 We need some of these concepts. They are also used in universal
algebra, a field that to some extent can be considered the model
theory of the algebraic languages. We introduce the definitions of the
concepts we need. 

Given an algebra A\bA of type LL, a congruence of
A\bA is an equivalence relation θ\theta on the carrier of
A\bA that satisfies for every nn-ary connective ∗∈L* \in L the
following compatibility property: for every a1,…,an,b1,…,bn∈Aa_1 , \ldots ,a_n, b_1 ,
\ldots ,b_n \in A,
if a1θb1,…,anθb1, then ∗A(a1,…,an) θ∗A(b1,…,bn).
\textrm{if } a_1\theta b_1 , \ldots ,a_n \theta b_1, \textrm{ then  } *^{\bA}(a_1 ,\ldots ,a_n)\ \theta *^{\bA}(b_1 ,\ldots ,b_n).


Given a congruence θ\theta of A\bA we can reduce the algebra by
identifying the elements which are related by θ\theta. The algebra
obtained is the quotient algebra of A\bA modulo
θ\theta. It is denoted by A/θ\bA/\theta, its carrier is the set
A/θA/\theta of equivalence classes [a][a] of the elements aa of
AA modulo the equivalence relation θ\theta, and the operations
are defined as follows:

†A/θ=[†A]\dagger^{\bA/\theta} = [\dagger^{\bA}], for every 0-ary
connective †\dagger,
∗A/θ([a1],…,[an])=[∗A(a1,…,an)]* ^{\bA/\theta}([a_1], \ldots, [a_n]) = [* ^{\bA }(a_1 ,\ldots
,a_n)], for every connective ∗* whose arity is nn and n>0n \gt
0.


The compatibility property ensures that the definition is sound.

Let A\bA and B\bB be LL-algebras. A homomorphism
hh from A\bA to B\bB is a map hh from AA to BB such
that for every 0-ary symbol †∈L\dagger \in L and every nn-ary
connective ∗∈L* \in L

 h(†A)=†Bh(\dagger^{\bA }) = \dagger^{\bB}
h(∗A(a1,…,an))=∗B(h(b1),…,h(bn))h(* ^{\bA }(a_1 ,\ldots ,a_n)) = * ^{\bB }(h(b_1),\ldots
,h(b_n)), for all a1,…,an∈Aa_1 , \ldots ,a_n \in A.


We say that B\bB is a homomorphic image of A\bA if
there is a homomorphism from A\bA to B\bB which is an onto map
from AA to BB. An homomorphism from A\bA to B\bB is an
isomorphism if it is a one-to-one and onto map from AA to
BB. If an isomorphism from A\bA to B\bB exists, we say that
A\bA and B\bB are isomorphic and that B\bB is an
isomorphic image (or a copy) of A\bA.

Let A\bA and B\bB be LL-algebras. A\bA is a
subalgebra of B\bB if (1) A⊆BA \subseteq B, (2) the
interpretations of the 0-ary symbols of LL in B\bB belong to
AA and AA is closed under the functions of B\bB that
interpret the non 0-ary symbols, and (3) the interpretations of the
0-ary symbols in A\bA coincide with their interpretations in
B\bB and the interpretations on A\bA of the other symbols in
LL are the restrictions to A\bA of their interpretations in
B\bB.

We refer the reader to the entry on
 first-order model theory
 for the notions of direct product (called product there) and
ultraproduct.
4.2 Varieties and quasivarieties

The majority of classes of algebras that provide semantics for
propositional logics are quasivarieties and in most cases varieties.
The theory of varieties and quasivarieties is one of the main subjects
of universal algebra.

A variety of LL-algebras is a class of LL-algebras that is
definable in a very simple way (by equations) using the
LL-algebraic language. An LL-equation is a formula
ϕ≈ψ\phi \approx \psi where ϕ\phi and ψ\psi are terms of the
LL-algebraic language (that is, LL-formulas if we take the
propositional logics point of view). An equation ϕ≈ψ\phi \approx \psi
is valid in an algebra A\bA, or A\bA is a
model of ϕ≈ψ\phi \approx \psi, if for every valuation vv
on A,v(ϕ)=v(ψ)\bA, \bv(\phi) = \bv(\psi). This is exactly the same as to
saying that the universal closure of ϕ≈ψ\phi \approx \psi is a
sentence true in A\bA according to the usual semantics for
first-order logic with equality. A variety of LL-algebras
is a class of LL-algebras which is the class of all the models of a
given set of LL-equations.

Quasivarieties of LL-algebras are classes of LL-algebras
definable using the LL-algebraic language in a slightly more
complex way than in varieties. A proper LL-quasiequation
is a formula of the form 

⋀i≤nϕi≈ψi→ϕ≈ψ.\bigwedge_{i \le n} \phi_i \approx \psi_i \rightarrow \phi \approx \psi.

 An LL-quasiequation
is a formula of the above form but possibly with an empty antecedent,
in which case it is just the equation ϕ≈ψ\phi \approx \psi. Hence,
the LL-quasiequations are the proper LL-quasiequations and the
LL-equations. An LL-quasiequation is valid in an
LL-algebra A\bA, or the algebra is a model of it, if the
universal closure of the quasiequation is sentence true in A\bA. A
quasivariety of LL-algebras is a class of algebras which
is the class of the models of a given set of LL-quasiequations.
Since equations are quasiequations, each variety is a quasivariety.
The converse is false. 


Varieties and quasivarieties can be characterized by the closure
properties they enjoy. A class of LL-algebras is a variety if and
only if it is closed under subalgebras, direct products, and
homomorphic images. The variety generated by a class K\bK of
LL-algebras is the least class of LL-algebras that includes
K\bK and is closed under subalgebras, direct products and
homomorphic images. It is also the class of the algebras that are
models of the equations valid in K\bK. For example, the variety
generated by the algebra of the two truth-values for classical logic
is the class of Boolean algebras. If we restrict that algebra to the
operations for conjunction and disjunction only, it generates the
variety of distributive lattices and if we restrict it to the
operations for conjunction and disjunction and the interpretations of
⊤\top and ⊥\bot, it generates the variety of bounded
distributive lattices.

A class of LL-algebras is a quasivariety if and only if it is
closed under subalgebras, direct products, ultraproducts, isomorphic
images, and contains a trivial algebra. The quasivariety generated by
a class K\bK of LL-algebras is the least class of LL-algebras
that includes K\bK, the trivial algebras and is closed under
subalgebras, direct products, ultraproducts, and isomorphic images.


An SP-class of LL-algebras is a class of LL-algebras
that contains a trivial algebra and is closed under isomorphic images,
subalgebras, and direct products. Thus quasivarieties and varieties
are all SP-classes. The SP-class generated by a class K\bK of
LL-algebras is the least class of LL-algebras that includes
K\bK, the trivial algebras and is closed under subalgebras, direct
products and isomorphic images. 
5. Algebraic semantics

The term ‘algebraic semantics’ was (and many times still
is) used in the literature in a loose way. To provide a logic with an
algebraic semantics was to interpret its language in a class of
algebras, define a notion of satisfaction of a formula (under a
valuation) in an algebra of the class and prove a soundness and
completeness theorem, usually for the theorems of the logic only.
Nowadays there is a precise concept of algebraic semantics for a logic
system. It was introduced by Blok and Pigozzi in Blok & Pigozzi
1989. In this concept we find a general way to state in mathematically
precise terms what is common to the many cases of purported algebraic
semantics for specific logic systems found in the literature. We
expose the notion in this section. To motivate the definition we
discuss several examples first, stressing what is common to all of
them. The reader does not need to know about the classes of algebras
that provide algebraic semantics we refer to in the examples. Its
existence is what is important.

The prototypical examples of algebraic semantics for propositional
logics are the class BA of
 Boolean algebras,
 which is the algebraic semantics for classical logic, and the class
HA of Heyting algebras, which is the algebraic
semantics for
 intuitionistic logic.
 Every Boolean algebra and every Heyting algebra A\bA has a
greatest element according to their natural order; this element is
denoted usually by 1A1^{\bA} and interprets the propositional
constant symbol ⊤\top. It is taken as the distinguished element
relative to which the algebraic semantics is given. The algebraic
semantics of these two logics works as follows: 

Let L\bL be classical or intuitionistic logic and let K(L)\bK(\bL)
be the corresponding class of algebras BA or
HA. It holds that 


Γ⊢Lϕ iff \Gamma \vdash_{\bL } \phi\txtiff for every A∈K(L)\bA \in \bK(\bL)
and every valuation vv on A\bA, if v(ψ)=1A\bv(\psi) = 1^{\bA} for all ψ∈Γ\psi \in \Gamma , then v(ϕ)=1A\bv(\phi) = 1^{\bA}.


This is the precise content of the statement that BA
and HA are an algebraic semantics for classical logic
and for intuitionistic logic respectively. The implication from left
to right in the expression above is an algebraic soundness theorem and
the implication from right to left an algebraic completeness
theorem.

There are logics for which an algebraic semantics is provided in the
literature in a slightly different way from the one given by the
schema above. Let us consider the example in
 Section 3.5
 of Intuitionistic Linear Logic without exponentials. We denote by
IL0\bILsubZ the class of IL-algebras with zero defined in Troelstra
1992 (but adapted to the language of ILL)\bILL). Each A∈IL0\bA \in
\bILsubZ is a lattice with extra operations and thus has its lattice
order ≤A\le^{\bA}. This lattice order has a greatest element which
we take as the interpretation of ⊤\top. On each one of these
algebras A\bA there is a designated element 1A1^{\bA} (the
interpretation of 1) that may be different from the greatest element.
It holds:


Γ⊢ILLϕ iff \Gamma \vdash_{\bILL } \phi\txtiff for every A∈IL0\bA \in \bILsubZ
and every valuation vv on A\bA, if 1A≤Av(ψ)1^{\bA } \le^{\bA } \bv(\psi) for all ψ∈Γ\psi \in \Gamma , then 1A≤Av(ϕ)1^{\bA } \le^{\bA }
\bv(\phi).


In this case one does not consider only a designated element in every
algebra A\bA but a set of designated elements, namely the elements
of A\bA  greater than or equal to 1A1^{\bA}, to provide the
definition. Let us denote this set by D(A)\tD (\bA), and notice that
D(A)={a∈A:1A∧Aa=1A}\tD (\bA) = \{a \in A: 1^{\bA } \wedge^{\bA} a = 1^{\bA }\}.
Hence,


Γ⊢ILLϕ iff \Gamma \vdash_{\bILL } \phi\txtiff for every A∈IL0\bA \in \bILsubZ
if v[Γ]⊆D(A)\bv[\Gamma] \subseteq \tD (\bA), then v(ϕ)∈D(A)\bv(\phi) \in \tD
(\bA).


Still there are even more complex situations. One of them is the
system R\bR of relevance logic. Consider the class of algebras
Ral\bRal defined in Font & Rodríguez 1990 (see also Font
& Rodríguez 1994) and denoted there by
‘R\bR’. Let us consider for every A∈Ral\bA \in \bRal the
set 

E(A):={a∈A:a∧A(a→Aa)=a→Aa}.\tE(\bA) := \{a \in A: a \wedge^{\bA }(a \rightarrow^{\bA } a) = a \rightarrow^{\bA } a\}. 

 Then Ral\bRal is said to be an algebraic semantics
for R\bR because the following holds:



Γ⊢Rϕ iff \Gamma \vdash_{\bR } \phi\txtiff for every A∈Ral\bA \in \bRal and
every valuation vv on A\bA, if v[Γ]⊆E(A)\bv[\Gamma] \subseteq \tE
(\bA), then v(ϕ)∈E(A)\bv(\phi) \in \tE (\bA).


The common pattern in the examples above is that the algebraic
semantics is given by 

a class of algebras K\bK,
in each algebra in K\bK a set of designated elements that plays
the role 1A1^{\bA} (more precisely the set {1A})\{1^{\bA }\}) plays
in the cases of classical and intuitionistic logic, and 
this set of designated elements is definable (in the same manner
on every algebra) by an equation in the sense that it is the set of
elements of the algebra that satisfy the equation (i.e., its
solutions). For BA and HA the
equation is p≈⊤p \approx \top. For Ral\bRal it is p→(p∧p)≈p→pp \rightarrow(p
\wedge p) \approx p \rightarrow p, and for IL0\bILsubZ it is 1∧p≈11
\wedge p \approx 1.


The main point in Blok and Pigozzi’s concept of algebraic
semantics comes from the realization, mentioned in (3) above, that the
set of designated elements considered in the algebraic semantics of
known logics is in fact the set of solutions of an equation, and that
what practice forced researchers to look for when they tried to obtain
algebraic semantics for new logics was in fact, although not
explicitly formulated in these terms, an equational way to define
uniformly in every algebra a set of designated elements in order to
obtain an algebraic soundness and completeness theorem. 

We are now in a position to expose the mathematically precise concept
of algebraic semantics. To develop a fruitful and general theory of
the algebraization of logics some generalizations beyond the
well-known concrete examples have to be made. In the definition of
algebraic semantics, one takes the move from a single equation to a
set of them in the definability condition for the set of designated
elements.

Before stating Blok and Pigozzi’s definition we need to
introduce a notational convention. Given an algebra A\bA and a set
of equations Eq\iEq in one variable, we denote by Eq(A)\iEq(\bA) the
set of elements of A\bA that satisfy all the equations in Eq\iEq.
Then a logic L\bL is said to have an algebraic semantics
if there is a class of algebras K\bK and a set of equations
Eq\iEq in one variable such that

(**) Γ⊢Lϕ iff  \Gamma
\vdash_{\bL } \phi \txtiff for every A∈K\bA \in \bK and every
valuation vv on A\bA, if v[Γ]⊆Eq(A)\bv[\Gamma] \subseteq \iEq(\bA),
then v(ϕ)∈Eq(A)\bv(\phi) \in \iEq(\bA). 


In this situation we say that the class of algebras K\bK is an
Eq\iEq-algebraic semantics for L\bL, or that the pair
(K,Eq)(\bK, \iEq) is an algebraic semantics for L\bL. If
Eq\iEq consists of a single equation δ(p)≈ε(p)\delta(p) \approx
\varepsilon(p) we will simply say that K\bK is a δ(p)≈ε(p)\delta(p)
\approx \varepsilon(p)-algebraic semantics for L\bL. In fact,
Blok and Pigozzi required that Eq\iEq should be finite in their
definition of algebraic semantics. But it is better to be more
general. The definition clearly encompasses the situations encountered
in the examples.

If K\bK is an Eq\iEq-algebraic semantics for a finitary logic
L\bL and Eq\iEq is finite, then the quasivariety generated by
K\bK is also an Eq\iEq-algebraic semantics. The same does not
hold in general if we consider the generated variety. For this reason
it is customary and useful when developing the theory of the
algebraization of finitary logics to consider quasivarieties of
algebras as algebraic semantics instead of arbitrary subclasses that
generate them. Conversely, if a quasivariety is an Eq\iEq-algebraic
semantics for a finitary L\bL and Eq\iEq is finite, so is any
subclass of the quasivariety that generates it. 

In the best-behaved cases, the typical algebraic semantics of a logic
is a variety, for instance in all the examples discussed above. But
there are cases in which it is not. 

A quasivariety can be an Eq\iEq-algebraic semantics for a logic and
an Eq′\iEq'-algebraic semantics for another logic (with Eq\iEq and
Eq′\iEq' different). For example, due to Glivenko’s theorem
(see the entry on
 intuitionistic logic)
 the class of Heyting algebras is a {¬¬p≈1}\{\neg \neg p \approx
1\}-algebraic semantics for classical logic and it is the standard
{p≈1}\{p \approx 1\}-algebraic semantics for intuitionistic logic.
Moreover, different quasivarieties of algebras can be an
Eq\iEq-algebraic semantics for the same logic. It is known that
there is a quasivariety that properly includes the variety of Boolean
algebras and is a {p≈1}\{p \approx 1\}-algebraic semantics for
classical propositional logic. It is also known that for some logics
with an algebraic semantics (relative to some set of equations), the
natural class of algebras that corresponds to the logic is not an
algebraic semantics (for any set of equations) of it. One example
where this situation holds is in the local normal modal logic
lK\blK. Finally, there are logics that do not have any algebraic
semantics.

These facts highlight the need for some criteria of the goodness of a
pair (K,Eq)(\bK, \iEq) to provide a natural algebraic semantics for a
logic L\bL when some exists. One such criterion would be that
L\bL is an algebraizable logic with (K,Eq)(\bK, \iEq) as an algebraic
semantics. Another that K\bK is the natural class of algebras
associated with the logic L\bL. The notion of the natural class of
algebras of a logic system will be discussed in
 Section 8
 and the concept of algebraizable logic in
 Section 9.
 
6. Logical matrices

In the last section, we saw that to provide a logic with an algebraic
semantics we need in many cases to consider in every algebra a set of
designated elements instead of a single designated one. In the
examples we discussed, the set of designated elements was definable in
the algebras by one equation. This motivated the definition of
algebraic semantics in
 Section 5.
 For many logics, to obtain a semantics similar to an algebraic
semantics using the class of algebras naturally associated with them
one needs for every algebra a set of designated elements that cannot
be defined using only the equations of the algebraic language or is
not even definable by using this language only. As we already
mentioned, one example where this happens is the local consequence of
the normal modal logic KK.

To endow every logic with a semantics of an algebraic kind
one has to consider, at least, algebras together with a set of
designated elements, without any requirement about its definability
using the corresponding algebraic language. These pairs are the
logical matrices. Tarski defined the general concept of logical matrix
in the 1920s but the concept was already implicit in previous work by
Łukasiewicz, Bernays, Post and others, who used truth-tables,
either in independence proofs or to define logics different from
classical logic. A logical matrix is a pair ⟨A,D⟩\langle \bA, D
\rangle where A\bA is an algebra and DD a subset of the
carrier AA of A\bA; the elements of DD are called the
designated elements of the matrix and accordingly DD is
called the set of designated elements (sometimes it is also
called the truth set of the matrix). Logical matrices were
first used as models of the theorems of specific logic systems, for
instance in the work of McKinsey and Tarski, and also to define sets
of formulas with similar properties to those of the set of theorems of
a logic system, namely closure under substitution instances. This was
the case of the nn-valued logics of Łukasiewicz and of his
infinite-valued logic. It was Tarski who first considered logical
matrices as a general tool to define this kind of sets. 

The general theory of logical matrices explained in this entry is due
mainly to Polish logicians, starting with Łoś 1949 and
continuing in Łoś & Suszko 1958, building on previous
work by Lindenbaum. In Łoś and Suszko’s paper matrices
are used for the first time both as models of logic systems (in our
sense) and to define these kinds of systems. 

In the rest of this section, we present the relevant concepts of the
theory of logical matrices using modern terminology.

Given a logic L\bL, a logical matrix ⟨A,D⟩\langle \bA, D \rangle is
said to be a model of L\bL if wherever Γ⊢Lϕ\Gamma
\vdash_{\bL } \phi then every valuation vv on A\bA that maps
the elements of Γ\Gamma to some designated value (i.e., an element
of D)D) also maps ϕ\phi to a designated value. When ⟨A,D⟩\langle
\bA, D \rangle is a model of L\bL it is said that DD is an
L\bL-filter of the algebra A\bA. The set of
L\bL-filters of an algebra A\bA plays a crucial role in the
theory of the algebraization of logic systems. We will come to this
point later. 

A class M\bM of logical matrices is said to be a matrix
semantics for a logic L\bL if 

(*)Γ⊢Lϕ iff  \Gamma
\vdash_{\bL } \phi\txtiff for every ⟨A,D⟩∈M\langle \bA, \tD \rangle \in
\bM and every valuation vv on A\bA, if v[Γ]⊆D\bv[\Gamma] \subseteq
D, then v(ϕ)∈D\bv(\phi) \in D. 


The implication from left to right says that L\bL is sound relative
to M\bM, and the other implication says that it is complete. In
other words, M\bM is a matrix semantics for L\bL if and only if
every matrix in M\bM is a model of L\bL and moreover for every
Γ\Gamma and ϕ\phi such that Γ⊬Lϕ\Gamma \not\vdash_{\bL } \phi
there is a model ⟨A,D⟩\langle \bA, \tD \rangle of L\bL in M\bM
that witnesses the fact, namely there is a valuation on the model that
sends the formulas in Γ\Gamma to designated elements and ϕ\phi
to a non-designated one. 

Logical matrices are also used to define logics semantically. If M=⟨A,D⟩\cM
= \langle \bA, D \rangle is a logical matrix, the relation defined
by


Γ⊢Mϕ iff \Gamma \vdash_{\cM } \phi\txtiff for every valuation vv on
A\bA if v(ψ)∈D\bv(\psi) \in D for all ψ∈Γ\psi \in \Gamma, then
v(ϕ)∈D\bv(\phi) \in D


is a consequence relation which is substitution-invariant; therefore
⟨L,⊢M⟩\langle L, \vdash_{\cM } \rangle is a logic system. Similarly, we
can define the logic of a class of matrices M\bM by taking
condition (*) as a definition of a consequence relation. In the entry
on
 many-valued logic
 the reader can find several logics defined in this way. 

Every logic (independently of how it is defined) has a matrix
semantics. Moreover, every logic has a matrix semantics whose elements
have the property of being reduced in the following sense: A matrix
⟨A,D⟩\langle \bA, D \rangle is reduced if there are no two
different elements of AA that behave in the same way. We say that
a,b∈Aa, b \in A behave in the same way in ⟨A,D⟩\langle \bA, D
\rangle if for every formula ϕ(q,p1,…,pn)\phi (q, p_1 , \ldots ,p_n) and all
elements d1,…,dn∈Ad_1 , \ldots ,d_n \in A
ϕA[a,d1,…,dn]∈D iff ϕA[b,d1,…,dn]∈D.\phi^{\bA }[a, d_1 , \ldots ,d_n] \in D \txtiff  \phi^{\bA }[b, d_1 , \ldots ,d_n] \in D.

 Thus a,b∈Aa, b \in A
behave differently if there is a formula ϕ(q,p1,…,pn)\phi(q, p_1 , \ldots
,p_n) and elements d1,…,dn∈Ad_1 , \ldots ,d_n \in A such that one of
ϕA[a,d1,…,dn]\phi^{\bA }[a, d_1 , \ldots ,d_n] and ϕA[b,d1,…,dn]\phi^{\bA }[b, d_1 ,
\ldots ,d_n] belongs to DD but not both. The relation of behaving
in the same way in ⟨A,D⟩\langle \bA, D \rangle is a congruence relation
of A\bA. This relation is known after Blok & Pigozzi 1986, 1989
as the Leibniz congruence of the matrix ⟨A,D⟩\langle \bA, D
\rangle and is denoted by ΩA(D)\bOmega_{\bA }(D). It can be
characterized as the greatest congruence relation of A\bA that is
compatible with DD, that is, that does not relate elements
in DD with elements not in DD. The concept of Leibniz congruence
plays a fundamental role in the general theory of the algebraization
of the logic systems developed during the 1980s by Blok and Pigozzi.
The reader is referred to Font, Jansana, & Pigozzi 2003 and
Czelakowski 2001 for extensive information on the developments around
the concept of Leibniz congruence during this period. 


Every matrix M\cM can be turned into a reduced matrix by
identifying the elements related by its Leibniz congruence. This
matrix is called the reduction of M\cM and is usually
denoted by M∗\cM^*. A matrix and its reduction are models of the
same logic systems, and since reduced matrices have no redundant
elements, the classes of reduced matrices that are matrix semantics
for logic systems are usually taken as the classes of matrices that
deserve study; they are better suited to encoding in algebraic-like
terms the properties of the logics that have them as their matrix
semantics. 

The proof that every logic system has a reduced matrix semantics
(i.e., a matrix semantics consisting of reduced matrices) is as
follows. Let L\bL be a logic system. Consider the matrices
⟨FmL,T⟩\langle \bFm_L, T \rangle over the formula algebra, where TT is
a theory of L\bL. These matrices are known as the Lindenbaum
matrices of L\bL. It is not difficult to see that the class of
those matrices is a matrix semantics for L\bL. Since a matrix and
its reduction are models of the same logics, the reductions of the
Lindenbaum matrices of L\bL constitute a matrix semantics for
L\bL too, and indeed a reduced one. Moreover, any class of reduced
matrix models of L\bL that includes the reduced Lindenbaum matrices
of L\bL is automatically a complete matrix semantics for L\bL.
In particular, the class of all reduced matrix models of L\bL is a
complete matrix semantics for L\bL. We denote this class by
RMatr(L)\bRMatr(\bL).

The above proof can be seen as a generalization of the
Lindenbaum-Tarski method for proving algebraic completeness theorems
that we will discuss in the next section.

The class of the algebras of the matrices in RMatr(L)\bRMatr(\bL) plays a
prominent role in the theory of the algebraization of logics and it is
denoted by Alg∗L\bAlg^*\bL. It has been considered for a long time the
natural class of algebras that has to be associated with a given logic
L\bL as its algebraic counterpart. For instance, in the examples
considered above, the classes of algebras that were given as algebraic
semantics of the different logics (Boolean algebras, Heyting algebras,
etc.) are exactly the class Alg∗L\bAlg^*\bL of the corresponding logic
L\bL. And in fact the class Alg∗L\bAlg^*\bL coincides with what was
taken to be the natural class of algebras for all the logics L\bL
studied up to the 1990s. In the 1990s, due to the knowledge acquired
of several logics not studied before, some authors proposed another
way to define the class of algebras that has to be counted as the
algebraic counterpart to be associated with a given logic L\bL. For
many logics L\bL it leads exactly to the class Alg∗L\bAlg^*\bL but
for others it gives a class that extends it properly. We will see it
in
 Section 8.
7. The Lindenbaum-Tarski method for proving algebraic completeness theorems

We now discuss the method that is most commonly used to prove that a
class of algebras K\bK is a δ(p)≈ε(p)\delta(p) \approx
\varepsilon(p)-algebraic semantics for a logic L\bL, namely the
Lindenbaum-Tarski method. It is the standard method used to prove that
the classes of algebras of the examples mentioned in
 Section 5
 are algebraic semantics for the corresponding logics.

The Lindenbaum-Tarski method contributed in two respects to the
elaboration of important notions in the theory of the algebraization
of logics. It underlies Blok and Pigozzi’s notion of
algebraizable logic and reflecting on it some ways to define for each
logic a class of algebras can be justified as providing a natural
class. We will consider this issue in
 Section 8.

The Lindenbaum-Tarski method can be outlined as follows. To prove that
a class of algebras K\bK is a δ(p)≈ε(p)\delta(p) \approx
\varepsilon(p)-algebraic semantics for a logic L\bL first it is
shown that K\bK gives a sound δ(p)≈ε(p)\delta(p) \approx
\varepsilon(p)-semantics for L\bL, namely that if Γ⊢Lϕ\Gamma
\vdash_{\bL } \phi, then for every A∈K\bA \in \bK and every
valuation vv in A\bA if the values of the formulas in Γ\Gamma
satisfy δ(p)≈ε(p)\delta(p) \approx \varepsilon(p), then the value of
ϕ\phi does too. Secondly, the other direction, that is, the
completeness part, is proved by what is properly known as the
Lindenbaum-Tarski method. This method uses the theories of L\bL to
obtain matrices on the algebra of formulas and then reduces these
matrices in order to get for each one, a matrix whose algebra is in
K\bK and whose set of designated elements is the set of elements of
the algebra that satisfy δ(p)≈ε(p)\delta(p) \approx \varepsilon(p). We
proceed to describe the method step by step. 

Let L\bL be one of the logics discussed in the examples in
 Section 5.
 Let K\bK be the corresponding class of algebras we considered
there and let δ(p)≈ε(p)\delta(p) \approx \varepsilon(p) be the equation in
one variable involved in the soundness and completeness theorem. To
prove the completeness theorem one proceeds as follows. Given any set
of formulas Γ\Gamma:

The theory CL(Γ)={ϕ:Γ⊢Lϕ}C_{\bL }(\Gamma) = \{\phi : \Gamma
\vdash_{\bL } \phi \} of Γ\Gamma, which we denote by TT, is
considered and the binary relation θ(T)\theta(T) on the set of
formulas is defined using the formula p↔qp \leftrightarrow q as
follows: 

⟨ϕ,ψ⟩∈θ(T) iff ϕ↔ψ∈T.\langle \phi , \psi \rangle \in \theta(T) \txtiff   \phi \leftrightarrow \psi \in T.

It is shown that θ(T)\theta(T) is a congruence relation
on FmL\bFm_L. The set [ϕ][\phi] of the formulas related to the
formula ϕ\phi by θ(T)\theta(T) is called the equivalence class of ϕ\phi.
A new matrix ⟨Fm/θ(T),T/θ(T)⟩\langle \bFm/\theta(T), T/\theta(T)
\rangle is obtained by identifying the formulas related by
θ(T)\theta(T), that is, Fm/θ(T)\bFm/\theta(T) is the quotient algebra of
Fm\bFm modulo θ(T)\theta(T) and T/θ(T)T/\theta(T) is the set of
equivalence classes of the elements of TT. Recall that the
algebraic operations of the quotient algebra are defined by:

∗Fm/θ(T)([ϕ1],…,[ϕn])=[∗ϕ1…ϕn]†Fm/θ(T)=[†]* ^{\bFm/\theta(T) }([\phi_1],\ldots ,[\phi_n]) = [* \phi_1 \ldots \phi_n ] \dagger^{\bFm/\theta(T) } = [\dagger]

It is shown that θ(T)\theta(T) is a relation compatible
with TT, i.e., that if ⟨ϕ,ψ⟩∈θ(T)\langle \phi , \psi \rangle \in
\theta(T) and ϕ∈T\phi \in T, then ψ∈T\psi \in T. This implies that

ϕ∈T iff [ϕ]⊆T iff [ϕ]∈T/θ(T).\phi \in T \txtiff [\phi] \subseteq T \txtiff [\phi] \in T/\theta(T).

It is proved that the matrix ⟨Fm/θ(T),T/θ(T)⟩\langle \bFm/\theta(T),
T/\theta(T) \rangle is reduced, that Fm/θ(T)\bFm/\theta(T) belongs to
K\bK and that T/θ(T)T/\theta(T) is the set of elements of
Fm/θ(T)\bFm/\theta(T) that satisfy the equation δ(p)≈ε(p)\delta(p) \approx
\varepsilon(p) in Fm/θ(T)\bFm/\theta(T). 


The proof of the completeness theorem then goes as follows.
 (4)
 and
 (5)
 imply that for every formula ψ,Γ⊢Lψ\psi , \Gamma \vdash_{\bL } \psi if
and only if [ψ][\psi] satisfies the equation δ(p)≈ε(p)\delta(p) \approx
\varepsilon(p) in the algebra Fm/θ(T)\bFm/\theta(T). Thus, considering
the valuation idid mapping every variable pp to its equivalence
class [p][p], and whose extension id\boldsymbol{id} to the set of
all formulas is such that id(ϕ)=[ϕ]\boldsymbol{id}(\phi) = [\phi] for every
formula ϕ\phi, we have for every formula ψ\psi,


Γ⊢Lψ iff id(ψ)\Gamma \vdash_{\bL } \psi\txtiff\boldsymbol{id}(\psi) satisfies
the equation δ(p)≈ε(p)\delta(p) \approx \varepsilon(p) in
Fm/θ(T)\bFm/\theta(T).


Hence, since by
 (5)
Fm/θ(T)∈K\bFm/\theta(T) \in \bK, it follows that if Γ⊬Lϕ\Gamma
\not\vdash_{\bL }\phi, then there is an algebra A\bA (namely
Fm/θ(T))\bFm/\theta(T)) and a valuation vv (namely id)id) such that
the elements of v[Γ]\bv[\Gamma] satisfy the equation on A\bA but
v(ϕ)\bv(\phi) does not.

The Lindenbaum-Tarski method, when successful, shows that the class of
algebras {Fm/θ(T):T\{\bFm/\theta(T): T is a theory of L}\bL\} is a
δ(p)≈ε(p)\delta(p) \approx \varepsilon(p)-algebraic semantics for L\bL.
Therefore it also shows that every class of algebras K\bK which is
δ(p)≈ε(p)\delta(p) \approx \varepsilon(p)-sound for L\bL and includes
{Fm/θ(T):T\{\bFm/\theta(T): T is a theory of L}\bL\} is also a δ(p)≈ε(p)\delta(p)
\approx \varepsilon(p)-algebraic semantics for L\bL.

Let us make some remarks on the Lindenbaum-Tarski method just
described. The first is important for the generalizations leading to
the classes of algebras associated with a logic. The other to obtain
the conditions in the definition of the concept of algebraizable
logic.

Conditions
 (4)
 and
 (5)
 imply that θ(T)\theta(T) is in fact the Leibniz congruence of
⟨FmL,T⟩\langle \bFm_L, T \rangle.
When the Lindenbaum-Tarski method succeeds, it usually holds that
in every algebra A∈K\bA \in \bK, the relation defined by the equation

δ(p↔q)≈ε(p↔q),\delta(p \leftrightarrow q) \approx \varepsilon(p \leftrightarrow q),

 which is the result of replacing in δ(p)≈ε(p)\delta(p) \approx
\varepsilon(p) the letter pp by the formula p↔qp \leftrightarrow
q that defines the congruence relation of a theory, is the identity
relation on AA. 
 For every formula ϕ\phi, the formulas δ(p/ϕ)↔ε(p/ϕ)\delta(p/\phi)
\leftrightarrow \varepsilon(p/\phi) and ϕ\phi are interderivable
in L\bL (i.e., ϕ⊢Lδ(p/ϕ)↔ε(p/ϕ)\phi \vdash_{\bL } \delta(p/\phi) \leftrightarrow
\varepsilon(p/\phi) and δ(p/ϕ)↔ε(p/ϕ)⊢Lϕ)\delta(p/\phi) \leftrightarrow
\varepsilon(p/\phi) \vdash_{\bL } \phi).


The concept of algebraizable logic introduced by Blok and Pigozzi,
which we will discuss in
 Section 9,
 can be described roughly by saying that a logic L\bL is
algebraizable if it has an algebraic semantics (K,Eq)(\bK, \iEq) such
that (1) K\bK is included in the natural class of algebras
Alg∗L\bAlg^*\bL associated with L\bL and (2) the fact that (K,Eq)(\bK,
\iEq) is an algebraic semantics can be proved by using the
Lindenbaum-Tarski method slightly generalized. 
8. The natural class of algebras of a logic system

We shall now discuss the two definitions that have been considered as
providing natural classes of algebras associated with a logic L\bL.
Both definitions can be seen as arising from an abstraction of the
Lindenbaum-Tarski method and we follow this path in introducing them.
The common feature of these abstractions is that in them the specific
way in which the relation θ(T)\theta(T) is defined in the
Lindenbaum-Tarski method is disregarded. 

It has to be remarked that, nonetheless, for many logics both
definitions lead to the same class. But the classes obtained from both
definitions have been considered in the algebraic studies of many
particular logics (for some logics one, for others the other) the
natural class that deserves to be studied. 

We already encountered the first generalization in
 Section 6
 when we showed that every logic has a reduced matrix semantics. It
leads to the class of algebras Alg∗L\bAlg^*\bL; that its definition is
a generalization of the Lindenbaum-Tarski method comes from the
realization that the relation θ(T)\theta(T), associated with an L\bL-theory, defined in the different
completeness proofs in the literature that use the Lindenbaum-Tarski
method is in fact the Leibniz congruence of the matrix ⟨FmL,T⟩\langle
\bFm_L, T \rangle and that therefore the matrix ⟨Fm/θ(T),T/θ(T)⟩\langle
\bFm/\theta(T), T/\theta(T) \rangle is its reduction. As we
mentioned in
 Section 6,
 for every logic L\bL every L\bL-sound class of matrices M\bM
that contains all the matrices ⟨Fm/ΩFmL(T),T/ΩFmL(T)⟩\langle \bFm/\bOmega_{\bFm_L }(T), T/
\bOmega_{\bFm_L }(T) \rangle, where TT is a theory of L\bL, is
a complete reduced matrix semantics for L\bL. From this perspective
the notion of the Leibniz congruence of a matrix can be taken as a
generalization to arbitrary matrices of the idea that comes from the
Lindenbaum-Tarski procedure of proving completeness. Following this
course of reasoning the class Alg∗L\bAlg^*\bL of the algebras of the
reduced matrix models of a logic L\bL is the natural class of
algebras to associate with L\bL. It is the class

{A/ΩA(F):A\{\bA/\bOmega_{\bA }(F): \bA is an L\bL-algebra and FF is a
L\bL-filter of A}\bA\}.

The second way of generalizing the Lindenbaum-Tarski method uses
another fact, namely that in the examples discussed in
 Section 3
 the relation θ(T)\theta(T) is also the relation
Ω∼FmL(T)\Omega^{\sim}_{\bFm_L }(T) defined by the condition 
⟨ϕ,ψ⟩∈Ω∼FmL(T) iff ∀T′∈Th(L),∀p∈V,∀γ(p)∈FmL(T⊆T′⇒(γ(p/ϕ)∈T′⇔γ(p/ψ)∈T′)).\begin{align*}
\langle \phi , \psi \rangle \in \bOmega^{\sim}_{\bFm_L }(T)\txtiff &amp; \forall T' \in \tTH(\bL),\\
&amp; \forall p \in V, \\
&amp;\forall \gamma(p) \in \bFm_L (T \subseteq T' \Rightarrow (\gamma(p/\phi) \in T' \Leftrightarrow \gamma(p/\psi) \in T')).
\end{align*}

For every logic L\bL and every L\bL-theory TT the relation
Ω∼FmL(T)\bOmega^{\sim}_{\bFm_L }(T) defined in this way is the greatest
congruence compatible with all the L\bL-theories that extend TT.
Therefore it holds that 

Ω∼FmL(T)=⋂T′∈Th(L)TΩFmL(T′)\bOmega^{\sim}_{\bFm_L }(T) = \bigcap_{T' \in \tTH(\bL)^T} \bOmega_{\bFm_L }(T')

 where Th(L)T={T′∈Th(L):T⊆T′}\tTH(\bL)^T = \{T' \in
\tTH(\bL): T \subseteq T'\}. The relation Ω∼FmL(T)\bOmega^{\sim}_{\bFm_L
}(T) is known as the Suszko congruence of TT (w.r.t.
L)\bL). Suszko defined it—in an equivalent way—in
1977.


For every logic L\bL, the notion of the Suszko congruence can be
extended to its matrix models. The Suszko congruence of a
matrix model ⟨A,D⟩\langle \bA, D \rangle of L\bL (w.r.t. L)\bL) is
the greatest congruence of A\bA compatible with every
L\bL-filter of A\bA that includes DD, that is, it is the
relation given by 

Ω∼AL(D)=⋂D′∈FiL(A)DΩA(D′){\bOmega^{\sim}_{\bA}}^{\bL}(D)  = \bigcap_{D' \in \tFi_{\bL}(\bA)^D} \bOmega_{\bA}(D')

 where FiL(A)D={D′:D′\tFi_{\bL}(\bA)^D = \{D': D'
is a L\bL-filter of A\bA and D⊆D′}D \subseteq D'\}. Notice that
unlike the intrinsic notion of Leibniz congruence, the Suszko
congruence of a matrix model of L\bL is not intrinsic to the
matrix: it depends in an essential way on the logic under
consideration. The theory of the Suszko congruence of matrices has
been developed in Czelakowski 2003 and recently in Albuquerque &
Font & Jansana 2016. 


In the same manner that the concept of Leibniz congruence leads to the
concept of reduced matrix, the notion of Suszko congruence leads to
the notion of Suszko-reduced matrix. A matrix model of L\bL is
Suszko-reduced if its Suszko congruence is the identity. Then
the class of algebras of the Suszko-reduced matrix models of a logic
L\bL is another class of algebras that is taken as a natural class
of algebras to associate with L\bL. It is the class of algebras


AlgL={A/Ω∼AL(F):A\bAlg\bL = \{\bA / {\bOmega^{\sim}_{\bA}}^{\bL}(F): \bA is an
L\bL-algebra and FF is a L\bL-filter of A}\bA\}.

This class of algebras is nowadays taken in abstract algebraic logic
as the natural class to be associated with L\bL and it
called its algebraic counterpart.

For an arbitrary logic L\bL the relation between the classes
AlgL\bAlg\bL and Alg∗L\bAlg^*\bL is that AlgL\bAlg\bL is the closure of
Alg∗L\bAlg^*\bL under subdirect products, in particular Alg∗L⊆AlgL\bAlg^*\bL
\subseteq \bAlg\bL. In general, both classes may be different. For
example, if L\bL is the (∧,∨)(\wedge , \vee)-fragment of classical
propositional logic, AlgL\bAlg\bL is the variety of distributive
lattices (the class that has been always taken to be the natural class
of algebras associated with L)\bL) while Alg∗L\bAlg^*\bL is not this
class—in fact it is not  a quasivariety. Nonetheless, for
many logics L\bL, in particular for the algebraizable and the
protoalgebraic ones to be discussed in the next sections, and also
when Alg∗L\bAlg^*\bL is a variety, the classes AlgL\bAlg\bL and
Alg∗L\bAlg^*\bL are equal. This fact can explain why in the 1980s,
before the algebraic study of non-protoalgebraic logics was considered
worth pursuing, the conceptual difference between both definitions of
the natural class of algebras of a logic was not needed and
accordingly it was not considered (or even discovered). 
9. When a logic is algebraizable and what does this mean?

The algebraizable logics are purported to be the logics with the
strongest possible link with their algebraic counterpart. This
requirement demands that the algebraic counterpart of the logic should
be an algebraic semantics but requires a more robust connection
between the logic and the algebraic counterpart than that. This more
robust connection is present in the best behaved particular logics
known. The mathematically precise concept of algebraizable logic
characterizes this type of link. Blok and Pigozzi introduced that
fundamental concept in Blok & Pigozzi 1989 and its introduction
can be considered the starting point of the unification and growth of
the field of abstract algebraic logic in the 1980s. Blok and Pigozzi
defined the notion of algebraizable logic only for finitary logics.
Later Czelakowski and Herrmann generalized it to arbitrary logics and
also weakened some conditions in the definition. We present here the
generalized concept. 

We said in
 Section 7
 that, roughly speaking, a logic L\bL is algebraizable when 1) it
has an algebraic semantics, i.e., a class of algebras K\bK and a
set of equations Eq(p)\iEq(p) such that K\bK is a Eq\iEq-algebraic
semantics for L,2)\bL, 2) this fact can be proved by using the
Lindenbaum-Tarski method slightly generalized and, moreover, 3) K⊆Alg∗L\bK
\subseteq \bAlg^*\bL. The generalization of the Lindenbaum-Tarski
method (as we described it in
 Section 7)
 consists in allowing in step (5) (as already done in the definition of algebraic
semantics) a set of equations Eq(p)\iEq(p) in one variable instead of a
single equation δ(p)≈ε(p)\delta(p) \approx \varepsilon(p) and in allowing
in a similar manner a set of formulas Δ(p,q)\Delta(p, q) in at most two
variables to play the role of the formula p↔qp \leftrightarrow q in
the definition of the congruence of a theory. Then, given a theory
TT, the relation θ(T)\theta(T), which has to be the greatest
congruence on the formula algebra compatible with TT (i.e., the
Leibniz congruence of T)T), is defined by
⟨ϕ,ψ⟩∈θ(T) iff Δ(p/ϕ,q/ψ)⊆T.\langle \phi , \psi \rangle \in \theta(T) \txtiff  \Delta(p/\phi , q/\psi) \subseteq T.

We need some notational conventions before engaging in the precise
definition of algebraizable logic. Given a set of equations
Eq(p)\iEq(p) in one variable and a formula ϕ\phi, let Eq(ϕ)\iEq(\phi)
be the set of equations obtained by replacing in all the equations in
Eq\iEq the variable pp by ϕ\phi. If Γ\Gamma is a set of
formulas, let
Eq(Γ):=⋃ϕ∈ΓEq(ϕ).\iEq(\Gamma) := \bigcup_{\phi \in \Gamma}\iEq(\phi).

Similarly, given a set of formulas in two variables Δ(p,q)\Delta(p, q)
and an equation δ≈ε\delta \approx \varepsilon, let Δ(δ,ε)\Delta(\delta ,
\varepsilon) denote the set of formulas obtained by replacing pp
by δ\delta and qq by ε\varepsilon in all the formulas in
Δ\Delta. Moreover, if Eq\iEq is a set of equations, let
Δ(Eq)=⋃δ≈ε∈EqΔ(δ,ε).\Delta(\iEq) = \bigcup_{\delta \approx \varepsilon \in \iEq} \Delta(\delta , \varepsilon).

Given a set of equations Eq(p,q)\iEq(p, q) in two variables, this set
defines on every algebra A\bA a binary relation, namely the set of
pairs ⟨a,b⟩\langle a, b\rangle of elements of AA that satisfy in
A\bA all the equations in Eq(p,q)\iEq(p, q). In standard
model-theoretic notation, this set is the relation
{⟨a,b⟩:a,b∈A and A⊨Eq(p,q)[a,b]}.\{\langle a, b \rangle : a, b \in A \textrm{ and } \bA \vDash \iEq(p, q)[a, b]\}.

The formal definition of algebraizable logic is as follows. A logic
L\bL is algebraizable if there is a class of algebras
K\bK, a set of equations Eq(p)\iEq(p) in one variable and a set of
formulas Δ(p,q)\Delta(p, q) in two variables such that

K\bK is an Eq\iEq-algebraic semantics for
L\bL, namely



Γ⊢Lϕ iff \Gamma \vdash_{\bL } \phi\txtiff for every A∈K\bA \in \bK and
every valuation vv on A\bA, if v[Γ]⊆Eq(A)\bv[\Gamma] \subseteq
\tEq(\bA), then v(ϕ)∈Eq(A)\bv(\phi) \in \tEq(\bA).
 
For every A∈K\bA \in \bK, the relation defined by the
set of equations in two variables Eq(Δ(p,q))\iEq(\Delta(p, q)) is the
identity relation on AA.


A class of algebras K\bK for which there are sets Eq(p)\iEq(p) and
Δ(p,q)\Delta(p, q) with these two properties is said to be an
equivalent algebraic semantics for L\bL. The set of
formulas Δ\Delta is called a set of equivalence formulas
and the set of equations Eq\iEq a set of defining
equations.

The conditions of the definition imply:

pp is inter-derivable in L\bL with the set of
formulas Δ(Eq)\Delta(\iEq), that is 

 Δ(Eq)⊢Lp and p⊢LΔ(Eq).\Delta(\iEq) \vdash_{\bL } p \textrm{ and }  p \vdash_{\bL } \Delta(\iEq).

For every L\bL-theory TT, the Leibniz congruence
of ⟨FmL,T⟩\langle \bFm_L, T\rangle is the relation defined by Δ(p,q)\Delta(p,
q), namely 

⟨ϕ,ψ⟩∈ΩFm(T) iff Δ(p/ϕ,q/ψ)⊆T.\langle \phi , \psi \rangle \in \bOmega_{\bFm }(T)\txtiff\Delta(p/\phi , q/\psi) \subseteq T.

If Δ\Delta and Δ′\Delta ' are two sets of
equivalence formulas, Δ⊢LΔ′\Delta \vdash_{\bL } \Delta ' and Δ′⊢LΔ\Delta '
\vdash_{\bL } \Delta. Similarly, if Eq(p)\iEq(p) and Eq′(p)\iEq'(p) are
two sets of defining equations, for every algebra A∈K,Eq(A)=Eq′(A)\bA \in \bK,
\iEq(\bA) = \iEq'(\bA).
The class of algebras Alg∗L\bAlg^*\bL also satisfies
conditions
 (1)
 and
 (2),
 and hence it is an equivalent algebraic semantics for L\bL.
Moreover, it includes every other class of algebras that is an
equivalent algebraic semantics for L\bL. Accordingly, it is called
the greatest equivalent algebraic semantics of L\bL.
For every A∈Alg∗L\bA \in \bAlg^*\bL there is exactly one
L\bL-filter FF such that the matrix ⟨A,F⟩\langle \bA, F\rangle is
reduced, and this filter is the set Eq(A)\iEq(\bA). Or, to put it in
other terms, the class of reduced matrix models of L\bL is
{⟨A,Eq(A)⟩:A∈Alg∗L}\{\langle \bA, \iEq(\bA) \rangle : \bA \in \bAlg^*\bL\}.
Alg∗L\bAlg^*\bL is an SP-class and includes any class
of algebras K\bK which is an equivalent algebraic semantics for
L\bL. The class Alg∗L\bAlg^*\bL is then the greatest equivalent
algebraic semantics for L\bL and thus it deserves to be called
the equivalent algebraic semantics of L\bL. 


Blok and Pigozzi’s definition of algebraizable logic in Blok
& Pigozzi 1989 was given only for finitary logics and, moreover,
they imposed that the sets of defining equations and of equivalence
formulas should be finite. Today we say that an algebraizable logic is
finitely algebraizable if the sets of equivalence formulas
Δ\Delta and of defining equations Eq\iEq can both be taken
finite. And we say that a logic is Blok-Pigozzi algebraizable
(BP-algebraizable) if it is finitary and finitely algebraizable. 

If L\bL is finitary and finitely algebraizable, then Alg∗L\bAlg^*\bL
is not only an SP-class, but a quasivariety and it is the quasivariety
generated by any class of algebras K\bK which is an equivalent
algebraic semantics for L\bL.

We have just seen that in algebraizable logics the class of algebras
Alg∗L\bAlg^*\bL plays a prominent role. Moreover, in these logics the
classes of algebras obtained by the two ways of generalizing the
Lindenbaum-Tarski method coincide, that is, Alg∗L=AlgL\bAlg^*\bL =
\bAlg\bL—this is due to the fact that for any algebraizable
logic L,Alg∗L\bL, \bAlg^*\bL is closed under subdirect products. Hence
for every algebraizable logic L\bL its algebraic counterpart
AlgL\bAlg\bL is its greatest equivalent algebraic semantics, whatever
perspective is taken on the generalization of the Lindenbaum-Tarski
method.

Conditions
 (1)
 and
 (2)
 of the definition of algebraizable logic (instantiated to Alg∗L\bAlg^*\bL) encode the fact that there
is a very strong link between an algebraizable logic L\bL and its
class of algebras AlgL\bAlg\bL, so that this class of algebras
reflects the metalogical properties of L\bL by algebraic properties
of AlgL\bAlg\bL and conversely.

The definition of algebraizable logic can be stated in terms of
translations between the logic and an equational consequence relation
⊨K\vDash_{\bK} associated with any equivalent algebraic semantics
K\bK for it—which is the same relation no matter what equivalent
algebraic semantics we choose.

The equational consequence ⊨K\vDash_{\bK} of a class of algebras
K\bK is defined as follows. 


{ϕi≈ψi:i∈I}⊨Kϕ≈ψ iff \{\phi_i \approx \psi_i: i \in I\} \vDash_{\bK } \phi \approx
\psi\txtiff for every A∈K\bA \in \bK and every valuation vv on
A\bA, if v(ϕi)=v(ψi)\bv(\phi_i) = \bv(\psi_i), for all i∈Ii \in I, then
v(ϕ)=v(ψ)\bv(\phi) = \bv(\psi).


The translations needed are given by the set of defining equations and
the set of equivalence formulas. A set of equations Eq(p)\iEq(p) in one
variable defines a translation from formulas to sets of
equations: each formula is translated into the set of equations
Eq(ϕ)\iEq(\phi). Similarly, a set of formulas Δ(p,q)\Delta(p, q) in two
variables defines a translation from equations to sets of
formulas: each equation ϕ≈ψ\phi \approx \psi is translated into
the set of formulas Δ(ϕ,ψ)\Delta(\phi , \psi). 

Condition
 (1)
 in the definition of algebraizable logic can be reformulated as

Γ⊢Lϕ iff Eq(Γ)⊨KEq(ϕ)\Gamma \vdash_{\bL } \phi\txtiff \iEq(\Gamma) \vDash_{\bK } \iEq(\phi)

 and condition
 (2)
 as 

p≈q⊨KEq(Δ(p,q)) and Eq(Δ(p,q))⊨Kp≈q.p \approx q \vDash_{\bK } \iEq(\Delta(p, q)) \textrm{ and }  \iEq(\Delta(p, q)) \vDash_{\bK } p \approx q.

These two conditions imply

{ϕi≈ψi:i∈I}⊨Kϕ≈ψ iff Δ({ϕi≈ψi:i∈I})⊢LΔ(ϕ,ψ)\{\phi_i \approx \psi_i : i \in I \} \vDash_{\bK }
\phi \approx \psi\txtiff\Delta(\{\phi_i \approx \psi_i : i \in I\})
\vdash_{\bL } \Delta(\phi , \psi)


and condition
 (3)
 above is
p⊢LΔ(Eq(p)) and Δ(Eq(p))⊢Lp.p \vdash_{\bL } \Delta(\iEq(p)) \textrm{ and }  \Delta(\iEq(p)) \vdash_{\bL } p.

Thus an algebraizable logic L\bL is faithfully interpreted in the
equational logic of its equivalent algebraic semantics (condition
 (2))
 by means of the translation of formulas into sets of equations given
by a set of defining equations, and the equational logic of its
equivalent algebraic semantics is faithfully interpreted in the logic
L\bL (condition
 (9))
 by means of the translation of equations into sets of formulas given
by an equivalence set of formulas. Moreover, both translations are
inverses of each other (conditions
 (2)
 and
 (3))
 modulo logical equivalence. In this way we see that the link between
L\bL and its greatest equivalent algebraic semantics is really very
strong and that the properties of L\bL should translate into
properties of the associated equational consequence relation. The
properties that this relation actually has depend on the properties of
the class of algebras AlgL\bAlg\bL.

Given an algebraic semantics (K,Eq)(\bK, \iEq) for a logic L\bL, a
way to stress the difference between it being merely an algebraic
semantics and being an algebraic semantics that makes L\bL
algebraizable is that the translation of formulas into equations given
by the set of equations Eq\iEq is invertible in the sense that there
is a translation, say Δ\Delta, of equations into formulas given by
a set of formulas in two variables that satisfies condition
 (9)
 above, and such that Eq\iEq and Δ\Delta provide mutually
inverses translations (i.e., conditions
 (2)
 and
 (3)
 hold). 

The link between an algebraizable logic L\bL and its greatest
equivalent algebraic semantics given by the set of defining equations
and the set of equivalence formulas allows us to prove a series of
general theorems that relate the properties of L\bL with the
properties of AlgL\bAlg\bL. We will mention as a sample only three of
them.

The first concerns the deduction theorem. To prove a general theorem
relating the existence of a deduction theorem with an algebraic
property requires first that a concept of deduction theorem applicable
to any logic has to be defined. A logic L\bL has the
deduction-detachment property if there is a finite set of
formulas Σ(p,q)\Sigma(p, q) such that for every set of formulas
Γ\Gamma and all formulas ϕ,ψ\phi , \psi
Γ∪{ϕ}⊢Lψ iff Γ⊢LΣ(ϕ,ψ).\Gamma \cup \{\phi \} \vdash_{\bL } \psi\txtiff\Gamma \vdash_{\bL } \Sigma(\phi , \psi).

Note that this is a generalization of the standard deduction theorem
(the direction from left to right in the above expression) and Modus
Ponens (equivalent to the implication from right to left) that several
logics have for a connective →\rightarrow. In those cases
Σ(p,q)={p→q}\Sigma(p, q) = \{p \rightarrow q\}. 

Theorem 1.
A finitary and finitely algebraizable logic L\bL has the
deduction-detachment property if and only if the principal relative
congruences of the algebras in AlgL\bAlg\bL are equationally
definable.

The second theorem refers to Craig interpolation. Several notions of
interpolation are applicable to arbitrary logics. We consider only one
of them. A logic L\bL has the Craig interpolation property
for the consequence relation if whenever Γ⊢Lϕ\Gamma \vdash_{\bL } \phi
there is a finite set of formulas Γ\Gamma’ with variables
shared by ϕ\phi and the formulas in Γ\Gamma such that Γ⊢LΓ′\Gamma
\vdash_{\bL } \Gamma ' and Γ′⊢Lϕ\Gamma ' \vdash_{\bL } \phi.

Theorem 2.
Let L\bL be a finitary and finitely algebraizable logic with
the deduction-detachment property. Then L\bL has the Craig
interpolation property if and only if AlgL\bAlg\bL has the
amalgamation property. 

Finally, the third theorem concerns the Beth definability property.
The interested reader can find the definition in Font, Jansana &
Pigozzi 2003. It is too involved in the general setting we are in to
give it here. 

Theorem 3.
A finitary and finitely algebraizable logic has the Beth property
if and only if all the epimorphisms of the category with objects the
algebras in AlgL\bAlg\bL and morphisms the algebraic homomorphisms are
surjective homomorphisms.

Other results relating properties of an algebraizable logic with a
property of its natural class of algebras can be found in Raftery
2011, 2013. They concern respectively a generalization of the property
of having the deduction-detachment property and the property that
generalize the inconsistency lemmas of classical and intuitionistic
logic. Also an abstract notion of having a theorem like
Glivenko’s theorem relating classical and intuitionistic logic
has been proposed and related to an algebraic property in the case of
algebraizable logics in Torrens 2008. 

For several classes of algebras that are the equivalent algebraic
semantics of some algebraizable logic it has been known for a long
time that for every algebra in the class there is an isomorphism
between the lattice of congruences of the algebra and a lattice of
subsets of the algebra with important algebraic meaning. For example,
in Boolean algebras and Heyting algebras these subsets are the lattice
filters and in modal algebras they are the lattice filters that are
closed under the operation that interprets ◻\Box. In all those
cases, the sets are exactly the L\bL-filters of the corresponding
algebraizable logic L\bL.

Algebraizable logics can be characterized by the existence of this
kind of isomorphism between congruences and logic filters on the
algebras of their algebraic counterpart. To spell out this
characterization we need a couple of definitions. Let L\bL be a
logic. The Leibniz operator on an algebra A\bA (relative
to L)\bL) is the map from the L\bL-filters of A\bA to the set
of congruences of A\bA that sends every L\bL-filter DD of
A\bA to its Leibniz congruence ΩA(D)\bOmega_{\bA }(D). We say that
the Leibniz operator of a logic L\bL commutes with the inverses
of homomorphisms between algebras in a class K\bK if for every
homomorphism hh from an algebra A∈K\bA \in \bK to an algebra B∈K\bB
\in \bK and every L\bL-filter DD of B,h−1[ΩB(D)]=ΩA(h−1[D]\bB, h^{-1}[\bOmega_{\bB
}(D)] = \bOmega_{\bA }(h^{-1}[D]).

Theorem 4.
A logic L\bL is algebraizable if and only if for every algebra
A∈AlgL\bA \in \bAlg\bL the Leibniz operator commutes with the inverses
of homomorphisms between algebras in AlgL\bAlg\bL and is an isomorphism
between the set of all L\bL-filters of A\bA, ordered by
inclusion, and the set of congruences θ\theta of A\bA such that
A/θ∈AlgL\bA/\theta \in \bAlg\bL, ordered also by inclusion.

The theorem provides a logical explanation of the known isomorphisms
mentioned above and similar ones for other classes of algebras. For
example the isomorphism between the congruences and the normal
subgroups of a group can be explained by the existence of an
algebraizable logic L\bL of which the class of groups is its
greatest equivalent algebraic semantics and the normal subgroups of a
group are its L\bL-filters.

A different but related characterization of algebraizable logics is
this:

Theorem 5.
A logic L\bL is algebraizable if and only if on the algebra of
formulas FmL\bFm_L, the map that sends every theory TT to its
Leibniz congruence  commutes with the inverses
of homomorphisms from FmL\bFm_L to FmL\bFm_L and is  an isomorphismbetween the set
Th(L)\tTH(\bL) of theories of L\bL, ordered by inclusion, and the
set of congruences θ\theta of FmL\bFm_L such that FmL/θ∈AlgL\bFm_L /\theta
\in \bAlg\bL, also ordered by inclusion.
10. A classification of logics

Unfortunately not every logic is algebraizable. A typical example of a
non-algebraizable logic is the local consequence of the normal modal
logic KK. Let us discuss this example.

The local modal logic lK\blK and the corresponding global one
gK\bgk are not only different, but their metalogical properties
differ. For example lK\blK has the deduction-detachment property for
→\rightarrow:
Γ∪{ϕ}⊢lKψ iff Γ⊢lKϕ→ψ.\Gamma \cup \{\phi \} \vdash_{\blK } \psi\txtiff \Gamma \vdash_{\blK } \phi \rightarrow \psi.

But gK\bgk does not have the deduction-detachment property (at all).


The logic gK\bgk is algebraizable and lK\blK is not. The
equivalent algebraic semantics of gK\bgk is the variety MA\bMA of
modal algebras, the set of equivalence formulas is the set {p↔q}\{p
\leftrightarrow q\} and the set of defining equations is {p≈⊤}\{p
\approx \top \}. Interestingly, lK\blK and gK\bgk have the same
algebraic counterpart (i.e., AlglK=AlglK)\bAlg \blK = \bAlg \blK), namely, the
variety of modal algebras.

A lesson to draw from this example is that the algebraic counterpart
of a logic L\bL, i.e, the class of algebras AlgL\bAlg\bL, does not
necessarily fully encode the properties of L\bL. The class of modal
algebras encodes the properties of gK\bgk because this logic is
algebraizable and so the link between gK\bgk and AlggK\bAlg \bgk is
as strong as possible. But AlglK\bAlg \blK, the class of modal
algebras, cannot by itself completely encode the properties of
lK\blK.

What causes this difference between gK\bgk and lK\blK is that the
class of reduced matrix models of gK\bgk is 

{⟨A,{1A}⟩:A∈MA},\{\langle \bA, \{1^{\bA }\}\rangle : \bA \in \bMA\},

 but the
class of reduced matrix models of lK\blK properly includes this
class so that for some algebras A∈MA\bA \in \bMA, in addition to
{1A}\{1^{\bA }\} there is some other lK\blK-filter FF with
⟨A,F⟩\langle \bA, F \rangle reduced. This fact provides a way to show
that lK\blK can not be algebraizable by showing that the
lK\blK-filters of the reduced matrices are not equationally
definable from the algebras; if they where, then for every A∈AlglK\bA \in
\bAlg \blK there would exists exactly one lK\blK-filter FF of
A\bA such that ⟨A,F⟩\langle \bA, F \rangle is reduced.


Nonetheless, we can perform some of the steps of the Lindenbaum-Tarski
method in the logic lK\blK. We can define the Leibniz congruence of
every lK\blK-theory in a uniform way by using formulas in two
variables. But in this particular case the set of formulas has to be infinite.
Let Δ(p,q)={◻n(p↔q):n\Delta(p, q) = \{\Box^n (p \leftrightarrow q): n a natural
number}\}, where for every formula ϕ,◻0ϕ\phi , \Box^0\phi is
ϕ\phi and ◻nϕ\Box^n\phi for n>0n \gt 0 is the formula ϕ\phi
with a sequence of nn boxes in front (◻…n…◻ϕ)(\Box \ldots^n \ldots \Box
\phi). Then, for every lK\blK-theory TT the relation
θ(T)\theta(T) defined by
⟨ϕ,ψ⟩∈θ(T) iff {◻n(ϕ↔ψ):n a natural number}⊆T\langle \phi , \psi \rangle \in \theta(T)\txtiff \{\Box^n (\phi \leftrightarrow \psi): n \textrm{ a natural number}\} \subseteq T

is the Leibniz congruence of TT. In this case, it happens though
that there are two different lK\blK-theories with the same Leibniz
congruence, something that does not hold for gK\bgk.

The logics L\bL with the property that there is a set of formulas
(possibly infinite) Δ(p,q)\Delta(p, q) in two variables which defines in
every L\bL-theory TT its Leibniz congruence, that is, that for
all LL-formulas ϕ,ψ\phi , \psi it holds 

⟨ϕ,ψ⟩∈ΩFm(T) iff Δ(ϕ,ψ)⊆T\langle \phi , \psi \rangle \in \bOmega_{\bFm }(T)\txtiff \Delta(\phi , \psi) \subseteq T

 are known as
the equivalential logics. If Δ(p,q)\Delta(p, q) is finite, the
logic is said to be finitely equivalential. A set Δ(p,q)\Delta(p,
q) that defines in every L\bL-theory its Leibniz congruence is
called a set of equivalence formulas for L\bL. It is clear
that every algebraizable logic is equivalential and that every
finitely algebraizable logic is finitely equivalential.


The logic lK\blK is, according to the definition, equivalential, and
it can be shown that it is not finitely equivalential. The local modal
logic lS4 is an example of a non-algebraizable logic
that is finitely equivalential. A set of equivalence formulas for
lS4 is {◻(p↔q)}\{\Box(p\leftrightarrow q)\}.

A set of equivalence formulas for a logic L\bL should be considered
as a generalized biconditional, in the sense that collectively the
formulas in the set have the relevant properties of the biconditional,
for example of classical logic, that makes it suitable to define the
Leibniz congruences of its theories. This comes out very clearly from
the following syntactic characterization of the sets of equivalence
formulas.

Theorem 6.
A set Δ(p,q)\Delta(p, q) of LL-formulas is a set of equivalence
formulas for a logic L\bL if and only if


 (RΔ)(\tR_{\Delta})⊢LΔ(p,p)\vdash_{\bL
} \Delta(p, p)
(MPΔ)(\tMP_{\Delta})p,Δ(p,q)⊢Lq
p, \Delta(p, q) \vdash_{\bL } q
(SΔ)(\tS_{\Delta}) Δ(p,q)⊢LΔ(q,p)
\Delta(p, q) \vdash_{\bL } \Delta(q, p)
(TΔ)(\tT_{\Delta})Δ(p,q)∪Δ(q,r)⊢LΔ(p,r)
\Delta(p, q) \cup \Delta(q, r) \vdash_{\bL } \Delta(p,
r)
(ReΔ)(\tRe_{\Delta})Δ(p1,q1)∪…∪Δ(pn,qn)⊢LΔ(∗p1…pn,∗q1…qn)
\Delta(p_1, q_1) \cup \ldots \cup \Delta(p_n, q_n) \vdash_{\bL }
\Delta(* p_1 \ldots p_n, * q_1 \ldots q_n), for every connective
∗* of LL of arity nn greater that 0.



There is some redundancy in the theorem. Conditions
(SΔ)(\tS_{\Delta}) and (TΔ)(\tT_{\Delta}) follow from
(RΔ),(MPΔ)(\tR_{\Delta}),(\tMP_{\Delta}) and (ReΔ)(\tRe_{\Delta}).

Equivalential logics were first considered as a class of logics
deserving to be studied in Prucnal & Wroński 1974, and they
have been studied extensively in Czelakowski 1981; see also
Czelakowski 2001. 

We already mentioned that the algebraizable logics are equivalential.
The difference between an equivalential logic and an algebraizable one
can be seen in the following syntactic characterization of
algebraizable logics:

Theorem 7.
A logic L\bL is algebraizable if and only if there exists a
set Δ(p,q)\Delta(p, q) of LL-formulas and a set Eq(p)\iEq(p) of
LL-equations such that the conditions
(RΔ)(\tR_{\Delta})–(ReΔ)(\tRe_{\Delta}) above hold for
Δ(p,q)\Delta(p, q) and 

p⊢LΔ(Eq(p)) and Δ(Eq(p))⊢Lp.p \vdash_{\bL } \Delta(\iEq(p)) \textrm{ and }  \Delta(\iEq(p)) \vdash_{\bL } p.


The set Δ(p,q)\Delta(p, q) in the theorem is then an equivalence set of
formulas for and the set Eq(p)\iEq(p) a set of defining equations.

There are logics that are not equivalential but have the property of
having a set of formulas [p⇒q][p \Rightarrow q] which collectively
behave in a very weak sense as the implication →\rightarrow does in
many logics. Namely, it has the properties (RΔ)(\tR_{\Delta}) and
(MPΔ)(\tMP_{\Delta}) in the syntactic characterization of a set of
equivalence formulas, i.e., 

(R⇒)(\tR_{\Rightarrow}) ⊢L[p⇒p]\vdash_{\bL
} [p \Rightarrow p]
(MP⇒)(\tMP_{\Rightarrow})
p,[p⇒q]⊢Lqp, [p \Rightarrow q] \vdash_{\bL } q


If a logic is finitary and has a set of formulas with these
properties, there is always a finite subset with the same properties.
The logics with a set of formulas (finite or not) with properties
 (1)
 and
 (2)
 above are called protoalgebraic. in particular, every
equivalential logic and every algebraizable logic are protoalgebraic.


Protoalgebraic logics were first studied by Czelakowski, who called
them non-pathological, and a slightly later by Blok and Pigozzi in
Blok & Pigozzi 1986. The label ‘protoalgebraic logic’
is due to these last two authors. 

The class of protoalgebraic logics turned out to be the class of
logics for which the theory of logical matrices works really well in
the sense that many results of universal algebra have counterparts for
the classes of reduced matrix models of these logics and many methods
of universal algebra can be adapted to its study; consequently the
algebraic study of protoalgebraic logics using their matrix semantics
has been extensively and very fruitfully pursued. But, as we will see,
some interesting logics are not protoalgebraic. 

An important characterization of protoalgebraic logics is via the
behavior of the Leibniz operator. The following conditions are
equivalent:

L\bL is protoalgebraic. 
The Leibniz operator ΩFmL\bOmega_{\bFm_L} is monotone on the set
of L\bL-theories with respect to the inclusion relation, that is,
if T⊆T′T \subseteq T' are L\bL-theories, then ΩFmL(T)⊆ΩFmL(T′)\bOmega_{\bFm_L
}(T) \subseteq \bOmega_{\bFm_L }(T').
For every algebra A\bA, the Leibniz operator ΩA\bOmega_{\bA}
is monotone on the set of L\bL-filters of A\bA with respect to
the inclusion relation.


Due to the monotonicity property of the Leibniz operator, for any
protoalgebraic logic L\bL the class of algebras Alg∗L\bAlg^*\bL is
closed under subdirect products and therefore it is equal to
AlgL\bAlg\bL. Hence for protoalgebraic logics the two ways we
encountered to associate a class of algebras with a logic produce, as
we already mentioned, the same result.

There are also characterizations of equivalential and finitely
equivalential logics by the behavior of the Leibniz operator. The
reader is referred to Czelakowski 2001 and Font & Jansana &
Pigozzi 2003. 

In his Raftery 2006b, Raftery studies Condition 7 in the list of
properties of an algebraizable logic we gave just after the
definition. The condition says:


For every A∈Alg∗L\bA \in \bAlg^*\bL the class of reduced matrix models of
L\bL is {⟨A,Eq(A)⟩:A∈Alg∗L}\{\langle \bA, \iEq(\bA) \rangle : \bA \in
\bAlg^*\bL\}, where Eq(p)\iEq(p) is the set of defining equations for
L\bL.


The logics with a set of equations Eq(p)\iEq(p) with this property,
namely such that for every A∈Alg∗L\bA \in \bAlg^*\bL the class of reduced
matrix models of L\bL is {⟨A,Eq(A)⟩:A∈Alg∗L}\{\langle \bA, \iEq(\bA) \rangle : \bA
\in \bAlg^*\bL\}, are called truth-equational, a name
introduced in Raftery 2006b. Some truth-equational logics are
protoalgebraic but others are not. We will see later an example of the
last situation.

The protoalgebraic logics that are truth-equational are in fact the
weakly algebraizable logics studied already in Czelakowski
& Jansana 2000. Every algebraizable logic is weakly algebraizable.
In fact, the algebraizable logics are the equivalential logics that
are truth-equational. But not every weakly algebraizable logic is
equivalential. An example is the quantum logic determined by the
ortolattices, namely by the class of the matrices ⟨A,{1}⟩\langle \bA, \{1\}
\rangle where A\bA is an ortolattice and 1 is its greatest
element (see Czelakowski & Jansana 2000 and Malinowski 1990).

The classes of logics we have considered so far are the main classes
in what has come to be known as the Leibniz hierarchy because
its members are classes of logics that can be characterized by the
behavior of the Leibniz operator. We described only the most important
classes of logics in the hierarchy. The reader is referred to
Czelakowski 2001, Font 2016b, Font, Jansana & Pigozzi 2003, and
Font 2016b for more information. In particular, Czelakowski 2001
gathers extensively the information on the different classes of the
Leibniz hierarchy known at the time of its publication. The relations
between the classes of the Leibniz hierarchy considered in this entry
are summarized in the following diagram:



Figure. The Leibniz Hierarchy


Recently the Leibniz hierarchy has been refined in Cintula &
Noguera 2010, 2016. The idea is to consider instead of sets of
equivalence formulas Δ\Delta (that correspond to the biconditional)
sets of formulas [p⇒q][p\Rightarrow q] with properties of the
conditional (→)(\rightarrow), among which (R⇒)(R_{\Rightarrow}) and
(MP⇒)(MP_{\Rightarrow}), and such that the set [p⇒q]∪[p⇒q][p\Rightarrow q]
\cup[p\Rightarrow q] is a set of equivalence formulas. New classes
arise when the set [p⇒q][p\Rightarrow q] has a single element.
11. Replacement principles

Two classes of logics that are not classes of the Leibniz hierarchy
have been extensively studied in abstract algebraic logic. They are
defined from a completely different perspective from the one provided
by the behavior of the Leibniz operator, namely from the perspective
given by the replacement principles a logic might enjoy. 

The strongest replacement principle that a logic system L\bL might
have, shared for example by classical logic, intuitionistic logic and
all its axiomatic extensions, says that for any set of formulas
Γ\Gamma, any formulas ϕ,ψ,δ\phi , \psi , \delta and any variable
pp


if Γ,ϕ⊢Lψ\Gamma , \phi \vdash_{\bL } \psi and Γ,ψ⊢Lϕ\Gamma , \psi
\vdash_{\bL } \phi, then Γ,δ(p/ϕ)⊢Lδ(p/ψ)\Gamma , \delta(p/\phi) \vdash_{\bL }
\delta(p/\psi) and Γ,δ(p/ψ)⊢Lδ(p/ϕ)\Gamma , \delta(p/\psi) \vdash_{\bL }
\delta(p/\phi),


where δ(p/ϕ)\delta(p/\phi) and δ(p/ψ)\delta(p/\psi) are the formulas
obtained by substituting respectively ϕ\phi and ψ\psi for pp
in δ\delta. This replacement property is taken by some authors as
the formal counterpart of Frege’s principle of compositionality
for truth. Logics satisfying this strong replacement property are
called Fregean in Font& Jansana 1996 and are thoroughly studied in
Czelakowski & Pigozzi 2004a, 2004b.

Many important logics do not satisfy the strong replacement property,
for instance almost all the logics (local or global) of the modal
family, but some, like the local consequence relation of a normal
modal logic, satisfy a weaker replacement principle: for all formulas
ϕ,ψ,δ\phi , \psi , \delta,


if ϕ⊢Lψ\phi \vdash_{\bL }\psi and ψ⊢Lϕ\psi \vdash_{\bL }\phi, then
δ(p/ϕ)⊢Lδ(p/ψ)\delta(p/\phi) \vdash_{\bL } \delta(p/\psi) and δ(p/ψ)⊢Lδ(p/ϕ)\delta(p/\psi)
\vdash_{\bL } \delta(p/\phi).


A logic satisfying this weaker replacement property is called
selfextensional by Wójcicki (e.g., in Wójcicki
1969, 1988) and congruential in Humberstone 2005. We will use
the first terminology because it seems more common—at least in
the abstract algebraic logic literature. 

Selfextensional logics have a very good behavior from several points
of view. Their systematic study started in Wójcicki 1969 and
has recently been continued in the context of abstract algebraic logic
in Font & Jansana 1996; Jansana 2005, 2006; and Jansana &
Palmigiano 2006.

There are selfextensional and non-selfextensional logics in any one of
the classes of the Leibniz hierarchy and also in the class of
non-protoalgebraic logics. These facts show that the perspective that
leads to the consideration of the classes in the Leibniz hierarchy and
the perspective that leads to the definition of the selfextensional
and the Fregean logics as classes of logics worthy of study as a whole
are to a large extent different. Nonetheless, one of the trends of
today’s research in abstract algebraic logic is to determine the
interplay between the two perspectives and study the classes of logics
that arise when crossing both classifications. In fact, there is a
connection between the replacement principles and the Suszko
congruence (and thus with the Leibniz congruence). A logic L\bL
satisfies the strong replacement principle if and only if for every
L\bL-theory TT its Suszko congruence is the interderivability
relation relative to TT, namely the relation {⟨ϕ,ψ⟩:T,ϕ⊢Lψ\{\langle \phi ,
\psi \rangle : T, \phi \vdash_{\bL } \psi and T,ψ⊢Lϕ}T, \psi \vdash_{\bL
} \phi \}. And a logic L\bL satisfies the weak replacement
principle if and only if the Suszko congruence of the set of theorems
of L\bL is the interderivability relation {⟨ϕ,ψ⟩:ϕ⊢Lψ\{\langle \phi , \psi
\rangle : \phi \vdash_{\bL } \psi and ψ⊢Lϕ}\psi \vdash_{\bL } \phi
\}.
12. Beyond protoalgebraic logics

Not all interesting logics are protoalgebraic. In this section we will
briefly discuss four examples of non-protoalgebraic logics: the logic
of conjunction and disjunction, positive modal logic, the strict
implication fragment of lK\blK and Visser’s subintuitionistic
logic. All of them are selfextensional. In the next section, we will
expound the semantics of abstract logics and generalized matrices that
serves to develop a really general theory of the algebraization of
logic systems. As we will see, the perspective changes in an important
respect from the perspective taken in logical matrix model theory.
12.1 The logic of conjunction and disjunction

This logic is the {∧,∨,⊥,⊤}\{\wedge , \vee , \bot , \top \}-fragment of
Classical Propositional Logic. Hence its language is the set
{∧,∨,⊤,⊥}\{\wedge , \vee , \top , \bot \} and its consequence relation is
given by 
Γ⊢ϕ iff Γ⊢CPLϕ.\Gamma \vdash \phi\txtiff\Gamma \vdash_{\bCPL} \phi.

It turns out that it is also the {∧,∨,⊥,⊤}\{\wedge , \vee , \bot , \top
\}-fragment of Intuitionistic Propositional Logic. Let us denote it
by L{∧,∨}\bL^{\{\wedge , \vee \}}.

The logic L{∧,∨}\bL^{ \{\wedge , \vee \}} is not protoalgebraic but it
is Fregean. Its classes of algebras Alg∗L{∧,∨}\bAlg^*\bL^{ \{\wedge , \vee
\}} and AlgL{∧,∨}\bAlg\bL^{ \{\wedge , \vee \}} are different. Moreover,
AlgL{∧,∨}\bAlg\bL^{\{\wedge , \vee \}} is the variety of bounded
distributive lattices, the class of algebras naturally expected to be
the associated with L{∧,∨}\bL^{ \{\wedge , \vee \}}, but Alg∗L{∧,∨}\bAlg^*\bL^{
\{\wedge , \vee \}} is strictly included in it. In fact, this last
class of algebras is not a quasivariety, but it is first-order
definable still. 

The logic L{∧,∨}\bL^{\{\wedge , \vee \}} is thus a natural example of a logic
where the class of algebras of its reduced matrix models is not the
right class of algebras expected to correspond to it (see Font &
Verdú 1991 where the logic is studied at length). The
properties of this example and its treatment in Font &
Verdú 1991 motivated the systematic study in Font & Jansana
1996 of the kind of
models for sentential logics considered in Brown & Suszko 1973,
namely, abstract logics. 
12.2 Positive Modal Logic

Positive Modal Logic is the {∧,∨,◻,◊,⊥,⊤}\{\wedge , \vee , \Box , \Diamond , \bot
, \top \}-fragment of the local normal modal logic lK\blK. We
denote it by PML\bPML. This logic has some interest in Computer
Science.

The logic PML\bPML is not protoalgebraic, it is not truth-equational,
it is selfextensional and it is not Fregean. Its algebraic counterpart
AlgPML\bAlg \bPML is the class of positive modal algebras introduced by
Dunn in Dunn 1995. The logic is studied in Jansana 2002 from the
perspective of abstract algebraic logic. The class of algebras
AlgPML\bAlg\bPML is different from Alg∗PML\bAlg^*\bPML.
12.3 Visser’s subintuitionistic logic

This logic is the logic in the language of intuitionistic logic that
has to the least normal modal logic KK the same relation that
intuitionistic logic has to the normal modal logic S4S4. It was
introduced in Visser 1981 (under the name Basic Propositional Logic)
and has been studied by several authors, such as Ardeshir, Alizadeh,
and Ruitenburg. It is not protoalgebraic, it is truth-equational and
it is Fregean (hence also selfextensional). 
12.4 The strict implication fragment of the local modal logic lK 

The strict implication of the language of modal logic is defined using
the ◻\Box operator and the material implication →\rightarrow. We
will use ⇒\Rightarrow for the strict implication. Its definition is
ϕ⇒ψ:=◻(ϕ→ψ)\phi \Rightarrow \psi := \Box(\phi \rightarrow \psi). The language
of the logic SilK\bSilK, that we call the strict implication fragment
of the local modal logic lK\blK, is the language L={∧,∨,⊥,⊤,⇒}L = \{\wedge ,
\vee , \bot , \top , \Rightarrow \}. We can translate the formulas
of LL to formulas of the modal language by systematically replacing
in an LL-formula ϕ\phi every subformula of the form ψ⇒δ\psi
\Rightarrow \delta by ◻(ψ→δ)\Box(\psi \rightarrow \delta) and
repeating the process until no appearance of ⇒\Rightarrow is left.
Let us denote by ϕ∗\phi^* the translation of ϕ\phi and by
Γ∗\Gamma^* the set of the translations of the formulas in
Γ\Gamma. Then the definition of the consequence relation of
SilK\bSilK is:
Γ⊢SilKϕ iff Γ∗⊢lKϕ∗.\Gamma \vdash_{\bSilK } \phi\txtiff\Gamma^* \vdash_{\blK } \phi^*.

The logic SilK\bSilK is not protoalgebraic and is not
truth-equational. It is selfextensional but it is not Fregean. Its
algebraic counterpart AlgSilK\bAlg \bSilK is the class of bounded
distributive lattices with a binary operation with the properties of
the strict implication of lK\blK. This class of algebras is
introduced and studied in Celani & Jansana 2005, where its members
are called Weakly Heyting algebras. AlgSilK\bAlg \bSilK does not coincide
with Alg∗SilK\bAlg^* \bSilK.

The logic SilK\bSilK belongs, as Visser’s logic, to the family
of so-called subintuitionistic logics. A reference to look at for
information on these logics is Celani & Jansana 2003.
13. Abstract logics and generalized matrices

The logical matrix models of a given logic can be thought of as
algebraic generalizations of its theories, more precisely, of its
Lindenbaum matrices. They come from taking a local perspective
centered around the theories of the logic considered one by one, and
its analogs the logic filters (also taken one by one). But, as we will
see, the properties of a logic depend in general on the global
behavior of the set of its theories taken together as a bunch;
or—to put it otherwise—on its consequence relation. The
consideration of this global behavior introduces a global perspective
on the design of semantics for logic systems. The abstract logics that
we are going to define can be seen, in contrast to logical matrices,
as algebraic generalizations of the logic itself and its extensions.
They are the natural objects to consider when one takes the global
perspective seriously. 

Let LL be a propositional language. An LL-abstract
logic is a pair A=⟨A\cA = \langle \bA, C ⟩\rangle where
A\bA is an LL-algebra and CC an abstract consequence
operation on AA. 

Given a logic L\bL, an LL-abstract logic A=⟨A,C⟩\cA = \langle \bA, C
\rangle is a model of L\bL if for every set of formulas
Γ\Gamma and every formula ϕ\phi


Γ⊢Lϕ iff \Gamma \vdash_{\bL } \phi\txtiff for every valuation vv on
A,v(ϕ)∈C(v[Γ])\bA, \bv(\phi) \in C(\bv[\Gamma]).


This definition has an equivalent in terms of the closed sets of
CC: an abstract logic A=⟨A,C⟩\cA = \langle \bA, C \rangle is a model
of L\bL if and only if for every CC-closed set XX the matrix
⟨A,X⟩\langle \bA, X \rangle is a model of L\bL (i.e., XX is an
L\bL-filter).

This observation leads to another point of view on abstract logics as
models of a logic system. It transforms them into a collection of
logical matrices (given by the closed sets) over the same algebra, or,
to put it more simply, into a pair ⟨A,B⟩\langle \bA, \cB \rangle where
B\cB is a collection of subsets of AA. A structure of this type
is called in the literature a generalized matrix
(Wójcicki 1973) and more recently it has been called an
atlas in Dunn & Hardegree 2001. It is said to be a model
of a logic L\bL if for every X∈B,⟨A,X⟩X \in \cB, \langle \bA, X \rangle
is a matrix model of L\bL.

A logic system L=⟨L,⊢L⟩\bL = \langle L, \vdash_{\bL } \rangle
straightforwardly provides us with an equivalent abstract logic
⟨FmL,C⊢L⟩\langle \bFm_L, C_{\vdash_{ \bL} } \rangle and an equivalent
generalized matrix ⟨FmL,Th(L)⟩\langle \bFm_L,\tTH(\bL) \rangle, where
Th(L)\tTH(\bL) is the set of C⊢LC_{\vdash_{ \bL}}-closed sets of
formulas (i.e., the L\bL-theories). We will move freely from one to
the other.

The generalized matrices ⟨A,B⟩\langle \bA, \cB \rangle that correspond
to abstract logics have the following two properties: A∈BA \in \cB
and B\cB is closed under intersections of arbitrary nonempty
families. A family B\cB of subsets of a set AA with these two
properties is known as a closed-set system and also as a
closure system. There is a dual correspondence between
abstract consequence operations on a set AA and closed-set systems
on AA. Given an abstract consequence operation CC on AA, the
set CC\cC_C of CC-closed sets is a closed-set system and given a
closed-set system C\cC the operation CCC_{\cC} defined by
CC(X)=⋂{Y∈C:X⊆Y}C_{\cC }(X) = \bigcap \{Y \in \cC: X \subseteq Y\}, for every X⊆AX
\subseteq A, is an abstract consequence operation. In general, every
generalized matrix ⟨A,B⟩\langle \bA, \cB \rangle can be turned into a
closed-set system by adding to B∪{A}\cB \cup \{A\} the intersections of
arbitrary nonempty subfamilies, and therefore into an abstract logic,
which we denote by ⟨A,CB⟩\langle \bA, C_{\cB }\rangle. In that situation
we say that B\cB is a base for CBC_{\cB}. It is obvious
that an abstract logic can have more than one base. Any family of
closed sets with the property that every closed set is an intersection
of elements of the family is a base. The study of bases for the closed
set system of the theories of a logic usually plays an important role
in its study. For example, in classical logic an important base for
the family of its theories is the family of maximal consistent
theories and in intuitionistic logic the family of prime theories. In
a similar way, the systematic study of bases for generalized matrix
models of a logic becomes important.

In order to make the exposition smooth we will now move from abstract
logics to generalized matrices. Let A=⟨A,B⟩\cA = \langle \bA, \cB \rangle
be a generalized matrix. There exists the greatest congruence of
A\bA compatible with all the sets in B\cB; it is known as the
Tarski congruence of A\cA. We denote it by
Ω∼A(B)\bOmega^{\sim}_{\bA }(\cB). It has the following characterization
using the Leibniz operator
Ω∼A(B)=⋂X∈BΩA(X).\bOmega^{\sim}_{\bA }(\cB) = \bigcap_{X \in \cB} \bOmega_{\bA }(X).

It can also be characterized by the condition:


⟨a,b⟩∈Ω∼A(B) iff \langle a, b \rangle \in \bOmega^{\sim}_{\bA }(\cB)\txtiff for
every ϕ(p,q1,…,qn)\phi(p, q_1 , \ldots ,q_n), every c1,…,cn∈Ac_1 , \ldots ,c_n \in
A and all X∈BX \in \cB 

ϕA[a,c1,…,cn]∈X⇔ϕA[b,c1,…,cn]∈X\phi^{\bA }[a, c_1 , \ldots ,c_n] \in X \Leftrightarrow \phi^{\bA }[b, c_1 , \ldots ,c_n] \in X

or equivalently by


⟨a,b⟩∈Ω∼A(B) iff \langle a, b \rangle \in \bOmega^{\sim}_{\bA }(\cB)\txtiff for
every ϕ(p,q1,…,qn)\phi(p, q_1 , \ldots ,q_n) and every c1,…,cn∈A,CB(ϕA[a,c1,…,cn])=CB(ϕA[b,c1,…,cn])c_1 , \ldots ,c_n \in
A, C_{\cB }(\phi^{\bA }[a, c_1 , \ldots ,c_n]) = C_{\cB }(\phi^{\bA
}[b, c_1 , \ldots ,c_n]).


A generalized matrix is reduced if its Tarski congruence is
the identity. Every generalized matrix ⟨A,B⟩\langle \bA, \cB \rangle
can be turned into an equivalent reduced one by identifying the
elements related by its Tarski congruence. The result is the quotient
generalized matrix ⟨A/Ω∼A(B),B/Ω∼A(B)⟩\langle \bA / \bOmega^{\sim}_{\bA }(\cB),
\cB/\bOmega^{\sim}_{\bA }(\cB) \rangle, where
B/Ω∼A(B)={X/Ω∼A(B):X∈B}\cB/\bOmega^{\sim}_{\bA }(\cB) = \{X/\bOmega^{\sim}_{\bA }(\cB): X
\in \cB\} and for X∈B,X/Ω∼A(B)X \in \cB, X/\bOmega^{\sim}_{\bA }(\cB) is the
set of equivalence classes of the elements of XX.

The properties of a logic L\bL depend in general, as we already
said, on the global behavior of the family of its theories. In some
logics, this behavior is reflected in the behavior of its set of
theorems, as in classical and intuitionistic logic due to the
deduction-detachment property, but this is by no means the most
general situation, as it is witnessed by the example of the local and
global modal logics of the normal modal logic KK. Both have the
same theorems but do not share the same properties. Recall that the
local logic has the deduction-detachment property but the global one
not. In a similar way, the properties of a logic are in
general better encoded in an algebraic setting if we consider
families of L\bL-filters on the algebras than if we consider a
single L\bL-filter as it is done in logical matrices model
theory.

The generalized matrix models that have naturally attracted most of
the attention in the research on the algebraization of logics are the
generalized matrices of the form ⟨A,FiLA⟩\langle \bA, \tFi_{\bL }\bA
\rangle where FiLA\tFi_{\bL }\bA is the set of all the
L\bL-filters of A\bA. An example of a property of logics encoded
in the structure of the lattices of L\bL-filters of the
LL-algebras is that for every finitary protoalgebraic logic L,L\bL,
\bL has the deduction-detachment property if and only if for every
algebra A\bA the join-subsemilattice of the lattice of all
L\bL-filters of A\bA that consists of the finitely generated
L\bL-filters is dually residuated; see Czelakowski 2001.

The generalized matrices of the form ⟨A,FiLA⟩\langle \bA, \tFi_{\bL }\bA
\rangle are called the basic full g-models of L\bL (the
letter ‘g’ stands for generalized matrix). The interest in
these models lead to the consideration of the class of generalized
matrix models of a logic L\bL with the property that their quotient
by their Tarski congruence is a basic full g-model. These generalized
matrices (and their corresponding abstract logics) are called full
g-models. The theory of the full g-models of an arbitrary logic
is developed in Font & Jansana 1996, where the notion of full
g-model and basic full g-model is introduced. We will mention some of
the main results obtained there.

Let L\bL be a logic system. 

L\bL is protoalgebraic if and only if for every full
g-model ⟨A,C⟩\langle \bA, \cC \rangle there exists an L\bL-filter
FF of A\bA such that C={G∈FiLA:F⊆G}\cC = \{G \in \tFi_{\bL }\bA: F \subseteq
G\}. 
If L\bL is finitary, L\bL is finitely
algebraizable if and only if for every algebra A\bA and every
L\bL-filter FF of A\bA, the generalized matrix ⟨A,{G∈FiLA:F⊆G}⟩\langle \bA,
\{G \in \tFi_{\bL }\bA: F \subseteq G\} \rangle is a full g-model
and AlgL\bAlg\bL is a quasivariety. 
The class AlgL\bAlg\bL is both the class of algebras of
the reduced generalized matrix models of L\bL, and the class
{A:⟨A,FiLA⟩\{\bA: \langle \bA, \tFi_{\bL }\bA \rangle is reduced}\}.
For every algebra A\bA there is an isomorphism
between the family of closed-set systems C\cC on AA such that
⟨A,C⟩\langle\bA, \cC\rangle is a full g-model of L\bL and the family
of congruences θ\theta of A\bA such that A/θ∈AlgL\bA/\theta \in
\bAlg\bL. The isomorphism is given by the Tarski operator that sends
a generalized matrix to its Tarski congruence.


The isomorphism
 theorem (4)
 above is a generalization of the isomorphism theorems we encountered
earlier for algebraizable logics. What is interesting here is that the
theorem holds for every logic system. Using
 (2) above,
 theorem (4) entails the isomorphism theorem for finitary and finitely
algebraizable logics. Thus
 theorem (4)
 can be seen as the most general formulation of the mathematical
logical phenomena that underlies the isomorphism theorems between the
congruences of the algebras in a certain class and some kind of
subsets of them we mentioned in
 Section 9.
 

The use of generalized matrices and abstract logics as models for
logic systems has proved very useful for the study of selfextensional
logics in general and more in particular for the study of the
selextenional logics that are not protoalgebraic such as the logics discused in
 Section 12.
 In particular, they have proved very useful for the study of the
class of finitary selfextensional logics with a conjunction and the
class of finitary selfextensional logics with the deduction-detachment
property for a single term, say p→qp \rightarrow q; the logics in
this last class are nevertheless protoalgebraic. A logic L\bL has a
conjunction if there is a formula in two variables ϕ(p,q)\phi(p,
q) such that
ϕ(p,q)⊢Lp,ϕ(p,q)⊢Lq,p,q⊢Lϕ(p,q).\phi(p, q) \vdash_{\bL } p, \phi(p, q)\vdash_{\bL } q,  p, q \vdash_{\bL } \phi(p, q).

The logics in those two classes have the following property: the
Tarski relation of every full g-model ⟨A,C⟩\langle \bA, C \rangle is
{⟨a,b⟩∈A×A:C(a)=C(b)}\{\langle a, b \rangle \in A \times A: C(a) = C(b)\}. A way of
saying it is to say that for these logics the property that defines
selfextensionality, namely that the interderivability condition is a
congruence, lifts or transfers to every full g-model. The
selfextensional logics with this property are called fully
selfextensional. This notion was introduced in Font & Jansana
1996 under the name ‘strongly selfextensional’. All the
known and natural selfextensional logics are fully selfextensional, in
particular the logics discussed in
 Section 12,
 but Babyonyshev showed (Babyonyshev 2003) an ad hoc example of
a selfextensional logic that is not fully selfextensional. 

An interesting result on the finitary logics which are fully
selfextensional logics with a conjunction or with the
deduction-detachment property for a single term is that their class of
algebras AlgL\bAlg\bL is always a variety. The researchers in abstract
algebraic logic are somehow surprised by the fact that several
finitary and finitely algebraizable logics have a variety as its
equivalent algebraic semantics, when the theory of algebraizable
logics allows in general to prove only that the equivalent algebraic
semantics of a finitary and finitely algebraizable logic is a
quasivariety. The result explains this phenomenon for the finitary and
finitely algebraizable logics to which it applies. For many other
finitary and finitely algebraizable logics to find a convincing
explanation is still an open area of research.

Every abstract logic A=⟨A,C⟩\cA = \langle \bA, C \rangle determines a
quasi-order (a reflexive and transitive relation) on AA. It is the
relation defined by 

a≤Ab iff C(b)⊆C(a) iff b∈C(a).a \le_{\cA } b\txtiff C(b) \subseteq C(a)\txtiff b \in C(a).

Thus a≤Aba \le_{\cA } b if and only if bb belongs to every
CC-closed set to which AA belongs. For a fully selfextensional
logic L\bL, this quasi-order turns into a partial order in the
reduced full g-models, which are in fact the reduced basic full
g-models, namely, the abstract logics ⟨A,FiLA⟩\langle \bA, \tFi_{\bL }\bA
\rangle with A∈AlgL\bA \in \bAlg\bL. Consequently, in a fully
selfextensional logic L\bL every algebra A∈AlgL\bA \in \bAlg\bL
carries a partial order definable in terms of the family of the
L\bL-filters. If the logic is fully selfextensional with a
conjunction this partial order is definable by an equation of the
LL-algebraic language because in this case for every algebra A∈AlgL\bA
\in \bAlg\bL we have: 

a≤b iff C(b)⊆C(a) iff C(a∧Ab)=C(a) iff a∧Ab=a,a \le b\txtiff C(b) \subseteq C(a)\txtiff C(a \wedge^{\bA } b) = C(a)\txtiff a \wedge^{\bA } b = a,

 where CC is the abstract
consequence operation that corresponds to the closed-set system
FiLA\tFi_{\bL }\bA, and ∧A\wedge^{\bA} is the operation defined on
A\bA by the formula that is a conjunction for the logic
L\bL.


A similar situation holds for fully selfextensional logics with the
deduction-detachment property for a single term, say p→qp \rightarrow
q, for then for every algebra A∈AlgL\bA \in \bAlg\bL 
a≤b iff C(b)⊆C(a) iff C(a→Ab)=C(∅)=C(a→Aa) iff a→Ab=a→Aa.a \le b\txtiff C(b) \subseteq C(a)\txtiff C(a \rightarrow^{\bA } b) = C(\varnothing) = C(a \rightarrow^{\bA } a)
 \txtiff \\ a \rightarrow^{\bA } b = a \rightarrow^{\bA } a.

These observations lead us to view the finitary fully selfextensional
logics L\bL with a conjunction and those with the
deduction-detachment property for a single term as logics definable by
an order which is definable in the algebras in AlgL\bAlg\bL by using
an equation of the L\bL-algebraic language. Related to this, the
following result is known.

Theorem 8.
A finitary logic L\bL with a conjunction is fully
selfextensional if and only if there is a class of algebras K\bK such that for
every A∈K\bA \in \bK the reduct ⟨A,∧A⟩\langle A, \wedge^{\bA }\rangle
is a meet-semilattice and if ≤\le is the order of the semilattice,
then



ϕ1,…,ϕn⊢Lϕ iff \phi_1 , \ldots ,\phi_n\vdash_{\bL } \phi\txtiff for all A∈K\bA \in
\bK and every valuation vv on Av(ϕ1)∧A…∧Av(ϕn)≤v(ϕ)\bA \; \bv(\phi_1) \wedge^{\bA
}\ldots \wedge^{\bA } \bv(\phi_n) \le \bv(\phi)


and


⊢Lϕ iff \vdash_{\bL } \phi\txtiff for all A∈K\bA \in \bK and every
valuation vv on Aa≤v(ϕ)\bA \; a \le \bv(\phi), for every a∈Aa \in A.




Moreover, in this case the class of algebras AlgL\bAlg\bL is the
variety generated by K\bK. 

Similar results can be obtained for the selfextensional logics with
the deduction-detachment property for a single term. The reader is
referred to Jansana 2006 for a study of the selfextensional logics
with conjunction, and to Jansana 2005 for a study of the
selfextensional logics with the deduction-detachment property for a
single term. 

The class of selfextensional logics with a
conjunction includes the so-called logics preserving degrees of truth
studied in the fields of substructural logics and of many-valued
logics. The reader can look at Bou et al. 2009 and the references
therein.
14. Extending the setting

The research on logic systems described in the previous sections has
been extended to encompass other consequence relations that go beyond
propositional logics, like equational logics and the consequence
relations between sequents built from the formulas of a propositional
language definable using sequent calculi. The interested reader can
consult the excellent paper Raftery 2006a.

This research arose the need for an, even more, abstract way of
developing the theory of consequence relations. It has lead to a
reformulation (in a category-theoretic setting) of the theory of logic
systems as explained in this entry. The work has been done mainly by
G. Voutsadakis in a series of papers, e.g., Voutsadakis 2002.
Voutsadakis’s approach uses the notion of a pi-institution,
introduced by Fiadeiro and Sernadas, as the analog of the logic
systems in his category-theoretic setting. Some work in this direction
is also found in Gil-Férez 2006. A different approach to a
generalization of the studies encompassing the work done for logic
systems and for sequent calculi is found in Galatos & Tsinakis
2009; Gil-Férez 2011 is also in this line. The work presented
in these two papers originates in Blok & Jónsson 2006. The
Galatos-Tsinakis approach has been recently extended in a way that
also encompasses the setting of Voutsadakis in Galatos &
Gil-Férez 2017.

Another recent line of research that extends the framework described
in this entry develops a theory of algebraization of many-sorted logic
systems using instead of the equational consequence relation of the
natural class of algebras a many-sorted behavioral equational
consequence (a notion coming from computer science) and a weaker
concept than algebraizable logic: behaviorally algebraizable logic.
