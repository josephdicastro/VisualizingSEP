In the first decade of the 21st century, new media
technologies for social networking such as Facebook, MySpace, Twitter
and YouTube began to transform the social, political and informational
practices of individuals and institutions across the globe, inviting a
philosophical response from the community of applied ethicists and
philosophers of technology. While this scholarly response continues to
be challenged by the rapidly evolving nature of social networking
technologies, the urgent need for attention to this phenomenon is
underscored by the fact that it is reshaping how many human beings initiate
and/or maintain virtually every type of ethically significant social
bond or role: friend-to-friend, parent-to-child, co-worker-to
co-worker, employer-to-employee, teacher-to-student,
neighbor-to-neighbor, seller-to-buyer, and doctor-to-patient, to offer
just a partial list. Nor are the ethical implications of these
technologies strictly interpersonal. The complex web of interactions
between social networking service users and their online and offline
communities, social network developers, corporations, governments and
other institutions—along with the diverse and sometimes
conflicting motives and interests of these various stakeholders—will
continue to require rigorous philosophical analysis for decades to
come.


Section 1 of the entry outlines the history and working definition
of social networking services (hereafter referred to as SNS). Section 2
identifies the early philosophical foundations of reflection on the
ethics of online social networks, leading up to the emergence of Web
2.0 standards (supporting user interactions) and full-fledged SNS.
Section 3 reviews the primary ethical topic areas around which
philosophical reflections on SNS have, to date, converged: privacy;
identity and community; friendship, virtue and the good life; democracy
and the public sphere; and cybercrime. Finally, Section 4 reviews some
of the metaethical issues potentially impacted by the emergence of
SNS.
 

1. History and Definitions of Social Networking Services


‘Social networking’ is an inherently ambiguous term
requiring some clarification. Human beings have been socially
‘networked’ in one manner or another for as long as we have
been on the planet, and we have historically availed ourselves of
many successive techniques and instruments for facilitating and
maintaining such networks. These include structured social affiliations
and institutions such as private and public clubs, lodges and churches
as well as communications technologies such as postal and courier
systems, telegraphs and telephones. When philosophers speak today,
however, of ‘Social Networking and Ethics’, they usually
refer more narrowly to the ethical impact of an evolving and loosely
defined group of information technologies, most based on or inspired by
the ‘Web 2.0’ software standards that emerged in the first
decade of the 21st century.
1.1 Online Social Networks and the Emergence of ‘Web 2.0’


Prior to the emergence of Web 2.0 standards, the computer had
already served for decades as a medium for various forms of social
networking, beginning in the 1970s with social uses of the U.S.
military’s ARPANET and evolving to facilitate thousands of
Internet newsgroups and electronic mailing lists, BBS (bulletin board
systems), MUDs (multi-user dungeons) and chat rooms dedicated to an
eclectic range of topics and social identities (Barnes 2001; Turkle
1995). These early computer social networks were systems that grew up
organically, typically as ways of exploiting commercial, academic or
other institutional software for more broadly social purposes. In
contrast, Web 2.0 technologies evolved specifically to facilitate
user-generated, collaborative and shared Internet content, and while
the initial aims of Web 2.0 software developers were still largely
commercial and institutional, the new standards were designed
explicitly to harness the already-evident potential of the Internet for
social networking. Most notably, Web 2.0 social interfaces have
redefined the social topography of the Internet by enabling users to
build increasingly seamless connections between their online social
presence and their existing social networks offline—a trend that has
begun to shift the Internet away from its original function as a haven
for largely anonymous or pseudonymous identities forming sui
generis social networks (Ess 2011).


Among the first websites to employ the new standards explicitly for
general social networking purposes were Orkut, MySpace, LinkedIn,
Friendster, Bebo, Habbo and Facebook. More recent and specific trends
in online social networking include the rise of sites dedicated to
media sharing (YouTube, Flickr, Instagram, Vine), microblogging (Tumblr, Twitter),
location-based networking (Foursquare, Loopt, Yelp, YikYak)
and interest-sharing (Pinterest).
1.2 Early Scholarly Engagement with Social Networking Services


The study of the ethical implications of SNS can be considered a
subpart of
 Computer and Information Ethics
 (Bynum 2008). While Computer and Information
Ethics certainly accommodates an interdisciplinary approach, the
direction and problems of that field have largely been defined by
philosophically-trained scholars. Yet this has not been the early
pattern for the ethics of social networking. Partly due to the
temporal coincidence of the social networking phenomenon with emerging
empirical studies of the patterns of use and effects of
computer-mediated-communication (CMC), a field now called
‘Internet Studies’ (Consalvo and Ess, 2011), the ethical
implications of social networking technologies were initially targeted
for inquiry by a loose coalition of sociologists, social
psychologists, anthropologists, ethnographers, media scholars and
political scientists (see, for example, Giles 2006; Boyd 2007; Ellison
et al. 2007; Ito 2009).   Consequently, those philosophers who
have turned their attention to social networking and ethics have had
to decide whether to pursue their inquiries independently, drawing
only from traditional philosophical resources in applied computer
ethics and the philosophy of technology, or to develop their views in
consultation with the growing body of empirical data and conclusions
already being generated by other disciplines. While this entry will
primarily confine itself to reviewing existing philosophical research
on social networking ethics, links between those researches and
studies in other disciplinary contexts continue to be highly
significant.
2. Early Philosophical Concerns about Online Social Networks


Among the first philosophers to take an interest in the ethical
significance of social uses of the Internet were phenomenological
philosophers of technology Albert Borgmann and Hubert Dreyfus. These
thinkers were heavily influenced by Heidegger’s (1954/1977) view of
technology as a monolithic force with a distinctive vector of
influence, one that tends to constrain or impoverish the human
experience of reality in specific ways. While Borgmann and Dreyfus were
primarily responding to the immediate precursors of Web 2.0 social
networks (e.g., chat rooms, newsgroups, online gaming and email), their
conclusions, which aim at online sociality broadly construed, are
directly relevant to SNS.
2.1 Borgmann’s Critique of Social Hyperreality


Borgmann’s early critique (1984) of modern technology
addressed what he called the device paradigm, a
technologically-driven tendency to conform our interactions with the
world to a model of easy consumption. By 1992’s Crossing the
Postmodern Divide, however, Borgmann had become more narrowly
focused on the ethical and social impact of information technologies,
employing the concept of hyperreality to critique (among other
aspects of information technology) the way in which online social
networks may subvert or displace organic social realities by allowing
people to “offer one another stylized versions of themselves for
amorous or convivial entertainment” (1992, 92) rather than
allowing the fullness and complexity of their real identities to be
engaged. While Borgmann admits that in itself a social hyperreality
seems “morally inert” (1992, 94), he insists that the
ethical danger of hyperrealities lies in their tendency to leave us
“resentful and defeated” when we are forced to return from
their “insubstantial and disconnected glamour” to the
organic reality which “with all its poverty inescapably asserts
its claims on us” by providing “the tasks and blessings
that call forth patience and vigor in people.” (1992, 96) This
contrast between the “glamour of virtuality” and the
“hardness of reality” continues to be a motif in his 1999
book Holding On to Reality, in which he describes online
sociality in MUDs (multi-user dungeons) as a “virtual
fog” which seeps into and obscures the gravity of real human
bonds (1999, 190–91).


There might be an inherent ambiguity in Borgmann’s analysis,
however. On the one hand he tells us that it is the
competition with our organic and embodied social presence that
makes online social environments designed for convenience, pleasure and
ease ethically problematic, since the latter will inevitably be judged
more satisfying than the ‘real’ social environment. But he
goes on to claim that online social environments are
themselves ethically deficient:


If everyone is indifferently present regardless of where one is
located on the globe, no one is commandingly present. Those who become
present via a communication link have a diminished presence, since we
can always make them vanish if their presence becomes burdensome.
Moreover, we can protect ourselves from unwelcome persons altogether by
using screening devices….The extended network of
hyperintelligence also disconnects us from the people we would meet
incidentally at concerts, plays and political gatherings. As it is, we
are always and already linked to the music and entertainment we desire
and to sources of political information. This immobile attachment to
the web of communication works a twofold deprivation in our lives. It
cuts us off from the pleasure of seeing people in the round and from
the instruction of being seen and judged by them. It robs us of the
social resonance that invigorates our concentration and acumen when we
listen to music or watch a play.…Again it seems that by having
our hyperintelligent eyes and ears everywhere, we can attain world
citizenship of unequaled scope and subtlety. But the world that is
hyperintelligently spread out before us has lost its force and
resistance. (1992, 105–6)


Critics of Borgmann have seen him as adopting Heidegger’s
substantivist, monolithic model of technology as a singular,
deterministic force in human affairs (Feenberg 1999; Verbeek 2005).
This model, known as technological determinism, represents
technology as an independent driver of social and cultural change,
shaping human institutions, practices and values in a manner largely
beyond our control. Whether or not this is ultimately Borgmann’s
view (or Heidegger’s), his critics are likely responding to
remarks of the following sort: “[Social hyperreality] has already
begun to transform the social fabric…At length it will lead to a
disconnected, disembodied, and disoriented sort of life…It is
obviously growing and thickening, suffocating reality and rendering
humanity less mindful and intelligent.” (Borgmann 1992,
108–9)


Critics assert that the ethical force of Borgmann’s analysis
suffers from his lack of attention to the substantive differences
between particular social networking technologies and their varied
contexts of use, as well as the different motivations and patterns of
activity displayed by individual users in those contexts. For example,
Borgmann is charged with ignoring the fact that physical reality does
not always enable or facilitate connection, nor does it do so equally
for all persons. As a consequence, Andrew Feenberg (1999) claims that
Borgmann has missed the way in which online social networks might
supply sites of democratic resistance for those who are physically or
politically disempowered by many ‘real-world’ networks.
2.2 Hubert Dreyfus on Internet Sociality: Anonymity versus Commitment


Philosopher Hubert Dreyfus (2001) joined Borgmann in early critical
engagement with the ethical possibilities of the Internet; like
Borgmann, Dreyfus’s reflections on the ethical dimension of online
sociality evince a general suspicion of such networks as an
impoverished substitute for the real thing. Like Borgmann,
Dreyfus’s suspicion is also informed by his phenomenological
roots, which lead him to focus his critical attention on the
Internet’s suspension of fully embodied presence. Yet
rather than draw upon Heidegger’s metaphysical framework, Dreyfus
(2004) reaches back to Kierkegaard in forming his criticisms of life
online. Dreyfus suggests that what online engagements intrinsically
lack is exposure to risk, and without risk, Dreyfus tells us,
there can be no true meaning or commitment found in the electronic
domain. Instead, we are drawn to online social environments precisely
because they allow us to play with notions of identity,
commitment and meaning, without risking the irrevocable consequences
that ground real identities and relationships. As Dreyfus puts
it:


…the Net frees people to develop new and exciting selves. The
person living in the aesthetic sphere of existence would surely agree,
but according to Kierkegaard, “As a result of knowing and being
everything possible, one is in contradiction with oneself”
(Present Age, 68). When he is speaking from the point of view of the
next higher sphere of existence, Kierkegaard tells us that the self
requires not “variableness and brilliancy,” but
“firmness, balance, and steadiness”  (Dreyfus 2004,
75)


While Dreyfus acknowledges that unconditional commitment and
acceptance of risk are not excluded in principle by online
sociality, he insists that “anyone using the Net who was led to
risk his or her real identity in the real world would have to act
against the grain of what attracted him or her to the Net in the first
place” (2004, 78).
2.3 Legacy of the Phenomenological Critique of Social Networks


While Borgmann and Dreyfus’s views continue to inform the
philosophical conversation about social networking and ethics, both of
these early philosophical engagements with the phenomenon manifest
certain predictive failures (as is perhaps unavoidable when reflecting
on new and rapidly evolving technological systems). Dreyfus did not
foresee the way in which popular SNS such as Facebook, LinkedIn and
Google+ would shift away from the earlier online norms of anonymity and
identity play, instead giving real-world identities an online presence
which in some ways is less ephemeral than bodily presence (as
those who have struggled to erase online traces of past acts or to
delete Facebook profiles of deceased loved ones can attest).


Likewise, Borgmann’s critiques of “immobile
attachment” to the online datastream did not anticipate the rise
of mobile social networking applications which not only encourage us to
physically seek out and join our friends at those same concerts, plays
and political events that he envisioned us passively digesting from an
electronic feed, but also enable spontaneous physical gatherings in
ways never before possible. That said, such predictive failures
may not, in the long view, turn out to be fatal to their
judgments. It is worth noting that one of the earliest and most
accomplished researchers of Internet sociality whose early championing
of its liberating social possibilities (Turkle 1995) was directly
challenged by Dreyfus (2004, 75) has since articulated a far more
pessimistic view of the trajectory of new social technologies (Turkle
2011)—one that now resonates in several respects with
Borgmann’s earlier concerns about electronic networks
increasingly leading to experiences of alienation in
connectedness.
3. Contemporary Ethical Concerns about Social Networking Services


While scholarship in the social and natural sciences has tended to
focus on the impact of SNS on psychosocial markers of
happiness/well-being, psychosocial adjustment, social capital, or
feelings of life satisfaction, philosophical concerns about social
networking and ethics have generally centered on topics less amenable
to empirical measurement (e.g., privacy, identity, friendship, the
good life and democratic freedom). More so than ‘social
capital’ or feelings of ‘life satisfaction,’ these
topics are closely tied to traditional concerns of ethical theory
(e.g., virtues, rights, duties, motivations and consequences). These
topics are also tightly linked to the novel features and distinctive
functionalities of SNS, more so than some other issues of interest in
computer and information ethics that relate to more general Internet
functionalities (for example, issues of copyright and intellectual
property).
3.1 Social Networking Services and Privacy


Social networking technologies have added a new sense of urgency and
new layers of complexity to the existing debates among philosophers
about
 computers and informational privacy.
 For example, standing philosophical
debates about whether privacy should be defined in terms of control
over information (Elgesem 1996), restricting access to information
(Tavani 2007) or contextual integrity (Nissenbaum 2004) must now be
re-examined in the light of the privacy practices of Facebook, Twitter and other
SNS. This has become a locus of much critical attention.


Some fundamental practices of concern include: the potential
availability of users’ data to third parties for the purposes of
commercial marketing, data mining, research, surveillance or law
enforcement; the capacity of facial-recognition software to
automatically identify persons in uploaded photos; the ability of
third-party applications to collect and publish user data without
their permission or awareness; the frequent use by SNS of automatic
‘opt-in’ privacy controls; the use of
‘cookies’ to track online user activities after they have
left a SNS; the potential use of location-based social networking for
stalking or other illicit monitoring of users’ physical movements; the
sharing of user information or patterns of activity with government
entities; and, last but not least, the potential of SNS to encourage
users to adopt voluntary but imprudent, ill-informed or unethical
information sharing practices, either with respect to sharing their
own personal data or sharing data related to other persons and
entities. Facebook has been a particular lightning-rod for criticism
of its privacy practices (Spinello 2011), but it is just the most
visible member of a far broader and more complex network of SNS actors
with access to unprecedented quantities of sensitive personal
data.


These new actors in the information environment create particular
problems with respect to privacy norms. For example, since it is the
ability to access information freely shared by others that makes SNS
uniquely attractive and useful, and given that users often minimize or
fail to fully understand the implications of sharing information on
SNS, we may find that contrary to traditional views of information
privacy, giving users greater control over their
information-sharing practices may actually lead to decreased
privacy for themselves or others. Moreover, in the shift from (early
Web 2.0) user-created and maintained sites and networks to (late Web
2.0) proprietary social networks, many users have yet to fully process
the potential for conflict between their personal motivations for using
SNS and the profit-driven motivations of the corporations that possess
their data (Baym 2011). Jared Lanier frames the point cynically when he
states that: “The only hope for social networking sites from a
business point of view is for a magic formula to appear in which some
method of violating privacy and dignity becomes acceptable”
(Lanier 2010).


Scholars also note the way in which SNS architectures are often
insensitive to the granularity of human sociality (Hull, Lipford &
Latulipe 2011). That is, such architectures tend to treat human
relations as if they are all of a kind, ignoring the profound
differences among types of social relation (familial,
professional, collegial, commercial, civic, etc.). As a consequence,
the privacy controls of such architectures often fail to account for
the variability of privacy norms within different but overlapping
social spheres. Among philosophical accounts of privacy, Nissenbaum’s
(2010) view of contextual integrity has seemed to many to be
particularly well suited to explaining the diversity and complexity of
privacy expectations generated by new social media (see for example
Grodzinsky and Tavani 2010; Capurro 2011). Contextual integrity
demands that our information practices respect context-sensitive
privacy norms, where‘context’ refers not to the overly
coarse distinction between ‘private’ and
‘public,’ but to a far richer array of social settings
characterized by distinctive roles, norms and values. For example, the
same piece of information made ‘public’ in the context of
a status update to family and friends on Facebook may nevertheless be
considered by the same discloser to be ‘private’ in other
contexts; that is, she may not expect that same information to be
provided to strangers Googling her name, or to bank employees
examining her credit. 


On the design side, such complexity means that attempts to produce
more ‘user-friendly’ privacy controls face an uphill
challenge—they must balance the need for simplicity and ease of
use with the need to better represent the rich and complex structures
of our social universes. A key design question, then, is how SNS
privacy interfaces can be made more accessible and more
socially intuitive for users.


Hull et al. (2011) also take note of the apparent plasticity of user
attitudes about privacy in SNS contexts, as evidenced by the pattern
of widespread outrage over changed or newly disclosed privacy
practices of SNS providers being followed by a period of accommodation
to and acceptance of the new practices (Boyd and Hargittai 2010). A
related concern is the “privacy paradox,” in which
users’ voluntary actions online seem to belie their own stated
values concerning privacy. These phenomena raise many ethical
concerns, the most general of which may be this: how can static
normative conceptions of the value of privacy be used to evaluate the
SNS practices that are destabilizing those very conceptions? More
recently, working from the late writings of Foucault, Hull (2015) has
explored the way in which the ‘self-management’ model of
online privacy protection embodied in standard ‘notice and
consent’ practices only reinforces a narrow neoliberal
conception of privacy, and of ourselves, as commodities for sale and
exchange.


In an early study of online communities, Bakardjieva and Feenberg
(2000) suggested that the rise of communities predicated on the
open exchange of information may in fact require us to relocate our
focus in information ethics from privacy concerns to concerns about
alienation; that is, the exploitation of information for
purposes not intended by the relevant community. Heightened concerns
about data mining and other third-party uses of information shared on
SNS would seem to give further weight to Bakardjieva and
Feenberg’s argument. Such considerations give rise to the
possibility of users deploying “guerrilla tactics” of
misinformation, for example, by providing SNS hosts with false names,
addresses, birthdates, hometowns or employment information. Such
tactics would aim to subvert the emergence of a new “digital
totalitarianism” that uses the power of information rather than
physical force as a political control (Capurro 2011).


Finally, privacy issues with SNS highlight a broader philosophical
problem involving the intercultural dimensions of information ethics;
Rafael Capurro (2005) has noted the way in which narrowly Western
conceptions of privacy occlude other legitimate ethical concerns
regarding new media practices. For example, he notes that in addition
to Western worries about protecting the private domain from public
exposure, we must also take care to protect the public sphere
from the excessive intrusion of the private. Though he illustrates the
point with a comment about intrusive uses of cell phones in public
spaces (2005, 47), the rise of mobile social networking has amplified
this concern by several factors. When one must compete with Facebook or
Twitter for the attention of not only one’s dinner companions and
family members, but also one’s fellow drivers, pedestrians,
students, moviegoers, patients and audience members, the integrity of
the public sphere comes to look as fragile as that of the private.
3.2 The Ethics of Identity and Community on Social Networking Services


Social networking technologies open up a new type of ethical space
in which personal identities and communities, both ‘real’
and virtual, are constructed, presented, negotiated, managed and
performed. Accordingly, philosophers have analyzed SNS both in terms of
their uses as Foucaultian “technologies of the self”
(Bakardjieva and Gaden 2012) that facilitate the construction and
performance of personal identity, and in terms of the distinctive kinds
of communal norms and moral practices generated by SNS (Parsell
2008).


The ethical and metaphysical issues generated by the formation of virtual identities
and communities have attracted much philosophical interest (see Introna
2011 and Rodogno 2012). Yet as noted by Patrick Stokes (2012), unlike earlier forms of
online community in which anonymity and the construction of alter-egos
were typical, SNS such as Facebook increasingly anchor member
identities and connections to real, embodied selves and offline
‘real-world’ networks. Yet SNS still enable users to manage
their self-presentation and their social networks in ways that offline
social spaces at home, school or work often do not permit. The result,
then, is an identity grounded in the person’s material reality
and embodiment but more explicitly “reflective and
aspirational” (Stokes 2012, 365) in its presentation. This raises a
number of ethical questions: first, from what source of normative
guidance or value does the aspirational content of an SNS user’s
identity primarily derive? Do identity performances on SNS generally
represent the same aspirations and reflect the same value profiles as
users’ offline identity performances? Do they display any notable
differences from the aspirational identities of non-SNS users? Are the
values and aspirations made explicit in SNS contexts more or less
heteronomous in origin than those expressed in non-SNS contexts? Do the
more explicitly aspirational identity performances on SNS encourage
users to take steps to actually embody those aspirations offline, or do
they tend to weaken the motivation to do so?


A further SNS phenomenon of relevance here is the persistence and
communal memorialization of Facebook profiles after the user’s
death; not only does this reinvigorate a number of classical ethical
questions about our ethical duties to honor and remember the dead, it
also renews questions about whether our moral identities can persist
after our embodied identities expire, and whether the dead have ongoing
interests in their social presence or reputation (Stokes 2012).


Mitch Parsell (2008) has raised concerns about the unique
temptations of ‘narrowcast’ social networking communities
that are “composed of those just like yourself, whatever your
opinion, personality or prejudices.” (41) He worries that among
the affordances of Web 2.0 tools is a tendency to constrict our
identities to a closed set of communal norms that perpetuate increased
polarization, prejudice and insularity. He admits that in
theory the many-to-many or one-to-many relations enabled by SNS
allow for exposure to a greater variety of opinions and attitudes, but
in practice Parsell worries that they often have the opposite
effect. Building from de Laat (2006), who suggests that members of
virtual communities embrace a distinctly hyperactive style of
communication to compensate for diminished informational cues, Parsell
claims that in the absence of the full range of personal identifiers
evident through face-to-face contact, SNS may also promote the
deindividuation of personal identity by exaggerating and
reinforcing the significance of singular shared traits (liberal,
conservative, gay, Catholic, etc.) that lead us to see ourselves and
our SNS contacts more as representatives of a group than as unique
persons (2008, 46).


Parsell also notes the existence of inherently pernicious
identities and communities that may be enabled or enhanced by some Web
2.0 tools—he cites the example of apotemnophiliacs, or would-be
amputees, who use such resources to create mutually supportive networks
in which their self-destructive desires receive validation (2008, 48).
Related concerns have been raised about “Pro-ANA” sites
that provide mutually supportive networks for anorexics seeking
information and tools to allow them to perpetuate and police disordered
identities (Giles 2006; Manders-Huits 2010). While Parsell believes
that certain Web 2.0 affordances enable corrupt and destructive
varieties of personal freedom, he claims that other Web 2.0 tools offer
corresponding solutions; for example, he describes Facebook’s
reliance on long-lived profiles linked to real-world identities as a
way of combating deindividuation and promoting responsible contribution
to the community (2008, 54).


Such tools, however, come at some cost to user autonomy—a value
that in other circumstances is critical to respecting the ethical
demands of identity, as noted by Noemi Manders-Huits (2010).
Manders-Huits explores the tension between the way in which SNS treat
users as profiled and forensically reidentifiable “objects of
(algorithmic) computation” (2010, 52) while at the same time
offering those users an attractive space for ongoing identity
construction. She argues that SNS developers have a duty to protect and
promote the interests of their users in autonomously constructing and
managing their own moral and practical identities.


The ethical concern about SNS constraints on user autonomy is also
voiced by Bakardjieva and Gaden (2012) who note that whether they wish
their identities to be formed and used in this manner or not, the
online selves of SNS users are constituted by the categories
established by SNS developers, and ranked and evaluated according to
the currency which primarily drives the narrow “moral
economy” of SNS communities: popularity (2012, 410). They note,
however, that users are not rendered wholly powerless by this schema;
users retain, and many exercise, “the liberty to make informed
choices and negotiate the terms of their self constitution and
interaction with others,” (2012, 411) whether by employing means
to resist the “commercial imperatives” of SNS sites (ibid.)
or by deliberately restricting the scope and extent of their personal
SNS practices.


SNS such as Facebook can also be viewed as enabling authenticity in
important ways. While the ‘Timeline’ feature (which
displays my entire online personal history for all my friends to see)
can prompt me to ‘edit’ my past, it can also prompt me to
face up to and assimilate into my self-conception thoughts and actions
that might otherwise be conveniently forgotten. The messy collision of
my family, friends and coworkers on Facebook can be managed with
various tools offered by the site, allowing me to direct posts only to
specific sub-networks that I define. But the far simpler and less
time-consuming strategy is to come to terms with the
collision—allowing each network member to get a glimpse of who I
am to others, while at the same time asking myself whether these
expanded presentations project a person that is more multidimensional
and interesting, or one that is manifestly insincere. As Tamara Wandel
and Anthony Beavers put it:


I am thus no longer radically free to engage in creating a
completely fictive self, I must become someone real, not who I really
am pregiven from the start, but who I am allowed to be and what I am
able to negotiate in the careful dynamic between who I want to be and
who my friends from these multiple constituencies perceive me, allow
me, and need me to be. (2011, 93)


Even so, Dean Cocking (2008) argues that many online social
environments, by amplifying active aspects of self-presentation under
our direct control, compromise the important function of
passive modes of embodied self-presentation beyond our
conscious control, such as body language, facial expression, and
spontaneous displays of emotion (130). He regards these as important
indicators of character that play a critical role in how others see us,
and by extension, how we come to understand ourselves through
others’ perceptions and reactions. If Cocking’s view is
correct, then as long as SNS continue to privilege text-based and
asynchronous communications, our ability to use them to cultivate and
express authentic identities may be significantly hampered.


Ethical preoccupations with the impact of SNS on our authentic
self-constitution and representation may also be regarded as assuming a
false dichotomy between online and offline identities; the
informational theory of personal identity offered by Luciano Floridi
(2011) problematizes this distinction. Soraj Hongladarom (2011) employs
such an informational metaphysic to deny that any clear boundary can be
drawn between our offline selves and our selves as cultivated through
SNS. Instead, our personal identities online and off are taken as
externally constituted by our informational relations to other selves,
events and objects.


Likewise, Charles Ess makes a link between relational models of the
self found in Aristotle, Confucius and many contemporary feminist
thinkers and emerging notions of the networked individual as a
“smeared-out self” (2010, 111) constituted by a shifting
web of embodied and informational relations. Ess points out that by
undermining the atomic and dualistic model of the self upon which
Western liberal democracies are founded, this new conception of the
self forces us to reassess traditional philosophical approaches to
ethical concerns about privacy and autonomy—and may even
promote the emergence of a much-needed “global information
ethics” (2010, 112). Yet he worries that our ‘smeared-out
selves’ may lose coherence as the relations that constitute us
are increasingly multiplied and scattered among a vast and expanding
web of networked channels. Can such selves retain the capacities of
critical rationality required for the exercise of liberal democracy, or
will our networked selves increasingly be characterized by political
and intellectual passivity, hampered in self-governance by
“shorter attention spans and less capacity to engage with
critical argument” (2010, 114)? Ess suggests that we hope for,
and work to enable the emergence of, ‘hybrid selves’ that
cultivate the individual moral and practical virtues needed to flourish
within our networked and embodied relations (2010, 116).
3.3 Friendship, Virtue and the Good Life on Social Networking Services


SNS can facilitate many types of relational connections: LinkedIn
encourages social relations organized around our professional lives,
Twitter is useful for creating lines of communication between ordinary
individuals and figures of public interest, MySpace was for a time a
popular way for musicians to promote themselves and communicate with
their fans, and Facebook, which began as a way to link university
cohorts and now connects people across the globe, has seen a
surge in business profiles aimed at establishing links to existing and
future customers. Yet the overarching relational concept in the SNS
universe has been, and continues to be, the ‘friend,’ as
underscored by the now-common use of this term as a verb to refer to
acts of instigating or confirming relationships on SNS.


This appropriation and expansion of the concept ‘friend’
by SNS has provoked a great deal of scholarly interest from
philosophers and social scientists, more so than any other ethical
concern except perhaps privacy. Early concerns about SNS friendship
centered on the expectation that such sites would be used primarily to
build ‘virtual’ friendships between physically separated
individuals lacking a ‘real-world’ or
‘face-to-face’ connection. This perception was an
understandable extrapolation from earlier patterns of Internet
sociality, patterns that had prompted philosophical worries about
whether online friendships could ever be ‘as good as the real
thing’ or were doomed to be pale substitutes for embodied
‘face to face’ connections (Cocking and Matthews 2000).
This view is robustly opposed by Adam Briggle (2008), who notes that
online friendships might enjoy certain unique advantages. For example,
Briggle asserts that friendships formed online might be more candid
than offline ones, thanks to the sense of security provided by physical
distance (2008, 75). He also notes the way in which asynchronous
written communications can promote more deliberate and thoughtful
exchanges (2008, 77).


These sorts of questions about how online friendships measure up to
offline ones, along with questions about whether or to what extent
online friendships encroach upon users’ commitments to embodied,
‘real-world’ relations with friends, family members and
communities, defined the ethical problem-space of online friendship as
SNS began to emerge. But it did not take long for empirical studies of
actual SNS usage trends to force a profound rethinking of this
problem-space. Within five years of Facebook’s launch, it was
evident that a significant majority of SNS users were relying on these
sites primarily to maintain and enhance relationships with those with
whom they also had a strong offline connection—including close
family members, high-school and college friends and co-workers
(Ellison, Steinfeld and Lampe 2007; Ito et al. 2009; Smith 2011). Nor
are SNS used to facilitate purely online exchanges—many SNS users
today rely on the sites’ functionalities to organize everything
from cocktail parties to movie nights, outings to athletic or cultural
events, family reunions and community meetings. Mobile SNS applications
such as Foursquare, Loopt and Google Latitude amplify this type of
functionality further, by enabling friends to locate one another in
their community in real-time, enabling spontaneous meetings at
restaurants, bars and shops that would otherwise happen only by
coincidence.


Yet lingering ethical concerns remain about the way in which SNS can
distract users from the needs of those in their immediate physical
surroundings (consider the widely lamented trend of users obsessively
checking their social media feeds during family dinners, business
meetings, romantic dates and symphony performances). Such phenomena,
which scholars like Sherry Turkle (2011) worry are indicative of a
growing cultural tolerance for being ‘alone together,’
bring a new complexity to earlier philosophical concerns about the
emergence of a zero-sum game between offline relationships and their
virtual SNS competitors. They have also prompted a shift of ethical
focus away from the question of whether online relationships are
“real” friendships (Cocking and Matthews 2000), to how
well the real friendships we bring to SNS are being served there
(Vallor 2012). The debate over the value and quality of online
friendships continues (Sharp 2012; Froding and Peterson 2012; Elder
2014); in large part because the typical pattern of those friendships,
like most social networking phenomena, continues to evolve. 


Such concerns intersect with broader philosophical questions about
whether and how the classical ethical ideal of ‘the good
life’ can be engaged in the 21st century. Pak-Hang
Wong claims that this question requires us to broaden the standard
approach to information ethics from a narrow focus on the
“right/the just” (2010, 29) that defines ethical action
negatively (e.g., in terms of violations of privacy,
copyright, etc.) to a framework that conceives of a positive
ethical trajectory for our technological choices. Edward Spence (2011)
further suggests that to adequately address the significance of SNS and
related information and communication technologies for the good life,
we must also expand the scope of philosophical inquiry beyond its
present concern with narrowly interpersonal ethics to the more
universal ethical question of prudential wisdom. Do SNS and
related technologies help us to cultivate the broader intellectual
virtue of knowing what it is to live well, and how to best pursue it?
Or do they tend to impede its development?


This concern about prudential wisdom and the good life is part of a
growing philosophical interest in using the resources of classical
virtue ethics to evaluate the impact of SNS and related technologies,
whether these resources are broadly Aristotelian (Vallor 2010),
Confucian (Wong 2012) or both (Ess 2008). This program of research
promotes inquiry into the impact of SNS not merely on the cultivation
of prudential virtue, but on the development of a host of other moral
and communicative virtues, such as honesty, patience, justice, loyalty,
benevolence and empathy.
3.4 Democracy, Freedom and Social Networking Services in the Public Sphere


As is the case with privacy, identity, community and friendship on
SNS, ethical debates about the impact of SNS on civil discourse,
freedom and democracy in the public sphere must be seen as extensions
of a broader discussion about the political implications of the
Internet, one that predates Web 2.0 standards. Much of the literature
on this subject focuses on the question of whether the Internet
encourages or hampers the free exercise of deliberative public reason,
in a manner informed by Jürgen Habermas’s (1992/1998) account of
discourse ethics and deliberative democracy in the public sphere (Ess
1996 and 2005b; Dahlberg 2001; Bohman 2008). A related topic of
concern is the potential of the Internet to fragment the public sphere
by encouraging the formation of a plurality of ‘echo
chambers’ and ‘filter bubbles’: informational silos
for like-minded individuals who deliberately shield themselves from
exposure to alternative views. The worry is that such insularity will
promote extremism and the reinforcement of ill-founded opinions, while
also preventing citizens of a democracy from recognizing their shared
interests and experiences (Sunstein 2008). Finally, there is the
question of the extent to which SNS can facilitate political activism,
civil disobedience and popular revolutions resulting in the overthrow
of authoritarian regimes.  Commonly referenced examples include the
2011 North African revolutions in Egypt and Tunisia, with which
Facebook and Twitter were respectively associated (Marturano 2011;
Frick and Oberprantacher 2011).


When SNS in particular are considered in light of these questions,
some distinctive considerations arise. First, sites like Facebook and
Twitter (as opposed to narrower SNS utilities such as LinkedIn)
facilitate the sharing of, and exposure to, an extremely diverse range
of types of discourse. On any given day on Facebook a user
may encounter in her NewsFeed a link to an article in a respected
political magazine followed by a video of a cat in a silly costume,
followed by a link to a new scientific study, followed by a lengthy
status update someone has posted about their lunch, followed by a
photo of a popular political figure overlaid with a clever and
subversive caption.  Vacation photos are mixed in with political
rants, invitations to cultural events, birthday reminders and
data-driven graphs created to undermine common political, moral or
economic beliefs. Thus while a user has a tremendous amount of liberty
to choose which forms of discourse to pay closer attention to, and
tools with which to hide or prioritize the posts of certain members of
her network, she cannot easily shield herself from at least a
superficial acquaintance with a diversity of private and public
concerns of her fellows. This has the potential to offer at least some
measure of protection against the extreme insularity and fragmentation
of discourse that is incompatible with the public sphere.


Second, while users can often ‘defriend’ or systematically
hide the posts of those with whom they tend to disagree, the high
visibility and perceived value of social connections on these sites
makes this option less attractive as a consistent strategy.
Philosophers of technology often speak of the affordances or
gradients of particular technologies in given contexts (Vallor
2010) insofar as they make certain patterns of use more attractive or
convenient for users (while not rendering alternative patterns
impossible). In this respect, social networks like those on Facebook,
in which users must take actions somewhat contrary to the site’s
purpose in order to effectively shield themselves from unwelcome or
contrary opinions, may be viewed as having a modestly democratic
gradient in comparison to networks deliberately constructed
around a particular political cause or identity. However, this
gradient may be undermined by Facebook’s own algorithms, which curate
users’ News Feed in ways that are opaque to them, and which almost
certainly prioritize the appeal of the ‘user experience’
over civic benefit or the integrity of the public sphere.


Third, one must ask whether SNS can skirt the dangers of a
plebiscite model of democratic discourse, in which minority voices are
inevitably dispersed and drowned out by the many. Certainly, compared
to the ‘one-to-many’ channels of communication favored by
traditional media, SNS facilitate a ‘many-to-many’ model of
communication that appears to lower the barriers to participation in
civic discourse for everyone, including the marginalized. However, if
one’s ‘Facebook friends’ or people you
‘follow’ are sufficiently numerous, then minority opinions
may still be heard as lone voices in the wilderness, perhaps valued for
providing some ‘spice’ and novelty to the broader
conversation but failing to receive serious public consideration of
their merits. Existing SNS lack the institutional structures necessary
to ensure that minority voices enjoy not only free, but
qualitatively equal access to the deliberative function of the
public sphere.


Fourth, one must also consider the quality of informational
exchanges on SNS and the extent to which they promote a genuinely
dialogical public sphere marked by the exercise of critical
rationality. While we have noted above that exposure to well-informed
opinions and reliable evidential sources is facilitated by many of the
most popular SNS, exposure does not guarantee attention or
consumption.  For example, the number of contacts in the average
Facebook user’s network is sufficiently large to make it virtually
impossible for a typical user to see every relevant post even among
those which Facebook’s algorithm selects for their News Feed, and only
a very small number of those may be closely attended or responded
to. Many scholars worry that in SNS environments, substantive
contributions to civic discourse increasingly function as flotsam on a
virtual sea of trivially amusing or shallow content, weakening the
civic habits and practices of critical rationality that we need in
order to function as well-informed and responsible democratic citizens
(Carr 2010; Ess 2010). Furthermore, while the most popular SNS do
promote norms of responsive practice, these norms tend to privilege
brevity and immediate impact over substance and depth in
communication; Vallor (2012) suggests that this bodes poorly for the
cultivation of those communicative virtues essential to a flourishing
public sphere. This worry is only reinforced by empirical data
suggesting that SNS perpetuate the ‘Spiral of Silence’ phenomenon that
results in the passive suppression of divergent views on matters of
important political or civic concern (Hampton et. al. 2014). In a
related critique, Frick and Oberprantacher (2011) claim that the
ability of SNS to facilitate public ‘sharing’ can obscure
the deep ambiguity between sharing as “a promising, active
participatory process” and “interpassive, disjointed acts
of having trivia shared.” (2011, 22)
A fifth issue for online democracy relates to the contentious
debate emerging on social media platforms about the extent to which
controversial or unpopular speech ought to be tolerated or punished by
private actors, especially when the consequences manifest in
traditional offline contexts and spaces such as the university. For
example, the norms of academic freedom in the U.S. have been greatly
destabilized by the ‘Salaita Affair’ and several other
cases in which academics were censured or otherwise punished by their
institutions as a result of their controversial social media posts. It
remains to be seen what equilibrium can be found between civility and
free expression in communities increasingly mediated by SNS
communications.


There is also the question of whether SNS will necessarily preserve a
democratic ethos as they come to reflect increasingly pluralistic and
international social networks.  The current split between networks
such as Facebook and Twitter dominant in Western liberal society and
dedicated SNS in countries such as China (RenRen) and Russia
(VKontakte) with more communitarian and/or authoritarian regimes may
not endure; if SNS become increasingly multinational or global in
scale, will that development tend to disseminate and enhance
democratic values and practices, dilute and weaken them, or perhaps
precipitate the recontextualization of liberal democratic values in a
new ‘global ethics’ (Ess 2010)?
 An even more pressing question is whether civic discourse and
activism on SNS will be compromised or manipulated by the commercial
interests that currently own and manage the technical
infrastructure. This concern is driven by the growing economic power
and political influence of companies in the technology sector, and the
potentially disenfranchising and disempowering effects of an economic
model in which users play a fundamentally passive role (Floridi
2015). Indeed, the relationship between social media users and service
providers has become increasingly contentious, as users struggle to
demand more privacy, better data security and more effective
protections from online harassment in an economic context where they
have little or no direct bargaining power. This imbalance was
powerfully illustrated by the revelation in 2014 that Facebook
researchers had quietly conducted psychological experiments on users
without their knowledge, manipulating their moods by altering the
balance of positive or negative items in their News Feeds (Goel
2014). The study adds yet another dimension to growing concerns about
the ethics and validity of social science research that relies on
SNS-generated data (Buchanan and Zimmer 2012).
Ironically, in the power struggle between users and SNS providers,
social networking platforms themselves have become the primary
battlefield, where users vent their collective outrage in an attempt
to force service providers into responding to their demands. The
results are sometimes positive, as when Twitter users, after years of
complaining, finally shamed the company in 2015 into providing better
reporting tools for online harassment. Yet by its nature the process
is chaotic and often controversial, as when later that year, Reddit
users successfully demanded the ouster of CEO Ellen Pao, under whose
leadership Reddit had banned some of its more repugnant ‘subreddit’
forums (such as “Fat People Hate,” devoted to the shaming
and harassment of overweight persons.)

The only clear consensus emerging from the considerations outlined
here is that if SNS are going to facilitate any enhancement of a
Habermasian public sphere, or the civic virtues and praxes of reasoned
discourse that any functioning public sphere must presuppose, then
users will have to actively mobilize themselves to exploit such an
opportunity (Frick and Oberprantacher 2011). Such mobilization may
depend upon resisting the “false sense of activity and
accomplishment” (Bar-Tura, 2010, 239) that may come from merely
clicking ‘Like’ in response to acts of meaningful
political speech, forwarding calls to sign petitions that one never
gets around to signing oneself, or simply ‘following’ an
outspoken social critic on Twitter whose ‘tweeted’ calls
to action are drowned in a tide of corporate announcements, celebrity
product endorsements and personal commentaries. Some argue that it
will also require the cultivation of new norms and virtues of online
civic-mindedness, without which online ‘democracies’ will continue to
be subject to the self-destructive and irrational tyrannies of mob
behavior (Ess 2010).
3.5 Social Networking Services and Cybercrime


SNS are hosts for a broad spectrum of ‘cybercrimes’ and
related offenses, including but not limited to:
cyberbullying/cyberharassment, cyberstalking, child exploitation,
cyberextortion, cyberfraud, illegal surveillance, identity theft,
intellectual property/copyright violations, cyberespionage,
cybersabotage and cyberterrorism. Each of these forms of criminal or
antisocial behavior has a history that well pre-dates Web 2.0
standards, and perhaps as a consequence, philosophers have tended to
leave the specific correlations between cybercrime and SNS as an
empirical matter for social scientists, law enforcement and Internet
security firms to investigate. Nevertheless, cybercrime is an enduring
topic of philosophical interest for the broader field of computer
ethics, and the migration to and evolution of such crime on SNS
platforms raises new and distinctive ethical issues.

Among those of great ethical importance is the question of how SNS
providers ought to respond to government demands for user data for
investigative or counterterrorism purposes. SNS providers are caught
between the public interest in crime prevention and their need to
preserve the trust and loyalty of their users, many of whom view
governments as overreaching in their attempts to secure records of
online activity. Many companies have opted to favor user security by
employing end-to-end encryption of SNS exchanges, much to the chagrin
of government agencies who insist upon ‘backdoor’ access
to user data in the interests of public safety and national security
(Friedersdorf 2015).

Another emerging ethical concern is the increasingly political
character of cyberharassment and cyberstalking. In the U.S., women who
speak out about the lack of diversity in the tech and videogame
industries have been particular targets, in some cases forcing them to
cancel speaking appearances or leave their homes due to physical
threats after their addresses and other personal info were posted
online (a practice known as ‘doxxing’). A new political
vernacular has emerged among online contingents such as
‘MRAs’ (men’s rights activists), who perceive themselves
as locked in a fierce ideological battle against those they derisively
label as ‘SJWs’ (‘social justice warriors’):
persons who advocate for equality, security and diversity in and
through online mediums. For victims of doxxing and associated
cyberthreats of physical violence, traditional law enforcement bodies
offer scant protection, as these agencies are often ill-equipped or
unmotivated to police the blurry boundary between virtual and physical
harms.
4. Social Networking Services and Metaethical Issues


A host of metaethical questions are raised by the rapid emergence of
SNS as a dominant medium of interpersonal connection. For example, SNS
lend new data to the existing philosophical debate (Tavani 2005; Moor
2008) about whether classical ethical traditions such as
utilitarianism, Kantian ethics or virtue ethics possess sufficient
resources for illuminating the ethical implications of emerging
information technologies, or whether we require a new ethical framework
to handle such phenomena. One novel approach commonly employed to
analyze SNS (Light, McGrath and Gribble 2008; Skog 2011) is Philip
Brey’s (2000) disclosive ethics. This
interdisciplinary ethical framework aims to analyze how particular
moral values are embedded in specific technologies, allowing
for the disclosure of otherwise opaque tendencies of a technology to
shape moral practice. Ess (2006) has suggested that a new, pluralistic
“global information ethics” may be the appropriate context
from which to view emerging information technologies. Other scholars
have suggested that technologies such as SNS invite renewed attention
to existing ethical approaches such as pragmatism (van den Eede 2010),
virtue ethics (Vallor 2010) feminist or care ethics (Hamington 2010;
Puotinen 2011) that have often been neglected by applied ethicists in
favor of conventional utilitarian and deontological resources.


A related metaethical project relevant to SNS is the development of
an explicitly intercultural information ethics (Ess 2005a;
Capurro 2008; Honglaradom and Britz 2010). SNS and other emerging
information technologies do not reliably confine themselves to national
or cultural boundaries, and this creates a particular challenge for
applied ethicists. For example, SNS practices in different countries
must be analyzed against a conceptual background that recognizes and
accommodates complex differences in moral norms and practices
concerning, for example, privacy (Capurro 2005; Hongladarom 2007).
Other SNS phenomena that one might expect to benefit from intercultural
analysis and that are relevant to the ethical considerations outlined
in Section 3 include: varied cultural patterns and preference/tolerance
for affective display, argument and debate, personal exposure,
expressions of political, interfamilial or cultural criticism,
religious expression and sharing of intellectual property.
Alternatively, the very possibility of a coherent information ethics
may come under challenge, for example, from a constructivist view that
emerging socio-technological practices like SNS continually
redefine ethical norms—such that our analyses of SNS and
related technologies are not only doomed to operate from shifting
ground, but from ground that is being shifted by the intended
object of our ethical analysis.


Finally, there are pressing practical concerns about whether and how
philosophers can actually have an impact on the ethical profile of
emerging technologies such as SNS. If philosophers direct their
ethical analyses only to other philosophers, then such analyses may
function simply as ethical postmortems of human-technology relations,
with no opportunity to actually pre-empt, reform or redirect unethical
technological practices. But to whom else can, or should, these
ethical concerns be directed: SNS users? Regulatory bodies and
political institutions? SNS software developers? How can the
theoretical content and practical import of these analyses be made
accessible to these varied audiences? What motivating force are they
likely to have? The profound urgency of such questions becomes
apparent once we recognize that unlike those ‘life or
death’ ethical dilemmas with which applied ethicists are
understandably often preoccupied (e.g., abortion, euthanasia and
capital punishment), emerging information technologies such as SNS
have in a very short time worked themselves into the daily moral
fabric of virtually all of our lives, transforming the social
landscape and the moral habits and practices with which we
navigate it. The ethical concerns illuminated here are, in a very real
sense, anything but ‘academic,’ and neither philosophers
nor the broader human community can afford the luxury of treating them
as such.
