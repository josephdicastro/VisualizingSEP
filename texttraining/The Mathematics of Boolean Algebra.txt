Boolean algebra is the algebra of two-valued logic with only
sentential connectives, or equivalently of algebras of sets under
union and complementation. The rigorous concept is that of a certain
kind of algebra, analogous to the mathematical notion of a
group. This concept has roots and applications in logic
(Lindenbaum-Tarski algebras and model theory), set theory (fields of
sets), topology (totally disconnected compact Hausdorff spaces),
foundations of set theory (Boolean-valued models), measure theory
(measure algebras), functional analysis (algebras of projections),
and ring theory (Boolean rings).  The study of Boolean algebras
has several aspects: structure theory, model theory of Boolean
algebras, decidability and undecidability questions for the class of
Boolean algebras, and the indicated applications. In addition,
although not explained here, there are connections to other logics,
subsumption as a part of special kinds of algebraic logic, finite
Boolean algebras and switching circuit theory,  and Boolean
matrices.
 
1. Definition and simple properties


 A Boolean algebra (BA) is a set AAA together with binary
operations + and ⋅⋅\cdot and a unary operation −−-, and elements
0, 1 of AAA such that the following laws hold: commutative and
associative laws for addition and multiplication, distributive laws
both for multiplication over addition and for addition over
multiplication, and the following special laws:
(x+(x⋅y)=x(x⋅(x+y)=xx+(−x)=1x⋅(−x)=0(x+(x⋅y)=x(x⋅(x+y)=xx+(−x)=1x⋅(−x)=0\begin{align*}
(x + (x \cdot y) &amp;= x \\
(x \cdot(x + y) &amp;= x \\
x + (-x) &amp;= 1 \\
x \cdot(-x) &amp;= 0
\end{align*}

 These laws are better understood in terms of the basic example of a
BA, consisting of a collection AAA of subsets of a set XXX closed
under the operations of union, intersection, complementation with
respect to XXX, with members ∅∅\varnothing and XXX. One can
easily derive many elementary laws from these axioms, keeping in mind
this example for motivation. Any BA has a natural partial order
≤≤\le defined upon it by saying that x≤yx≤yx \le y if and only if x+y=yx+y=yx
+ y = y.  This corresponds in our main example to ⊆⊆\subseteq. Of
special importance is the two-element BA, formed by taking the set
XXX to have just one element. The two-element BA shows the direct
connection with elementary logic. The two members, 0 and 1, correspond
to falsity and truth respectively. The Boolean operations then express
the ordinary truth tables for disjunction (with +)+)+), conjunction
(with ⋅)⋅)\cdot) and negation (with −)−)-). An important elementary
result is that an equation holds in all BAs if and only if it holds in
the two-element BA. Next, we define x⊕y=(x⋅−y)+(y⋅−x)x⊕y=(x⋅−y)+(y⋅−x)x \oplus y = (x \cdot -y) + (y
\cdot -x). Then AAA together with ⊕⊕\oplus and ⋅⋅\cdot, along
with 0 and 1, forms a ring with identity in which every element is
idempotent. Conversely, given such a ring, with addition ⊕⊕\oplus
and multiplication, define x+y=x⊕y⊕(x⋅y)x+y=x⊕y⊕(x⋅y)x + y = x \oplus y \oplus(x \cdot y)
and −x=1⊕x−x=1⊕x-x = 1 \oplus x. This makes the ring into a BA. These two
processes are inverses of one another, and show that the theory of
Boolean algebras and of rings with identity in which every element is
idempotent are definitionally equivalent. This puts the theory of BAs
into a standard object of research in algebra. An atom in a BA is a
nonzero element aaa such that there is no element bbb with 0<b<a0<b<a0 \lt
b \lt a. A BA is atomic if every nonzero element of the BA is above
an atom. Finite BAs are atomic, but so are many infinite BAs. Under
the partial order ≤≤\le above, x+yx+yx + y is the least upper bound of
xxx and yyy, and x⋅yx⋅yx \cdot y is the greatest lower bound of
xxx and yyy. We can generalize this: ΣXΣX\Sigma X is the least
upper bound of a set XXX of elements, and ΠXΠX\Pi X is the greatest
lower bound of a set XXX of elements. These do not exist for all
sets in all Boolean algebras; if they do always exist, the Boolean
algebra is said to be complete.
2. The elementary algebraic theory

 Several algebraic constructions have obvious definitions and simple
properties for BAs: subalgebras, homomorphisms, isomorphisms, and
direct products (even of infinitely many algebras). Some other
standard algebraic constructions are more peculiar to BAs. An ideal in
a BA is a subset III closed under +, with 0 as a member, and such
that if a≤b∈Ia≤b∈Ia \le b \in I, then also a∈Ia∈Ia \in I. Although not
immediately obvious, this is the same as the ring-theoretic
concept. There is a dual notion of a filter (with no counterpart in
rings in general). A filter is a subset FFF closed under ⋅⋅\cdot ,
having 1 as a member, and such that if a≥b∈Fa≥b∈Fa \ge b \in F, then also
a∈Fa∈Fa \in F. An ultrafilter on AAA is a filter FFF with the
following properties: 0∉F0∉F0 \not\in F, and for any a∈Aa∈Aa \in A, either
a∈Fa∈Fa \in F or −a∈F−a∈F-a \in F. For any a∈Aa∈Aa \in A, let
S(a)={F:F is an ultrafilter on A and a∈F}.S(a)={F:F is an ultrafilter on A and a∈F}.
S(a)= \{F : F \text{ is an ultrafilter on } A \text{ and } a \in F\}.

 

Then SSS is an isomorphism onto a BA of subsets of the set XXX of
all ultrafilters on AAA. This establishes the basic Stone
representation theorem, and clarifies the origin of BAs as concrete
algebras of sets. Moreover, the sets S(a)S(a)S(a) can be declared to be a
base for a topology on XXX, and this turns XXX into a totally
disconnected compact Hausdorff space. This establishes a one-one
correspondence between the class of BAs and the class of such
spaces. As a consequence, used very much in the theory of BAs, many
topological theorems and concepts have consequences for BAs. If xxx
is an element of a BA, we let 0x=−x0x=−x0x = -x and 1x=x1x=x1x = x. If
(x(x(x(0), …x(m−1))…x(m−1))\ldots x(m - 1)) is a finite sequence of elements of a
BA AAA, then every element of the subalgebra of AAA generated by
{x(0),…,x(m−1)}{x(0),…,x(m−1)}\{x(0), \ldots, x(m - 1)\} can be written as a sum of monomials
e(0)x(0)⋅…⋅e(m−1)x(m−1)e(0)x(0)⋅…⋅e(m−1)x(m−1)e(0)x(0) \cdot \ldots \cdot e(m - 1)x(m - 1) for eee in some set
of functions mapping m={0,…,m−1}m={0,…,m−1}m = \{0,\ldots , m - 1\} into 2={0,1}2={0,1}2 = \{0,
1\}. This is an algebraic expression of the disjunctive normal form
theorem of sentential logic. A function fff from a set XXX of
generators of a BA AAA into a BA BBB can be extended to a
homomorphism if and only if
e(0)x(0)⋅…⋅e(m−1)x(m−1)=0e(0)x(0)⋅…⋅e(m−1)x(m−1)=0
e(0)x(0) \cdot \ldots \cdot e(m - 1)x(m - 1) = 0

 always implies that 
e(0)f(x(0))⋅…⋅e(m−1)f(x(m−1))=0.e(0)f(x(0))⋅…⋅e(m−1)f(x(m−1))=0.e(0)f(x(0)) \cdot \ldots \cdot e(m - 1)f(x(m - 1)) = 0.


This is Sikorski’s extension criterion. Every BA AAA can be
embedded in a complete BA BBB in such a way that every element of
BBB is the least upper bound of a set of elements of AAA. BBB is
unique up to AAA-isomorphism, and is called the completion of
AAA. If fff is a homomorphism from a BA AAA into a complete BA
BBB, and if AAA is a subalgebra of CCC, then fff can be
extended to a homomorphism of CCC into BBB. This is
Sikorski’s extension theorem. Another general algebraic notion
which applies to Boolean algebras is the notion of a free
algebra. This can be concretely constructed for BAs. Namely, the free
BA on κκ\kappa is the BA of closed-open subsets of the two element
discrete space raised to the κκ\kappa power.
3. Special classes of Boolean algebras


 There are many special classes of Boolean algebra which are important
both for the intrinsic theory of BAs and for
applications:

Atomic BAs, already mentioned above.
Atomless BAs, which are defined to be
BAs without any atoms. For example, any infinite
free BA is atomless.
Complete BAs, defined above. These are specially
important in the foundations of set theory.
Interval algebras. These are derived from linearly ordered sets
(L,<)(L,<)(L, \lt) with a first element as follows. One takes the smallest
 algebra of subsets of LLL containing all of the half-open
intervals [a,b)a,b)a, b) with aaa in LLL and
bbb in LLL or equal to ∞∞\infty. These BAs are useful in
the study of Lindenbaum-Tarski algebras. Every countable BA is
isomorphic to an interval algebra, and thus a countable BA can be
described by indicating an ordered set such that it is isomorphic to
the corresponding interval algebra.
Tree algebras. A tree is a partially ordered set (T,<)(T,<)(T, \lt) in
which the set of predecessors of any element is well-ordered.  Given
such a tree, one considers the algebra of subsets of TTT generated
by all sets of the form {b:a≤b}{b:a≤b}\{b : a \le b\} for some aaa in
TTT.
Superatomic BAs. These are BAs
which are not only atomic, but are such that each subalgebra and
homomorphic image is atomic.

4. Structure theory and cardinal functions on Boolean algebras


 Much of the deeper theory of Boolean algebras, telling about their
structure and classification, can be formulated in terms of certain
functions defined for all Boolean algebras, with infinite cardinals
as values. We define some of the more important of these cardinal
functions, and state some of the known structural facts, mostly
formulated in terms of them

The cellularity c(A)c(A)c(A) of a BA is the supremum of
the cardinalities of sets of pairwise disjoint elements of AAA.

A subset XXX of a BA AAA is independent if
XXX is a set of free generators of the subalgebra that it
generates. The independence of AAA is the supremum of
cardinalities of independent subsets of AAA.
A subset XXX of a BA AAA is dense in AAA if
every nonzero element of AAA is ≥≥\ge a nonzero element of
XXX. The ππ\pi-weight of AAA is the smallest cardinality
of a dense subset of AAA.
Two elements x,yx,yx, y of AAA are incomparable
if neither one is ≤≤\le the other. The supremum of cardinalities of
subset XXX of AAA consisting of pairwise incomparable
elements is the incomparability of AAA.
A subset XXX of AAA is irredundant if no element of
XXX is in the subalgebra generated by the others.


 An important fact concerning cellularity is the Erdős-Tarski
theorem: if the cellularity of a BA is a singular cardinal, then there
actually is a set of disjoint elements of that size; for cellularity
regular limit (inaccessible), there are counterexamples. Every
infinite complete BA has an independent subset of the same size as the
algebra. Every infinite BA AAA has an irredundant incomparable
subset whose size is the ππ\pi-weight of AAA. Every interval
algebra has countable independence. A superatomic algebra does not
even have an infinite independent subset. Every tree algebra can be
embedded in an interval algebra. A BA with only the identity
automorphism is called rigid. There exist rigid complete BAs, also
rigid interval algebras and rigid tree algebras. 

More recently, many cardinal functions of min-max type have been
studied. For example, small independence is the smallest size of an
infinite maximal independent set; and small cellularity is the
smallest size of an infinite partition of unity.
5. Decidability and undecidability questions


 A basic result of Tarski is that the elementary theory of Boolean
algebras is decidable. Even the theory of Boolean algebras with a
distinguished ideal is decidable. On the other hand, the theory of a
Boolean algebra with a distinguished subalgebra is undecidable. Both
the decidability results and undecidablity results extend in various
ways to Boolean algebras in extensions of first-order logic.
6. Lindenbaum-Tarski algebras


 A very important construction, which carries over to many logics and
many algebras other than Boolean algebras, is the construction of a
Boolean algebra associated with the sentences in some logic. The
simplest case is sentential logic. Here there are sentence symbols,
and common connectives building up longer sentences from them:
disjunction, conjunction, and negation. Given a set AAA of sentences
in this language, two sentences sss and ttt are equivalent modulo
AAA if and only if the biconditional between them is a logical
consequence of AAA. The equivalence classes can be made into a BA
such that + corresponds to disjunction, ⋅⋅\cdot to conjunction, and
−−- to negation. Any BA is isomorphic to one of this form. One can
do something similar for a first-order theory. Let TTT be a
first-order theory in a first-order language LLL. We call formulas
ϕϕ\phi and ψψ\psi equivalent provided that T⊢ϕ↔ψT⊢ϕ↔ψT \vdash \phi
\leftrightarrow \psi.  The equivalence class of a sentence ϕϕ\phi
is denoted by [ϕϕ\phi]. Let AAA be the collection of all
equivalence classes under this equivalence relation. We can make AAA
into a BA by the following definitions, which are easily
justified:
[ϕ]+[ψ]=[ϕ∨ψ][ϕ]⋅[ψ]=[ϕ∧ψ]−[ϕ]=[¬ϕ]0=[F]1=[T][ϕ]+[ψ]=[ϕ∨ψ][ϕ]⋅[ψ]=[ϕ∧ψ]−[ϕ]=[¬ϕ]0=[F]1=[T]\begin{align*}
[\phi] + [\psi] &amp;= [\phi \vee \psi] \\
[\phi] \cdot[\psi] &amp;= [\phi \wedge \psi] \\
-[\phi] &amp;= [\neg \phi] \\
0 &amp;= [\mathrm{F}] \\
1 &amp;= [\mathrm{T}]
\end{align*}


 Every BA is isomorphic to a Lindenbaum-Tarski
algebra. However, one of the most important uses of these classical
Lindenbaum-Tarski algebras is to describe them for important theories
(usually decidable theories). For countable languages this can be
done by describing their isomorphic interval algebras. Generally this
gives a thorough knowledge of the theory. Some examples are:



Theory
Isomorphic to interval algebra on


(1)
essentially undecidable theory
QQ\mathbb{Q}, the rationals


(2)
BAs
N×NN×N\mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N},
 square of the positive integers, ordered lexicographically


(3)
linear orders
A×QA×Q\mathbf{A} \times \mathbb{Q} ordered antilexicographically,
 where AA\mathbf{A} is NNNN\mathbb{N}^\mathbb{N}
 in its usual order


(4)
abelian groups
(Q+A)×Q(Q+A)×Q(\mathbb{Q} + \mathbf{A}) \times \mathbb{Q}


7. Boolean-valued models


 In model theory, one can take values in any complete BA rather than
the two-element BA. This Boolean-valued model theory was developed
around 1950–1970, but has not been worked on much since. But a
special case, Boolean-valued models for set theory, is very much at
the forefront of current research in set theory. It actually forms an
equivalent way of looking at the forcing construction of Cohen, and
has some technical advantages and disadvantages. Philosophically it
seems more satisfactory than the forcing concept. We describe this
set theory case here; it will then become evident why only complete
BAs are considered. Let B be a complete BA. First we define the
Boolean valued universe V(B)V(B)V(B). The ordinary
set-theoretic universe can be identified with VVV(2), where 2
is the 2-element BA. The definition is by transfinite recursion, where
α,βα,β\alpha , \beta are ordinals and λλ\lambda is a limit ordinal:
V(B,0)=∅V(B,α+1)={f:dom(f)⊂V(B,α) and range(f)⊂B}V(B,λ)=⋃β<λV(B,β).V(B,0)=∅V(B,α+1)={f:dom(f)⊂V(B,α) and range(f)⊂B}V(B,λ)=⋃β<λV(B,β).\begin{align*}
V(B, 0) &amp;= \varnothing \\
V(B, \alpha + 1) &amp;= \{ f : \dom(f) \subset V(B, \alpha) 
     \text{ and } \range(f) \subset B \} \\
V(B, \lambda) &amp;= \bigcup_{\beta \lt \lambda} V(B, \beta).
\end{align*}


where dom(f)dom(f)\dom(f) is the domain of function fff and range(f)range(f)\range(f) is
the range of function fff. The BBB-valued universe is the proper
class V(B)V(B)V(B) which is the union of all of these VVVs. Next, one
defines by a rather complicated transfinite recursion over
well-founded sets the value of a set-theoretic formula with elements
of the Boolean valued universe assigned to its free variables:
∥x∈y∥=∑t∈dom(y)∥x=t∥⋅y(t)∥x⊆y∥=∏t∈dom(x)−x(t)+∥t∈y∥∥x=y∥=∥x⊆y∥⋅∥y⊆x∥∥¬ϕ∥=−∥ϕ∥∥ϕ∨ψ∥=∥ϕ∥+∥ψ∥∥∃xϕ(x)∥=∑a∈V(B)∥ϕ(a)∥.‖x∈y‖=∑t∈dom(y)‖x=t‖⋅y(t)‖x⊆y‖=∏t∈dom(x)−x(t)+‖t∈y‖‖x=y‖=‖x⊆y‖⋅‖y⊆x‖‖¬ϕ‖=−‖ϕ‖‖ϕ∨ψ‖=‖ϕ‖+‖ψ‖‖∃xϕ(x)‖=∑a∈V(B)‖ϕ(a)‖.\begin{align*}
\val{x \in y} &amp;= \sum_{t \in \dom(y)} \val{x=t}\cdot y(t) \\
\val{x \subseteq y} &amp;= \prod_{t \in \dom(x)} -x(t) + \val{t \in y} \\
\val{x = y} &amp;= \val{x \subseteq y} \cdot \val{y \subseteq x} \\
\val{\neg \phi} &amp;= -\val{\phi} \\
\val{\phi \vee \psi} &amp;=  \val{\phi} + \val{\psi} \\
\val{\exists x\phi(x)} &amp;= \sum_{a \in V(B)} \val{\phi(a)}.
\end{align*}
