Substructural logics are non-classical logics weaker
than classical logic, notable for the absence of structural
rules present in classical logic. These logics are motivated by
considerations from philosophy (relevant logics), linguistics (the
Lambek calculus) and computing (linear logic). In addition, techniques
from substructural logics are useful in the study of traditional
logics such as classical and intuitionistic logic. This article
provides a brief overview of the field of substructural logic. For a
more detailed introduction, complete with theorems, proofs and
examples, the reader can consult the books and articles in the
Bibliography.
 
1. Residuation


Logic is about logical consequence. As a result, the
conditional is a central notion in logic because of its
intimate connection with logical consequence. This connection is
neatly expressed in the residuation condition (also known
as the deduction theorem):
p,q⊢r if and only if p⊢q→rp,q⊢r if and only if p⊢q→r
p, q \vdash r \text{ if and only if } p \vdash q \rightarrow r



It says that rrr follows from ppp together with
qqq just when q→rq→rq \rightarrow r follows
from ppp alone. The validity of the transition from qqq
to rrr (given p)p)p) is recorded by the conditional
q→rq→rq \rightarrow r. 


This connection between the conditional and consequence is called
residuation by analogy with the case in mathematics. Consider
the connection between addition and substraction. a+b=ca+b=ca + b = c if and
only if a=c−ba=c−ba = c - b. The resulting aaa (which is c−b)c−b)c - b) is the
residual, what is left of ccc when bbb is taken
away. Another name for this connection is the deduction
theorem.


However, there the connection between consequence and the
conditional contains one extra factor. Not only is there the turnstile,
for logical consequence, and the conditional, encoding consequence
inside the language of propositions, there is also the comma,
indicating the combination of premises. We have read
“p,q⊢rp,q⊢rp, q \vdash r” as “rrr follows from ppp
together with qqq”. To combine premises is to
have a way to take them together. But how can we take them
together? It turns out that there are different ways to do so, and so,
different substructural logics. The behaviour of premise combination
varies as the behaviour of the conditional varies. In this introduction
we will consider some examples of this.
1.1 Weakening


It is one thing for ppp to be true. It is another for the
conditional q→pq→pq \rightarrow p to be true. Yet, if
‘→→\rightarrow’ is a material conditional, q→pq→pq
\rightarrow p follows from ppp. For many different reasons, we may
wish to understand how a conditional might work in
the absence of this inference. This is tied to the behaviour
of premise combination, as can be shown by this demonstration. 
p⊢pp,q⊢pp⊢q→pp⊢pp,q⊢pp⊢q→p
\cfrac{p \vdash p} 
{ \cfrac{p, q \vdash p}
  {p \vdash q \rightarrow p}
}



From the axiomatic p⊢pp⊢pp \vdash p (anything follows from
itself) we deduce that ppp follows from ppp together with
qqq, and then by residuation, p⊢q→pp⊢q→pp \vdash q \rightarrow p. If we
wish to reject the inference from ppp to q→pq→pq \rightarrow p, then
we either reject residuation, or reject the identity axiom at the
start of the proof, or we reject the first step of the proof. It is
illuminating to consider what is involved in this last option. Here,
we are to deny that ppp follows from p,qp,qp, q. In general, we are to
reject the inference rule that has this form: 
X⊢AX,Y⊢AX⊢AX,Y⊢A
\frac{X \vdash A}
 {X, Y \vdash A}



This is called the rule of weakening. The rule steps from a
stronger statement, that AAA follows from XXX to a
possibly weaker one, that AAA follows from XXX together
with YYY. 


People have offered different reasons for rejecting the rule of
weakening, depending on the interpretation of consequence and premise
combination. One of the early motivating examples comes from a concern
for relevance. If the logic is relevant (if to say that
ppp entails qqq is true is to say, at least, that
qqq truly depends on p)p)p) then the comma need
not not satisfy weakening. We may indeed have AAA following
from XXX, without AAA following from
X,YX,YX,Y, for it need not be the case that AAA
depends on XXX and YYY together.


In relevant logics the rule of weakening fails on the other
side too, in that we wish this argument to be invalid too:
q⊢qp,q⊢qp⊢q→qq⊢qp,q⊢qp⊢q→q
\cfrac{q \vdash q}
 { \cfrac{p, q \vdash q}
   {p \vdash q \rightarrow q}
 }



Again, qqq may follow from qqq, but this does not mean
that it follows from ppp together with qqq,
provided that “together with” is meant in an appropriately
strong sense. So, in relevant logics, the inference from an arbitrary
premise to a logical truth such as q→qq→qq \rightarrow q may
well fail. 
1.2 Commutativity


If the mode of premise combination is commutative (if anything which
follows from X,YX,YX, Y also follows from Y,X)Y,X)Y,
X) then we can reason as follows, using just the identity
axiom and residuation: 
p→q⊢p→qp→q,p⊢qp,p→q⊢qp⊢(p→q)→qp→q⊢p→qp→q,p⊢qp,p→q⊢qp⊢(p→q)→q
\cfrac{p \rightarrow q \vdash p \rightarrow q}
 { \cfrac{p \rightarrow q, p \vdash q}
   { \cfrac{p, p \rightarrow q \vdash q}
     {p \vdash(p \rightarrow q) \rightarrow q}
   }
 }



In the absence of commutativity of premise combination, this proof is
not available. This is another simple example of the connection between
the behaviour of premise combination and that of deductions involving
the conditional. 


There are many kinds of conditional for which this inference fails.
If “→→\rightarrow” has modal force (if it
expresses a kind of entailment, in which p→qp→qp \rightarrow q is true
when in every related circumstance in which ppp holds, qqq does
too), and if “⊢⊢\vdash” expresses local consequence
(p⊢q(p⊢q(p\vdash q if and only if any model, at any circumstance at which
ppp holds, so does q)q)q) it fails. It may be true that Greg is a
logician (p)(p)(p) and it is true that Greg’s being a logician
entails Greg’s being a philosopher (p→q(p→q(p \rightarrow q –
in related circunstances in which Greg is a logician, he is a
philosopher) but this does not entail that Greg is a
philosopher. (There are many circumstances in which the entailment
(p→q)(p→q)(p \rightarrow q) is true but qqq is not.) So we a circumstance
in which ppp is true but (p→q)→q(p→q)→q(p \rightarrow q) \rightarrow q is
not. The argument is invalid.


This counterexample can also be understood in terms of behaviour of
premise combination. Here when we say X,A⊢BX,A⊢BX,A \vdash B is true, we are
not just saying that BBB holds in any circumstance in which XXX
and AAA both hold.  If we are after a
genuine entailment A →→\rightarrow B, then we want
BBB to be true in any (related) circumstance in which AAA is
true. So, X,A⊢BX,A⊢BX,A \vdash B says that in any possibility in
which AAA is true, so is BBB. These possibilities might not
satisfy all of XXX. (In classical theories of entailment, the
possibilities are those in which all that is taken
as necessary in XXX are true.)


If premise combination is not commutative, then residuation can go in
two ways. In addition to the residuation condition giving the
behaviour of →→\rightarrow, we may wish to define a new arrow
←←\leftarrow as follows:
p,q⊢r if and only if q⊢r←pp,q⊢r if and only if q⊢r←p
p, q \vdash r \text{ if and only if } q \vdash r \leftarrow p



For the left-to-right arrow we have modus ponens in this
direction: 
p→q,p⊢qp→q,p⊢q
p \rightarrow q, p \vdash q



For the right-to-left arrow, modus ponens is provable with the
premises in the opposite order: 
p,q←p⊢qp,q←p⊢q
p, q \leftarrow p \vdash q



This is a characteristic of substructural logics. When we pay attention
to what happens when we don’t have the full complement of structural
rules, then new possibilities open up. We uncover two
conditionals underneath what was previously one (in intuitionistic or
classical logic). 


In the next section we will see
 another example
motivating non-commutative premise combination and these two different
conditionals.
1.3 Associativity


Here is another way that structural rules influence proof. The
associativity of premise combination provides the following proof: 
r→p,r⊢p   p→q,p⊢qp→q,(r→p,r)⊢q(p→q,r→p),r⊢qp→q,r→p⊢r→qp→q⊢(r→p)→(r→q)r→p,r⊢p   p→q,p⊢qp→q,(r→p,r)⊢q(p→q,r→p),r⊢qp→q,r→p⊢r→qp→q⊢(r→p)→(r→q) 
\cfrac{r \rightarrow p, r \vdash p \ \ \ p \rightarrow q, p \vdash q}
 { \cfrac{p \rightarrow q, (r \rightarrow p, r) \vdash q}
   { \cfrac{(p \rightarrow q, r \rightarrow p), r \vdash q}
     { \cfrac{ p \rightarrow q, r \rightarrow p \vdash r \rightarrow q }
       {p \rightarrow q \vdash(r \rightarrow p) \rightarrow(r \rightarrow q)}
     }
   }
 }



This proof uses the cut rule at the topmost step. The idea is
that inferences can be combined. If X⊢AX⊢AX \vdash A and Y(A)⊢BY(A)⊢BY(A) \vdash
B (where Y(A)Y(A)Y(A) is a structure of premises possibly including
AAA one or more times) then Y(X)⊢BY(X)⊢BY(X) \vdash B too (where Y(X)Y(X)Y(X) is
that structure of premises with those instances of AAA replaced by
X)X)X). In this proof, we replace the ppp in p→q,p⊢qp→q,p⊢qp \rightarrow q, p
\vdash q by r→p,rr→p,rr \rightarrow p, r on the basis of the validity of
r→p,r⊢pr→p,r⊢pr \rightarrow p, r \vdash p. 
1.4 Contraction


A final important example is the rule of contraction which
dictates how premises may be reused. Contraction is crucial in the
inference of p→qp→qp \rightarrow q from p→(p→q)p→(p→q)p \rightarrow 
(p \rightarrow q) 
p→(p→q)⊢p→(p→q)p→(p→q),p⊢p→qp→q⊢p→qp→q,p⊢q(p→(p→q),p),p⊢qp→(p→q),p⊢qp→(p→q)⊢p→qp→(p→q)⊢p→(p→q)p→(p→q),p⊢p→qp→q⊢p→qp→q,p⊢q(p→(p→q),p),p⊢qp→(p→q),p⊢qp→(p→q)⊢p→q
  \cfrac{
   \matrix{ 
     \cfrac{p \rightarrow(p \rightarrow q) \vdash p \rightarrow(p \rightarrow q)}
          {p \rightarrow(p \rightarrow q), p \vdash p \rightarrow q}
     &amp;
     \cfrac{p \rightarrow q \vdash p \rightarrow q}
          {p \rightarrow q, p \vdash q}
     }
   }
   { \cfrac{(p \rightarrow(p \rightarrow q), p), p \vdash q}
       { \cfrac{p \rightarrow(p \rightarrow q), p \vdash q}
          {p \rightarrow(p \rightarrow q) \vdash p \rightarrow q}
       }
   }



These different examples give you a taste of what can be done by
structural rules. Not only do structural rules influence the
conditional, but they also have their effects on other connectives,
such as conjunction and disjunction (as we shall see below) and
negation (Dunn 1993; Restall 2000). 
1.5 Structure on the right of the turnstile


Since the introduction of Gentzen’s sequent calculus (Gentzen
1935), we have known that the difference between classical
logic and intuitionistic logic can also be understood as a
difference of structural rules. Instead of considering sequents of the
form X⊢AX⊢AX \vdash A, in
which we have a collection of antecedents and a single consequent, for
classical logic it is fruitful to consider sequents of the form 
X⊢YX⊢Y
X \vdash Y



where both XXX and YYY are collections of statements. The
intended interpretation is that from all of the XXX it
follows that some of the YYY. In other words, we cannot
have all of the XXX and none of the YYY obtaining. 


Allowing sequents with multiple consequents and translating the
rules into this expanded context, we are able to derive classical
tautologies. For example, the derivation
p⊢pp⊢q,p⊢p→q,pp⊢pp⊢q,p⊢p→q,p
\cfrac{p \vdash p}
{ \cfrac{p \vdash q, p}
  {\vdash p \rightarrow q, p}
}



shows that either p→qp→qp \rightarrow q or ppp must hold.
This is classically valid (if ppp fails, ppp is
false, and conditionals with false antecedents are true), but
invalid in intuitionistic logic. The difference between classical and
intuitionistic logic, then, can be understood formally as a difference
between the kinds of structural rules permitted, and the kinds of
structures appropriate to use in the analysis of logical consequence. 
2. Logics in the Family


There are many different formal systems in the family of substructural
logics. These logics can be motivated in different ways. 
2.1 Relevant Logics


Many people have wanted to give an account of logical validity which
pays some attention to conditions of relevance. If X,A⊢BX,A⊢BX,A
\vdash B holds, then XXX must somehow be relevant to
AAA.  Premise combination is restricted in the following way. We may
have X⊢AX⊢AX \vdash A without also having X,Y⊢AX,Y⊢AX,Y \vdash A . The new
material YYY might not be relevant to the deduction. In the 1950s,
Moh (1950), Church (1951) and Ackermann (1956) all gave accounts of
what a ‘relevant’ logic could be. The ideas have been
developed by a stream of workers centred around Anderson and Belnap,
their students Dunn and Meyer, and many others.  The canonical
references for the area are Anderson, Belnap and Dunn’s
two-volume Entailment (1975 and 1992). Other introductions
can be found in Read’s Relevant Logic, Dunn and
Restall’s Relevance Logic (2002), and
Mares’ Relevant Logic: a philosophical
interpretation (2004). 
2.2 Resource Consciousness


This is not the only way to restrict premise combination. Girard (1987)
introduced linear logic as a model for processes and resource
use. The idea in this account of deduction is that resources must be
used (so premise combination satisfies the relevance criterion) and
they do not extend indefinitely. Premises cannot be
rerere-used. So, I might have X,X⊢AX,X⊢AX,X \vdash A, which says that I can use XXX twice
to get AAA. I might not have X⊢AX⊢AX \vdash A, which says that I can use XXX once
alone to get AAA. A helpful introduction to linear logic is
given in Troelstra’s Lectures on Linear Logic (1992).
There are other formal logics in which the contraction rule
(from X,X⊢AX,X⊢AX,X \vdash A to
X⊢A)X⊢A)X \vdash A) is absent.
Most famous among these are Łukasiewicz’s many-valued
logics. There has been a sustained interest in logics without this rule
because of Curry’s paradox (Curry 1977, Geach 1995; see also
Restall 1994 in Other Internet Resources). 
3. Order


Independently of either of these traditions, Joachim Lambek considered
mathematical models of language and syntax (Lambek 1958, 1961). The
idea here is that premise combination corresponds to composition of
strings or other linguistic units. Here X,XX,XX,X differs
in content from XXX, but in addition, X,YX,YX,Y
differs from Y,X. Not only does the number of
premises used count but so does their order. Good
introductions to the Lambek calculus (also called categorial
grammar) can be found in books by Moortgat (1988) and Morrill
(1994).
3. Proof Systems


We have already seen a fragment of one way to present substructural
logics, in terms of proofs. We have used the residuation condition,
which can be understood as including two rules for the conditional, one
to introduce a conditional 
X,A⊢BX⊢A→BX,A⊢BX⊢A→B
\cfrac{X, A \vdash B}
 {X \vdash A \rightarrow B}



and another to eliminate it. 
X⊢A→B   Y⊢AX,Y⊢BX⊢A→B   Y⊢AX,Y⊢B
\cfrac{X \vdash A \rightarrow B \ \ \ Y \vdash A}
      {X, Y \vdash B}



Rules like these form the cornerstone of a natural deduction system,
and these systems are available for the wide sweep of substructural
logics. But proof theory can be done in other ways. Gentzen
systems operate not by introducing and eliminating connectives, but by
introducing them both on the left and the right of the turnstile of
logical consequence. We keep the introduction rule above, and replace
the elimination rule by one introducing the conditional on the left: 
X⊢A   Y(B)⊢CY(A→B,X)⊢CX⊢A   Y(B)⊢CY(A→B,X)⊢C
\cfrac{X \vdash A \ \ \ Y(B) \vdash C}
  {Y(A \rightarrow B, X) \vdash C}



This rule is more complex, but it has the same effect as the arrow
elimination rule: It says that if XXX suffices for AAA, and if you
use BBB (in some context Y)Y)Y) to prove CCC then you could just
as well have used A→BA→BA \rightarrow B together with XXX (in that
same context Y)Y)Y) to prove CCC, since A→BA→BA \rightarrow B together
with XXX gives you BBB. 


Gentzen systems, with their introduction rules on the left and the
right, have very special properties which are useful in studying
logics. Since connectives are always introduced in a proof
(read from top to bottom) proofs never lose structure. If a
connective does not appear in the conclusion of a proof, it will not
appear in the proof at all, since connectives cannot be eliminated.


In certain substructural logics, such as linear logic and the Lambek
calculus, and in the fragment of the relevant logic RR\mathbf{R}
without disjunction, a Gentzen system can be used to show that the
logic is decidable, in that an algorithm can be found to
determine whether or not an argument X⊢AX⊢AX \vdash A is valid. This is
done by searching for proofs of X⊢AX⊢AX \vdash A in a Gentzen
system. Since premises of this conclusion must feature no language not
in this conclusion, and they have no greater complexity (in these
systems), there are only a finite number of possible premises. An
algorithm can check if these satisfy the rules of the system, and
proceed to look for premises for these, or to quit if we hit an
axiom. In this way, decidability of some substructural logics is
assured.


However, not all substructural logics are decidable in this sense.
Most famously, the relevant logic RR\mathbf{R} is not decidable.
This is partly because its proof theory is more complex than that of
other substructural logics. RR\mathbf{R} differs from linear
logic and the Lambek calculus in having a straightforward treatment of
conjunction and disjunction. In particular, conjunction and disjunction
satisfy the rule of distribution:
p&(q∨r)⊢(p&q)∨(p&r)p&(q∨r)⊢(p&q)∨(p&r)
p \amp(q \vee r) \vdash (p \amp q) \vee (p \amp r)



The natural proof of distribution in any proof system uses both
weakening and contraction, so it is not available in the relevant logic
RR\mathbf{R}, which does not contain weakening. As a result,
proof theories for RR\mathbf{R} either contain distribution as a
primitive rule, or contain a second form of premise combination (so
called extensional combination, as opposed to the
intensional premise combination we have seen) which satisfies
weakening and contraction. 


In recent years, a great deal of work has been done on the proof
theory of classical logic, inspired and informed by research
into substructural logics. Classical logic has the full complement of
structural rules, and is historically prior to more recent systems of
substructural logics. However, when it comes to attempting to
understand the deep structure of classical proof systems (and
in particular, when two derivations that differ in some superficial
syntactic way are really different ways to represent the one
underlying ‘proof’) it is enlightening to think of
classical logic as formed by a basic substructural logic, in which
extra structural rules are imposed as additions. In particular, it has
become clear that what distinguishes classical proof from its siblings
is the presence of the structural rules of contraction and weakening in
their complete generality (see, for example, Bellin et al.
2006 and the literature cited therein).
4. Model Theory


While the relevant logic RR\mathbf{R} has a proof system more
complex than the substructural logics such as linear logic, which lack
distribution of (extensional) conjunction over disjunction, its
model theory is altogether more simple. A Routley-Meyer
model for the relevant logic RR\mathbf{R} is comprised
of a set of points PPP with a three-place relation
RRR on PPP. A conditional A→BA→BA \rightarrow B is
evaluated at a world as follows: 

A→BA→BA \rightarrow B is true at xxx if and only if for each yyy and
zzz where RxyzRxyzRxyz, if AAA is true at y,By,By, B is true at zzz.



An argument is valid in a model just when in any point at
which the premises are true, so is the conclusion. The argument A⊢B→BA⊢B→BA
\vdash B \rightarrow B is invalid because we may have a point xxx
at which AAA is true, but at which B→BB→BB \rightarrow B is not.  We
can have B→BB→BB \rightarrow B fail to be true at xxx simply by having
RxyzRxyzRxyz where BBB is true at yyy but not at zzz. 


The three place relation RRR follows closely the behaviour of the
mode of premise combination in the proof theory for a substructural
logic. For different logics, different conditions can be placed on
RRR. For example, if premise combination is commutative, we place
a symmetry condition on RRR like this: RxyzRxyzRxyz if and only
if RyxzRyxzRyxz. Ternary relational semantics gives us great facility
to model the behaviour of substructural logics. (The extent
of the correspondence between the proof theory and algebra of
substructural logics and the semantics is charted in Dunn’s work
on Gaggle Theory (1991) and is summarised in
Restall’s Introduction to Substructural Logics
(2000).)


Furthermore, if conjunction and disjunction satisfy the distribution
axiom mentioned in the previous section, they can be modelled
straightforwardly too: a conjunction is true at a point just when both
conjuncts are true at that point, and a disjunction is true at a point
just when at least one disjunct is true there. For logics, such as
linear logic, without the distribution axiom, the semantics
must be more complex, with a different clause for disjunction required
to invalidate the inference of distribution.


It is one thing to use a semantics as a formal device to model a
logic. It is another to use a semantics as an interpretive
device to apply a logic. The literature on substructural
logics provides us with a number of different ways that the ternary
relational semantics can be applied to describe the logical structure
of some phenomena in which the traditional structural rules do not
apply.


For logics like the Lambek calculus, the interpretation of the
semantics is straightforward. We can take the points to be linguistic
items, and the ternary relation to be the relation of concatenation
(RxyzRxyzRxyz if and only if xxx concatenated with yyy
results in z)z)z). In these models, the structural rules of
contraction, weakening and permutation all fail, but premise
combination is associative.


The contemporary literature on linguistic classification extends the
basic Lambek Calculus with richer forms of combination, in which more
syntactic features can be modelled (see Moortgat 1995).


Another application of these models is in the treatment of the
semantics of function application. We can think of the points
in a model structure as both functions and data, and
hold that RxyzRxyzRxyz if and only if xxx (considered as a
function) applied to yyy (considered as data) is zzz.
Traditional accounts of functions do not encourage this dual use, since
functions are taken to be of a ‘higher’ than their inputs
or outputs (on the traditional set-theoretic model of functions, a
function isisis the set of its input-output pairs, and
so, it can never take itself as an input, since sets cannot
contain themselves as members). However, systems of functions modelled
by the untyped λλ\lambda-calculus, for example, allow for
self-application. Given this reading of points in a model, a point is
of type A→BA→BA \rightarrow B just if whenever it takes inputs
of type AAA, it takes outputs of type BBB. The inference
rules of this system are then principles governing types of functions:
the sequent
(A→B)&(A→C)⊢A→(B&C)(A→B)&(A→C)⊢A→(B&C)
(A \rightarrow B) \amp(A \rightarrow C) \vdash A \rightarrow (B \amp C)



tells us that whenever a function takes AAAs to BBBs and
AAAs to CCCs, then it takes AAAs to things that
are both BBB and CCC. 


This example gives us a model in which the appropriate substructural
logic is extremely weak. None of the usual structural rules
(not even associativity) are satisfied in this model. This example of a
ternary relational model is discussed in (Restall 2000, Chapter
11).


For the relevant logic RR\mathbf{R} and its interpretation of
natural language conditionals, more work must be done in identifying
what features of reality the formal semantics models. This has been a
matter of some controversy, since not only is the ternary relation
unfamiliar to those whose exposure is primarily to modal logics with a
simpler binary accessibility relation between possible worlds,
but also because of the novelty of the treatment of negation
in models for relevant logics. It is not our place to discuss this
debate in much detail here, Some of this work is reported in the
article on
 relevant logic
 in this
Encyclopedia, and a book-length treatment of relevant logic in this
light is Mares’ Relevant Logic: a philosophical
interpretation (2004).
5. Quantifiers

The treatment of quantifiers in models for substructural logics has
proved to be quite difficult, but advances have been made in the early
2000s. The difficulty came in what seemed to be a mismatch between the
proof theory and model theory for quantifiers. Appropriate axioms or
rules for the quantifiers are relatively straightforward. The
universal quantifier elimination axiom ∀xA→A[t/x]∀xA→A[t/x] \forall xA \rightarrow
A[t/x]  states that an instance follows (in the relevant sense) from
its universal generalisation. The introduction rule ⊢A→B⊢A→∀xB⊢A→B⊢A→∀xB \cfrac{\vdash
A\rightarrow B} {\vdash A\rightarrow \forall xB}  (where the proviso
that xxx is not free in AAA holds) tells us that if we can prove
an instance of the generalisation ∀xB∀xB\forall xB, as a matter of
logic, from some assumption which makes no particular claim about that
instance, we can also prove the generalisation from that
assumption. This axiom and rule seems to fit nicely with any
interpretation of the first-order quantifiers in a range of
substructural logics, from the weakest systems, to strong systems like
RR\mathbf{R}.



While the proof theory for quantifiers seems well behaved, the
generalisation to model theory for substructural logics has proved
difficult. Richard Routley (1980) showed that  adding the rules for
the quantifiers to a very weak system of substructural logic
BB\mathbf{B} fits appropriately with the ternary relational
semantics, where quantifiers are interpreted as ranging over a domain
of objects, constant across all of the points in the model. This fact
does not apply for stronger logics, in particular, the
relevant logic RR\mathbf{R}.  Kit Fine (1989) showed that there
exists a complex formula which holds in all constant domain frame
models for RR\mathbf{R} but which is not derivable from the axioms.
The details of Fine’s argument are not important for our purposes, but
the underlying cause for the mismatch is relatively straightforward to
explain. In the constant domain semantics, the universal
generalisation ∀xFx∀xFx\forall x Fx has exactly the same truth
conditions—at every point in the model—as the family of
instances Fx1Fx1Fx_1, Fx2Fx2Fx_2, Fx3,…Fx3,…Fx_3,\ldots, Fxλ,…Fxλ,…Fx_\lambda,\ldots,
where the objects of the domains are enumerated by the values of the
terms xixix_i.  So, the quantified expression ∀xFx∀xFx\forall x Fx is
semantically indistinguishable from the (possibly infinite)
conjunction Fx1∧Fx2∧Fx3∧⋯Fx1∧Fx2∧Fx3∧⋯Fx_1\land Fx_2\land Fx_3\land\cdots . However, no
conjunction of instances (even an infinite one) could
be relevantly equivalent to the universally quantified claim
∀xFx∀xFx\forall x Fx, because the instances could be true in a
circumstance (or could be made true by a circumstance) without also
making true the generalisation—if there had been more
things than those. So, constant domain models seem ill-suited to the
project of a relevant theory of quantification.


Recent work by Goldblatt and Mares (2006) has shown that there is an
alternative, and it turns out to be elegant and relatively
straightforward. The crucial idea is to modify the ternary relational
semantics just a little, so that not every set of points need count as
a ‘proposition’. That is, not every set of points is the
possible semantic value for a sentence. So, while there is a set of
worlds determined by the infinite conjunction of instances of
∀xFx∀xFx\forall xFx: Fx1∧Fx2∧Fx3∧⋯Fx1∧Fx2∧Fx3∧⋯Fx_1\land Fx_2\land Fx_3\land\cdots , that
precise set of worlds may not count as a proposition. (Perhaps there
is no way to single out those particular objects in such a way as to
draw them together in the one judgement.) What we can say is
the generalisation ∀xFx∀xFx\forall xFx and that is a proposition that
entails each of the instances (that is the universal quantifier
elimination axiom), and if a proposition entails each instance, it
entails the generalisation (that is the introduction rule), so the
proposition expressed by ∀xFx∀xFx\forall xFx is the semantically
weakest proposition that entails each instance Fa. This
is precisely the modelling condition for the universal quantifier in
Goldblatt & Mares’ models, and it matches the axioms exactly.
