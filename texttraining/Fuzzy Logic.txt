Fuzzy logic is intended to model logical reasoning with vague or
imprecise statements like “Petr is young (rich, tall, hungry,
etc.)”. It refers to a family of many-valued logics (see entry
on
 many-valued logic)
 and thus stipulates that the truth value (which, in this case amounts
to a degree of truth) of a logically compound proposition, like
“Carles is tall and Chris is rich”, is determined by the
truth value of its components. In other words, like in classical
logic, one imposes truth-functionality.

Fuzzy logic emerged in the context of the theory of fuzzy sets,
introduced by Zadeh (1965). A fuzzy set assigns a degree of
membership, typically a real number from the interval [0,1][0,1][0,1], to
elements of a universe. Fuzzy logic arises by assigning degrees of
truth to propositions. The standard set of truth values (degrees) is
[0,1][0,1][0,1], where 000 represents “totally false”, 111
represents “totally true”, and the other numbers refer to
partial truth, i.e., intermediate degrees of
 truth.[1]


“Fuzzy logic” is often understood in a very wide sense
which includes all kinds of formalisms and techniques referring to the
systematic handling of degrees of some kind (see, e.g.,
Nguyen & Walker 2000). In particular in engineering contexts
(fuzzy control, fuzzy classification, soft computing) it is aimed at
efficient computational methods tolerant to suboptimality and
imprecision (see, e.g., Ross 2010). This entry focuses on fuzzy logic
in a narrow sense, established as a discipline of mathematical logic
following the seminal monograph by Petr Hájek (1998) and
nowadays usually referred to as “mathematical fuzzy logic”
(see Cintula, Fermüller, Hájek, & Noguera 2011 and
2015). It focuses on logics based on a truth-functional account of
partial truth and studies them in the spirit of classical mathematical
logic (syntax, model theoretic semantics, proof systems, completeness,
etc.; both, at propositional and the predicate level).
 
1. Fuzzy connectives based on t-norms

The standard set of truth degrees for fuzzy logics is the real unit
interval [0,1][0,1][0,1] with its natural ordering ≤≤\leq, ranging from
total falsity (represented by 000) to total truth (represented by
111) through a continuum of intermediate truth degrees. The most
fundamental assumption of (mainstream) mathematical fuzzy logic is
that connectives are to be interpreted truth-functionally over the set
of truth-degrees. Such truth-functions are assumed to behave
classically on the extremal values 000 and 111. A very natural
behavior of conjunction and disjunction is achieved by imposing x∧y=min{x,y}x∧y=min{x,y}x
\land y = \min\{x,y\} and x∨y=max{x,y}x∨y=max{x,y}x \lor y = \max\{x,y\} for each x,y∈[0,1]x,y∈[0,1]x,y
\in [0,1].

Another, non-idempotent, conjunction &&\&amp; is typically added to
account for the intuition that applying a partially true hypothesis
twice might lead to a different degree of truth than using it only
once. Such a conjunction is usually interpreted by a binary operation
on [0,1][0,1][0,1], which is not necessarily idempotent, but still
associative, commutative, non-decreasing in both arguments and has
111 as neutral element. These operations are called t-norms
(triangular norms) and their mathematical properties have
been thoroughly studied (e.g., by Klement, Mesiar, & Pap 2000).
Prominent examples of t-norms are the already mentioned function
minmin\min, the standard product of real numbers, and the
Łukasiewicz t-norm: x∗Ły=max{x+y−1,0}x∗Ły=max{x+y−1,0}x *_{Ł} y=\max\{x+y-1,0\}. These
three t-norms are actually continuous functions and any other
continuous t-norm can be described as an ordinal sum of these
three basic ones (see, Ling 1965; Mostert & Shields 1957).

Negation is interpreted by a non-increasing function assigning 000
to 111 and vice versa; usual choices are the Łukasiewicz
negation ¬Łx=1−x¬Łx=1−x\neg_{Ł} x = 1 - x and the Gödel negation:
¬G0=1¬G0=1\neg_\mathrm{G} 0 = 1 and ¬Gx=0¬Gx=0\neg_\mathrm{G} x = 0 for each x>0x>0x
&gt; 0. It is also usual to introduce a constant symbol
0¯¯¯0¯\overline{0} for total falsity, hence interpreted as 000.
Finally, a suitable choice for implication is the residuum of the
t-norm ∗∗\ast, that is, the unique function ⇒⇒\Rightarrow
satisfying the so-called residuation condition: x∗y≤zx∗y≤zx \ast y
\leq z, if and only if, x≤y⇒zx≤y⇒zx \leq y \Rightarrow z. Such a function
exists (and is defined as x⇒y=max{z∣x∗z≤y}x⇒y=max{z∣x∗z≤y}x \Rightarrow y = \max\{z \mid x \ast z
\leq y\}) if, and only if, the t-norm is left-continuous.
2. MTL: A fundamental fuzzy logic

The weakest logic with connectives interpreted by truth-functions of
the type described above is MTL (Monoidal T-norm based Logic,
Esteva & Godo 2001). It is a logic with the primitive connectives
&,→,∧,&,→,∧,\mathbin{\&amp;}, \to, \wedge, and 0¯¯¯0¯\overline{0}, and derivable
connectives defined as: 

φ∨ψ¬φφ↔ψ1¯¯¯=((φ→ψ)→ψ)∧((ψ→φ)→φ),=φ→0¯¯¯,=(φ→ψ)∧(ψ→φ),and=¬0¯¯¯.φ∨ψ=((φ→ψ)→ψ)∧((ψ→φ)→φ),¬φ=φ→0¯,φ↔ψ=(φ→ψ)∧(ψ→φ),and1¯=¬0¯.
\begin{align}
\varphi \lor \psi &amp;= ((\varphi \to \psi) \to \psi) \land ((\psi \to \varphi) \to \varphi),\\
\neg \varphi &amp;= \varphi \to \overline{0}, \\
\varphi \leftrightarrow \psi &amp;= (\varphi \to \psi) \land (\psi \to \varphi), and \\
\overline{1} &amp;= \neg \overline{0}.
\end{align}


 MTL is defined as a consequence
relation over the semantics given by all left-continuous t-norms.
Namely, given a particular left-continuous t-norm ∗∗\ast, an
evaluation e∗e∗e_\ast is a mapping from propositional variables to
[0,1][0,1][0,1], extended to all formulas by interpreting &&\&amp; as
∗∗\ast, the implication →→\to as its residuum ⇒⇒\Rightarrow, and
∧∧\land and 0¯¯¯0¯\overline{0} as minmin\min and 000,
respectively.


A formula φφ\varphi is a consequence of a set of formulas ΓΓ\Gamma
in MTL, denoted Γ⊨MTLφΓ⊨MTLφ\Gamma \models_\mathrm{MTL} \varphi, if for each
left-continuous t-norm ∗∗\ast and each evaluation e∗e∗e_\ast such
that e(ψ)=1e(ψ)=1e(\psi) = 1 for each ψ∈Γψ∈Γ\psi \in \Gamma we have e(φ)=1e(φ)=1e(\varphi)
= 1; that is: each evaluation that makes the premises totally true
must also make the conclusion totally true. Formulas φφ\varphi that
always evaluate to 111 (⊨MTLφ⊨MTLφ\models_\mathrm{MTL}\varphi) are called
tautologies of MTL. Note that the formula (φ&ψ)→(φ∧ψ)(φ&ψ)→(φ∧ψ)(\varphi \mathbin{\&amp;}
\psi) \to (\varphi \land \psi) is a tautology in MTL, i.e., the
conjunction &&\&amp; is stronger than ∧∧\land.

MTL can also be presented by a Hilbert-style proof system with the
following axioms:
(φ→ψ)φ&ψφ&ψφ∧ψφ∧ψ(χ→φ)(φ&ψ→χ)(φ→(ψ→χ))((φ→ψ)→χ)0¯¯¯→((ψ→χ)→(φ→χ))→φ→ψ&φ→φ→ψ∧φ→((χ→ψ)→(χ→φ∧ψ))→(φ→(ψ→χ))→(φ&ψ→χ)→(((ψ→φ)→χ)→χ)→φ(φ→ψ)→((ψ→χ)→(φ→χ))φ&ψ→φφ&ψ→ψ&φφ∧ψ→φφ∧ψ→ψ∧φ(χ→φ)→((χ→ψ)→(χ→φ∧ψ))(φ&ψ→χ)→(φ→(ψ→χ))(φ→(ψ→χ))→(φ&ψ→χ)((φ→ψ)→χ)→(((ψ→φ)→χ)→χ)0¯→φ
\begin{align}
  (\varphi \to \psi) &amp; \to ((\psi \to \chi) \to (\varphi \to \chi)) \\
  \varphi \mathbin{\&amp;} \psi &amp; \to \varphi \\
  \varphi\mathbin{\&amp;}\psi &amp; \to\psi\mathbin{\&amp;}\varphi \\
  \varphi \land \psi &amp; \to \varphi \\
  \varphi \land \psi &amp; \to \psi \land \varphi \\
  (\chi \to \varphi) &amp; \to ((\chi\to \psi) \to (\chi \to \varphi\wedge \psi)) \\
  (\varphi\mathbin{\&amp;}\psi \to \chi) &amp; \to (\varphi\to(\psi \to \chi)) \\
  (\varphi\to(\psi \to \chi)) &amp; \to (\varphi\mathbin{\&amp;}\psi \to \chi) \\
  ((\varphi \to \psi) \to \chi) &amp; \to (((\psi \to \varphi)\to \chi)\to \chi) \\
  \overline{0}&amp; \to\varphi \\
\end{align}


and modus ponens as the only inference rule: from φφ\varphi
and φ→ψφ→ψ\varphi \to \psi, infer ψψ\psi. This system is a complete
axiomatization of the logic MTL: Γ⊨MTLφΓ⊨MTLφ\Gamma \models_\mathrm{MTL}
\varphi iff Γ⊢MTLφΓ⊢MTLφ\Gamma \vdash_\mathrm{MTL} \varphi, where the latter
relation denotes derivability from instances of the above axioms and
formulas in ΓΓ\Gamma. The validity problem of MTLMTL\mathrm{MTL} is
known to be decidable, however its computational complexity has not
yet been determined.
3. Łukasiewicz logic


Łukasiewicz logic can be defined by adding ((φ→ψ)→ψ)→((ψ→φ)→φ)((φ→ψ)→ψ)→((ψ→φ)→φ)((\varphi \to \psi)
\to \psi) \to ((\psi \to \varphi) \to \varphi) to the Hilbert-style

 system for MTL. It corresponds to the finitary version of
the consequence relation defined with respect to evaluations based on
the Łukasiewicz t-norm (in symbols: for each finite set
of formulas ΓΓ\Gamma and each formula φφ\varphi, we have Γ⊨ŁφΓ⊨Łφ\Gamma
\models_{Ł} \varphi iff Γ⊢ŁφΓ⊢Łφ\Gamma \vdash_{Ł}
 \varphi).[2]

This logic was an early example of a many-valued logic, introduced by
Łukasiewicz & Tarski (1930), well before the inception of the
theory of fuzzy sets, by means of an equivalent axiomatic system (with
modus ponens as the only inference rule):
φ(φ→ψ)((φ→ψ)→ψ)(¬ψ→¬φ)((φ→ψ)→(ψ→φ)→((ψ→χ)→(φ→χ))→((ψ→φ)→φ)→(φ→ψ)→(ψ→φ))→(ψ→φ)φ→(ψ→φ)(φ→ψ)→((ψ→χ)→(φ→χ))((φ→ψ)→ψ)→((ψ→φ)→φ)(¬ψ→¬φ)→(φ→ψ)((φ→ψ)→(ψ→φ))→(ψ→φ)
\begin{align}
\varphi &amp;\to (\psi \to \varphi)\\
(\varphi \to \psi) &amp;\to ((\psi \to \chi) \to (\varphi \to \chi))\\
((\varphi \to \psi) \to \psi) &amp;\to ((\psi \to \varphi) \to \varphi)\\
(\neg \psi \to \neg \varphi) &amp;\to (\varphi \to \psi)\\
((\varphi \to \psi) &amp;\to (\psi \to \varphi)) \to (\psi \to \varphi)\\ 
\end{align}


Łukasiewicz logic is the only t-norm based fuzzy logic where all
connectives are interpreted by continuous functions, including the
implication which, as the residuum of ŁŁ_{Ł}, is given by the
function x→Ły=min{1,1−x+y}x→Ły=min{1,1−x+y}x \to_{Ł} y=\min\{1,1-x+y\}. McNaughton’s
theorem (1951) states that real-valued functions over [0,1] that
interpret formulas of Łukasiewicz logic are exactly the
continuous piecewise linear functions with integer coefficients. In
terms of computational complexity, the validity problem for this logic
is asymptotically not worse than in classical logic: it remains
coNP-complete.
4. Gödel–Dummett logic

Gödel–Dummett logic, also known as Dummett’s LC or
simply Gödel logic, is another early example of a many-valued
logic with truth values in [0,1][0,1][0,1]. It was introduced by Michael
Dummett (1959) as the extension of intuitionistic logic (see entry on
 intuitionistic logic)
 by the axiom 

(φ→ψ)∨(ψ→φ).(φ→ψ)∨(ψ→φ).(\varphi \to \psi) \lor (\psi \to \varphi).

 This formula enforces a linear order in the
underlying (Kripke-style as well as algebraic) semantics. It also
appears in the context of Gödel’s observation that it is
impossible to characterize intuitionistic logic by finite truth tables
(Gödel 1932). Gödel–Dummett logic can alternatively be
obtained as an axiomatic extension of MTL by adding the axiom
φ→φ&φφ→φ&φ\varphi \to \varphi \mathbin{\&amp;} \varphi, which amounts to
requiring the idempotence of &&\&amp;, and hence making the
interpretation of both conjunctions coincide. In the fuzzy logic
setting the Gödel–Dummett logic can be seen as the
consequence relation given by the minimum t-norm. It is distinguished
as the only t-norm based logic where the truth of a formula in a given
evaluation does not depend on the specific values assigned to the
propositional variables, but only on the relative order of these
values. In this sense, Gödel–Dummett logic can be seen as a
logic of comparative truth. Like for Łukasiewicz logic, the
computational complexity of testing validity remains
coNP-complete.


5. Other notable fuzzy logics

Besides MTL (the logic of all left-continuous t-norms) and
Łukasiewicz and Gödel–Dummett logics (each induced by
one particular t-norm), one can consider logics induced by
other sets of t-norms or, in general, arbitrary axiomatic extensions
of MTL. In particular, the logic of all continuous t-norms
(Hájek’s Basic Fuzzy Logic) is obtained by adding the
axiom 

(φ&(φ→ψ))→(ψ&(ψ→φ))(φ&(φ→ψ))→(ψ&(ψ→φ))(\varphi\mathbin{\&amp;}(\varphi\to{{\psi}})) \to
(\psi\mathbin{\&amp;}(\psi\to\varphi))

 to those of MTL. Actually, for any set of continuous
t-norms there is a finite axiomatization of the corresponding logic
(Esteva, Godo, & Montagna 2003; Haniková 2014). In
particular the logic of the last prominent continuous t-norm
(algebraic product), known as Product logic, is the extension of
Hájek’s Basic Fuzzy Logic by the axiom: 

¬φ∨((φ→φ&ψ)→ψ)¬φ∨((φ→φ&ψ)→ψ)\neg\varphi \vee ((\varphi\to\varphi\mathbin{\&amp;}{{\psi}})\to{{\psi}})

 On
the other hand, not all axiomatic extensions of MTL can be given a
semantics of t-norms. For example, classical logic can be axiomatized
as MTL +++ φ∨¬φφ∨¬φ\varphi\vee\neg \varphi, but the axiom of excluded
middle is not a tautology under any t-norm based interpretation.


There are also reasons to consider weaker fuzzy logics. For example,
it can be argued that the assumptions forcing the interpretation of
the conjunction to be a t-norm are too strong. In particular, the
assumption that 111 is the neutral element of conjunction enforces a
definition of tautology as a formula always evaluated to 111 and the
consequence relation as preservation of the value 111 – that
is, 111 is the only designated value in the
 semantics.[3]
 A natural way to introduce logics with more than one designated truth
degree is to assume that the neutral element for ∗∗\ast is a number
t<1t<1t &lt;1. (It can be shown that in this situation the designated
truth degrees are exactly those greater than or equal to ttt.) Such
interpretations of conjunctions are called uninorms. The
resulting logic was axiomatized by Metcalfe & Montagna (2007).

Analogously one may argue against commutativity or even against
associativity of conjunction. Axiomatizations of resulting logics are
described in the literature (see Cintula, Horčík, &
Noguera 2013; Jenei & Montagna 2003); an exception is the logic of
non-commutative uninorms for which a natural axiomatic system is not
known.

Finally, taking into account that fuzzy logics, unlike classical
logic, are typically not functionally complete, one can increase their
expressive power by adding new connectives. The most commonly
considered connectives are: truth constants r¯r¯\bar r for each
rational number r∈(0,1)r∈(0,1)r\in (0,1); unary connectives ∼∼\sim and
△△\triangle interpreted as ∼x=1−x∼x=1−x{\sim}x = 1-x and △x=1△x=1\triangle x = 1
if x=1x=1x=1 and 000 otherwise; a binary connective ⊙⊙\odot
interpreted as the usual algebraic product, etc. (Baaz 1996; Esteva,
Gispert, Godo, & Noguera 2007; Esteva, Godo, & Montagna 2001;
Esteva, Godo, Hájek, & Navara 2000).

A thorough overview of all the kinds of propositional fuzzy logics
mentioned in this section (and a general theory thereof) can be found
in the Handbook of Mathematical Fuzzy Logic (3 volumes,
Cintula et al. 2011a,b, 2015).
6. Predicate logics

Given any propositional fuzzy logic L there is a uniform way to
introduce its first-order counterpart L∀∀\forall in a predicate
language PLPL\mathcal{P\!L} (defined as in the classical case). In
this section, for simplicity, we present it for t-norm based
logics.

The semantics is given by structures in which predicate symbols are
interpreted as functions mapping tuples of domain elements into truth
values. More precisely, a structure MM{\mathbf M} consists of a
non-empty domain of elements MMM, a function fM:Mn→MfM:Mn→Mf_{\mathbf M}\colon
M^n\to M for each nnn-ary function symbol f∈PLf∈PLf\in \mathcal{P\!L},
and a function PM:Mn→[0,1]PM:Mn→[0,1]P_{\mathbf M}\colon M^n\to [0,1] for each nnn-ary
predicate symbol P∈PLP∈PLP\in \mathcal{P\!L}. Fixing an evaluation
vv{\mathrm v} of object variables in MMM, one defines values of
terms (∥f(t1,…,tn)∥v=fM(∥t1∥v,…,∥tn∥v)‖f(t1,…,tn)‖v=fM(‖t1‖v,…,‖tn‖v)\|f(t_1,\dots,t_n)\|_{\mathrm v} = f_{\mathbf
M}(\|t_1\|_{\mathrm v},\dots,\|t_n\|_{\mathrm v})) and truth values
of atomic formulas (∥P(t1,…,tn)∥v=PM(∥t1∥v,…,∥tn∥v)‖P(t1,…,tn)‖v=PM(‖t1‖v,…,‖tn‖v)\|P(t_1,\dots,t_n)\|_{\mathrm v} = P_{\mathbf
M}(\|t_1\|_{\mathrm v},\dots,\|t_n\|_{\mathrm v})). Truth values of
a universally/existentially quantified formula are computed as
infimum/supremum of truth values of instances of the formula where the
quantified variable runs over all elements of the domain MMM.
Formally: 

∥(∀x)φ∥v∥(∃x)φ∥v=inf{∥φ∥v[x:a]∣a∈M}=sup{∥φ∥v[x:a]∣a∈M},‖(∀x)φ‖v=inf{‖φ‖v[x:a]∣a∈M}‖(∃x)φ‖v=sup{‖φ‖v[x:a]∣a∈M},
\begin{align}
\|(\forall x)\varphi\|_{\mathrm v} &amp; = \inf\{\|\varphi\|_{{\mathrm v}[x{:}a]} \mid a\in M\}\\
  \|(\exists x)\varphi\|_{\mathrm v} &amp; = \sup\{\|\varphi\|_{{\mathrm v}[x{:}a]}\mid a\in M\},\\
  \end{align}


 where v[x:a]v[x:a]{\mathrm v}[x{:}a] is the evaluation
sending xxx to aaa and keeping values of other variables
unchanged. The values of other formulas are computed using the truth
functions for the propositional connectives of L.


The first-order logic L∀∀\forall is then defined as the consequence
relation given by preservation of total truth (value 111), as in the
propositional case. More precisely, we say that a first-order formula
φφ\varphi is a consequence of a set of formulas ΓΓ\Gamma (in
symbols: Γ⊨L∀φΓ⊨L∀φ\Gamma \models_{\mathrm{L}\forall} \varphi) if
∥φ∥v=1‖φ‖v=1\|\varphi\|_{\mathrm v} = 1 for each evaluation v, whenever
∥ψ∥v=1‖ψ‖v=1\|\psi\|_{\mathrm v} = 1 for each evaluation v and each ψ∈Γψ∈Γ\psi \in
\Gamma.

L∀∀\forall can be given a Hilbert-style calculus with the following
axioms:

(P) The (first-order)
instances of the axioms of the propositional logic L
(∀1)(∀1)(\forall1) 
(∀x)φ(x)→φ(t)(∀x)φ(x)→φ(t)(\forall x)\varphi(x)\to\varphi(t), where the term ttt is
substitutable for xxx in
 (∃1)(∃1)(\exists1) 
φ(t)→(∃x)φ(x)φ(t)→(∃x)φ(x)\varphi(t)\to(\exists x)\varphi(x), where the term ttt is
substitutable for xxx in
(∀2)(∀2)(\forall2) 
(∀x)(χ→φ)→(χ→(∀(x)φ)(∀x)(χ→φ)→(χ→(∀(x)φ)(\forall x)(\chi\to\varphi)\to(\chi\to (\forall(x)\varphi), where
xxx is not free in χχ\chi
(∃2)(∃2)(\exists2) 
(∀x)(φ→χ)→((∃x)φ→χ)(∀x)(φ→χ)→((∃x)φ→χ)(\forall x)(\varphi\to\chi)\to((\exists x)\varphi\to\chi), where
xxx is not free in χχ\chi
(∀3)(∀3)(\forall3) 
(∀x)(χ∨φ)→χ∨(∀x)φ(∀x)(χ∨φ)→χ∨(∀x)φ(\forall x)(\chi\vee\varphi)\to\chi\vee(\forall x)\varphi, where
xxx is not free in χχ\chi.


The deduction rules of L∀∀\forall are those of L plus the rule of
generalization: from φφ\varphi infer (∀x)φ(∀x)φ(\forall
x)\varphi.

For many notable propositional fuzzy logics (including MTL and
Gödel logic) the above axiomatic system is sound and complete
with respect to the semantics (i.e., Γ⊨L∀φΓ⊨L∀φ\Gamma
\models_{\mathrm{L}\forall} \varphi iff Γ⊢L∀φΓ⊢L∀φ\Gamma
\vdash_{\mathrm{L}\forall} \varphi for each ΓΓ\Gamma and each
φφ\varphi; Cintula, Horčík, & Noguera 2014).

However, the first-order Łukasiewicz logic is not recursively
axiomatizable as shown by Scarpellini (1962; Ragaz (1981) proved that
the set of tautologies is actually Σ2Σ2\Sigma_2-complete in the sense
of arithmetical hierarchy). Completeness can be achieved either by
including an infinitary inference rule (Hay 1963) or by generalizing
the set of truth-values (see next section). The situation is even more
complicated in the case of Hájek’s Basic Fuzzy Logic,
where the set of first-order tautologies of all structures given by
continuous t-norms is as complex as true arithmetics (Montagna
2001).
7. Algebraic semantics

One of the main tools in the study of fuzzy logic is that of algebraic
semantics (see entry on
 algebraic semantics).
 Roughly speaking, the idea is to replace the real unit interval with
an arbitrary set and interpret the connectives as operations of
corresponding arities on that set.

An MTL-algebra (introduced by Esteva & Godo (2001)) is a tuple
A=⟨A,&,→,∧,∨,0¯¯¯,1¯¯¯⟩A=⟨A,&,→,∧,∨,0¯,1¯⟩{\mathbf A} = \langle A, \&amp;, \to, \wedge, \vee, \overline{0},
\overline{1} \rangle where

⟨A,∧,∨,0¯¯¯,1¯¯¯⟩⟨A,∧,∨,0¯,1¯⟩\langle A, \wedge, \vee, \overline{0}, \overline{1} \rangle is
a bounded lattice
⟨A,&,1¯¯¯⟩⟨A,&,1¯⟩\langle A, \&amp;, \overline{1} \rangle is a commutative
monoid
(x→y)∨(y→x)=1¯¯¯(x→y)∨(y→x)=1¯(x\to y)\vee(y\to x) = \overline{1}
x&y≤zx&y≤zx\mathbin{\&amp;} y \leq z iff x≤y→zx≤y→zx \leq y\to z (where
≤≤\leq is the lattice order induced by ∧∧\wedge or ∨∨\vee).


MTL-algebras are a generalization of the t-norm based semantics
explained above and provide a sound and complete semantics for
 MTL.[4]


MTL-chains are those whose lattice order is total and they are the
basic building blocks of the whole class of algebras, in the sense
that each MTL-algebra can be decomposed as a subdirect
product of chains. This implies that the logic is also complete
with respect to the semantics of MTL-chains, which is then used as the
first step in the proof of its completeness with respect to the t-norm
based semantics (Jenei & Montagna 2002).

Algebraic semantics is a universal tool that can be used for any
logic. In particular, for any arbitrary fuzzy logic studied in the
literature (even those not supporting a t-norm based semantics such as
finite-valued fuzzy logics or the logic of non-commutative uninorms)
one can find a corresponding class of algebras which can be decomposed
as subdirect products of chains. This fact has led Běhounek &
Cintula (2006) to propose a definition of fuzzy logics as logics that
are complete with respect to totally ordered algebraic structures.

The use of algebraic semantics for first-order logics usually yields
lower complexity for testing validity or satisfiability than standard
semantics (Montagna & Noguera 2010).
8. Proof theory

It has been a considerable challenge to come up with analytic proof
systems for fuzzy logics. These are systems that share important
features, like the eliminability of cuts and the subformula property,
with Gentzen’s sequent calculi for classical and intuitionistic
logic (see entry on
 the development of proof theory).
 A major breakthrough has been achieved with the introduction of a
so-called hypersequent calculus for Gödel–Dummett logic by
Arnon Avron (1991). Hypersequent calculi arise from sequent calculi by
considering finite multisets or sequences of sequents, interpreted as
disjunctions of sequents, as main object of inference. In the case of
Gödel–Dummett logic one lifts the rules of Gentzen’s
intuitionistic sequent calculus by simply adding side-hypersequents to
the upper and lower sequents. For example, the sequent rule for
introducing disjunction on the right hand side 

Γ1⇒ϕΓ2⇒ψΓ1,Γ2⇒ϕ∨ψΓ1⇒ϕΓ2⇒ψΓ1,Γ2⇒ϕ∨ψ\frac{\Gamma_1 \Rightarrow \phi \hspace{3ex} \Gamma_2 \Rightarrow
\psi}{\Gamma_1,\Gamma_2 \Rightarrow \phi \vee \psi}

 where
Γ1Γ1\Gamma_1 and Γ2Γ2\Gamma_2 are finite sequences of formulas, is
turned into the following hypersequent rule: 

H∣Γ1⇒ϕH′∣Γ2⇒ψH∣H′∣Γ1,Γ2⇒ϕ∨ψH∣Γ1⇒ϕH′∣Γ2⇒ψH∣H′∣Γ1,Γ2⇒ϕ∨ψ\frac{H \mid \Gamma_1 \Rightarrow \phi \hspace{3ex} H' \mid \Gamma_2
\Rightarrow \psi}{H \mid H' \mid \Gamma_1,\Gamma_2 \Rightarrow \phi
\vee \psi }

 where HHH
and H′H′H' denote the side-hypersequents, i.e., finite sequences or
multisets of sequents. This by itself does not change the
corresponding logic (intuitionistic logic, in this case). The crucial
additional structural rule is the so-called communication rule:

H∣Γ1,Π1⇒Δ1H′∣Γ2,Π2⇒Δ2H∣H′∣Γ1,Γ2⇒Δ1∣Π2,Π2⇒Δ2H∣Γ1,Π1⇒Δ1H′∣Γ2,Π2⇒Δ2H∣H′∣Γ1,Γ2⇒Δ1∣Π2,Π2⇒Δ2\frac{H \mid \Gamma_1,\Pi_1 \Rightarrow \Delta_1 \hspace{3ex} H'
\mid \Gamma_2,\Pi_2 \Rightarrow \Delta_2}{H \mid H' \mid
\Gamma_1,\Gamma_2 \Rightarrow \Delta_1 \mid \Pi_2,\Pi_2 \Rightarrow
\Delta_2}

 Here Γ1,Γ2,Π1,Π2Γ1,Γ2,Π1,Π2\Gamma_1, \Gamma_2,\Pi_1, \Pi_2 are finite lists
of formulas; Δ1Δ1\Delta_1 and Δ2Δ2\Delta_2 are either single formulas
or remain empty; HHH and H′H′H' denote the side-hypersequents, like
above.


To obtain a hypersequent calculus for the fundamental fuzzy logic MTL
one has to add the communication rule to a sequent system for
contraction-free version of intuitionistic logic. Analytic proof
systems for other fuzzy logics, in particular Łukasiewicz logic,
call for a more radical departure from traditional calculi, where the
sequent components of hypersequents are interpreted differently than
intuitionistic or classical sequents. Also so-called labeled proof
systems and various tableau calculi have been suggested. A detailed
presentation of the corresponding state of the art can be found in
Metcalfe, Olivetti, & Gabbay 2008 and Metcalfe 2011.
9. Semantics justifying truth functionality

It is desirable, not only from a philosophical point of view, but also
to a get a better grip on potential applications of fuzzy logics to
relate the meaning of intermediary truth values and corresponding
logical connectives to basic models of reasoning with vague and
imprecise notions. A number of such semantics that seek to justify
particular choices of truth functional connectives have been
introduced. Just two of them are briefly described here.

Voting semantics is based on the idea that different agents (voters)
may coherently judge the same proposition differently. The proportion
of agents that accept a proposition φφ\varphi as true may be seen as
a truth value. Without further restrictions this does not lead to a
truth functional semantics, but rather to an assignment of
probabilities to propositions. But if one assigns a fixed level of
skepticism to each agent and imposes some natural conditions that
keep the judgments on logically complex statements consistent with
those levels, then one can recover minmin\min, maxmax\max, and 1−x1−x1-x as
truth functions for conjunction, disjunction and negation,
respectively. Details can be found in Lawry 1998.

Another intriguing model of reasoning that provides a justification
for all propositional connectives of standard Łukasiewicz logic
has been introduced by Giles (1974). It consists in a game, where two
players, I and you, systematically reduce logically complex assertions
(formulas) to simpler ones according to rules like the following:

If I assert φ∨ψφ∨ψ\varphi \lor \psi, then I have to assert either
φφ\varphi or ψψ\psi.
If I assert φ∧ψφ∧ψ\varphi \land \psi, then you choose one of the
conjuncts and I have to assert either φφ\varphi or ψψ\psi,
accordingly.
If I assert φ→ψφ→ψ\varphi \to \psi, then I have to assert ψψ\psi
if you assert φφ\varphi.


The rules for quantified statements refer to a fixed domain, assuming
that there is a constant symbol for each domain element one
stipulates:

If I assert (∀x)φ(x)(∀x)φ(x)(\forall x) \varphi(x), then I have to assert
φ(c)φ(c)\varphi(c), for a constant ccc chosen by you.
If I assert (∃x)φ(x)(∃x)φ(x)(\exists x) \varphi(x), then I have to assert
φ(c)φ(c)\varphi(c), for a constant ccc chosen by myself.


The rules for your assertions are dual. At each state of the game an
occurrence of a non-atomic formula in either the multiset of current
assertions by me or by you is chosen and gets replaced by subformulas,
as indicated by these rules, until only atomic assertions remain. A
final game state is then evaluated according to the following betting
scheme.

For each atomic formula there is a corresponding experiment which may
either fail or succeed, but may show dispersion, i.e., it may yield
different results when repeated. A fixed failure probability, called
risk value, is assigned to each experiment and thus to each atomic
formula. The players have to pay $$\$1 to the other player for each
of their atomic assertion where the associated experiments fails. For
any game starting with my assertion of φφ\varphi my expected overall
loss of money if we both play rationally can be shown to correspond
inversely to the truth value of φφ\varphi evaluated in an
interpretation of Łukasiewicz logic that assigns the inverse of
the risk values as truth values to atomic formulas. In particular, a
formula is valid in Łukasiewicz logic if and only if, for every
risk value assignment, I have a strategy that guarantees that my
expected overall loss at the end of game is 000 or negative.

Fermüller & Metcalfe (2009) have pointed out a correspondence
between optimal strategies in Giles’s game and cut-free proofs
in a hypersequent system for Łukasiewicz logic. The game has also
been extended by Fermüller & Roschger (2014) to characterize
various types of (semi-)fuzzy quantifiers, intended to model natural
language expressions like “about half” or “almost
all”.

Paris (2000) provides an overview over other semantics supporting
various choices of truth functions; in particular, re-randomizing
semantics (Hisdal 1988), similarity semantics (e.g., Ruspini 1991),
acceptability semantics (Paris 1997), and approximation semantics
(Paris 2000). Let us also mention the resource-based semantics of
Běhounek (2009). Moreover there are different forms of evaluation
games for various fuzzy logics, besides the one of Giles for
Łukasiewicz logic outlined above. An overview over those semantic
games can be found in Fermüller 2015.
10. Fuzzy logic and vagueness

Modeling reasoning with vague predicates and propositions is often
cited as the main motivation for introducing fuzzy logics. There are
many alternative theories of vagueness (see entry on
 vagueness),
 but there is a general agreement that the susceptibility to the
sorites paradox (see entry on
 sorites paradox)
 is a main feature of vagueness. Consider the following version of the
paradox:

(1)101001010010^{100}
is a huge number.
(2)If nnn is
a huge number, then n−1n−1n-1 is also huge.


At the face of it, it seems not be unreasonable to accept these two
assumptions. By instantiating nnn with 101001010010^{100} in
 (2)
 and applying modus ponens with
 (1)
 as the other premise we conclude that 10100−110100−110^{100}-1 is huge. By
simply repeating this type of inference we arrive at the unreasonable
statement

(3)000 is a
huge number.


Fuzzy logic suggests an analysis of the sorites paradox that
respects the intuition that statement
 (2),
 while arguably not totally true, is almost true.

There are various ways to model this form of reasoning in t-norm based
fuzzy logics that dissolve the paradox. For example, one may declare
that any instance of modus ponens is sound if the degree of
truth of the conclusion is not lower than that of the strong
conjunction of its premises.[5]
 As indicated, one stipulates that every instance of
 (2)
 is true to degree 1−ϵ1−ϵ1-\epsilon, for some very small number
ϵϵ\epsilon. Even if we declare
 (1)
 to be perfectly true, the statement that 10100−110100−110^{100}-1 is huge, too,
might then be less than perfectly true without sacrificing the
soundness of instantiation and modus ponens. If, moreover,
the degree of truth of the conjunction of two not perfectly true (or
not perfectly false) statements is less than that of each conjunct, we
may safely declare that statement
 (3)
 is perfectly false and nevertheless insist on the soundness of each
step in the indicated chain of inferences. Informally speaking, the
paradox disappears by assuming that repeatedly decreasing some
perfectly huge number by a small amount leads to numbers of which it
is less and less true that they are huge too.

An alternative truth degree based solution to the sorites
paradox has been proposed by Hájek & Novák
(2003). They introduce a new truth functional connective modeling the
expression “it is almost true that”. In this manner they
formalize sorites-style reasoning within an axiomatic theory
of an appropriate t-norm based fuzzy logic.

Smith (2008; see also 2005) has argued that the so-called
closeness principle captures the essence of vagueness. It
expresses that statements of the same form about indistinguishable
objects should remain close in respect of truth. It is a hallmark of
many approaches to the paradox that employ fuzzy logic that they are
compatible with this
 principle.[6]
