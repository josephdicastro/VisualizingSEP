The principle of set theory known as the Axiom of Choice has
been hailed as “probably the most interesting and, in spite of
its late appearance, the most discussed axiom of mathematics, second
only to Euclid’s axiom of parallels which was introduced more than two
thousand years ago” (Fraenkel, Bar-Hillel & Levy 1973,
§II.4). The fulsomeness of this description might lead those
unfamiliar with the axiom to expect it to be as startling as, say, the
Principle of the Constancy of the Velocity of Light or the Heisenberg
Uncertainty Principle. But in fact the Axiom of Choice as it is
usually stated appears humdrum, even self-evident. For it amounts to
nothing more than the claim that, given any collection of mutually
disjoint nonempty sets, it is possible to assemble a new set—a
transversal or choice set—containing exactly
one element from each member of the given collection. Nevertheless,
this seemingly innocuous principle has far-reaching mathematical
consequences—many indispensable, some startling—and
has come to figure prominently in discussions on the foundations of
mathematics. It (or its equivalents) have been employed in countless
mathematical papers, and a number of monographs have been exclusively
devoted to it.
 
1. Origins and Chronology of the Axiom of Choice


In 1904 Ernst Zermelo formulated the Axiom of Choice (abbreviated as
AC throughout this article) in terms of what he called
coverings (Zermelo 1904).  He starts with an arbitrary set
MMM and uses the symbol M′M′M' to denote an
arbitrary nonempty subset of MMM, the collection of which he
denotes by M.  He continues:

           
Imagine that with every subset M′M′M' there is associated
an arbitrary element m′1m′1m_{1}', that occurs in
M′M′M' itself; let m′1m′1m_{1}' be called
the “distinguished” element of M′M′M'. This
yields a “covering” ggg of the set MMM by
certain elements of the set MMM. The number of these coverings
is equal to the product [of the cardinalities of all the subsets
M′M′M'] and is certainly different from 0.




The last sentence of this quotation—which asserts, in effect,
that coverings always exist for the collection of nonempty subsets of
any (nonempty) set—is Zermelo’s first formulation of
the Axiom of 
 Choice[1].
 This is now usually stated in terms of choice functions:
here a choice function on a collection HH\sH
  of nonempty sets is a map fff with domain 
 HH\sH
  such that f(X)∈Xf(X)∈Xf(X) \in X for every X∈HX∈HX \in \sH. 

As a very simple example, let HH\sH
be the collection of nonempty subsets of {0,1}{0,1}\{0, 1\}, i.e., 
H={{0},{1},{0,1}}H={{0},{1},{0,1}}\sH = \{\{0\}, \{1\}, \{0,1\}\}. Then 
HH\sH has the two distinct choice functions
f1f1f_{1} and f2f2f_{2} given by:
f1({0})=0f1({1})=1f1({0,1})=0f2({0})=0f2({1})=1f2({0,1})=1f1({0})f1({1})f1({0,1})f2({0})f2({1})f2({0,1})=0=1=0=0=1=1\begin{align}
f_{1}(\{0\}) &amp;= 0 \\
f_{1}(\{1\}) &amp;= 1 \\
f_{1}(\{0, 1\}) &amp;= 0 \\
f_{2}(\{0\}) &amp;= 0 \\
f_{2}(\{1\}) &amp;= 1 \\
f_{2}(\{0, 1\}) &amp;= 1
\end{align}

  A more interesting example of a choice function is provided by
taking HH\sH
to be the set of (unordered) pairs of real numbers and the function
to be that assigning to each pair its least element. A different choice
function is obtained by assigning to each pair its greatest
element. Clearly many more choice functions on
HH\sH can be defined.

  Stated in terms of choice functions, Zermelo’s first formulation of
AC reads:

AC1: 
Any collection of nonempty sets has a choice function.


AC1 can be reformulated in terms of indexed
or variable sets. An indexed collection of sets
 A={Ai:i∈I}A={Ai:i∈I}\sA = \{A_{i}: i \in I\}
 may be conceived as a variable set, to wit, as a set
varying over the index set III. Each
AiAiA_{i} is then the “value” of the
variable set AA\sA
at stage iii. A choice function on
AA\sA is a map f:I→⋃i∈IAif:I→⋃i∈IAif: I \rightarrow \bigcup_{i\in I} A_{i} such that 
f(i)∈Aif(i)∈Aif(i) \in A_{i} for all i∈Ii∈Ii\in I.  A choice function on
AA\sA is thus a “choice” of an element of the variable set
AA\sA at each stage; in other words, a choice function on
AA\sA is a variable element of AA\sA. 
AC1 is then equivalent to the assertion

AC2: 
 Any indexed collection of  sets has a choice function.



Informally speaking, AC2 amounts to the assertion
that a variable set with an element at each stage has a variable
element.

AC1 can also be reformulated in terms of
relations, viz.

AC3: 
 For any relation RRR between sets AAA, BBB,

∀x∈A ∃y∈B[R(x,y)]⇒∃f[f:A→B&∀x∈A[R(x,fx)]].∀x∈A ∃y∈B[R(x,y)]⇒∃f[f:A→B&∀x∈A[R(x,fx)]]. 
{\forall x\inn A}\ \exists y\inn B[R(x,y)] \Rightarrow 
 \exists f[f: A \rightarrow B \amp {\forall x\inn A}[R(x,fx)]].


  In other words, every relation contains a function having the same
domain.


Finally AC3  is easily shown to be equivalent
(in the usual set theories) 
 to:[2]

AC4: 
 Any surjective function has a right inverse.



In a 1908 paper Zermelo introduced a modified form of AC. Let
us call a transversal (or choice set) for a family
of sets HH\sH any subset 
T⊆⋃HT⊆⋃HT \subseteq \bigcup \sH
 for which each intersection T∩XT∩XT \cap X for
X∈HX∈HX \in \sH
has exactly one element.  As a very simple example, let 
H={{0},{1},{2,3}}H={{0},{1},{2,3}}\sH = \{\{0\}, \{1\}, \{2, 3\}\}. Then 
HH\sH
has the two transversals {0,1,2}{0,1,2}\{0, 1, 2\} and {0,1,3}{0,1,3}\{0, 1, 3\}. 
A more substantial example is afforded  by letting
HH\sH be the collection of all lines in the Euclidean plane parallel to the
xxx-axis. Then the set TTT of points on the yyy-axis is a
transversal for HH\sH.

Stated in terms of transversals, then, Zermelo’s second (1908)
formulation of AC amounts to the assertion that any family of
mutually disjoint nonempty sets has a
 transversal.[3]

 Zermelo asserts that “the purely objective character” of
this principle “is immediately evident.” In making this
assertion Zermelo meant to emphasize the fact that in this form the
principle makes no appeal to the possibility of making
“choices”. It may also be that Zermelo had the following
“combinatorial” justification of the principle in
mind. Given a family HH\sH of mutually disjoint nonempty sets, call
a subset S⊆⋃HS⊆⋃HS \subseteq \bigcup \sH a selector for HH\sH
if S∩X≠∅S∩X≠∅S\cap X \ne \varnothing for all X∈HX∈HX \in \sH. Clearly
selectors for HH\sH exist; ⋃H⋃H\bigcup \sH itself is an example. Now
one can imagine taking a selector SSS for HH\sH and
“thinning out” each intersection S∩XS∩XS \cap X for X∈HX∈HX\in
\sH until it contains just a single element. The result is a
transversal for HH\sH. This argument, suitably refined, yields a
precise derivation of
AC in this formulation from the set-theoretical
principle known as Zorn’s lemma (see below). 

 Let us call Zermelo’s 1908 formulation the combinatorial
 axiom of choice: 

CAC: 
 Any collection of mutually disjoint nonempty sets has a
transversal.


 It is to be noted that AC1 and CAC
for finite collections of sets are both provable (by
induction) in the usual set theories. But in the case of an
infinite collection, even when each of its members is finite,
the question of the existence of a choice function or a transversal is
 problematic[4].
 For example, as already mentioned, it is easy to come up with a
choice function for the collection of pairs of real numbers (simply
choose the smaller element of each pair). But it is by no means
obvious how to produce a choice function for the collection of pairs
of arbitrary sets of real numbers.

 Zermelo’s original purpose in introducing AC was to
establish a central principle of Cantor’s set theory, namely, that
every set admits a well-ordering and so can also be assigned a
cardinal number. Zermelo’s 1904 introduction of the axiom, as well as
the use to which he put it, provoked considerable criticism from the
mathematicians of the day.  The chief objection raised was to what
some saw as its highly non-constructive, even idealist, character:
while the axiom asserts the possibility of making a number 
of—perhaps even an uncountable number—of arbitrary
“choices”, it gives no indication whatsoever of how these
latter are actually to be effected, of how, otherwise put, choice
functions are to be defined. This was particularly
objectionable to mathematicians of a “constructive” bent
such as the so-called French Empiricists Baire, Borel and Lebesgue,
for whom a mathematical object could be asserted to exist only if it
can be defined in such a way as to characterize it uniquely.
Zermelo’s response to his critics came in the form in two papers in
1908. In the first of these, as remarked above, he
reformulated AC in terms of transversals; in the second
(1908a) he made explicit the further assumptions needed to carry
through his proof of the well-ordering theorem. These assumptions
constituted the first explicit presentation of an axiom system for set
theory.

 As the debate concerning the Axiom of Choice rumbled on, it became
apparent that the proofs of a number of significant mathematical
theorems made essential use of it, thereby leading many mathematicians
to treat it as an indispensable tool of their trade.  Hilbert, for
example, came to regard AC as an essential principle of
mathematics[5] and
employed it in his defence of classical mathematical reasoning against
the attacks of the intuitionists.  Indeed his ε-operators are
essentially just choice functions (see the entry on the
  epsilon calculus).

 Although the usefulness of AC quickly become clear,
doubts about its soundness remained. These doubts were reinforced by
the fact that it had certain strikingly counterintuitive
consequences.  The most spectacular of these was Banach
and Tarski’s paradoxical decompositions of the sphere
(Banach and Tarski 1924): any solid sphere can be split into finitely
many pieces which can be reassembled to form two solid spheres of the
same size; and any solid sphere can be split into finitely many
pieces in such a way as to enable them to be reassembled to form a
solid sphere of arbitrary size. (See Wagon 1993.) 

 It was not until the middle 1930s that the question of the soundness
of AC was finally put to rest with Kurt Gödel’s
proof of its consistency relative to the other axioms of set theory.


 Here is a brief chronology of
 AC:[6]


1904/1908
Zermelo introduces axioms of set theory, explicitly formulates AC 
and uses it to prove the well-ordering theorem,
thereby raising a storm of controversy.


1904
Russell recognizes AC as the multiplicative
axiom: the product of arbitrary nonzero cardinal numbers is
nonzero.


1914
Hausdorff derives from AC the existence of
nonmeasurable sets in the “paradoxical”
form that 1⁄21/2\bfrac{1}{2} of a sphere is congruent to 1⁄31/3\bfrac{1}{3} of it
(Hausdorff 1914).


1922
Fraenkel introduces the “permutation method” to
establish independence of AC from a system of set
theory with atoms (Fraenkel 1922).


1924
Building on the work of Hausdorff, Banach and Tarski derive from
AC their paradoxical decompositions of the sphere.


1926
Hilbert introduces into his proof theory the
“transfinite” or “epsilon” axiom as a version
of AC . (Hilbert 1926).


1936
Lindenbaum and Mostowski extend and refine Fraenkel’s permutation
method, and prove the independence of various statements of set theory
weaker than AC . (Lindenbaum and Tarski 1938) 


1935–38
Gödel establishes relative consistency of
 AC with the
 axioms of set theory (Gödel 1938a, 1938b, 1939, 1940). 


1950s
Mendelson, Shoenfield and Specker, working independently, use the
permutation method to establish the independence of various forms of AC 
from a system of set theory without atoms, but
also lacking the axiom of foundation (Mendelson 1956, 1958,
Shoenfield 1955, Specker 1957).


1963
Paul Cohen proves independence of AC from the standard
axioms of set theory (Cohen 1963, 1963a, 1964).


2. Independence and Consistency of the Axiom of Choice


As stated above, in 1922 Fraenkel proved the independence of
AC from a system of set theory containing
“atoms”. Here by an atom is meant a pure
individual, that is, an entity having no members and yet distinct from
the empty set (so a fortiori an atom cannot be a set). In a
system of set theory with atoms it is assumed that one is given an
infinite set AAA of atoms. One can build a
universe V(A)V(A)V(A) of sets over AAA by starting
with AAA, adding all the subsets of AAA, adjoining all
the subsets of the result, etc., and iterating
transfinitely.  V(A)V(A)V(A) is then a model of set theory
with atoms. The kernel of Fraenkel’s method for proving the
independence of AC is the observation that, since atoms
cannot be set-theoretically distinguished, any permutation of the set
AAA of atoms induces a structure-preserving 
permutation—an automorphism—of the universe
V(A)V(A)V(A) of sets built from AAA. This idea may be
used to construct another model Sym(V)Sym(V)Sym(V) of 
set theory—a permutation or symmetric model—in
which a set of mutually disjoint pairs of elements of AAA has
no choice function.  

           
Now let us suppose that we are given a group GGG of
automorphisms of AAA. Let us say that an automorphism ππ\pi; of
AAA fixes an element xxx of
V(A)V(A)V(A) if π(x)=xπ(x)=x\pi(x) = x. Clearly, if
π∈Gπ∈G\pi \in G fixes every element of AAA, it also
fixes every element of V(A)V(A)V(A). Now it may be the case
that, for certain elements x∈V(A)x∈V(A)x \in V(A),
the fixing of the elements of a subset of AAA by any
π∈Gπ∈G\pi\in G suffices to fix xxx. We are therefore
led to define a support for xxx to be a subset
XXX of AAA such that, whenever π∈Gπ∈G\pi\in G
fixes each member of XXX, it also fixes xxx. Members of
V(A)V(A)V(A) possessing a finite support are called
symmetric.


We next define the universe Sym(V)Sym(V)Sym(V) to consist of the
hereditarily symmetric members of V(A)V(A)V(A),
that is, those x∈V(A)x∈V(A)x\in V(A) such that
xxx, the elements of xxx, the elements of elements of
xxx, etc., are all symmetric. Sym(V)Sym(V)Sym(V) is also
a model of set theory with set of atoms AAA, and ππ\pi induces
an automorphism of Sym(V)Sym(V)Sym(V).

           
Now suppose AAA to be partitioned into a (necessarily infinite)
mutually disjoint set PPP of pairs. Take GGG to be the group of
permutations of AAA which fix all the pairs in PPP. Then P∈Sym(V)P∈Sym(V)P\in
Sym(V); it can now be shown that Sym(V)Sym(V)Sym(V) contains no choice
function on PPP. For suppose fff were a choice function on PPP
and f∈Sym(V)f∈Sym(V)f \in Sym(V). Then fff has a finite support which may be
taken to be of the form {a1,…,an,b1,…,bn}witheachpair{ai,bi}∈P{a1,…,an,b1,…,bn}witheachpair{ai,bi}∈P\{a_{1}, \ldots, a_{n}, b_{1},\ldots,b_{n}\}
with each pair \{a_{i}, b_{i}\} \in P. Since PPP is infinite, we
may select a pair {c,d}=U{c,d}=U\{c, d\} = U from PPP different from all the
{ai,bi}{ai,bi}\{a_{i}, b_{i}\}. Now we define π∈Gπ∈G\pi \in G so that ππ\pi
fixes each aiaia_{i} and bibib_{i} and interchanges ccc and
ddd. Then ππ\pi also fixes fff. Since fff was supposed to be a
choice function on PPP, and U∈PU∈PU \in P, we must have f(U)∈Uf(U)∈Uf(U) \in
U, that is, f(U)=cf(U)=cf(U) = c or f(U)=df(U)=df(U) = d. Since ππ\pi interchanges
ccc and ddd, it follows that π(f(U))≠f(U)π(f(U))≠f(U)\pi(f(U)) \ne f(U). But since
ππ\pi is an automorphism, it also preserves function application, so
that π(f(U))=πf(π(U))π(f(U))=πf(π(U))\pi(f(U)) = \pi f(\pi(U)). But
π(U)=Uπ(U)=U\pi(U) = U and πf=fπf=f\pi f = f, whence
π(f(U))=f(U)π(f(U))=f(U)\pi(f(U)) = f(U). We have duly arrived at a contradiction,
showing that the universe Sym(V)Sym(V)Sym(V) contains no choice
function on PPP.


The point here is that for a symmetric function fff defined on
PPP there is a finite list LLL of pairs from PPP
the fixing of all of whose elements suffices to fix fff, and
hence also all the values of fff. Now, for any pair UUU
in PPP but not in LLL , a permutation ππ\pi can always be
found which fixes all the elements of the pairs in LLL, but
does not fix the members of UUU. Since ππ\pi must fix the value
of fff at UUU, that value cannot lie in UUU.
Therefore fff cannot “choose” an element of
UUU, so a fortiori fff cannot be a choice function on
PPP.

           
This argument shows that collections of sets of atoms need
not necessarily have choice functions, but it fails to establish the
same fact for the “usual” sets of mathematics, for example
the set of real numbers. This had to wait until 1963 when Paul Cohen
showed that it is consistent with the standard axioms of set theory
(which preclude the existence of atoms) to assume that a countable
collection of pairs of sets of real numbers fails to have a choice
function. The core of Cohen’s method of proof—the celebrated
method of forcing—was vastly more general than any
previous technique; nevertheless his independence proof also made
essential use of permutation and symmetry in essentially the form in
which Fraenkel had originally employed them.

           
Gödel’s proof of the relative consistency of AC 
with the axioms of set theory (see the entry on 
 Kurt Gödel)
 rests on an entirely different idea: that of
definability. He introduced a new hierarchy of 
sets—the constructible hierarchy—by analogy with the
cumulative type hierarchy. We recall that the latter is defined by the
following recursion on the ordinals, where P(X)P(X)\sP(X) is
the power set of XXX, αα\alpha is an ordinal, and λλ\lambda is
a limit ordinal::
V0=∅Vα+1=P(Vα)Vλ=⋃α<λVαV0Vα+1Vλ=∅=P(Vα)=⋃α<λVα\begin{align}
V_0 &amp;= \varnothing \\
V_{\alpha+1} &amp;= \sP(V_{\alpha}) \\
V_{\lambda} &amp;= {\bigcup}_{\alpha \lt \lambda} V_{\alpha}
\end{align}


The constructible hierarchy is defined by a similar recursion on the
ordinals, where Def(X)Def(X)\Def(X) is the set of all subsets of
XXX which are first-order definable in the structure
(X,∈,(x)x∈X)(X,∈,(x)x∈X)(X, \in, (x)_{x\in X}):[7]
L0=∅Lα+1=Def(Lα)Lλ=⋃α<λLαL0Lα+1Lλ=∅=Def(Lα)=⋃α<λLα\begin{align}
L_0 &amp;= \varnothing \\
L_{\alpha+1} &amp;= \Def(L_{\alpha}) \\
L_{\lambda} &amp;= {\bigcup}_{\alpha\lt \lambda} L_{\alpha}
\end{align}


The constructible universe is the class 
L=⋃α∈OrdLαL=⋃α∈OrdLαL = \bigcup_{\alpha\in \Ord} L_{\alpha}; the members of LLL are the
constructible sets. Gödel showed that (assuming the
axioms of Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory ZF) the
structure (L,∈)(L,∈)(L, \in) is a model of ZF and
also of AC as well as the Generalized Continuum
Hypothesis). The relative consistency of AC with
ZF follows.  


It was also observed by Gödel (1964) (and, independently, by
Myhill and Scott 1971, Takeuti 1963 and Post 1951) that a simpler
proof of the relative consistency of AC can be
formulated in terms of ordinal definability. If we write
D(X)D(X)\rD(X) for the set of all subsets of XXX which are
first-order definable in the structure (X,∈)(X,∈)(X, \in), then the
class OD of ordinal definable sets is defined to be the
union ⋃α∈OrdD(Vα)⋃α∈OrdD(Vα)\bigcup_{\alpha\in \Ord}  D(V_{\alpha}).
 The class HOD of hereditarily ordinal definable sets
consists of all sets aaa for which aaa, the members of
aaa, the members of members of aaa, … etc., are
all ordinal definable. It can then be shown that the structure (HOD,
∈∈\in) is a model of ZF + AC , from
which the relative consistency of AC  with
ZF again
 follows.[8]
3. Maximal Principles and Zorn’s Lemma


The Axiom of Choice is closely allied to a group of mathematical
propositions collectively known as maximal principles.
Broadly speaking, these propositions assert that certain conditions
are sufficient to ensure that a partially ordered set contains at
least one maximal element, that is, an element such that,
with respect to the given partial ordering, no element strictly
exceeds it.


           
To see the connection between the idea of a maximal element and
AC, let us return to the latter’s formulation
AC2 in terms of indexed sets. Accordingly suppose we
are given an indexed family of nonempty sets A={Ai:i∈I}.A={Ai:i∈I}.\sA = \{A_{i}:i \in
I\}. Let us define a potential choice function on AA\sA
to be a function fff whose domain is a subset of III such that
f(i)∈Aif(i)∈Aif(i) \in A_{i} for all i∈Ji∈Ji\in J.  (Here the use of the
qualifier potential is suggested by the fact that the domain
is a subset of III; recall that a choice function fff on AA\sA
has the same properties as what we are now calling potential choice
functions except that the domain of fff is required to be all of
III, not just a subset.) The set PPP of potential choice functions
on AA\sA can be partially ordered by inclusion: we agree that, for
potential choice functions f,g∈Pf,g∈Pf, g \in P, the relation f≤gf≤gf \le g
holds provided that the domain of fff is included in that of ggg
and the value of fff at an element of its domain coincides with the
value of ggg there. It is now easy to see that the maximal elements
of PPP with respect to the partial ordering ≤≤\le are precisely
the choice functions on AA\sA. 

Zorn’s Lemma is the best-known principle ensuring the
existence of such maximal elements.  To state it, we need a few
definitions. Given a partially ordered set (P,≤)(P,≤)(P, \le), an
upper bound for a subset XXX of PPP is an element a∈Pa∈Pa\in
P for which x≤ax≤ax\le a for every x∈Xx∈Xx\in X; a maximal
element of PPP may then be defined as an element aaa for
which the set of upper bounds of {a}{a}\{a\} coincides with {a}{a}\{a\},
which essentially means that no element of PPP is strictly larger
than aaa. A chain in (P,≤)(P,≤)(P,\le) is a subset CCC of PPP
such that, for any xxx, y∈Py∈Py\in P, either x≤yx≤yx\le y or y≤xy≤xy\le x. 
PPP is said to be inductive if every chain in PPP
has an upper bound. Now Zorn’s Lemma asserts:

Zorn’s Lemma (ZL): 
 Every nonempty inductive
partially ordered set has a maximal element.



           
Why is Zorn’s Lemma plausible? Here is an informal argument.
Given a nonempty inductive partially ordered set (P,≤)(P,≤)(P,\le), pick an
arbitrary element p0p0p_{0} of PPP. If p0p0p_{0} is maximal, stop
there. Otherwise pick an element p1>p0p1>p0p_{1} \gt p_{0}; if p1p1p_{1} is
maximal, stop there. Otherwise pick an element p2>p1p2>p1p_{2} \gt p_{1},
and repeat the process. If none of the elements p0<p1<p2<…<pn<…p0<p1<p2<…<pn<…p_{0} \lt p_{1} \lt
p_{2} \lt \ldots \lt p_{n} \lt \ldots is maximal, the pipip_{i} form
a chain which, since PPP is inductive, has an upper bound
q0q0q_{0}. If q0q0q_{0} is maximal, stop there. Otherwise the
procedure can be repeated with q0<q1q0<q1q_{0} \lt q_{1}, …, and then
iterated. This process must eventually terminate, since otherwise the
union of the chains so generated would constitute a proper class,
making PPP itself a proper class contrary to assumption. The
point at which the process terminates yields a maximal element
of PPP.

 This argument, suitably rigorized, gives a
 proof[9]
 of ZL from AC1 in Zermelo-Fraenkel
set theory: in this proof AC1 is used to
“pick” the elements referred to in the informal
argument.

           
Another version of Zorn’s Lemma can be given in terms of
collections of sets. Given a collection HH\sH of sets, let us call
a nest in HH\sH any subcollection NN\sN of HH\sH such
that, for any pair of members of NN\sN, one is included in the
 other.[10] 
Call HH\sH strongly inductive if the union of any nest in
HH\sH is a member of HH\sH.  Zorn’s Lemma may then be
equivalently restated as the assertion that any nonempty strongly
inductive collection HH\sH of sets has a maximal member, that is, a
member properly included in no member of HH\sH.  This may in turn be
formulated in a dual form. Call a family of sets
strongly reductive if it is closed under intersections of
nests. Then any nonempty strongly reductive family of sets has a
minimal element, that is, a member properly including no
member of the family.

AC2 is now easily derived from Zorn’s Lemma in
this alternative form. For the set PPP of potential choice functions
on an indexed family of sets AA\sA is clearly nonempty and is
readily shown to be strongly inductive; so Zorn’s lemma yields
the existence of a choice function on AA\sA. 

CAC can be derived from
ZL in a way echoing the “combinatorial”
justification of CAC sketched above. Accordingly
suppose we are given a family HH\sH of mutually disjoint nonempty
sets; call a subset S⊆⋃HS⊆⋃HS \subseteq \bigcup \sH a sampling
for HH\sH if, for any X∈HX∈HX\in \sH, either 
X⊆SX⊆SX \subseteq S or S∩XS∩XS \cap X is nonempty and
finite. Minimal samplings are precisely transversals for
 HH\sH;[11] 
and the collection TT\sT of samplings is clearly nonempty since it
contains ⋃H⋃H\bigcup \sH.  So if it can be shown that TT\sT is
strongly 
 reductive,[12] 
 Zorn’s lemma will yield a minimal element of TT\sT and so a
transversal for HH\sH.  The strong reductiveness of TT\sT may be
seen as follows: suppose that {Si:i∈I}{Si:i∈I}\{S_{i}: i\in I\} is a nest of
samplings; let S=⋂i∈ISiS=⋂i∈ISiS = {\bigcap}_{i\in I} S_{i}.  We need to show that
SSS is itself a sampling; to this end let X∈HX∈HX \in \sH and suppose
¬(X⊆S)¬(X⊆S)\neg(X \subseteq S). Then there is i∈Ii∈Ii \in I for which 
¬(X⊆Si)¬(X⊆Si)\neg(X \subseteq S_{i}); since SiSiS_{i} is a sampling, Si∩XSi∩XS_{i}\cap X is
finite and nonempty,
say Si∩X={x1,…,xn}Si∩X={x1,…,xn}S_{i}\cap X = \{x_{1}, \ldots, x_{n}\}. Clearly 
S∩XS∩XS\cap X is then finite; suppose for the sake of contradiction that
S∩X=∅S∩X=∅S\cap X = \varnothing. Then for each k=1,…,nk=1,…,nk = 1,\ldots,n there is 
ik∈Iik∈Ii_k \in I for which ¬(xk∈Sik)¬(xk∈Sik)\neg(x_k \in S_{i_k}). It follows that
¬(Si⊆Sik)¬(Si⊆Sik)\neg(S_{i} \subseteq S_{i_k}), for k=1,…,nk=1,…,nk = 1, \ldots, n.  
So, since the SiSiS_{i} form a chain, each SikSikS_{i_k} is a subset of
SiSiS_{i}. Let SjSjS_{j} be the least of Si1,…,SikSi1,…,SikS_{i_1},\ldots, S_{i_k};
then Sj⊆SiSj⊆SiS_{j}\subseteq S_{i}. But since ¬(xk∈Sj)¬(xk∈Sj)\neg(x_{k} \in S_{j}),
for k=1,…,nk=1,…,nk = 1, \ldots, n, it now follows that Sj∩X=∅Sj∩X=∅S_{j} \cap X =
\varnothing, contradicting the fact that SjSjS_{j} is a sampling.
Therefore S∩X≠∅S∩X≠∅S \cap X\ne \varnothing; and SSS is a sampling as
claimed.

           
We note that while Zorn’s lemma and the Axiom of Choice are
set-theoretically equivalent, it is much more difficult to derive the
former from the latter than vice-versa.

           
Here is a brief chronology of maximal principles.


1909
Hausdorff introduces first explicit formulation of a maximal
principle and derives it from AC (Hausdorff 1909)


1914
Hausdorff’s Grundzüge der Mengenlehre (one of the
first books on set theory and general topology) includes several
maximal principles.


1922
Kuratowski formulates and employs several maximal principles in
avoiding use of transfinite ordinals (Kuratowski 1922).


1926–28
Bochner and others independently introduce maximal
principles (Bochner 1928, Moore 1932). 


1935
Max Zorn, apparently unacquainted with previous formulations of
maximal principles, publishes (Zorn 1935) his definitive version
thereof later to become celebrated as his lemma
(ZL). ZL was first formulated in
Hamburg in 1933, where Chevalley and Artin quickly
“adopted” it. It seems to have been Artin who first
recognized that ZL would yield AC, so that
the two are equivalent (over the remaining axioms of set theory).
Zorn regarded his principle less as a theorem than as an
axiom—he hoped that it would supersede cumbersome
applications in algebra of transfinite induction and well-ordering,
which algebraists in the Noether school had come to regard as
“transcendental” devices.


1939–40
Teichmüller, Bourbaki and Tukey independently reformulate
ZL in terms of “properties of finite
character”(Bourbaki 1939, Teichmuller 1939, Tukey 1940). 


4. Mathematical Applications of the Axiom of Choice


The Axiom of Choice has numerous applications in mathematics, a
number of which have proved to be formally equivalent to
 it[13].
 Historically the most important application was the first, namely:

The Well-Ordering Theorem (Zermelo 1904,
1908). Every set can be well-ordered.  


After Zermelo published his 1904 proof of the well-ordering theorem
from AC, it was quickly seen that the two are equivalent.



Another early equivalent of AC is

The Multiplicative Axiom (Russell 1906). The
product of any set of non-zero cardinal numbers is non-zero.



Early applications of AC include:

Every infinite set has a denumerable subset. This principle, again
weaker than AC, cannot be proved without it in the
context of the remaining axioms of set theory.
Every infinite cardinal number is equal to its square.  This was
proved equivalent to AC in Tarski 1924.
Every vector space has a basis (initiated by Hamel 1905). This was
proved equivalent to AC in Blass 1984.
Every field has an algebraic closure (Steinitz 1910). This
assertion is weaker than AC, indeed is a consequence
of the (weaker) compactness theorem for first-order logic (see
below).
There is a Lebesgue nonmeasurable set of real numbers (Vitali
1905). This was shown much later to be a consequence of
BPI (see below) and hence weaker than
AC. Solovay (1970) established its independence of
the remaining axioms of set theory.



A significant “folklore” equivalent of AC is

The Set-Theoretic Distributive Law. For an
arbitrary doubly-indexed family of sets
{Mi,j:i∈I,j∈J}{Mi,j:i∈I,j∈J}\{M_{i,j}: i \in I,j \in J\}, and where
JIJIJ^I is the set of all functions with
domain III and which take values in JJJ:

⋂i∈I⋃j∈JMi,j=⋃f∈JI⋂i∈IMi,f(i)⋂i∈I⋃j∈JMi,j=⋃f∈JI⋂i∈IMi,f(i)
 \bigcap_{i\in I} \bigcup_{j\in J} M_{i,j} 
 =
 \bigcup_{f\in J^I} \bigcap_{i\in I} M_{i,f(i)}


 A much-studied special case of AC is the

Principle of Dependent Choices (Bernays 1942, Tarski
1948). For any nonempty relation RRR on a set AAA for which
range(R)⊆domain(R)range(R)⊆domain(R)\range(R) \subseteq \domain(R), there is a function f:ω→Af:ω→Af: \omega
\rightarrow A such that, for all n∈ω,R(f(n),f(n+1))n∈ω,R(f(n),f(n+1))n\in \omega, R(f(n),f(n+1)).
This principle, although (much) weaker than AC, cannot be
proved without it in the context of the remaining axioms of set
theory.


 Mathematical equivalents of AC include:

Tychonov’s Theorem (1930): the product of compact
topological spaces is compact. This was proved equivalent to
AC in Kelley 1950. But for compact Hausdorff spaces it is
equivalent to BPI (see below) and hence weaker than
AC
Löwenheim-Skolem-Tarski Theorem
(Löwenheim 1915, Skolem 1920, Tarski and Vaught 1957): a
first-order sentence having a model of infinite cardinality κκ\kappa
also has a model of any infinite cardinality μμ\mu such that 
μ≤κμ≤κ\mu \le \kappa.  This was proved equivalent to AC by
Tarski.
Krein-Milman Theorem: the unit ball BBB of the
dual of a real normed linear space has an extreme point, that is, one
which is not an interior point of any line segment in BBB. This was
proved equivalent to AC in Bell and Fremlin 1972a. There it
is shown that, given any indexed family AA\sA of nonempty sets,
there is a natural bijection between choice functions on AA\sA and
the extreme points of the unit ball of the dual of a certain real
normed linear space constructed from AA\sA.
Every distributive lattice has a maximal ideal. This was proved
equivalent to AC in Klimovsky 1958, and for lattices
of sets in Bell and Fremlin 1972.
Every commutative ring with identity has a maximal ideal. This was
proved equivalent to AC by Hodges 1979.


 There are a number of mathematical consequences of AC
which are known to be
 weaker[14]
 than it, in particular:

The Boolean Prime Ideal Theorem
(BPI): every Boolean algebra has a maximal (or prime)
ideal. This was shown to be weaker than AC in Halpern
and Levy 1971.
The Stone Representation Theorem for Boolean
algebras (Stone 1936): every Boolean algebra is isomorphic to
a field of sets. This is equivalent to BPI and hence
weaker than AC 
Compactness Theorem for First-Order Logic
(Gödel 1930, Malcev 1937, others): if every finite subset of
a set of first-order sentences has a model, then the set has a
model. This was shown, in Henkin 1954, to be equivalent to
BPI, and hence weaker than AC.
Completeness Theorem for First-Order Logic
(Gödel 1930, Henkin 1954): each consistent set of first-order
sentences has a model. This was shown by Henkin in 1954 to be
equivalent to BPI, and hence weaker than
AC. If the cardinality of the model is specified in
the right way, the assertion becomes equivalent to
AC.


 Finally, there is

The Sikorski Extension Theorem for Boolean
algebras (Sikorski 1949): every complete Boolean algebra is
injective, i.e., for any Boolean algebra AAA and any complete
Boolean algebra BBB, any homomorphism of a subalgebra of
AAA into BBB can be extended to the whole of
AAA.


 The question of the equivalence of this with AC is one of
the few remaining interesting open questions in this area; while it
clearly implies BPI, it was proved independent of
BPI in Bell 1983.
 Many of these theorems are discussed in Bell and Machover (1977).

5. The Axiom of Choice and Logic


An initial connection between AC and logic emerges by
returning to its formulation AC3 in terms of
relations, namely: any binary relation contains a function with the
same domain. This version of AC is naturally
expressible within a second-order language LLL with individual
variables xxx, yyy, zzz, … and function
variables fff, ggg, hhh, …. In LLL,
binary relations are represented by formulas
ϕ(x,y)ϕ(x,y)\phi(x, y) with two free individual
variables xxx, yyy. The counterpart in LLL of the
assertion AC3 is then

ACL:
∀x∃yϕ(x,y)→∃f∀xϕ(x,fx).∀x∃yϕ(x,y)→∃f∀xϕ(x,fx).\forall x \exists y
\phi(x, y) \rightarrow  \exists f \forall x
\phi(x, fx).


This scheme of sentences is the standard logical form of
AC.

Zermelo’s original form of the Axiom of Choice,
AC1, can be expressed as a scheme of sentences within
a suitably strengthened version of LLL. Accordingly we now
suppose LLL to contain in addition predicate
variables XXX, YYY, ZZZ, … and
second-order function variables FFF, GGG, HHH,
…. Here a second-order function variable FFF may be
applied to a predicate variable XXX to yield an individual term
FXFXFX.   The scheme of sentences

AC1L:
∀X[Φ(X)→∃xX(x)]→∃F∀X[Φ(X)→X(FX)]∀X[Φ(X)→∃xX(x)]→∃F∀X[Φ(X)→X(FX)]\forall X [\Phi(X) \rightarrow  \exists x X(x)] \rightarrow 
\exists F \forall X[\Phi(X) \rightarrow X(FX)]


 is the direct counterpart of AC1 in this
strengthened second-order language. In words, AC1L
asserts that, if each predicate having a certain property
ΦΦ\Phi has instances, then there is a function FFF on
predicates such that, for any predicate XXX satisfying
ΦΦ\Phi, FXFXFX is an instance of XXX. Here
predicates are playing the role of sets.

 Up to now we have tacitly assumed our background logic to be the
usual classical logic. But the true depth of the connection between
AC and logic emerges only when
intuitionistic or constructive logic is brought into
the picture. It is a remarkable fact that, assuming only the framework
of intuitionistic logic together with certain mild further
presuppositions, the Axiom of Choice can be shown to entail the
cardinal rule of classical logic, the law of excluded 
middle—the assertion that A∨¬AA∨¬AA \vee \neg A for any proposition
AAA. To be precise, using the rules of intuitionistic logic
within our augmented language LLL, we shall
 derive[15]
 the law of excluded middle from AC1L conjoined with
the following additional principles:

Predicative Comprehension:
∃X∀x[X(x)↔ϕ(x)]∃X∀x[X(x)↔ϕ(x)]\exists X \forall x[X(x) \leftrightarrow \phi(x)], where ϕϕ\phi
contains no bound function or predicate variables.

Extensionality of Functions:
∀X∀Y∀F[X≈Y→FX=FY]∀X∀Y∀F[X≈Y→FX=FY]\forall X \forall Y \forall F[X \approx Y \rightarrow  FX = FY], where 
X≈YX≈YX \approx Y is an abbreviation for
∀x[X(x)↔Y(x)]∀x[X(x)↔Y(x)]\forall x[X(x) \leftrightarrow Y(x)], that is, XXX and YYY are
extensionally equivalent.

Two Distinct Individuals:
0_≠1_0–≠1–\uO \ne \uI, where 0_0–\uO and 1_1–\uI are
individual constants.


 Now let AAA be a given proposition. By Predicative
Comprehension, we may introduce predicate constants UUU,
VVV together with the assertions
∀x[U(x)↔(A∨x=0)]∀x[V(x)↔(A∨x=1)]∀x[U(x)↔(A∨x=0)]∀x[V(x)↔(A∨x=1)](1)\begin{align}
\tag{1} &amp;\forall x[U(x) \leftrightarrow (A \vee x = 0)] \\
\notag  &amp;\forall x[V(x) \leftrightarrow (A \vee x = 1)]
\end{align}


Let Φ(X)Φ(X)\Phi(X) be the formula X≈U∨X≈VX≈U∨X≈VX \approx U \vee X \approx V. Then
clearly we may assert ∀X[Φ(X)→∃xX(x)]∀X[Φ(X)→∃xX(x)]\forall X[\Phi(X) \rightarrow \exists xX(x)]
so AC1L may be invoked to assert ∃F∀X[Φ(X)→X(FX)]∃F∀X[Φ(X)→X(FX)]\exists F \forall
X[\Phi(X) \rightarrow X(FX)]. Now we can introduce a function
constant KKK together with the assertion
∀X[Φ(X)→X(KX)].∀X[Φ(X)→X(KX)].(2)
\tag{2} 
\forall X[\Phi(X) \rightarrow X(KX)].



Since evidently we may assert Φ(U)Φ(U)\Phi(U) and Φ(V)Φ(V)\Phi(V), it follows
from (2) that we may assert U(KU)U(KU)U(KU) and V(KV)V(KV)V(KV), whence also,
using (1),
[A∨KU=0]∧[A∨KV=1].[A∨KU=0]∧[A∨KV=1].
[A \vee KU = 0] \wedge [A \vee KV = 1].


Using the distributive law (which holds in intuitionistic logic), it
follows that we may assert
A∨[KU=0∧KV=1].A∨[KU=0∧KV=1].
A \vee [KU = 0 \wedge KV = 1].


From the presupposition that 0≠10≠10 \ne 1 it follows that
A∨KU≠KVA∨KU≠KV(3)
\tag{3} A \vee KU \ne KV


 is assertable. But it follows from (1) that we may assert A→U≈VA→U≈VA
\rightarrow U ≈ V, and so also, using the Extensionality of
Functions, A→KU=KVA→KU=KVA \rightarrow KU = KV. This yields the assertability of
KU≠KV→¬AKU≠KV→¬AKU \ne KV \rightarrow  \neg A,
which, together with (3) in turn yields the assertability of
A∨¬AA∨¬A
A \vee \neg A


that is, the law of excluded middle.

The fact that the Axiom of Choice implies Excluded Middle seems at
first sight to be at variance with the fact that the former is often
taken as a valid principle in systems of constructive
mathematics governed by intuitionistic logic, e.g. Bishop’s
 Constructive Analysis[16] 
 and Martin-Löf’s Constructive Type
 Theory[17], in
 which Excluded Middle is not affirmed. In Bishop’s words, “A
choice function exists in constructive mathematics because a choice is
implied by the very meaning of existence.” Thus, for
example, the antecedent 
∀x∃yϕ(x,y)∀x∃yϕ(x,y)\forall x \exists y \phi(x,y) of ACL, given a
constructive construal, just means that we have a procedure
which, applied to each xxx, yields a yyy for which
ϕ(x,y)ϕ(x,y)\phi(x, y). But this is precisely what is expressed by the
consequent ∃f∀xϕ(x,fx)∃f∀xϕ(x,fx)\exists f \forall x \phi(x,fx) of ACL.

 To resolve the difficulty, we note that in deriving Excluded Middle
from ACL1 essential use was made of the principles of
Predicative Comprehension and Extensionality of
 Functions[18]. 
 It follows that, in systems of constructive mathematics affirming
AC (but not Excluded Middle) either the principle
of Predicative Comprehension or the principle of Extensionality of
Functions must fail. While the principle of Predicative
Comprehension can be given a constructive justification, no such
justification can be provided for the principle of Extensionality of
Functions. Functions on predicates are given intensionally, and
satisfy just the corresponding principle of Intensionality
∀X∀Y∀F[X=Y→FX=FY]∀X∀Y∀F[X=Y→FX=FY]\forall X \forall Y \forall F[X = Y \rightarrow  FX = FY]. The
principle of Extensionality can easily be made to fail by considering,
for example, the predicates PPP: rational featherless
biped and QQQ: human being and the function
KKK on predicates which assigns to each predicate the number of
words in its description. Then we can agree that P≈QP≈QP \approx
Q but KP=3KP=3KP = 3 and KQ=2KQ=2KQ = 2.

 In intuitionistic set theory (that is, set theory based on
intuitionistic as opposed to classical logic—we shall abbreviate
this as IST) and in topos theory the principles of
Predicative Comprehension and Extensionality of Functions (both
appropriately construed) hold and so there AC implies
Excluded
 Middle.[19]
,
[20]

 The derivation of Excluded Middle from AC was first given by
Diaconescu (1975) in a category-theoretic setting. His proof employed
essentially different ideas from the proof presented above; in
particular, it makes no use of extensionality principles but instead
employs the idea of the quotient of an object (or set) by an
equivalence relation. It is instructive to formulate
Diaconescu’s argument within IST. To do this,
let us call a subset UUU of a set AAA detachable if there
is a subset VVV of AAA for which U∩V=∅U∩V=∅U \cap V = \varnothing and
U∪V=AU∪V=AU \cup V = A.  Diaconescu’s argument amounts to a derivation
from AC4 (see above) of the assertion that every
subset of a set is detachable, from which Excluded Middle readily
follows. Here it is.

 First, given U⊆AU⊆AU \subseteq A, an indicator for
UUU (in AAA) is a map g:A×2→2g:A×2→2g: A \times 2 \rightarrow 2 
satisfying
U={x∈A:g(x,0)=g(x,1)}U={x∈A:g(x,0)=g(x,1)}
U = \{ x \in A: g(x,0) = g(x,1) \}


 It is then easy to show that a subset is detachable if and only if
it has an indicator. 

 Now we show that, if AC4 holds, then any subset of a
set has an indicator, and hence is detachable.

 For U⊆AU⊆AU \subseteq A, let RRR be the binary
relation on A+A=A×{0}∪A×{1}A+A=A×{0}∪A×{1}A + A = A \times \{0\} \cup A \times \{1\}
given by
R={((x,0),(x,0)):x∈A}∪{((x,1),(x,1)):x∈A}∪{((x,0),(x,1):x∈A}∪{((x,1),(x,0)}:x∈AR={((x,0),(x,0)):x∈A}∪{((x,1),(x,1)):x∈A}∪{((x,0),(x,1):x∈A}∪{((x,1),(x,0)}:x∈A
R = \{ ((x,0),(x,0)) :
x \in A \} \cup \{ ((x,1),(x,1)) : x \in A \} \cup
  \{ ((x,0),(x,1) : x \in A \} \cup  
  \{ ((x,1),(x,0) \} : x \in A


It can be checked that RRR is an equivalence relation. Write
rrr for the natural map from A+AA+AA + A to the
 quotient[21]
QQQ of (A+A)(A+A)(A + A) by RRR which carries
each member of A+AA+AA + A to its R−R−R-equivalence
class.

 Now apply AC4 to obtain a map 
f:Q→A+Af:Q→A+Af: Q \rightarrow  A + A satisfying 
f(X)∈Xf(X)∈Xf(X) \in X for all X∈QX∈QX \in Q. It is then not
hard to show that, writing π1π1\pi_{1} for projection on the
first coordinate,
for n=0,1 and x∈A,π1(f(r(x,n)))=x;for n=0,1 and x∈A,π1(f(r(x,n)))=x;(*)
\tag{*} \mbox{for } n=0,1 \mbox{ and } x \in A, \pi_1(f(r(x,n))) = x;

and
x∈U↔f(r(x,0))=f(r(x,1)).x∈U↔f(r(x,0))=f(r(x,1)).(**)
\tag{**} x \in U \leftrightarrow f(r(x,0)) = f(r(x,1)).


 Now define g:A×2→2g:A×2→2g: A \times 2 \rightarrow 2 by g=π2∘f∘rg=π2∘f∘rg = \pi_{2} \circ f
\circ r, where π2π2\pi_2 is a projection on the second
coordinate. Then ggg is an indicator for UUU, as the
following equivalences show:
x∈U↔f(r(x,0))=f(r(x,1))…by (**)↔π1(f(r(x,0)))=π1(f(r(x,1)))∧π2(f(r(x,0)))=π2(f(r(x,1)))↔π2(f(r(x,0)))=π2(f(r(x,1)))…using (*)↔g(x,0)=g(x,1).x∈U↔f(r(x,0))=f(r(x,1))…by (**)↔π1(f(r(x,0)))=π1(f(r(x,1)))∧π2(f(r(x,0)))=π2(f(r(x,1)))↔π2(f(r(x,0)))=π2(f(r(x,1)))…using (*)↔g(x,0)=g(x,1).\begin{align}
x \in U &amp;\leftrightarrow f(r(x,0))=f(r(x,1)) \ldots \mbox{by (**)} \\

  &amp;\leftrightarrow 
   \pi_{1}(f(r(x,0))) = \pi_{1}(f(r(x,1))) \wedge
   \pi_{2}(f(r(x,0))) = \pi_{2}(f(r(x,1))) \\

  &amp;\leftrightarrow \pi_{2}(f(r(x,0))) =
     \pi_{2}(f(r(x,1))) \ldots \mbox{using (*)} \\

  &amp;\leftrightarrow g(x,0) = g(x,1).
\end{align}

The proof is complete.

 It can be shown (Bell 2006) that each of a number of
intuitionistically invalid logical principles, including the law of
excluded middle, is equivalent (in intuitionistic set theory)
to a suitably weakened version of the axiom of choice.  Accordingly
these logical principles may be viewed as choice principles.

Here are the logical principles at issue:


SLEM
α∨¬αα∨¬α\alpha \vee \neg \alpha (αα\alpha any sentence)


Lin
(α→β)∨(β→α)(α→β)∨(β→α)(\alpha \rightarrow  \beta) \vee (\beta \rightarrow \alpha) (αα\alpha, ββ\beta any sentences)


Stone
¬α∨¬¬α¬α∨¬¬α\neg \alpha \vee \neg\neg \alpha (αα\alpha any sentence)


Ex
∃x[∃xα(x)→α(x)]∃x[∃xα(x)→α(x)]\exists x[ \exists x \alpha(x) \rightarrow \alpha(x)]
    (α(x)α(x)\alpha(x) any formula with at most xxx free)


Un
∃x[α(x)→∀xα(x)]∃x[α(x)→∀xα(x)]\exists x[\alpha(x) \rightarrow \forall x\alpha(x)]
    (α(x)α(x)\alpha(x) any formula with at most xxx free)


Dis
∀x[α∨β(x)]→α∨∀xβ(x)∀x[α∨β(x)]→α∨∀xβ(x)\forall x[\alpha \vee \beta(x)] \rightarrow \alpha\vee\forall x\beta(x)
   (αα\alpha any sentence, β(x)β(x)\beta(x) any formula with at most xxx free)




 Over intuitionistic logic, Lin,
Stone and Ex are consequences of
SLEM; and Un implies
Dis. All of these schemes follow, of course, from the
full law of excluded middle, that is SLEM for
arbitrary formulas.

 In what follows the empty set is denoted by 0, {0}{0}\{0\} by 1, and
{0,1}{0,1}\{0, 1\} by 2. 

 We formulate the following choice principles—here XXX
is an arbitrary set, Fun(X)Fun(X)\Fun(X) the class of functions with
domain XXX and ϕ(x,y)ϕ(x,y)\phi(x,y) an arbitrary
formula of the language of set theory with at most the free variables
xxx, yyy:


ACXX_X
∀x∈X ∃yϕ(x,y)→∃f∈Fun(X) ∀x∈X ϕ(x,fx)∀x∈X ∃yϕ(x,y)→∃f∈Fun(X) ∀x∈X ϕ(x,fx)\forall x\in X\ \exists y \phi(x,y) \rightarrow  \exists f \in 
\Fun(X)\ \forall x \in X\ \phi(x,fx)


AC∗X∗X^*_X
∃f∈Fun(X)[∀x∈X ∃yϕ(x,y)→∀x∈X ϕ(x,fx)]∃f∈Fun(X)[∀x∈X ∃yϕ(x,y)→∀x∈X ϕ(x,fx)]{\exists f \inn \Fun(X)} [{\forall x\inn X}\ \exists y \phi(x,y)
\rightarrow {\forall x \inn X}\ \phi(x,fx)]


DACXX_X
∀f∈Fun(X) ∃x∈X ϕ(x,fx)→∃x∈X ∀yϕ(x,y)∀f∈Fun(X) ∃x∈X ϕ(x,fx)→∃x∈X ∀yϕ(x,y)\forall f \inn Fun(X)\ {\exists x \inn X}\ \phi(x,fx) \rightarrow 
{\exists x \inn X}\ \forall y \phi(x,y)


DAC∗X∗X^*_X
∃f∈Fun(X) [∃x∈X ϕ(x,fx)→∃x∈X ∀yϕ(x,y)]∃f∈Fun(X) [∃x∈X ϕ(x,fx)→∃x∈X ∀yϕ(x,y)]{\exists f \inn \Fun(X)}\ [{\exists x\inn X}\ \phi(x,fx) \rightarrow 
 {\exists x \inn X}\ \forall y \phi(x,y)]



 The first two of these are forms of AC for
XXX; while classically equivalent, in IST
AC∗X∗X^*_X implies ACXX_X, but not
conversely. The principles DACXX_X and
DAC∗X∗X^*_X are dual forms of the axiom of
choice for XXX: classically they are both equivalent to
ACXX_X and AC∗X∗X^*_X but
intuitionistically DAC∗X∗X^*_X
implies DACXX_X, and not conversely.

We also formulate the weak extensional selection principle,
in which α(x)α(x)\alpha(x) and β(x)β(x)\beta(x) are any formulas
with at most the variable xxx free:

WESP:
∃x∈2 α(x)∧∃x∈2 β(x)→∃x∈2 ∃y∈2 [α(x)∧β(y)∧[∀x∈2 [α(x)↔β(x)]→x=y]].∃x∈2 α(x)∧∃x∈2 β(x)→∃x∈2 ∃y∈2 [α(x)∧β(y)∧[∀x∈2 [α(x)↔β(x)]→x=y]].{\exists x\inn 2}\ \alpha(x) \wedge
{\exists x \inn 2}\ \beta(x) \rightarrow 
{\exists x \inn 2}\ {\exists y \inn 2}\ [\alpha(x) \wedge
\beta(y) \wedge [{\forall x \inn 2}\
[\alpha(x) \leftrightarrow \beta(x)] \rightarrow  x = y]].


 This principle, a straightforward consequence of the axiom of choice,
asserts that, for any pair of instantiated properties of members of 2,
instances may be assigned to the properties in a manner that depends
just on their extensions.

 Each of the logical principles tabulated above is equivalent (in
IST) to a choice principle. In fact:

WESP and SLEM are equivalent over
  IST. 
AC∗1∗1^*_1 and
  Ex are equivalent over IST.


 Further, while DAC11_1 is easily seen to be
provable in IST, we have

DAC∗1∗1^*_1
  and Un are equivalent over
  IST.


 Next, while AC22_2 is easily proved in
IST, by contrast we have

DAC22_2 and Dis are
  equivalent over IST.
Over IST,
  DAC∗2∗2^*_2 is
  equivalent to Un, and hence also to
  DAC∗1∗1^*_1.


 In order to provide choice schemes equivalent to Lin
and Stone we introduce

ac∗X∗X^*_X:
∃f∈2X[∀x∈X ∃y∈2 ϕ(x,y)→∃x∈X ϕ(x,fx)]∃f∈2X[∀x∈X ∃y∈2 ϕ(x,y)→∃x∈X ϕ(x,fx)]{\exists f \inn 2^X} [{\forall x\inn X}\ {\exists y \inn 2}\ \phi(x,y) 
\rightarrow {\exists x \inn X}\ \phi(x,fx)]


wac∗X∗X^*_X:
∃f∈2X[∀x∈X ∃y∈2 ϕ(x,y)→∀x∈X ϕ(x,fx)]∃f∈2X[∀x∈X ∃y∈2 ϕ(x,y)→∀x∈X ϕ(x,fx)]{\exists f \inn 2^X} [{\forall x \inn X}\ {\exists y \inn 2}\ \phi(x,y) 
\rightarrow  {\forall x \inn X}\ \phi(x,fx)] provided it is provable in
IST that 
∀x[ϕ(x,0)→¬ϕ(x,1)]∀x[ϕ(x,0)→¬ϕ(x,1)]\forall x[\phi(x,0) \rightarrow  \neg\phi(x,1)]

Clearly ac∗X∗X^*_X is equivalent to

∃f∈2X[∀x∈X[ϕ(x,0)∨ϕ(x,1)]→∀x∈X ϕ(x,fx)]∃f∈2X[∀x∈X[ϕ(x,0)∨ϕ(x,1)]→∀x∈X ϕ(x,fx)]{\exists f \inn 2^X}[{\forall x \inn X}[\phi(x,0) \vee \phi(x,1)] \rightarrow 
{\forall x \inn X}\ \phi(x,fx)]


 and similarly for
dac∗X∗X^*_X.

 Then, over IST,
ac∗1∗1^*_1 and dac∗1∗1^*_1 are
equivalent, respectively, to Lin and
Stone.

 These results show just how deeply choice principles interact with
logic, when the background logic is assumed to be intuitionistic. In a
classical setting where the Law of Excluded Middle is assumed these
connections are obliterated.
