Hybrid logics are logics that result by adding further expressive
power to ordinary modal logic. The most basic hybrid logic is obtained
by adding so-called nominals which are propositional symbols of a new
sort, each being true at exactly one possible world. The history of
hybrid logic goes back to
   Arthur N. Prior’s work in the 1960s.

 
1. Motivations for hybrid logic

In the standard Kripke semantics for modal logic, truth is relative to
points in a set. Thus, a propositional symbol might have different
truth-values relative to different points. Usually, these points are
taken to represent possible worlds, times, epistemic states, states in
a computer, or something else. This allows us to formalize natural
language statements whose truth-values are relative to for example
times, like the statement

it is raining


which clearly has different truth-values at different times. Now,
certain natural language statements are true at exactly one time,
possible world, or something else. An example is the statement

it is five o’clock 15 March 2006


which is true at the time five o’clock 15 March 2006, but false
at all other times. The first kind of natural language statements can
be formalized in ordinary modal logic, but the second kind cannot.

A major motivation for hybrid logic is to add further expressive power
to ordinary modal logic with the aim of being able to formalize the
second kind of statements. This is obtained by adding to ordinary
modal logic a second sort of propositional symbols called
nominals such that in the Kripke semantics each nominal is
true relative to exactly one point. A natural language statement of
the second kind (like the example statement with the time five
o’clock 15 March 2006) is then formalized using a nominal, not
an ordinary propositional symbol (which would be used to formalize the
example statement with rainy weather). The fact that a nominal is true
relative to exactly one point implies that a nominal can be considered
a term referring to a point, for example, if aa\mathtt{a} is a
nominal that stands for “it is five o’clock 15 March
2006”, then this nominal can be considered a term referring to
the time five o’clock 15 March 2006. Thus, in hybrid logic a
term is a specific sort of propositional symbol whereas in first-order
logic it is an argument to a predicate.

Most hybrid logics involve further additional machinery than nominals.
There is a number of options for adding further machinery; here we
shall consider what are called satisfaction operators. The
motivation for adding satisfaction operators is to be able to
formalize a statement being true at a particular time, possible world,
or something else. For example, we want to be able to formalize that
the statement “it is raining” is true at the time five
o’clock 15 March 2006, that is, that

at five o’clock 15 March 2006, it is raining.


This is formalized by the formula @ap@ap\mathtt{@_a p} where the nominal
aa\mathtt{a} stands for “it is five o’clock 15 March
2006” as above and where pp\mathtt{p} is an ordinary
propositional symbol that stands for “it is raining”. It
is the part @a@a\mathtt{@_a} of the formula @ap@ap\mathtt{@_a p} that is
called a satisfaction operator. In general, if aa\mathtt{a} is a
nominal and ϕϕ\mathtt{\phi} is an arbitrary formula, then a new
formula @aϕ@aϕ\mathtt{@_a\phi} called a satisfaction statement
can be built. The satisfaction statement @aϕ@aϕ\mathtt{@_a\phi}
expresses that the formula ϕϕ\mathtt{\phi} is true relative to one
particular point, namely the point to which the nominal aa\mathtt{a}
refers.

To sum up, we have now added further expressive power to ordinary
modal logic in the form of nominals and satisfaction operators.
Informally, the nominal aa\mathtt{a} has the truth-condition

aa\mathtt{a} is true relative to a point www

    if and only if

the reference of aa\mathtt{a} is identical to www


and the satisfaction statement @aϕ@aϕ\mathtt{@_a\phi} has the
truth-condition

@aϕ@aϕ\mathtt{@_a\phi} is true relative to a point www

    if and only if

ϕϕ\mathtt{\phi} is true relative to the reference of aa\mathtt{a}


Note that actually the point www does not matter in the
truth-condition for @aϕ@aϕ\mathtt{@_a\phi} since the satisfaction
operator @a@a\mathtt{@_a} moves the point of evaluation to the
reference of aa\mathtt{a} whatever the identity of www.

It is remarkable that nominals together with satisfaction operators
allow us to express that two points are identical: If the nominals
aa\mathtt{a} and bb\mathtt{b} refer to the points www and vvv,
then the formula @ab@ab\mathtt{@_a b} expresses that www and vvv are
identical. The following line of reasoning shows why.

@ab@ab\mathtt{@_a b} is true relative to a point www

    if and only if

bb\mathtt{b} is true relative to the reference of aa\mathtt{a}

    if and only if

bb\mathtt{b} is true relative to www

    if and only if

the reference of bb\mathtt{b} is identical to www

    if and only if

vvv is identical to www


The identity relation on a set has the well-known properties
reflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity, which is reflected in the
fact that the formulas
@aa@ab→@ba(@ab&@bc)→@ac@aa@ab→@ba(@ab&@bc)→@ac\begin{align*}
&amp; \mathtt{@_a a} \\
&amp; \mathtt{@_a b \rightarrow @_b a} \\
&amp;(\mathtt{@_a b \amp @_b c) \rightarrow @_a c}
\end{align*}

are valid formulas of hybrid logic. Also the formula
(@ab&@aϕ)→@bϕ(@ab&@aϕ)→@bϕ
(\mathtt{@_ab \amp @_a\phi) \rightarrow @_b\phi}


is valid. This is the rule of replacement.

Beside nominals and satisfaction operators, in what follows we shall
consider the so-called binders ∀∀\mathtt{\forall} and
↓↓\mathtt{\downarrow} allowing us to build formulas
∀aϕ∀aϕ\mathtt{\forall a \phi} and ↓aϕ↓aϕ\mathtt{{\downarrow} a \phi}. The
binders bind nominals to points in two different ways: The
∀∀\mathtt{\forall} binder quantifies over points analogous to the
standard first-order universal quantifier, that is, ∀aϕ∀aϕ\mathtt{\forall
a \phi} is true relative to www if and only if whatever point the
nominal aa\mathtt{a} refers to, it is the case that
ϕϕ\mathtt{\phi} is true relative to www. The
↓↓\mathtt{\downarrow} binder binds a nominal to the point of
evaluation, that is, ↓aϕ↓aϕ\mathtt{{\downarrow} a \phi} is true relative
to www if and only if ϕϕ\mathtt{\phi} is true relative to www
when aa\mathtt{a} refers to www. It turns out that the
↓↓\mathtt{\downarrow} binder is definable in terms of
∀∀\mathtt{\forall} (as shown below).
2. Formal semantics

The language we consider is the language of ordinary modal logic built
over ordinary propositional symbols p,q,r,…p,q,r,…\mathtt{p}, \mathtt{q},
\mathtt{r}, … as well as nominals a,b,c,…a,b,c,…\mathtt{a}, \mathtt{b},
\mathtt{c}, … and extended with satisfaction operators and
binders. We take the propositional connectives ∧∧\mathtt{\wedge} and
¬¬\mathtt{\neg} to be primitive; other propositional connectives are
defined as usual. Similarly, we take the modal operator
□◻\mathtt{\Box} to be primitive and define the modal operator
◊◊\mathtt{\Diamond} as ¬□¬¬◻¬\mathtt{\neg \Box \neg}. As the name
suggests, binders bind nominals and the notions of free and bound
occurrences of nominals are defined analogously to first-order logic.
Satisfaction operators do not bind nominals, that is, the free nominal
occurrences in a formula @aϕ@aϕ\mathtt{@_a \phi} are the free nominal
occurrences in ϕϕ\mathtt{\phi} together with the occurrence of
aa\mathtt{a}. We let ϕ[c/a]ϕ[c/a]\mathtt{\phi[c/a]} be the formula
ϕϕ\mathtt{\phi} where the nominal cc\mathtt{c} has been
substituted for all free occurrences of the nominal aa\mathtt{a}. If
the nominal aa\mathtt{a} occurs free in ϕϕ\mathtt{\phi} within the
scope of ∀c∀c\mathtt{\forall c} or ↓c↓c\mathtt{{\downarrow} c}, then
the bound nominal cc\mathtt{c} in ϕϕ\mathtt{\phi} is renamed as
appropriate.

We now define models and frames. A model for hybrid logic is
a triple (W,R,V)(W,R,V)(W, R, V) where WWW is a non-empty set, RRR is a
binary relation on WWW, and VVV is a function that to each pair
consisting of an element of WWW and an ordinary propositional symbol
assigns an element of the set {0,1}{0,1}\{0,1\}. The pair (W,R)(W,R)(W, R) is
called a frame. Thus, models and frames are the same as in
ordinary modal logic. The elements of WWW are called worlds
and the relation RRR is called the accessibility relation.
The model (W,R,V)(W,R,V)(W, R, V) is said to be based on the frame
(W,R)(W,R)(W, R).

An assignment for a model M=(W,R,V)M=(W,R,V)M = (W, R, V) is a function
ggg that to each nominal assigns an element of WWW. An assignment
g′g′g' is an aa\mathtt{a}-variant of ggg if g′g′g' agrees
with ggg on all nominals save possibly aa\mathtt{a}. The relation
M,g,w⊨ϕM,g,w⊨ϕM, g, w \vDash \phi is defined by induction, where ggg is an
assignment, www is an element of WWW, and ϕϕ\mathtt{\phi} is a
formula.

M,g,w⊨pM,g,w⊨pM, g, w \vDash \mathtt{p} iff V(w,p)=1V(w,p)=1V(w, \mathtt{p})=1

M,g,w⊨aM,g,w⊨aM, g, w \vDash \mathtt{a} iff w=g(a)w=g(a)w = g(\mathtt{a})

M,g,w⊨ϕ∧ψM,g,w⊨ϕ∧ψM, g, w \vDash \mathtt{\phi \wedge \psi} iff M,g,w⊨ϕM,g,w⊨ϕM, g, w \vDash
\mathtt{\phi} and M,g,w⊨ψM,g,w⊨ψM, g, w \vDash \mathtt{\psi}

M,g,w⊨¬ϕM,g,w⊨¬ϕM, g, w \vDash \mathtt{\neg \phi} iff not M,g,w⊨ϕM,g,w⊨ϕM, g, w \vDash
\mathtt{\phi}

M,g,w⊨□ϕM,g,w⊨◻ϕM, g, w \vDash \mathtt{\Box} \phi iff for any element vvv of
WWW such that wRvwRvwRv, it is the case that M,g,v⊨ϕM,g,v⊨ϕM, g, v \vDash
\mathtt{\phi}

M,g,w⊨@aϕM,g,w⊨@aϕM, g, w \vDash \mathtt{@_a \phi} iff M,g,g(a)⊨ϕM,g,g(a)⊨ϕM, g, g(\mathtt{a}) \vDash
\mathtt{\phi}

M,g,w⊨∀aϕM,g,w⊨∀aϕM, g, w \vDash \mathtt{\forall a\phi} iff for any
aa\mathtt{a}-variant g′g′g' of ggg, it is the case that M,g′,w⊨ϕM,g′,w⊨ϕM, g', w
\vDash \mathtt{\phi}

M,g,w⊨↓aϕM,g,w⊨↓aϕM, g, w \vDash \mathtt{{\downarrow} a\phi} iff M,g′,w⊨ϕM,g′,w⊨ϕM, g', w \vDash
\mathtt{\phi} where g′g′g' is the aa\mathtt{a}-variant of ggg
such that g′(a)=wg′(a)=wg'(\mathtt{a}) = w.


A formula ϕϕ\mathtt{\phi} is said to be true at www if
M,g,w⊨ϕM,g,w⊨ϕM, g, w \vDash \mathtt{\phi}; otherwise it is said to be
false at www. By convention M,g⊨ϕM,g⊨ϕM, g \vDash \mathtt{\phi}
means M,g,w⊨ϕM,g,w⊨ϕM, g, w \vDash \mathtt{\phi} for every element www of
WWW and M⊨ϕM⊨ϕM \vDash \mathtt{\phi} means M,g⊨ϕM,g⊨ϕM, g \vDash
\mathtt{\phi} for every assignment ggg. A formula
ϕϕ\mathtt{\phi} is valid in a frame if and only if M⊨ϕM⊨ϕM
\vDash \mathtt{\phi} for any model MMM that is based on the frame
in question. A formula ϕϕ\mathtt{\phi} is valid in a class
of frames FFF if and only if ϕϕ \mathtt{\phi} is valid in any
frame in FFF. A formula ϕϕ\mathtt{\phi} is valid if and
only if ϕϕ\mathtt{\phi} is valid in the class of all frames. The
definition of satisfiability is left to the reader.

Note that the binder ↓↓\mathtt{\downarrow} is definable in terms of
∀∀\mathtt{\forall} as the formula ↓aϕ↔∀a(a→ϕ)↓aϕ↔∀a(a→ϕ)\mathtt{{\downarrow} a\phi
\leftrightarrow \forall a(a \rightarrow \phi)} is valid in any
frame.

The fact that hybridizing ordinary modal logic actually does give more
expressive power can for example be seen by considering the formula
↓c□¬c↓c◻¬c\mathtt{{\downarrow} c\Box \neg c}. It is straightforward to check
that this formula is valid in a frame if and only if the frame is
irreflexive. Thus, irreflexivity can be expressed by a hybrid-logical
formula, but it is well known that it cannot be expressed by any
formula of ordinary modal logic. Irreflexivity can actually be
expressed just by adding nominals to ordinary modal logic, namely by
the formula c→□¬cc→◻¬c\mathtt{c\rightarrow \Box \neg c}. Other examples of
properties expressible in hybrid logic, but not in ordinary modal
logic, are asymmetry (expressed by c→□¬◊cc→◻¬◊c\mathtt{c \rightarrow \Box \neg
\Diamond c }), antisymmetry (expressed by c→□(◊c→c)c→◻(◊c→c)\mathtt{c\rightarrow
\Box(\Diamond c \rightarrow c)}), and universality (expressed by
◊c◊c\mathtt{\Diamond c}).

See the handbook chapter Areces and ten Cate (2006) for a detailed
account of the syntax and semantics of hybrid logic, as well as many
other basic definitions. The syntax and semantics above can be
extended in a number of ways, in particular, first-order machinery can
be added (of course, an equivalent way to obtain first-order hybrid
logic is by adding hybrid-logical machinery to first-order modal
logic). See Braüner (2014) for an overview of first-order hybrid
logic, see Chapter 6 of Braüner (2011a) for a more detailed account,
and see Chapter 7 of Braüner (2011a) for an account of intensional
first-order hybrid logic.
3. Translations

Hybrid logic can be translated into first-order logic with equality,
and (a fragment of) first-order logic with equality can be translated
back into (a fragment of) hybrid logic. The first-order language under
consideration has a 1-place predicate symbol p∗p∗\mathtt{p^*}
corresponding to each ordinary propositional symbol pp\mathtt{p} of
modal logic, a 2-place predicate symbol RR\mathtt{R}, and a 2-place
predicate symbol ==\mathtt{=}. Of course, the predicate symbol
p∗p∗\mathtt{p^*} will be interpreted such that it relativises the
interpretation of the corresponding modal propositional symbol
pp\mathtt{p} to worlds, the predicate symbol RR\mathtt{R} will be
interpreted using the accessibility relation, and the predicate symbol
==\mathtt{=} will be interpreted using the identity relation on
worlds. We let a,b,c,…a,b,c,…\mathtt{a}, \mathtt{b}, \mathtt{c},\ldots range
over first-order variables. The language does not have constant or
function symbols. We shall identify first-order variables with
nominals of hybrid logic.

We first translate hybrid logic into first-order logic with equality.
Given two new first-order variables aa\mathtt{a} and bb\mathtt{b},
the translations STaSTa\mathrm{ST}_\mathtt{a} and
STbSTb\mathrm{ST}_\mathtt{b} are defined by mutual recursion. We just
give the translation STaSTa\mathrm{ST}_\mathtt{a}.
STa(p)STa(c)STa(ϕ∧ψ)STa(¬ϕ)STa(□ϕ)STa(@cϕ)STa(↓cϕ)STa(∀cϕ)=p∗(a)=a=c=STa(ϕ)∧STa(ψ)=¬STa(ϕ)=∀b(R(a,b)→STb(ϕ))=STa(ϕ)[c/a]=STa(ϕ)[a/c]=∀cSTa(ϕ)STa(p)=p∗(a)STa(c)=a=cSTa(ϕ∧ψ)=STa(ϕ)∧STa(ψ)STa(¬ϕ)=¬STa(ϕ)STa(◻ϕ)=∀b(R(a,b)→STb(ϕ))STa(@cϕ)=STa(ϕ)[c/a]STa(↓cϕ)=STa(ϕ)[a/c]STa(∀cϕ)=∀cSTa(ϕ)\begin{align*}
\mathrm{ST}_\mathtt{a} (\mathtt{p}) &amp;= \mathtt{p^*(a)} \\
\mathrm{ST}_\mathtt{a} (\mathtt{c}) &amp;= \mathtt{a=c} \\
\mathrm{ST}_\mathtt{a} (\mathtt{\phi \wedge \psi}) &amp;= \mathrm{ST}_\mathtt{a} (\mathtt{\phi}) \mathtt{\wedge} \mathrm{ST}_\mathtt{a} (\mathtt{\psi}) \\
\mathrm{ST}_\mathtt{a} (\mathtt{\neg \phi}) &amp;= \mathtt{\neg} \mathrm{ST}_a (\phi) \\
\mathrm{ST}_\mathtt{a} (\mathtt{\Box \phi}) &amp;= \mathtt{\forall b(R(a, b) \rightarrow} \mathrm{ST}_\mathtt{b} (\mathtt{\phi})\mathtt{)} \\
\mathrm{ST}_\mathtt{a} (\mathtt{@_c \phi}) &amp;= \mathrm{ST}_\mathtt{a} (\mathtt{\phi})[\mathtt{c}/\mathtt{a}]  \\
\mathrm{ST}_\mathtt{a} (\mathtt{{\downarrow} c\phi}) &amp;= \mathrm{ST}_\mathtt{a} (\mathtt{\phi})[\mathtt{a}/\mathtt{c}] \\
\mathrm{ST}_\mathtt{a} (\mathtt{\forall c\phi}) &amp;= \mathtt{\forall c }\mathrm{ST}_\mathtt{a} (\mathtt{\phi})
\end{align*}

The definition of STbSTb\mathrm{ST}_\mathtt{b} is obtained by exchanging
aa\mathtt{a} and bb\mathtt{b}. The translation is an extension of
the well-known standard translation from modal logic into
first-order logic. As an example, we demonstrate step by step how the
hybrid-logical formula ↓c□¬c↓c◻¬c\mathtt{{\downarrow} c\Box \neg c} is
translated into a first-order formula:
STa(↓c□¬c)=STa(□¬c)[a/c]=∀b(R(a,b)→STb(¬c))[a/c]=∀b(R(a,b)→¬STb(c))[a/c]=∀b(R(a,b)→¬b=c)[a/c]=∀b(R(a,b)→¬b=a).STa(↓c◻¬c)=STa(◻¬c)[a/c]=∀b(R(a,b)→STb(¬c))[a/c]=∀b(R(a,b)→¬STb(c))[a/c]=∀b(R(a,b)→¬b=c)[a/c]=∀b(R(a,b)→¬b=a).\begin{align*}
\mathrm{ST}_\mathtt{a} (\mathtt{{\downarrow} c\Box \neg c}) 
  &amp;= \mathrm{ST}_\mathtt{a} (\mathtt{\Box \neg c})[\mathtt{a}/\mathtt{c}] \\
  &amp;= \mathtt{\forall b(R(a, b) \rightarrow } \mathrm{ST}_\mathtt{b} (\mathtt{\neg c})\mathtt{)}[\mathtt{a}/\mathtt{c}] \\
  &amp;= \mathtt{\forall b(R(a, b) \rightarrow \neg } \mathrm{ST}_\mathtt{b} (\mathtt{c})\mathtt{)}[\mathtt{a}/\mathtt{c}] \\
  &amp;= \mathtt{\forall b(R(a, b) \rightarrow \neg b=c)}[\mathtt{a}/\mathtt{c}] \\
  &amp;= \mathtt{\forall b(R(a, b) \rightarrow \neg b=a)}.
\end{align*}

The resulting first-order formula is equivalent to ¬R(a,a)¬R(a,a)\mathtt{\neg R(a,
a)} which shows that ↓c□¬c↓c◻¬c\mathtt{{\downarrow} c\Box \neg c} indeed
does correspond to the accessibility relation being irreflexive, cf.
above.

First-order logic with equality can be translated back into hybrid
logic by the translation HT given below.
HT(p∗(a))HT(R(a,c))HT(a=c)HT(ϕ∧ψ)HT(¬ϕ)HT(∀aϕ)=@ap=@a◊c=@ac=HT(ϕ)∧HT(ψ)=¬HT(ϕ)=∀aHT(ϕ)HT(p∗(a))=@apHT(R(a,c))=@a◊cHT(a=c)=@acHT(ϕ∧ψ)=HT(ϕ)∧HT(ψ)HT(¬ϕ)=¬HT(ϕ)HT(∀aϕ)=∀aHT(ϕ)\begin{align*}
\mathrm{HT}(\mathtt{p^*(a)}) &amp;= \mathtt{@_a p} \\
\mathrm{HT}(\mathtt{R(a, c)}) &amp;= \mathtt{@_a \Diamond c} \\
\mathrm{HT}(\mathtt{a=c}) &amp;= \mathtt{@_a c} \\
\mathrm{HT}(\mathtt{\phi \wedge \psi}) &amp;= \mathrm{HT}(\mathtt{\phi}) \mathtt{\wedge} \mathrm{HT}(\mathtt{\psi}) \\
\mathrm{HT}(\mathtt{\neg \phi}) &amp;= \mathtt{\neg} \mathrm{HT}(\mathtt{\phi}) \\
\mathrm{HT}(\mathtt{\forall a\phi}) &amp;= \mathtt{\forall a} \mathrm{HT}(\mathtt{\phi})
\end{align*}

Note that the hybrid-logical binder ∀∀\mathtt{\forall} is needed.
The history of the above mentioned observations goes back to the work
of Arthur N. Prior, we shall return to that later.

Similarly, what is called the bounded fragment of first-order
logic can be translated into the hybrid logic but here only the binder
↓↓\mathtt{\downarrow} is needed, as pointed out in the paper Areces,
Blackburn, and Marx (2001). The bounded fragment is the fragment of
first-order logic with the property that quantifiers only occur as in
the formula ∀c(R(a,c)→ϕ)∀c(R(a,c)→ϕ)\mathtt{\forall c(R(a, c) \rightarrow \phi)}, where it
is required that the variables aa\mathtt{a} and cc\mathtt{c} are
different. A translation from the bounded fragment to the hybrid logic
without the ∀∀\mathtt{\forall} binder can be obtained by replacing
the last clause in the translation HT above by
HT(∀c(R(a,c)→ϕ))=@a□↓cHT(ϕ).HT(∀c(R(a,c)→ϕ))=@a◻↓cHT(ϕ).
\mathrm{HT}(\mathtt{\forall c(R(a, c) \rightarrow \phi)}) = \mathtt{@_a \Box {\downarrow} c}\mathrm{HT}(\mathtt{\phi}).


In Areces, Blackburn, and Marx (2001) a number of independent semantic
characterisations of the bounded fragment are given.

The translations given above are truth-preserving. To state this
formally, one makes use of the well-known observation that models and
assignments for hybrid logic can be considered as models and
assignments for first-order logic and vice versa. These
truth-preservation results are straightforward to formulate and we
leave the details to the reader. Thus, the hybrid logic with the
binder ∀∀\mathtt{\forall} has the same expressive power as
first-order logic with equality and the hybrid logic without the
binder ∀∀\mathtt{\forall} (but with the binder
↓↓\mathtt{\downarrow}) has the same expressive power as the bounded
fragment of first-order logic (note that the translation
STa(ϕ)STa(ϕ)\mathrm{ST}_\mathtt{a} (\mathtt{\phi}) of any formula
ϕϕ\mathtt{\phi} without the binder ∀∀\mathtt{\forall} is in the
bounded fragment).

The translations above can be extended to first-order hybrid logic, in
which case the relevant target logic is two-sorted first-order logic
with equality, one sort for worlds and one sort for individuals, see
Chapter 6 of Braüner (2011a). In the case of intensional first-order
hybrid logic, three sorts are employed, the third sort being for
intensions, see Chapter 7 of Braüner (2011a).
4. Arthur N. Prior and hybrid logic

The history of hybrid logic goes back to Arthur N. Prior’s
hybrid tense logic, which is a hybridized version of ordinary tense
logic. With the aim of investigating this further, we shall give a
formal definition of hybrid tense logic: The language of hybrid tense
logic is simply the language of hybrid logic defined above except that
there are two modal operators, namely GG\mathtt{G} and
HH\mathtt{H}, instead of the single modal operator
□◻\mathtt{\Box}. The two new modal operators are called tense
operators. The semantics of hybrid tense logic is the semantics
of hybrid logic, cf. earlier, with the clause for □◻\mathtt{\Box}
replaced by clauses for the tense operators GG\mathtt{G} and
HH\mathtt{H}.

M,g,w⊨GϕM,g,w⊨GϕM, g, w \vDash \mathtt{G \phi} iff for any element vvv of WWW
such that wRvwRvwRv, it is the case that M,g,v⊨ϕM,g,v⊨ϕM, g, v \vDash
\mathtt{\phi}

M,g,w⊨HϕM,g,w⊨HϕM, g, w \vDash \mathtt{H \phi} iff for any element vvv of WWW
such that vRwvRwvRw, it is the case that M,g,v⊨ϕM,g,v⊨ϕM, g, v \vDash
\mathtt{\phi}


Thus, there are now two modal operators, namely one that “looks
forwards” along the accessibility relation and one that
“looks backwards”. In tense logic the elements of the set
WWW are called moments or instants and the
relation RRR is called the earlier-later relation.

Of course, it is straightforward to modify the translations
STaSTa\mathrm{ST}_a and HTHT\mathrm{HT} above such that translations are
obtained between hybrid tense logic (including the
∀∀\mathtt{\forall} binder) and first-order logic with equality. The
first-order logic under consideration is what Prior called
first-order earlier-later logic. Given the translations, it
follows that Prior’s first-order earlier-later logic has the
same expressive power as hybrid tense logic.

Now, Prior introduced hybrid tense logic in connection with what he
called four grades of tense-logical involvement. The motivation for
his four grades of tense-logical involvement was philosophical. The
four grades were presented in the book Prior (1968), Chapter XI (also
Chapter XI in the new edition Prior (2003)). Moreover, see Prior
(1967), Chapter V.6 and Appendix B.3-4. For a more general discussion,
see the posthumously published book Prior and Fine (1977). The stages
progress from what can be regarded as pure first-order earlier-later
logic to what can be regarded as pure tense logic; the goal being to
be able to consider the tense logic of the fourth stage as
encompassing the earlier-later logic of the first stage. In other
words, the goal was to be able to translate the first-order logic of
the earlier-later relation into tense logic. It was with this goal in
mind Prior introduced so-called instant-propositions:

What I shall call the third grade of tense-logical involvement
consists in treating the instant-variables a,b,ca,b,ca, b, c, etc. as also
representing propositions. (Prior 2003, p. 124)


In the context of modal logic, Prior called such propositions
possible-world-propositions. Of course, this is what we here call
nominals. Prior also introduced the binder ∀∀\mathtt{\forall} and
what we here call satisfaction operators (he used the notation
T(a,ϕ)T(a,ϕ)\mathtt{T(a, \phi)} instead of @aϕ@aϕ\mathtt{@_a \phi} for
satisfaction operators). In fact, Prior’s third grade tense
logic is identical to the hybrid tense logic as defined above. The
↓↓\mathtt{\downarrow} binder was introduced much later. Thus, Prior
obtained the expressive power of his first-order earlier-later logic
by adding to ordinary tense logic further expressive power in the form
of nominals, satisfaction operators, and the binder
∀∀\mathtt{\forall}. So from a technical point of view he clearly
reached his goal.

However, from a philosophical point of view it has been debated
whether or not the ontological import of his third grade tense logic
is the same as the ontological import of the first-order earlier-later
logic. For example, the ∀∀\mathtt{\forall} binder is by some authors
considered a direct analogy to the first-order ∀∀\mathtt{\forall}
quantifier, and therefore suspect; see for example the paper Sylvan
(1996) in the collection Copeland (1996). Also a number of other
papers in this collection are relevant. See Braüner (2002) for a
discussion of Prior’s fourth grade tense logic. See also
Øhrstrøm and Hasle (1993), Øhrstrøm and
Hasle (2006), Müller (2007), and Blackburn (2007). Finally, see
the discussion of Prior’s four grades in Chapter 1 of
Braüner (2011a).

The above mentioned paper Øhrstrøm and Hasle (2006)
gives a detailed account of Prior's logical work. For a comprehensive
account of Prior's life and work, see the book Øhrstrøm and Hasle
(1995). The paper Hasle and Øhrstrøm (2016) describes
Prior's methodological approach, in particular, his view on
formalisation and the role of symbolic logic in conceptual
studies.
5. The development of hybrid logic since Prior

The first completely rigorous definition of hybrid logic was given in
Bull (1970), which appeared in a special issue of the journal
Theoria in memory of Prior. Bull introduces a third sort of
propositional symbols where a propositional symbol is assumed to be
true exactly at one branch (“course of events”) in a
branching time model. This idea of sorting propositional symbols
according to restrictions on their interpretations has later been
developed further by a number of authors, see Section 5 of the paper
Blackburn and Tzakova  (1999) for a discussion.

The hybrid logical machinery originally invented by Prior in the late
1960s was reinvented in the 1980s by Solomon Passy and Tinko Tinchev
from Bulgaria, see Passy and Tinchev (1985) as well as Passy and
Tinchev (1991). Rather than ordinary modal logic, this work took place
in connection with the much more expressive Propositional Dynamic
Logic.

A major contribution in the 1990s was the introduction of the
↓↓\mathtt{\downarrow} binder. An early version of the downarrow
binder was introduced by Valentin Goranko in the papers Goranko (1994)
and Goranko (1996). The version of the present paper was introduced in
Blackburn and Seligman (1995). Since then, hybrid logic with the
↓↓\mathtt{\downarrow} binder has been extensively studied, see for
example the paper Areces, Blackburn, and Marx (2001) on
model-theoretic aspects of this logic. A comprehensive study of the
model-theory of hybrid logic is the PhD thesis of ten Cate (2004).

Also the weaker hybrid logic obtained by omitting both of the binders
↓↓\mathtt{\downarrow} and ∀∀\mathtt{\forall} has been the subject
of extensive exploration. It turns out that this binder-free logic and
a number of variants of it are decidable. In the paper Areces,
Blackburn, and Marx (1999), a number of complexity results are given
for hybrid modal and tense logics over various classes of frames, for
example arbitrary, transitive, linear, and branching. It is remarkable
that the satisfiability problem of the binder-free hybrid logic over
arbitrary frames is decidable in PSPACE, which is the same as the
complexity of deciding satisfiability in ordinary modal logic. Thus,
hybridizing ordinary modal logic gives more expressive power, but the
complexity stays the same. Some work has been carried out on
simulating nominals inside modal logic, see Kracht and Wolter
(1997).

Any ordinary modal formula expresses a monadic second-order property on
frames, and it is well-known that for some modal formulas, including
what are called Sahlqvist formulas, the second-order property is
equivalent to a first-order property. In the paper Goranko and
Vakarelov (2006) this is shown to hold also for a class of
hybrid-logical formulas, including nominals. Several algorithms exists
for calculating first-order equivalents of ordinary modal formula. One
such algorithm, SQEMA, is in the paper Conradie, Goranko, and
Vakarelov (2006) extended to encompass the hybrid-logical formulas
considered in Goranko and Vakarelov (2006).

It is remarkable that first-order hybrid logic offers precisely the
features needed to prove interpolation theorems: While interpolation
fails in a number of well-known first-order modal logics, their
hybridized counterparts have this property, see Areces, Blackburn, and
Marx (2003) as well as Blackburn and Marx (2003). The first paper
gives a model-theoretic proof of interpolation whereas the second
paper gives an algorithm for calculating interpolants based on a
tableau system.

It should also be mentioned that logics similar to hybrid logics play
a central role within the area of description logic, which is a family
of logics used for knowledge representation in Artificial
Intelligence, see the paper Blackburn and Tzakova (1998) and Carlos
Areces’ PhD thesis (2000).

As described in the previous section, Prior introduced hybrid tense
logic to deal with a particular issue in the philosophy of time, but
in Prior (1968), Chapter XIV (also Chapter XIV in the new edition
Prior (2003)), he also showed that hybrid tense logic can replace a
two-dimensional temporal logic introduced by Hans Kamp in Kamp (1971).
The dimension is simply the number of instants a formula is evaluated
relative to, so adding hybrid-logical machinery enables two dimensions
to be replaced by one. This work has recently been followed up in a
number of papers by Blackburn and Jørgensen, see Blackburn and
Jørgensen (2016a) for an overview. We now give a brief sketch of this
line of work, adapted to the terminology of the present paper. The
version of hybrid logic in question has a designated nominal
nownow\mathtt{now} and each model comes together with a designated time
t0t0 t_0  such that i) any stand-alone formula is evaluated relative
to t0t0 t_0  and ii) the nominal nownow\mathtt{now} refers to t0t0 t_0 .
More formally, we adopt the convention that (M,t0),g⊨ϕ(M,t0),g⊨ϕ(M,t_0), g \vDash
\mathtt{\phi} means M,g,t0⊨ϕM,g,t0⊨ϕM, g, t_0 \vDash \mathtt{\phi} and we only
consider assignments ggg where g(now)=t0g(now)=t0g(\mathtt{now})=t_0. Note that
the nominal nownow\mathtt{now}, considered as a stand-alone formula, is
valid in this semantics, but this is not the case for any other
nominal. This new notion of validity is by Blackburn and Jørgensen
called contextual validity. The paper Blackburn and
Jørgensen (2013) gives an axiom system which is complete wrt. this
notion of contextual validity. The paper Blackburn and Jørgensen
(2012) gives a complete tableau system, but the semantics of this
paper is in line with Kamp's original two-dimensional semantics. Both
papers also consider further indexicals like yesterdayyesterday\mathtt{yesterday},
todaytoday\mathtt{today} and tomorrowtomorrow\mathtt{tomorrow}. 

The paper Blackburn and Jørgensen (2016b) uses hybrid tense logic to
combine ideas of Prior with those of Hans Reichenbach on how to
represent natural language tenses. Prior preferred the well-known
tense operators described above, whereas Reichenbach preferred
temporal references, that is, references to specific times,
Reichenbach (1947). It turns out that the two approaches can be
combined, which was not the route taken by Prior
himself––see the account given in Blackburn and Jørgensen
(2016b), 
6. Axioms for hybrid logic

A number of papers have dealt with axioms for hybrid logic, for
example Gargov and Goranko (1993), Blackburn (1993), and Blackburn and
Tzakova (1999). In the paper Gargov and Goranko (1993) an axiom system
for hybrid logic is given, and it is shown that if the system is
extended with a set of additional axioms which are pure
formulas (that is, formulas where all propositional symbols are
nominals), then the extended axiom system is complete with respect to
the class of frames validating the axioms in question. Pure formulas
correspond to first-order conditions on the accessibility relation
(cf. the translation STaSTa\mathrm{ST}_\mathtt{a} above), so axiom
systems for new hybrid logics with first-order conditions on the
accessibility relation can be obtained in a uniform way simply by
adding axioms as appropriate. So, if for example the formula
c→□¬cc→◻¬c\mathtt{c\rightarrow \Box \neg c} is added as an axiom, then the
resulting system is complete with respect to irreflexive frames, cf.
earlier. See the discussion of such rules in Section 4 of the paper
Blackburn (2000).

The proof­ system in Gargov and Goranko (1993) makes use of a complex
rule (called COV) where the formula schema containing the active part
of the rule can be arbitrarily large; in fact, the active part is
embedded under arbitrarily deep nestings of modal operators. Blackburn
and Tzakova (1999) shows that satisfaction operators can be used to
formulate an axiom system in a more standard format, using a simpler
rule called PASTE, such that the system is still complete when
extended with pure axions. 

The paper Blackburn and ten Cate (2006) investigates orthodox
proof-rules (which are proof-rules without side-conditions) in axiom
systems, and it is shown that if one requires extended completeness
using pure formulas, then unorthodox proof-rules are indispensable in
axiom systems for binder-free hybrid logic, but an axiom system can be
given only involving orthodox proof-rules for the stronger hybrid
logic including the ↓↓\mathtt{\downarrow} binder. See also the book
Braüner (2011a) for another axiom system for hybrid logic as well
as axiom systems for intuitionistic hybrid logic and a hybridization
of Nelson's paraconsistent logic N4 (compare to Costa and Martins
(2016) where another paraconsistent hybrid logic is considered). A
survey of intuitionistic hybrid logic can be found in Braüner
(2011b).

The paper Areces, Blackburn, Huertas, and Manzano (2014) deals with a
hybrid-logical version of higher-order modal logic (that is, modal
logic built over Church's simple theory of types). Axiom systems are
given and completeness is proved wrt. Henkin-type semantics. The paper
Blackburn, Huertas, Manzano, and Jørgensen (2014) extends these
results to encompass the downarrow binder and gives translations to
and from the bounded fragment of first-order logic (see above). 
7. Analytic proof methods for hybrid logic

Tableau, Gentzen, and natural deduction style proof-theory for hybrid
logic work very well compared to ordinary modal logic. Usually, when a
modal tableau, Gentzen, or natural deduction system is given, it is
for one particular modal logic and it has turned out to be problematic
to formulate such systems for modal logics in a uniform way without
introducing metalinguistic machinery. This can be remedied by
hybridization, that is, hybridization of modal logics enables the
formulation of uniform tableau, Gentzen, and natural deduction systems
for wide classes of logics. The paper Blackburn (2000) introduces a
tableau system for hybrid logic that has this desirable feature:
Analogous to the axiom system of Blackburn and Tzakova (1999),
completeness is preserved if the tableau system is extended with a set
of pure axioms, that is, a set of pure formulas that are allowed to be
added to a tableau during the tableau construction. The tableau system
of Blackburn (2000) is the basis for a decision procedure for the
binder-free fragment of hybrid logic given in Bolander and
Braüner (2006). This line of work has been continued in the
papers Bolander and Blackburn (2007) and Bolander and Blackburn
(2009). The paper Cerrito and Cialdea (2010) presents another
tableau-based decision procedure for hybrid logic. Other decision
procedures for hybrid logics, which also are based on proof-theory,
are given in the paper Kaminski and Smolka (2009). The procedures of
the latter paper are based on a higher-order formulation of hybrid
logic involving the simply typed lambda calculus.

The article Hansen, Bolander, and Braüner (2017) gives a
tableau-based decision procedure for many-valued hybrid logic, that
is, hybrid logic where the two-valued classical logic basis has been
generalized to a many-valued logic basis involving a truth-value space
having the structure of a finite Heyting algebra. Hansen (2010) gives
a tableau-based decision procedure for a hybridized version of a
dynamic epistemic logic called public annoucement logic. This is also
a major issue of the PhD thesis Hansen (2011).

Natural deduction style proof-theory of hybrid logic has been explored
in the book Braüner (2011a). This book also gives a Gentzen
system for hybrid logic. These natural deduction and Gentzen systems
can be extended with additional proof-rules corresponding to
first-order conditions on the accessibility relations expressed by
so-called geometric theories (this is of course analogous to
extending tableau and axiom systems with pure axioms). See also
Braüner and de Paiva (2006) where a natural deduction system is
given for intuitionistic hybrid logic (Chapter 8 of Braüner
(2011a)).

Tableau systems for first-order hybrid logic can be found in the paper
Blackburn and Marx (2002). Natural deduction and axiom systems for
first-order hybrid logic can be found in Chapter 6 of the book
Braüner (2011a) and Chapter 7 of the book deals with natural
deduction for intensional first-order hybrid logic. The paper Barbosa,
Martins, and Carreteiro (2014) gives an axiomatization of a fragment
of first-order hybrid logic called equational first-order hybrid
logic.

Gentzen and natural deduction systems for logics similar to hybrid
logics were explored already in the 1990s by Jerry Seligman, see the
overview in Seligman (2001). In particular, Seligman developed
proof-systems that work with arbitrary formulas, not just satisfaction
statements, the latter being the case for most proof-systems for
hybrid logic, where satisfaction operators are used to access
information hidden behind modalities. A natural deduction system in
this style was introduced in Seligman (1997) and this system has been
further developed in Chapter 4 of the book Braüner (2011a). A
tableau systems in Seligman's proof-style has been considered in
Blackburn, Bolander, Braüner, and Jørgensen (2017) where a syntactic
completeness proof is given. A semantic completenes proof of the
tableau system is given in Jørgensen, Blackburn, Bolander, Braüner
(2016). Reasoning in these systems does not directly rely on the
global encodings that satisfaction operators make possible, hence,
these systems can be considered more in line with the local character
of the standard Kripke semantics for modal logic. In fact, this more
local reasoning style makes these systems suitable for formalizing the
perspectival reasoning taking place in certain psychological reasoning
tasks, see Braüner (2014b) as well as Braüner, Blackburn, and
Polyanskaya (2016).

Some work in resolution calculi and model checking has been carried
out, see Areces, de Rijke, and de Nivelle (2001) as well as Areces and
Gorin (2011) for resolution calculi and see as Franceschet and de
Rijke (2006) as well as Lange (2009) for results on model
checking.

Since the mid 1990s, the work on hybrid logic has flourished. We refer
