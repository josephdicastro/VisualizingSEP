Second-order logic has a subtle role in the philosophy of mathematics.
It is stronger than first order logic in that it incorporates
“for all properties” into the syntax, while first order
logic can only say “for all elements”. At the same time it
is arguably weaker than set theory in that its quantifiers range over
one limited domain at a time, while set theory has the universalist
approach in that its quantifiers range over all possible domains. This
stronger-than-first-order-logic/weaker-than-set-theory duality is the
source of lively debate, not least because set theory is usually
construed as based on first order logic. How can second-order logic be
at the same time stronger and weaker? To make the situation even more
complex, it was suggested early on that in order that the strength of
second-order logic can be exploited to its full extent and in order
that “for all properties” can be given an exact
interpretation, a first order set-theoretical background has to be
assumed. This seemed to undermine the claimed strength of second-order
logic as well as its role as the primary foundation of mathematics. It
also seemed to attach second-order logic to aspects of set theory
which second-order logic might have wanted to bypass: the higher
infinite, the independence results, and the difficulties in finding
new convincing axioms. Setting aside philosophical questions, it is
undeniable and manifested by a continued stream of interesting
results, that second-order logic is part and parcel of a
logician’s toolbox.
 
1. Introduction

Second-order
 logic[1]
 was introduced by Frege in his Begriffsschrift (1879) who also coined
the term “second order” (“zweiter
Ordnung”) in (1884: §53). It was widely used in logic
until the 1930s, when set theory started to take over as a foundation
of mathematics. It is difficult to say exactly why this happened, but
set theory has certain simplicity in being based on one single binary
predicate x∈yx∈yx\in y, compared to second- and higher-order logics,
including type theory. Discussion among philosophers of the merits of
second-order logic especially in comparison to set theory continues to
this day (Shapiro 1991). Meanwhile second-order logic has become a
standard tool of computer science logic, finite model theory in
particular. Central questions of theoretical computer science, such as
the P = NP? question, can be seen as questions about second-order
logic in the finite context.

Ultimately second-order logic is just another formal language. It can
be given the standard treatment making syntax, semantics and proof
theory exact by working in a mathematical metatheory which we choose
to be set theory. It would be possible to use second-order logic
itself as metatheory, but it would be more complicated, simply because
second-order logic is less developed than set theory.

The distinction between first order logic and second-order logic is
easiest to understand in elementary mathematics. Let us consider
number theory. The objects of our study are the natural numbers 0, 1,
2,… and their arithmetic. With first order logic we can
formulate statements about number theory by using atomic expressions
x=y,x=y,x = y, x+y=zx+y=zx+y = z and x×y=zx×y=zx\times y = z combined with the
propositional operations ∧,∧,\land, ¬,¬,\neg, ∨,∨,\lor, →→\to and
the quantifiers ∀x∀x\forall x and ∃x∃x\exists x. Here the variables
x, y, z,… are thought to range over the
natural numbers. With second-order logic we can express more: we have
variables x, y, z,… as in first order
logic for numbers. In addition we have variables X, Y,
Z,… for properties of numbers and relations between
numbers as well as quantifiers ∀X∀X\forall X and ∃X∃X\exists X for
these variables. We have the atomic expressions of first order logic
and also new atomic expressions of the form X(y1,…,yn)X(y1,…,yn)X(y_1,\ldots,
y_n).

An interesting and much studied question arises: what properties of
natural numbers can be expressed in first order logic and what can be
expressed in second-order logic? The question is equally interesting
if “expressed” is replaced by “proved”, once a
suitable proof system is given in both cases. We can replace natural
numbers by some other mathematical context, for example real numbers,
complex numbers, and so on.

With just the constant 000 and the unary function n↦n+n↦n+n \mapsto n^+
(where n+n+n^+ means n+1n+1n+1) we can express in second-order logic the
Induction Axiom 
∀X([X(0)∧∀y(X(y)→X(y+))]→∀yX(y)),(1)∀X([X(0)∧∀y(X(y)→X(y+))]→∀yX(y)),\tag{1}\label{ind} \forall X\left(\left[X(0) \land \forall
y\left(X(y) \to X(y^+)\right)\right] \to \forall y\,X(y)\right), 

of natural numbers. This, together with the axioms ∀x¬(x+=0)∀x¬(x+=0)\forall
x\,\neg(x^+=0) and ∀x∀y(x+=y+→x=y)∀x∀y(x+=y+→x=y)\forall x\,\forall y(x^+=y^+\to x=y)
characterizes the natural numbers with their successor operation up to
isomorphism. In first order logic any theory which has a countably
infinite model has also an uncountable model (by the Upward
Löwenheim Skolem Theorem). Hence (11\ref{ind}) cannot be expressed
in first order logic. Another typical second-order expression is the
Completeness Axiom of the linear order ≤≤\le of the real
numbers: 
∀X([∃yX(y)∧∃z∀y(X(y)→y≤z)]→∃z∀y(∃u(X(u)∧y≤u)∨z≤y)),(2)∀X([∃yX(y)∧∃z∀y(X(y)→y≤z)]→∃z∀y(∃u(X(u)∧y≤u)∨z≤y)),\tag{2}\label{comp} \forall X\left(\left[\exists y\,X(y) \land
\exists z\,\forall y(X(y) \to y \le z)\right] \to\\ \exists z\,\forall
y\left(\exists u\left(X(u) \land y \le u\right) \lor z \le
y\right)\right), 

This, together with the axioms of ordered fields characterizes the
ordered field of real numbers up to isomorphism. In first order logic
any countable theory which has an infinite model has also a countable
model (by the Downward Löwenheim Skolem Theorem). Hence
(22\ref{comp}) cannot be expressed in first order logic.

To early logicians it seemed natural to use second-order logic on a
par with first order logic, as if there were not much difference. This
included Russell, Löwenheim, Hilbert, and Zermelo. Essentially
only Skolem emphasized the difference (see Moore 1988 for the
emergence of first order logic). In 1929 Gödel proved his
Completeness Theorem and the next year his Incompleteness Theorem. It
became gradually obvious that second-order logic is very different
from first order logic. One of the first indicators was the
incompleteness phenomenon. Gödel showed that any effective
axiomatization of number theory is incomplete. On the other hand,
there was a simple finite categorical—hence complete
 (§10)—axiomatization
 of the structure (N,(N,(\oN, +,+,+, ×)×)\times) in second-order logic
(see also the discussion related to (11\ref{ind})). This showed that
there cannot be such a complete axiomatization of second-order logic
as there was for first order logic. What became known in the case of
first order logic as Gödel’s Completeness Theorem simply
cannot hold for second-order logic.

The situation changed somewhat when Henkin proved the Completeness
Theorem for second-order logic with respect to so-called general
models
 (§9).
 Now it became possible to use second-order logic in the same way as
first order logic, if only one keeps in mind that the semantics is
based on general models. The ability of second-order logic to
characterize mathematical structures up to isomorphism does not extend
to general models (except in the form of internal
categoricity—see
 §10).
 Any second-order theory with an infinite general model has general
models of all infinite cardinalities, and therefore cannot be
categorical in the context of general models. We shall discuss general
models and the related Henkin models in
 §9.
2. The Syntax of Second-Order Logic

A vocabulary in second-order logic is just as a vocabulary in
first order logic, that is, a set L of relation,
function and constant symbols. Each relation and
function symbol has an arity, which is a positive natural
number.

Second-order logic has several kinds of variables. It has
individual variables denoted by lower case letters
x,y,z,…x,y,z,…x, y, z, \ldots possibly with subscripts. It has property
and relation variables denoted by upper case letters
X,Y,Z,…X,Y,Z,…X,Y,Z,\ldots possibly with subscripts. Finally, it has
function variables denoted by upper case letters F,G,H,…F,G,H,…F, G, H,
\ldots possibly with subscripts. Sometimes function variables are
omitted as, after all, functions are special kinds of relations. Each
relation and function variable has an arity, which is a positive
natural number.

It is noteworthy that although we have property variables we do not
have variables for properties of properties. Such variables would be
part of the formalism of third order logic, see
 §12.

The terms of second-order logic are defined recursively as
follows: Constant symbols and individual variables are terms. If
t1,…,tnt1,…,tnt_1,\ldots,t_n are terms, U is an n-ary function
symbol and F is an n-ary function variable, then
U(t1,…,tn)U(t1,…,tn)U(t_1,\ldots,t_n) and F(t1,…,tn)F(t1,…,tn)F(t_1,\ldots,t_n) are terms. Note that
terms denote individuals, not relations or properties. Thus X
alone is not a term but x is.

The atomic formulas of second-order logic are defined from
terms as follows: If t and t′t′t' are terms, then t=t′t=t′t = t' is
an atomic formula. If R is an n-ary relation symbol and
t1,…,tnt1,…,tnt_1,\ldots,t_n are terms, then R(t1,…,tn)R(t1,…,tn)R(t_1,\ldots,t_n) is an atomic
formula. If X is an n-ary relation variable, then also
X(t1,…,tn)X(t1,…,tn)X(t_1,\ldots,t_n) is an atomic formula. The intuitive meaning of
X(t1,…,tn)X(t1,…,tn)X(t_1,\ldots,t_n) is that the elements t1,…,tnt1,…,tnt_1,\ldots, t_n are in
the relation X or are predicated by X. We do
not allow atomic formulas of the form X=YX=YX = Y, although they would
have an obvious meaning. We achieve the same effect by using
quantifiers.


Definition 1 The formulas of second-order
logic are defined as follows: Atomic formulas are formulas. If
ϕϕ\phi and ψψ\psi are formulas, then ¬ϕ¬ϕ\neg\phi, ϕ∧ψϕ∧ψ\phi\land
\psi, ϕ∨ψϕ∨ψ\phi\lor \psi, ϕ→ψϕ→ψ\phi \to \psi and ϕ↔ψϕ↔ψ\phi
\leftrightarrow \psi are formulas. If ϕϕ\phi is a formula,
x an individual variable, X a relation variable and
F a function variable, then ∃xϕ∃xϕ\exists x\phi, ∀xϕ∀xϕ\forall
x\phi, ∃Xϕ∃Xϕ\exists X\phi, ∀Xϕ,∃Fϕ∀Xϕ,∃Fϕ\forall X\phi, \exists F\phi and
∀Fϕ∀Fϕ\forall F\phi are formulas.


An important special case is monadic second-order logic where
no function variables are allowed and the relation variables are
required to be monadic (a.k.a. unary), i.e., of arity one.

We did not take X=YX=YX=Y as an atomic formula (although we could have)
but having introduced the quantifiers we can use 
∀x1…∀xn(X(x1,…,xn)↔Y(x1,…,xn))(3)∀x1…∀xn(X(x1,…,xn)↔Y(x1,…,xn))\tag{3}\label{XY} \forall x_1\ldots \forall
x_n(X(x_1,\ldots,x_n)\leftrightarrow Y(x_1,\ldots,x_n)) 

as a substitute for X=YX=YX=Y. The advantage of taking X=YX=YX=Y as a
basic atomic formula would be that using (33\ref{XY}) brings along extra
quantifiers. Sometimes it is interesting to minimize the number of
quantifiers in a formula.

The concepts of a free and bound occurrence
of a variable in a formula are defined in the usual way. A formula is
called a sentence if it has no free variables. The concept of
a term being free for a variable in a formula is
defined as in first order logic.

3. The Semantics of Second-Order Logic

In order to define the semantics of second-order logic we have to
agree what our metalanguage is. This fact has nothing to do
with second-order logic but is rather a general feature of semantics
(Tarski 1933 [1956]). The most commonly used metalanguage for
second-order logic is set theory. We thus give a
set-theoretical interpretation of second-order logic, interpreting
“properties” as sets. This is the most common choice and
brings out the main features of second-order logic. We cannot
interpret all properties by sets, e.g. the property of being
identical to oneself. But if the domain that the individual variables
range over is taken to be a set, then we can meaningfully interpret
properties of individuals in that domain as sets. If we want to
interpret second-order logic in a domain which is too large to be a
set, we can use the set-theoretical concept of a class (see entry on
 set theory
 for more on classes). 

We use the same concept of an L-structure (or equivalently, an
L-model) as in first order logic. That is, an
L-structure MM\mm has a domain M,
which is any non-empty set, an interpretation cM∈McM∈Mc^\mm \in M
of any constant symbol c of L, an interpretation RM⊆MnRM⊆MnR^\mm
\subseteq M^n of any n-ary relation symbol R of
L, as well as an interpretation HM:Mn→MHM:Mn→MH^\mm : M^n \to M of any
n-ary function symbol H of L.

Given an L-structure MM\mm, an assignment is a
function s from variables to the domain M of MM\mm
such that: if x is an individual variable, then s(x)∈Ms(x)∈Ms(x) \in M;
if X is relation variable of arity n, then s(X)⊆Mns(X)⊆Mns(X)
\subseteq M^n; if F is function variable of arity n,
then s(F):Mn→Ms(F):Mn→Ms(F) : M^n \to M. We use s(P/X)s(P/X)s(P/X) to denote the assignment
which is otherwise as s except that the value at X has
been changed to P. Similarly s(a/x)s(a/x)s(a/x) and s(f/F)s(f/F)s(f/F).

The value tM⟨s⟩tM⟨s⟩t^\mm\langle s\rangle of a term t in a model
MM\mm under the interpretation s is defined as in first order
logic.

The concept M⊨ϕM⊨ϕ\mm\models\phi of the truth of the sentence
ϕϕ\phi in MM\mm can now be defined by first defining the auxiliary
concept M⊨sϕM⊨sϕ\mm\models_s\phi of the assignment sss satisfying
ϕϕ\phi in MM\mm (see entry on
 Tarski's truth definitions
 for more details): 


Definition 2 (Tarski’s Truth Definition) The
truth definition for second-order logic extends the respective truth
definition for first order logic by the clauses:

M⊨sX(t1,…,tn)M⊨sX(t1,…,tn)\mm \models_s X(t_1,\ldots,t_n) iff (tM1⟨s⟩,…,tMn⟨s⟩)∈s(X)(tM1⟨s⟩,…,tMn⟨s⟩)∈s(X)(t^\mm_1 \langle
s\rangle,\ldots,t^\mm_n \langle s\rangle) \in s(X).
M⊨s∃XϕM⊨s∃Xϕ\mm\models_s \exists X\,\phi iff M⊨s(P/X)ϕM⊨s(P/X)ϕ\mm\models_{s(P/X)} \phi
for some P⊆MnP⊆MnP \subseteq M^n.
M⊨s∃FϕM⊨s∃Fϕ\mm\models_s \exists F\,\phi iff M⊨s(f/F)ϕM⊨s(f/F)ϕ\mm\models_{s(f/F)} \phi
for some f:Mn→M.f:Mn→M.f:M^n \to M.


and similarly for the universal quantifiers. For a sentence ϕϕ\phi
we define M⊨ϕM⊨ϕ\mm\models\phi to mean M⊨sϕM⊨sϕ\mm\models_s\phi for all
(equivalently some) s, and then say ϕϕ\phi is true
in MM\mm.


In clause 1 of the above definition we follow the common practice of
giving a set-theoretical interpretation to the predication
X(t1,…,tn)X(t1,…,tn)X(t_1,\ldots,t_n). Having interpreted X as a subset of
MnMnM^n, we interpret predication X(t1,…,tn)X(t1,…,tn)X(t_1,\ldots,t_n) as membership
(tM1⟨s⟩,…,tMn⟨s⟩)∈s(X)(tM1⟨s⟩,…,tMn⟨s⟩)∈s(X)(t^\mm_1 \langle s\rangle,\ldots,t^\mm_n \langle s\rangle) \in
s(X). In clause 2 we interpret quantification over properties and
relations as quantification over subsets of the cartesian product
MnMnM^n. Respectively, in clause 3 we interpret quantification over
functions as quantification over sets that are functions Mn→MMn→MM^n\to M
in the set-theoretical sense.

Now that the semantics of second-order logic is defined we can define
what it means for a formula ϕϕ\phi to be valid and for two
formulas ϕϕ\phi and ψψ\psi to be logically equivalent. As
in logic in general, we say that ϕϕ\phi is (logically) valid if
M⊨sϕM⊨sϕ\mm\models_s\phi holds for all MM\mm and all s. Likewise,
we define ϕϕ\phi and ψψ\psi to be logically equivalent,
ϕ≡ψϕ≡ψ\phi\equiv\psi, if ϕ↔ψϕ↔ψ\phi\leftrightarrow\psi is valid. Two
models MM\mm and NN\mn are said to be second-order
equivalent, in symbols M≡L2NM≡L2N\mm\equiv_{L^2}\mn if for all
sentences ϕϕ\phi we have M⊨ϕ⟺N⊨ψM⊨ϕ⟺N⊨ψ\mm\models\phi\iff\mn\models\psi.

The truth definition involves the concepts “for some P⊆MnP⊆MnP
\subseteq M^n” and “for some f:Mn→Mf:Mn→Mf:M^n \to M”.
Since we assume set theory as our metalanguage, we can interpret these
in the sense of set theory. Thus we interpret “for some P⊆MnP⊆MnP
\subseteq M^n” as “for some set P⊆MnP⊆MnP \subseteq
M^n” and “for some f:Mn→Mf:Mn→Mf:M^n\to M” as “for
some set which is a function f:Mn→Mf:Mn→Mf:M^n\to M”.

For infinite M the collection of subsets of MnMnM^n and the set
of functions Mn→MMn→MM^n\to M are famously complex. Currently set theory
(ZFC) cannot even decide how many subsets of an infinite set
there are. The situation is quite different with first order logic.
The respective concept “for some a∈Ma∈Ma \in M” is
unproblematic, relatively speaking. Of course, depending on what
M is, “for some a∈Ma∈Ma \in M” can be quite
problematic too. To reflect the difficulties involved with finding a
P⊆MnP⊆MnP \subseteq M^n or an f:Mn→Mf:Mn→Mf:M^n \to M we sometimes say we
“guess” a P⊆MnP⊆MnP \subseteq M^n or an f:Mn→Mf:Mn→Mf:M^n \to M.

When we use set theory as the metatheory for the semantics of
first order logic, the reliance on the metatheory is of a
lower degree than when we use set theory as the metatheory for the
semantics of second order logic. The central concept, which
explains the difference, is that of absoluteness. For
details, see
 §6.

3.1 The Ehrenfeucht-Fraïssé game of second-order logic

The Ehrenfeucht-Fraïssé game is a game-theoretic
tool for investigating to what extent two models are similar (see
entry on
 logic and games
 for a general introduction to Ehrenfeucht-Fraïssé games).
Two isomorphic models would be very similar but normally we are
interested in similarity of models that are not isomorphic. The
Ehrenfeucht-Fraïssé game of second-order logic
characterizes A≡L2NA≡L2N\ma\equiv_{L^2}\mn, i.e. the proposition that
exactly the same second-order sentences are true in AA\ma and
BB\mb, just as the Ehrenfeucht-Fraïssé game of first
order logic characterizes the first order elementary equivalence
A≡NA≡N\ma\equiv\mn. See the entry on
 first-order model theory
 for more on elementary equivalence.

For simplicity we disallow function and constant symbols as well as
function variables in this section. Suppose AA\ma and BB\mb are
two models of the same finite relational vocabulary. In the game which
we denote by G2n(A,B)G2n(A,B)G^2_n(\ma,\mb) two players I and II pick one at a
time subsets (or elements) of A or subsets (or elements) of
B. During round i of the game player I can pick a
relation AiAiA_i on A (or an element aiaia_i of A) and
then player II has to pick a relation BiBiB_i on B of the same
arity as AiAiA_i (or an element bibib_i of on B) and vice
versa: Player I can instead pick a relation BiBiB_i on B (or an
element bibib_i of B) and then II picks a relation AiAiA_i on
A of the same arity as BiBiB_i (or an element aiaia_i) of
A. After n rounds the pairs of played elements
(ai,bi)(ai,bi)(a_i,b_i) form a binary relation R on A×BA×BA\times B. If
this relation is a partial isomorphism of the structures AA\ma and
BB\mb expanded by the played relations AiAiA_i and BiBiB_i, i.e., it
preserves atomic formulas and their negations, we say that II has won.
The models AA\ma and BB\mb satisfy the same second-order sentences
if and only if for each n∈Nn∈Nn\in \oN Player II has a winning strategy
in G2n(A,B)G2n(A,B)G^2_n(\ma,\mb). A model class (i.e. a class of models of a
fixed vocabulary, closed under isomorphisms) K is definable in
second-order logic if and only if there is an n such that if
A∈KA∈K\ma\in K and Player II has a winning strategy in the
G2n(A,B)G2n(A,B)G^2_n(\ma,\mb), then B∈KB∈K\mb\in K.

The first order version G1n(A,B)G1n(A,B)G^1_n(\ma,\mb), where players play only
individual elements, i.e., no relations are played, is very useful in
working with first order logic. Unfortunately the game
G2n(A,B)G2n(A,B)G^2_n(\ma,\mb) is much more complex. It is very difficult to
invent winning strategies for Player II except in the trivial case
when A≅BA≅B\ma\cong\mb. If Player I plays a binary relation R on
A, Player II should be able to play a binary relation R′R′R' on
B such that whatever challenges Player I makes in the rest of
the game, even involving new binary relations, the relations R
and R′R′R' look similar. If V=LV=LV=L, then countable second-order
equivalent models (with a finite vocabulary) are actually isomorphic
(Ajtai 1979). For details, see
 §10.
 Thus consistently in countable models there is no other winning
strategy for Player II than an isomorphism. Perhaps this explains why
the game is not as useful in second-order logic as it is in first
order logic. However, if we restrict to monadic second-order logic,
which in terms of the Ehrenfeucht-Fraïssé game means
restricting the game to unary predicates, the situation
changes. A unary predicate just divides the model into two parts. If
Player I divides A into two parts, Player II should find a
similar division in B. This is more reasonable and there
actually are useful strategies for Player II. For examples in the
finite context see
 §16.



4. Properties of Second-Order Formulas

Many syntactic operations that we are used to in first order logic
work equally well in second-order logic. One such is the operation of
relativization, in which we want to limit what a formula
expresses to a fixed part of the universe. For example, we may
consider models where a certain unary predicate U is used for
the set of natural numbers. Then we relativize our axioms of
arithmetic to the predicate U. Some other part of the model may
be used for the power set of the set of natural numbers. Then we
relativize our axioms of power set (see
 §5.3)
 to that part, and so on.

If MM\mm is a structure and A⊆MA⊆MA\subseteq M, then MAMA\mm^{A} is
obtained by restricting the relations RMRMR^\mm and functions
FMFMF^\mm to A. This does not always result in a structure but
if it does, it is called the relativization of MM\mm to
A. Suppose
ϕ=ϕ(x1,…,xn,X1,…,Xm,F1,…,Fk)ϕ=ϕ(x1,…,xn,X1,…,Xm,F1,…,Fk)\phi=\phi(x_1,\ldots,x_n,X_1,\ldots,X_m,F_1,\ldots,F_k) is a
second-order formula and U is a unary relation variable. There
is a second-order formula ϕUϕU\phi^{U}, the relativization of ϕϕ\phi
to U, such that for all MM\mm for which MUMMUM\mm^{U^\mm} is a
structure: 
M⊨ϕU⟺MUM⊨ϕ.M⊨ϕU⟺MUM⊨ϕ.\mm\models\phi^{U}\iff \mm^{U^\mm}\models\phi.


Intuitively, ϕUϕU\phi^{U} says about UMUMU^\mm what ϕϕ\phi says
about M. To obtain ϕUϕU\phi^{U} from ϕϕ\phi one restricts all
the first order quantifiers to elements of U and second-order
quantifiers to subsets, relations and functions on U.

Hierarchies based on quantifier structure are a useful method to
compare the definability of concepts in different systems. In first
order logic it was observed very early on that formulas can be brought
into a logically equivalent Prenex Normal Form in which all
quantifiers occur in the beginning of the formula. This is possible
also in second-order logic and the proof is essentially the same.
Moreover, using the equivalence (which is reminiscent of a principle
of set theory called Axiom of Choice, to which we return in Section
5.4., since in the below formula the relation YYY in a sense chooses
one XXX for each xxx and puts them together into one relation
YYY – see entry on
 Axiom of Choice
 for more on the topic.)
∀x∃Xϕ≡∃Y∀xϕ′,∀x∃Xϕ≡∃Y∀xϕ′,\forall x\,\exists X\,\phi\equiv \exists Y\,\forall x\,\phi',


where the arity of Y is one higher than the arity of X,
and ϕ′ϕ′\phi' is obtained from ϕϕ\phi by replacing everywhere
X(t1,…,tn)X(t1,…,tn)X(t_1,\ldots,t_n) by Y(x,t1,…,tn)Y(x,t1,…,tn)Y(x,t_1,\ldots,t_n), one can bring every
second-order logic formula to a logically equivalent normal form 
Q1X1…QnXnϕ,(4)Q1X1…QnXnϕ,\tag{4}\label{qqq}
Q_1X_1\ldots Q_nX_n\phi,


where each QiQiQ_i is either ∃∃\exists or ∀∀\forall and ϕϕ\phi
is first order.




Notation
The QiQiQ_i in (44\ref{qqq}) are: 

Σ11Σ11\Sigma^1_1
All existential 

Π11Π11\Pi^1_1
All universal 

Σ12Σ12\Sigma^1_2
First existential, then universal 

Π12Π12\Pi^1_2
First universal, then existential 

⋮⋮\vdots
⋮⋮\vdots 



Notation
The formula is logically equivalent to: 

Δ11Δ11\Delta^1_1
Both Σ11Σ11\Sigma^1_1 and Π11Π11\Pi^1_1 formulas 

Δ12Δ12\Delta^1_2
Both Σ12Σ12\Sigma^1_2 and Π12Π12\Pi^1_2 formulas 

⋮⋮\vdots
⋮⋮\vdots 


Table 1: The hierarchy of second-order
formulas.



By restricting what kind of quantifiers the sequence Q1X1…QnXnQ1X1…QnXnQ_1X_1\ldots
Q_nX_n of the Prenex Normal Form (44\ref{qqq}) can contain we obtain
the classes of Σ1nΣ1n\Sigma^1_n-, Π1nΠ1n\Pi^1_n- and
Δ1nΔ1n\Delta^1_n-formulas, as indicated in
 Table 1.
 For example, the second-order formulas (1) and (2) are
Π11Π11\Pi^1_1-formulas.

We have considered above only quantifiers that bind relation variables
but the situation is exactly the same if we had bound function
variables.

These classes of formulas have some obvious closure properties: They
are all closed, up to logical equivalence, under ∧,∨∧,∨\land , \lor, and
first order quantifiers. Moreover, the hierarchy is proper in the
sense that for all n≥1n≥1n\ge 1 
Σ1n⊈Π1n and Π1n⊈Σ1n,(5)Σ1n⊈Π1n and Π1n⊈Σ1n,\tag{5}\label{kurat}
\Sigma^1_n \nsubseteq \Pi^1_n\text{ and } \Pi^1_n  \nsubseteq \Sigma^1_n,


which can be proved with a diagonalisation argument. The classes
Δ1nΔ1n\Delta^1_n are closed under ∧,∨,¬∧,∨,¬\land , \lor, \neg and first order
quantifiers. By Craig’s Interpolation Theorem,
Δ11Δ11\Delta^1_1-formulas are logically equivalent to first order
formulas
 [2].

There is a sense in which Π11Π11\Pi^1_1, or equivalently Σ11Σ11\Sigma^1_1,
already has the full power of second-order logic, although the above
hierarchy result (55\ref{kurat}) shows that this cannot literally be
true. To see this, i.e., to see what the reduction of second-order
logic to its Π11Π11\Pi^1_1-part means, let L be a vocabulary,
E a binary and U a unary relation symbol, both not in
L. Let θθ\theta be the second-order Π11Π11\Pi^1_1-formula

∀X(ϕ1∧ϕ2∧ϕ3),(6)∀X(ϕ1∧ϕ2∧ϕ3),\tag{6}\label{ex6}
\forall X(\phi_1\land\phi_2\land\phi_3),


where 
ϕ1 is ∀x∀y(∀z(E(z,x)↔E(z,y))→x=y)ϕ2 is ∀x∀y(E(x,y)→(U(x)∧¬U(y)))ϕ3 is ∀x((X(x)→U(x))→∃y∀z(X(z)↔E(z,y))).ϕ1 is ∀x∀y(∀z(E(z,x)↔E(z,y))→x=y)ϕ2 is ∀x∀y(E(x,y)→(U(x)∧¬U(y)))ϕ3 is ∀x((X(x)→U(x))→∃y∀z(X(z)↔E(z,y))).\begin{align}
\phi_1&amp;\text{ is }\quad \forall x\,\forall y(\forall z(E(z,x)\leftrightarrow E(z,y))\to x=y)\\
\phi_2&amp;\text{ is }\quad \forall x\,\forall y(E(x,y)\to (U(x)\land\neg U(y)))\\
\phi_3&amp;\text{ is }\quad \forall x ((X(x)\to U(x))\to\exists y\,\forall z(X(z)\leftrightarrow E(z,y))).
\end{align}


It is easy to
 see[3]
 that models of θθ\theta are, up to isomorphism, models MM\mm
where M=UM∪P(UM)M=UM∪P(UM)M=U^\mm\cup\P(U^\mm), UM∩P(UM)=∅UM∩P(UM)=∅U^\mm\cap\P(U^\mm)=\emptyset and
for all a,b∈Ma,b∈Ma,b\in M, EM(a,b)↔a∈bEM(a,b)↔a∈bE^\mm(a,b)\leftrightarrow a\in b. In such a
model monadic second-order formulas ϕϕ\phi over UMUMU^\mm can be
reduced to first order formulas ϕ∗ϕ∗\phi^* over M. This
reduction, due to Hintikka (1955) and further developed by Montague
(1963), shows that Π11Π11\Pi^1_1-formulas alone are enough to express
any second-order property with extra predicates. The idea can be
extended to third and higher order logic.

As a consequence, checking the validity of a second-order sentence
ϕϕ\phi can be recursively reduced to checking the validity of the
Σ11Σ11\Sigma^1_1-sentence θ→ϕ∗θ→ϕ∗\theta\to\phi^*. Likewise checking whether
a second-order sentence ϕϕ\phi has a model of cardinality κκ\kappa
can be reduced to asking whether the Π11Π11\Pi^1_1-sentence
θ∧ϕ∗θ∧ϕ∗\theta\land\phi^* has a model of cardinality 2κ2κ2^\kappa. This
means that the Löwenheim
 number[4]
 and the Hanf
 number[5]
 of the entire second-order logic are the same as those of the
fragment Π11Π11\Pi^1_1.

Summing up, upon first inspection the levels Σ1nΣ1n\Sigma^1_n and
Π1nΠ1n\Pi^1_n of the hierarchy of second-order formulas grow strictly in
expressive power as n increases, but a more careful analysis
reveals that already the first level Σ11∪Π11Σ11∪Π11\Sigma^1_1\cup \Pi^1_1 has
the power of all the levels Σ1n,Π1nΣ1n,Π1n\Sigma^1_n, \Pi^1_n even if the power
is somewhat implicit and needs to be brought to light.

In set theory there is the Levy-hierarchy of ΣnΣn\Sigma_n-
and ΠnΠn\Pi_n-formulas (Lévy 1965). Formulas where all
quantifiers are bounded, i.e., of the form ∀x∈y∀x∈y\forall x\in y or of
the form ∃x∈y∃x∈y\exists x\in y for some x and y, are called
Σ0Σ0\Sigma_0 or equivalently Π0Π0\Pi_0. Formulas of the form ∀xϕ∀xϕ\forall
x\,\phi, where ϕϕ\phi is ΣnΣn\Sigma_n, are called Πn+1Πn+1\Pi_{n+1}.
Formulas of the form ∃xϕ∃xϕ\exists x\,\phi, where ϕϕ\phi is ΠnΠn\Pi_n,
are called Σn+1Σn+1\Sigma_{n+1}. This is a strict hierarchy roughly for
the same reason why the hierarchy of second-order Σ1nΣ1n\Sigma^1_n- and
Π1nΠ1n\Pi^1_n-formulas is strict. But there is no known method to reduce
the truth of an arbitrary formula to the truth of a formula on the
Σ1∪Π1Σ1∪Π1\Sigma_1\cup\Pi_1 level. In fact, if the decision problem,
Löwenheim-Skolem number and Hanf number are suitably defined for
Σn∪ΠnΣn∪Πn\Sigma_n\cup \Pi_n-formulas of set theory, the decision problem
gets more and more complicated, and the numbers obtained get bigger
and bigger as n increases (see
 Theorem 4;
 Väänänen 1979).

The hierarchy Σ1n∪Π1nΣ1n∪Π1n\Sigma_n^1\cup \Pi_n^1 inside second-order logic and
the hierarchy Σn∪ΠnΣn∪Πn\Sigma_n\cup\Pi_n in set theory, are compared to
each other in
 §7.

5. The Infamous Power of Second-Order Logic

5.1 Putting distance between second- and first-order logic

Second-order logic has some remarkable qualities which we will now
uncover in detail. Above we characterized the structure of the natural
numbers by means of (11\ref{ind}). This application of second-order
logic is perhaps the most famous and most important. We now
reformulate this in a slightly more general form in order to get more
power out of it. Suppose U is a unary relation variable
(“the set of natural numbers”), G a unary function
variable (“the successor function”), and z an
individual variable (“the zero”). Let
θPA(U,G,z)θPA(U,G,z)\theta_{\textrm{PA}}(U,G,z) be the sentence 
U(z)∧∀x(U(x)→(U(G(x))∧¬G(x)=z))∧∀x∀y((U(x)∧U(y)∧G(x)=G(y))→x=y)∧∀X([X(z)∧∀x((U(x)∧X(x))→X(G(x)))]→∀x(U(x)→X(x))),(7)U(z)∧∀x(U(x)→(U(G(x))∧¬G(x)=z))∧∀x∀y((U(x)∧U(y)∧G(x)=G(y))→x=y)∧∀X([X(z)∧∀x((U(x)∧X(x))→X(G(x)))]→∀x(U(x)→X(x))),\tag{7}
\begin{align}
&amp;U(z)\land{}\\
&amp;\forall x(U(x)\to(U(G(x))\land\neg G(x)=z))\land{}\\
&amp;\forall x\,\forall y((U(x)\land U(y)\land G(x)=G(y))\to x=y)\land{}\\
&amp;\forall X([X(z) \land  \forall x((U(x)\land X(x)) \to X(G(x)))] \to {}\\
&amp;\forall x(U(x)\to X(x))),
\end{align}


Then (N,A,g,a)⊨θPA(U,G,z)(N,A,g,a)⊨θPA(U,G,z)(N,A,g,a)\models\theta_{\textrm{PA}}(U,G,z) if and only if
(N,A,g,a)(N,A,g,a)(N,A,g,a) is isomorphic to a structure (M,N,s,0)(M,N,s,0)(M,\oN,s,0) where
N⊆MN⊆M\oN\subseteq M and s(n)=n+1s(n)=n+1s(n)=n+1. Thus we have used second-order
logic to say that the U-part of any model of
θPA(U,G,z)θPA(U,G,z)\theta_{\textrm{PA}}(U,G,z), together with the function G
and the individual z are isomorphic to the natural numbers
NN\oN with their successor function and zero. There are many ways to
see that no first order sentence can have this property. For example,
by the Compactness Theorem such a sentence would have also a
non-standard model where some element is different from each
in the sequence z, G(z)G(z)G(z), G(G(z))G(G(z))G(G(z)), G(G(G(z)))G(G(G(z)))G(G(G(z))),
……\ldots. Such a model cannot be isomorphic to the natural numbers
NN\oN with their successor function and zero. Hereupon we may
conclude that the Compactness Theorem does not hold for second-order
logic in the form that it holds for first order logic.

In models of θPA(U,G,z)θPA(U,G,z)\theta_{\textrm{PA}}(U,G,z) the formula
θ+(U,G,z,H)θ+(U,G,z,H)\theta_+(U,G,z,H) 
{∀x(U(x)→H(x,z)=x)∧∀x∀y(U(x)→(U(y)→H(x,G(y))=G(H(x,y)))){∀x(U(x)→H(x,z)=x)∧∀x∀y(U(x)→(U(y)→H(x,G(y))=G(H(x,y))))\left\{\begin{array}{l}
\forall x(U(x)\to H(x,z)=x)\land\\
\forall x\,\forall y(U(x)\to (U(y)\to H(x,G(y))=G(H(x,y))))\\
\end{array}\right.


and the formula θ×(U,G,z,H,J)θ×(U,G,z,H,J)\theta_\times(U,G,z,H,J) 
{∀x(U(x)→J(x,z)=z)∧∀x∀y(U(x)→(U(y)→J(x,G(y))=H(J(x,y),x))){∀x(U(x)→J(x,z)=z)∧∀x∀y(U(x)→(U(y)→J(x,G(y))=H(J(x,y),x)))\left\{\begin{array}{l}
\forall x(U(x)\to J(x,z)=z)\land\\
\forall x\,\forall y(U(x)\to (U(y)\to J(x,G(y))=H(J(x,y),x)))\\
\end{array}\right.


define unique functions m+n=H(m,n)m+n=H(m,n)m+n=H(m,n) and m⋅n=J(m,n)m⋅n=J(m,n)m\cdot n=J(m,n). A
first order sentence ϕ(+,⋅,0)ϕ(+,⋅,0)\phi(+,\cdot,0) of arithmetic is true in
(N,+,⋅,0)(N,+,⋅,0)(\oN,+,\cdot,0) if and only if 
∀U∀G∀z∀H∀J((θPA(U,G,z)∧θ+(U,G,z,H)∧θ×(U,G,z,H,J))→(ϕ(H,J,z))U)∀U∀G∀z∀H∀J((θPA(U,G,z)∧θ+(U,G,z,H)∧θ×(U,G,z,H,J))→(ϕ(H,J,z))U)
\forall U\,
\forall G\,
\forall z\,
\forall H\,
\forall J  \left(\left(
\theta_{\textrm{PA}} (U,G,z) 
\land \theta_+(U,G,z,H)  
          \land \theta_\times(U,G,z,H,J)
\right)
\to {}\\
(\phi(H,J,z))^{U}\right)


is valid. We know that truth of first order sentences in
(N,+,⋅,0)(N,+,⋅,0)(\oN,+,\cdot,0) is undecidable, and even non-arithmetical by
results of Gödel (1931 [1986: 144–195]) and Tarski (1933
[1956]). This shows that second-order logic is not completely
axiomatizable by effective means, or decidable even in the empty
vocabulary. That is, there is no decidable second-order theory with an
infinite model. This is in sharp contrast to first order logic where
the following theories are decidable: first order logic with empty
vocabulary, first order logic with monadic predicates, dense linear
order, Pressburger arithmetic (first order theory of (N,+,0)(N,+,0)(\oN,+,0)),
real closed fields (first order theory of (R,+,⋅,0,1)(R,+,⋅,0,1)(\oR,+,\cdot,0,1)),
theory of algebraically closed fields, and the first order theory of
(C,+,⋅,0,1)(C,+,⋅,0,1)(\oC,+,\cdot,0,1). In second-order logic none of the respective
second-order theories are decidable. However, if we restrict
second-order logic to monadic second-order logic, we obtain
many important decidable theories (see
 §8).


5.2 The collapse of the Completeness Theorem

The Completeness Theorem is one of the cornerstones of our
understanding of first order logic. Also many extensions of first
order logic have a Completeness Theorem, most notably the extension of
first order logic by the
 generalized quantifier
 “There are uncountably many” and the
 infinitary language
Lω1ωLω1ωL_{\omega_1\omega}. We shall now see that there is no hope of a
Completeness Theorem for second-order logic. Later in
 §9.1
 we shall modify the semantics so that a Completeness Theorem can be
proved.

Behind the failure of the Completeness Theorem is the fact that
second-order logic is—almost by definition—able to say
that a set is the power set of another set. What this means is the
following: Let L be a vocabulary. Let E be a binary and
U a unary relation symbol, both not in L. Let
θPow(U,E)θPow(U,E)\theta_{\textrm{Pow}}(U,E) be the second-order formula
(66\ref{ex6}). Let us consider the conjunction 
θPA(U,G,z)∧θPow(U,E).(8)θPA(U,G,z)∧θPow(U,E).\tag{8}\label{papow}
\theta_{\textrm{PA}}(U,G,z)\land\theta_{\textrm{Pow}}(U,E).


Models of this formula are, up to isomorphism, of the form
(M,∈,N,g,a)(M,∈,N,g,a)(M,\in,N,g,a), where P(N)=MP(N)=M\P(N)=M, N∩P(N)=∅N∩P(N)=∅N\cap\P(N)=\emptyset and
NNN is countably infinite. Thus the models are necessarily
uncountable. This shows that second-order logic, unlike first order
logic, has sentences with models but only uncountable ones. Thus the
Downward Löwenheim-Skolem Theorem fails for second-order logic,
as we already noted above. Combining (88\ref{papow}) with the
observations in
 §5.1
 yields the following result (by validity we mean the set of
Gödel numbers of valid formulas):


Theorem 3 (Hintikka 1955; Montague 1963) Validity in
second-order logic is not second-order definable over
(N,+,⋅,0)(N,+,⋅,0)(\oN,+,\cdot,0).


In consequence, validity in second-order logic is not Σ1nΣ1n\Sigma^1_n
for any n. Since building power sets in the style of
θPow(U,E)θPow(U,E)\theta_{\textrm{Pow}}(U,E) can be iterated, we can see that
validity in second-order logic is not ΣmnΣmn\Sigma^m_n for any m
and n. We extend this result further below in
 Theorem 6.


5.3 “Set theory in sheep’s clothing”

Second-order logic hides in its semantics some of the most difficult
problems of set theory. In the words of Resnik (1988: 75):


In Philosophy of Logic [Quine 1970], W. V. Quine summed up a popular
opinion among mathematical logicians by referring to second-order
logic as “set theory in sheep’s clothing”.


Let us see where this opinion might come from. First we observe that a
very simple, indeed a very basic, second-order formula can say that
two sets have the same cardinality: Suppose P and R are
unary relation variables. Let θ≤(P,R)θ≤(P,R)\theta_{\le}(P,R) be the formula

∃F(∀x∀y((F(x)=F(y)→x=y)∧(P(x)→R(F(x)))).∃F(∀x∀y((F(x)=F(y)→x=y)∧(P(x)→R(F(x)))).
\exists F\left(\forall x\,\forall y\left(
(F(x)=F(y)\to x=y)
\land(P(x)\to R(F(x))
\right)\right).


Now M⊨sϕ≤(P,R)M⊨sϕ≤(P,R)\mm\models_s\phi_\le(P,R) if and only if |s(P)|≤|s(R)||s(P)|≤|s(R)||s(P)|\le |s(R)|.
Let θEQ(P,R)θEQ(P,R)\theta_{\textrm{EQ}}(P,R) be the formula
θ\le(P,R)∧θ\le(R,P)θ\le(P,R)∧θ\le(R,P)\theta_{\textrm{\le}}(P,R)\land \theta_{\textrm{\le}}(R,P). Now
M⊨sϕ(P,R)M⊨sϕ(P,R)\mm\models_s\phi(P,R) if and only if |s(P)|=|s(R)||s(P)|=|s(R)||s(P)|=|s(R)|. Let
θ′EC(Y)θ′EC(Y)\theta'_{\textrm{EC}}(Y) be 
∃F(∀x∀y((F(x)=F(y)→x=y)∧R(F(x)))∧∀x∃y(R(x)→x=F(y))).∃F(∀x∀y((F(x)=F(y)→x=y)∧R(F(x)))∧∀x∃y(R(x)→x=F(y))).
\exists F\left(
\forall x\,\forall y((F(x)=F(y)\to x=y)\land R(F(x)))
 \land {}\\
\forall x\,\exists y(R(x)\to x=F(y))
\right).


Now M⊨sϕ(P,R)M⊨sϕ(P,R)\mm\models_s\phi(P,R) if and only if the sets M and
s(R)s(R)s(R) have the same cardinality. We will use these formulas to
launch an attack on the Continuum Hypothesis, the notorious problem of
set theory, proved independent of ZFC by Cohen in 1963 (Cohen
1966).

Let θCHθCH\theta_{\textrm{CH}} be the sentence 
∃E∃U∃G∃z(θPow(E,U)∧θPA(U,G,z)∧∀Y(θ′EC(Y)∨θ≤(Y,U))).(9)∃E∃U∃G∃z(θPow(E,U)∧θPA(U,G,z)∧∀Y(θ′EC(Y)∨θ≤(Y,U))).
\exists E\,\exists U\,\exists G\,\exists z\left(
\theta_{\textrm{Pow}}(E,U)
\land\theta_{\textrm{PA}}(U,G,z) 
\land {}\\
\forall Y(\theta'_{\textrm{EC}}(Y)\lor\theta_{\le}(Y,U))
\right). \tag{9}


Now θCHθCH\theta_{\textrm{CH}}, which is a sentence of the empty
vocabulary, has a model if and only if the Continuum Hypothesis CH
holds. Similarly, there is a sentence θ¬CHθ¬CH\theta_{\neg \textrm{CH}},
which has a model if and only if the Continuum Hypothesis CH does not
hold. This shows that the dependence of the semantics of second-order
logic on the metatheoretic set theory is so deep that even questions
that ZFC cannot solve can determine the truth or falsity of a sentence
in a model.

The curious quality of second-order logic is that the truth of a
sentence such as θCHθCH\theta_{\textrm{CH}} in a big enough model of the
empty vocabulary is equivalent to the truth of the Continuum
Hypothesis in the set-theoretical universe. By the same technique
almost any set-theoretical statement can be turned into a sentence of
second-order logic, the truth of which in a big enough model of the
empty vocabulary is equivalent to the truth of the statement in the
set-theoretical universe. Somehow second-order logic manages to read
the background set theory correctly. Does this mean that second-order
logic is set theory in “sheep’s clothing”?


5.4 Does second-order logic depend on the Axiom of Choice?

The Axiom of Choice (AC) is a philosophical puzzle in the foundations
of mathematics. Roughly speaking, this axiom, that originally emerged
in set theory, says that if we have a set AAA of non-empty disjoint
sets, then we can form a new set BBB which contains exactly one
element from each set in AAA. What can be seen as a problem is the
fact that when AAA is infinite, forming the set BBB seems to
require making an infinite number of choices. See entry on
 Axiom of Choice
 for a thorough definition and discussion. On the one hand the Axiom
of Choice seems magic, for example when it implies that the wildest
sets have a well-ordering. On the other hand it seems innocuous, for
example when it implies that the Cartesian product of a family of
non-empty sets is non-empty. The Axiom of Choice is typically used to
construct odd “paradoxical” sets, such as a non-Lebesgue
measurable set of real numbers, a well-ordering of the real numbers, a
paradoxical decomposition of the sphere (see entry on
 set theory),
 and so on. Such sets are usually in one sense or another undefinable.
For example, a non-Lebesgue measurable set of real numbers
has to be undefinable in second-order logic over
(N,+,⋅)(N,+,⋅)(\oN,+,\cdot), if there are sufficiently large cardinals (see the
entry on
 large cardinals and determinacy).

The puzzling Axiom of Choice arises also in the middle of second-order
logic: Let θθ\theta be the sentence 
∀X(∀x∃yX(x,y)→∃F∀xX(x,F(x))).∀X(∀x∃yX(x,y)→∃F∀xX(x,F(x))).
\forall X(\forall x\,\exists y\,X(x,y)\to\exists F\,\forall x\,X(x,F(x))).


Then R⊨θR⊨θ\oR\models\theta essentially says that if a binary relation
XXX relates to each x∈Rx∈Rx\in\oR a non-empty set {y∈R:X(x,y}{y∈R:X(x,y}\{y\in\oR :
X(x,y\}, then there is a function FFF which chooses for each
x∈Rx∈Rx\in\oR some y=F(x)y=F(x)y=F(x) such that X(x,y)X(x,y)X(x,y). In set theory this
is one of many equivalent ways of saying that the Axiom of Choice
holds for (continuum size) families of subsets of RR\oR. The basic
tenet of second-order logic is that “all” properties of
elements of a fixed domain exist and we can quantify over them. In
set-theoretical terms this means that all subsets, definable or not,
of a set of any cardinality exists and we can quantify over them. In
this spirit the Axiom of Choice seems innocent and is usually accepted
in the literature of second-order logic.

By Cohen’s results (1966) there are N and N′N′N'
satisfying the axioms of ZF (without the Axiom of Choice) such that
“N⊨θN⊨θ\oN\models\theta” holds in N but does not hold
in N′N′N'. This is a further demonstration of the dependence of the
semantics of second-order logic on the metatheory.


6. Non-Absoluteness of Truth in Second-Order Logic

Absoluteness is one of the most important concepts of logic. It was
used already in 1939 by Gödel in his analysis of the hierarchy of
constructible sets (1939 [1990: 46]) towards proving the consistency
of the Continuum Hypothesis. It is briefly mentioned by Gödel
three years earlier in connection with the notion of computability
(1936 [1986: 397]).

Intuitively speaking, a concept is absolute if its meaning is
independent of the formalism used, or in other words, if its meaning
in the formal sense is the same as its meaning in the “real
world”. This may sound very vague and inexact. However,
absoluteness has a perfectly exact technical definition in set
theory.

Recall that a set a is called transitive if every
element of an element of a is an element of a. A
transitive model is a model (M,∈)(M,∈)(M,\in) such that M is
transitive. By the Mostowski Collapsing Lemma (Mostowski 1949) every
well-founded model (M,E)(M,E)(M,E) of the Axiom of Extensionality is
isomorphic to a transitive model. A basic property of transitive
models (M,∈)(M,∈)(M,\in) is that if a,b∈Ma,b∈Ma,b\in M, then M⊨a⊆bM⊨a⊆bM\models a\subseteq
b if and only if a⊆ba⊆ba\subseteq b. (If all elements of a that
are in M are in b then all elements of a are in
b, as by transitivity of M, elements of a are
necessarily elements of M.) We could express this by saying
that the formula x⊆yx⊆yx\subseteq y is absolute in transitive models.
More generally, we say that a formula ϕ(x1,…,xn)ϕ(x1,…,xn)\phi(x_1,\ldots,x_n) of the
first order language of set theory is absolute relative to
ZFC if there is a finite T⊆ZFCT⊆ZFCT\subseteq \ZFC such that for all
transitive models (M,∈)(M,∈)(M,\in) of T and all a1,…,an∈Ma1,…,an∈Ma_1,\ldots,a_n\in
M we have 
ϕ(a1,…,an) if and only if (M,∈)⊨ϕ(a1,…,an).ϕ(a1,…,an) if and only if (M,∈)⊨ϕ(a1,…,an).\phi(a_1,\ldots,a_n)\text{ if and only if }(M,\in)\models\phi(a_1,\ldots,a_n).


This definition of absoluteness is equivalent to the following more
syntactic condition (Feferman & Kreisel 1966): there are a
Σ1Σ1\Sigma_1-formula ∃yψ(y,x1,…,xn)∃yψ(y,x1,…,xn)\exists y\,\psi(y,x_1,\ldots,x_n) and a
Π1Π1\Pi_1-formula ∀yθ(y,x1,…,xn)∀yθ(y,x1,…,xn)\forall y\,\theta(y,x_1,\ldots,x_n) such that

ZFC⊢∀x1…∀xn(ϕ(x1,…,xn)↔∃yψ(y,x1,…,xn))ZFC⊢∀x1…∀xn(ϕ(x1,…,xn)↔∃yψ(y,x1,…,xn))\ZFC\vdash\forall x_1\ldots\forall x_n(\phi(x_1,\ldots,x_n)\leftrightarrow \exists y\,\psi(y,x_1,\ldots,x_n))


and 
ZFC⊢∀x1…∀xn(ϕ(x1,…,xn)↔∀yθ(y,x1,…,xn)).ZFC⊢∀x1…∀xn(ϕ(x1,…,xn)↔∀yθ(y,x1,…,xn)).\ZFC\vdash\forall x_1\ldots\forall x_n(\phi(x_1,\ldots,x_n)\leftrightarrow \forall y\,\theta(y,x_1,\ldots,x_n)).


In such a case we say that ϕ(x1,…,xn)ϕ(x1,…,xn)\phi(x_1,\ldots,x_n) is
ΔZFC1ΔZFC1\Delta_1^{\text{ZFC}}.

For first order logic it can be proved that
“M⊨sϕM⊨sϕ\mm\models_s\phi” is an absolute property of MM\mm,
s and ϕϕ\phi relative to ZFC. In fact, this is true even if
ZFC is replaced by the weaker Kripke-Platek set theory KP (see Barwise
1972a). The usual Tarski Truth Definition of first order logic can be
written in ΔZFC1ΔZFC1\Delta_1^{\text{ZFC}} form. For second-order logic the
propositions “ϕϕ\phi is a second-order formula”,
“MM\mm is an L-structure” and “s is
an assignment” are all absolute relative to ZFC as well, but
“M⊨sϕM⊨sϕ\mm\models_s\phi” is not, as we shall now see. This
is a crucial property of second-order logic. One may consider it a
weakness, if one thinks of absoluteness as a desirable property, or a
strength, if one takes non-absoluteness as a sign of expressive power.
Whether a weakness or not, it is an important feature of second-order
logic and a dominating topic in discussions about it. Second-order
logic is, however, not the only non-absolute logic. For example,
L(Q1)L(Q1)L(Q_1) (see the entry on
 generalized quantifiers)
 and Lω1ω1Lω1ω1L_{\omega_1\omega_1} (see then entry on
 infinitary languages)
 are non-absolute, while L(Q0)L(Q0)L(Q_0) and Lω1ωLω1ωL_{\omega_1\omega} are
absolute. The reason why L(Q0)L(Q0)L(Q_0) is absolute is essentially that
the property of a set being infinite is absolute in transitive models
of ZFC. Although the set of sentences of Lω1ωLω1ωL_{\omega_1\omega} may
vary from one transitive model of ZFC to another, the truth of a
sentence of Lω1ωLω1ωL_{\omega_1\omega} in a model is absolute in
transitive models of ZFC essentially because the truth has a simple
inductive definition which only refers to subformulas of the sentence
and elements of the model.

Recall the definition of the sentence θEC(P,R)θEC(P,R)\theta_{\textrm{EC}}(P,R) in
 §5.3,
 which says that the interpretations of the predicates P and
R have the same cardinality. Cardinality is not an absolute
property. Two sets (even two ordinals) can be of different cardinality
in one transitive model of ZFC and of the same cardinality in a
transitive extension. It is easy to see that “M⊨sθEC(P,R)M⊨sθEC(P,R)\mm\models_s\theta_{\textrm{EC}}(P,R)”
is not absolute relative to ZFC. Essentially, the reason is that two
sets have the same cardinality if there is a bijection between them.
In a small transitive set it may happen that the sets are there but
the bijection manifesting their equicardinality is not. The bijection
may be one obtained by the method of forcing. Or the lack of the
bijection may be the result of applying the Downward
Löwenheim-Skolem
 Theorem[6].

A more serious case of non-absoluteness is the sentence
θCHθCH\theta_{\textrm{CH}} of
 §5.3.
 The sentence θCHθCH\theta_{\textrm{CH}} of the empty vocabulary has a
model if and only if the Continuum Hypothesis is true. If T⊆ZFCT⊆ZFCT\subseteq
\ZFC is finite, then there are countable transitive models
M⊆M′M⊆M′M\subseteq M' such that one, say M, satisfies CH and the
other, in this case M′M′M', does not (by Cohen 1966). In M the
sentence θCHθCH\theta_{\textrm{CH}} has a model AA\ma, that is,
M⊨“A⊨θCH”M⊨“A⊨θCH”M\models
\textrm{“}\ma\models\theta_{\textrm{CH}}\textrm{”}. In
M′M′M' the same sentence has no models, in particular M′⊭“A⊨θCH”M′⊭“A⊨θCH”M'\not\models
\textrm{“}\ma\models\theta_{\textrm{CH}}\textrm{”}. Thus
the property of a model satisfying a second-order sentence is not
absolute relative to ZFC. Even the property of a second-order sentence
having a model is not absolute relative to ZFC, because in
M the sentence θCHθCH\theta_{\textrm{CH}} has a model but in
M′M′M' not. For first order logic the property of a sentence of having
a model is co-re and therefore arithmetical. Arithmetical properties
are always absolute relative to ZFC. The situation is similar if the
Continuum Hypothesis is replaced by the Axiom of Choice (see
 §5.4).

The CH and the AC are central questions of set theory and subjects of
continuing debate. While the AC is mostly accepted as an axiom, and is
part of the ZFC axiom system, the CH is widely considered an open
problem. There are even suggestions (e.g., Feferman 1999) that it
cannot be solved by any axiom system with the kind of general
acceptance that ZFC has. The formalist position in the foundations of
mathematics goes further and maintains that the question, what the
truth value of CH is, is meaningless. Both CH and its negation are
consistent with ZFC, assuming ZFC itself is consistent. According to
the formalist position the status of CH has been solved with this. The
semantics of second-order logic depending on these hard questions of
set theory puts second-order logic into the same “basket”
with set theory. Criticism of set theory becomes criticism of
second-order logic and vice versa.

Another indication of the dependence of second-order logic on set
theory as the metatheory is the result of Barwise to the effect that
the existence of the Hanf number of second-order logic is not provable
in set theory without a highly complex use of the Replacement Axiom
(for details, see Barwise 1972b).


7. Model Theory of Second-Order Logic

Let us start by noting that there are some trivial consequences of
second-order logic being able to quantify over relations. For example,
the Craig Interpolation Theorem holds for second-order logic for
trivial reasons: If the finite relational vocabulary of ϕϕ\phi is
L, the finite relational vocabulary of ϕ′ϕ′\phi' is L′L′L' and
⊨ϕ→ϕ′,⊨ϕ→ϕ′,\models\phi\to\phi', then there is θθ\theta such that
⊨ϕ→θ and ⊨θ→ϕ′⊨ϕ→θ and ⊨θ→ϕ′\models\phi\to\theta\text{ and } \models\theta\to\phi' and the
vocabulary of θθ\theta is L∩L′L∩L′L\cap L', because we can let
θθ\theta be the sentence ∃X1…∃Xnϕ∃X1…∃Xnϕ\exists X_1\ldots\exists X_n\,\phi,
where L∖L′={X1,…,Xn}L∖L′={X1,…,Xn}L\setminus L'=\{X_1,\ldots, X_n\}. We can additionally
demand that every predicate symbol occurring positively in θθ\theta
occurs positively in ϕϕ\phi and ψψ\psi, and every predicate symbol
occurring negatively in θθ\theta occurs negatively in ϕϕ\phi and
ψψ\psi (the Lyndon Interpolation Theorem [Lyndon 1959]). In
the same way the Beth Definability Theorem holds for trivial reasons,
also some preservation
 results[7]
 have a trivial proof. For a negative result, see Craig 1965.

However, second-order logic does not have a model theory in the same
sense as first order logic does. There is no Compactness Theorem to
produce non-standard models. One reason why first order logic has such
a rich model theory is that first order logic is relatively weak.
Countable first order theories that have infinite models have models
of all infinite cardinalities. This is a consequence of a weakness of
first order logic: its sentences cannot limit the size of the model
unless the size is finite. In model theory this weakness is turned to
a strength: the structure of models of first order theories can be
analyzed in interesting ways. See the entry on
 model theory
 for examples of this.

Second-order theories can typically have just one model up to
isomorphism. Thus if we investigate the class of models of a
second-order sentence, the class may very well consist of just one
model, up to isomorphism. With just one model one cannot really
develop a model theory. One ends up investigating the one and only
model and there are no compelling reasons to use logic in the study of
it. If the one and only model is an algebraic structure, one should
use algebra to study it. If it is an ordered structure, one should use
the general theory of ordered structures to study it, and so on. It is
unlikely that being second-order characterizable (see
 §7.1)
 tells much about the structure. It reveals more about second-order
logic in general. For example, being able to characterize the
structure of natural numbers means that the Compactness Theorem and
the Completeness Theorem fail. Being able to characterize the ordered
field of real numbers means that both the Downward and the Upward
Löwenheim-Skolem Theorems fail. It is from this
perspective—to understand second-order logic itself—that
it is interesting to know exactly which structures are second-order
characterizable up to isomorphism.

Let us finally compare the two hierarchies, the model theoretic
hierarchy Σ1n∪Π1nΣ1n∪Π1n\Sigma_n^1\cup\Pi_n^1 inside second-order logic and the
Levy hierarchy Σn∪ΠnΣn∪Πn\Sigma_n\cup\Pi_n in set theory.


Theorem 4

The set of Gödel numbers of valid second-order sentences is
the complete Π2Π2\Pi_2-set of natural numbers. (Tharp 1973)
The Löwenheim-Skolem number of second-order logic is the
supremum of all Π2Π2\Pi_2-definable ordinals. (Krawczyk & Marek
1977)
The Hanf number of second-order logic is the supremum of all
Σ2Σ2\Sigma_2-definable ordinals. (Krawczyk & Marek 1977)
Every model class which is definable in second-order logic is
Δ2Δ2\Delta_2-definable in set theory. (Väänänen
1979)



In the light of the above theorem second-order logic sits firmly on
the Σ2∪Π2Σ2∪Π2\Sigma_2\cup\Pi_2-level of set theoretic definability. This is
a reason to consider second-order logic weaker than first
order set theory. This sounds paradoxical. How can second-order logic,
with all the power and non-first order properties it has, be weaker
than first order logic based set theory, when first order logic cannot
even express finiteness, countability, uncountability, and so on?
Nevertheless the message of
 Theorem 4
 is undeniable. Perhaps this would not be so puzzling if we thought of
set theory as a very high order logic over the singleton of the empty
set. After all, set theory permits endless iterations of the power set
operation, while second-order logic permits only one iteration.

We start below with a subsection on models that can be characterized
in second-order logic by one sentence up to isomorphism. Another
approach to the model theory of second-order logic is to focus on
models with large cardinal (inaccessible, measurable,
supercompact cardinals) properties. This is the topic of
 §7.2.
 Finally, in
 §7.3
 we consider the possibility of allowing the so-called general models
introduced in
 §9.1.
 In this case second-order logic becomes very much like first order
logic. However, general models are mostly interesting when they are
so-called Henkin models, i.e., they satisfy the so-called
Comprehension Axioms. In Henkin models second-order logic satisfies
the Compactness Theorem and other principles familiar from first order
model theory but no general structure- or classification theory exists
yet, perhaps because the Comprehension Axioms bring in a lot of
complicated structure into the models.

7.1 Second-order characterizable structures

A structure AA\ma is second-order characterizable if there
is a second-order sentence θAθA\theta_\ma such that
B⊨θA⟺B≅AB⊨θA⟺B≅A\mb\models\theta_\ma\iff\mb\cong\ma for all structures BB\mb of
the same vocabulary as AA\ma.


Example 5: The following structures are second-order
characterizable:

Natural numbers: (N,+,⋅)(N,+,⋅)(\oN,+,\cdot).
Real numbers: (R,+,⋅,0,1)(R,+,⋅,0,1)(\oR,+,\cdot,0,1).
Complex numbers: (C,+,⋅,0,1)(C,+,⋅,0,1)(\oC,+,\cdot,0,1).
The first uncountable ordinal (ω1,<)(ω1,<)(\omega_1,&lt;).
The level (Vκ,∈)(Vκ,∈)(V_\kappa,\in) of the cumulative hierarchy, where
κκ\kappa is the first strongly inaccessible cardinal
>ω>ω&gt;\omega.
The well-order (κ,<)(κ,<)(\kappa,&lt;) of the first weakly compact
cardinal >ω>ω&gt;\omega.



Are all structures second-order characterizable? There are
only countably many second-order sentences, hence only countably many
(up to isomorphism) second-order characterizable structures. Therefore
there are lots of structures of every infinite cardinality which are
not second-order characterizable. However, it is not easy to give
examples. One example is (κ,<)(κ,<)(\kappa,&lt;), where κκ\kappa is the
first measurable cardinal (>ω>ω&gt;\omega). See
 §7.2
 for an explanation. Another example is (N,<,A)(N,<,A)(\oN,&lt;,A), where
A is the set of Gödel numbers of valid second-order
sentences in the vocabulary of one binary relation. For an
explanation, see
 §7.2.
 One may ask whether there is an example which arises from
mathematical practice outside of mathematical logic. What about
(R,+,×,<,A)(R,+,×,<,A)(\oR,+,\times,&lt;,A), where A is a Hamel basis (a basis
for the vector space where the reals are the vectors, rationals are
the scalars and vector addition is the usual addition of reals)? It is
consistent, relative to the consistency of ZF that no such structure
(R,+,×,<,A)(R,+,×,<,A)(\oR,+,\times,&lt;,A) is second-order characterizable (Hyttinen,
Kangas, & Väänänen 2013).

A special property of second-order characterizable structures is that
their reducts are also second-order characterizable, because we can
use existential second-order quantifiers to “guess” the
missing relations and functions. Therefore it is interesting to find
characterizable structures that have as many (but only finitely many)
relations and functions as possible. We can endow NN\oN with any
finite number of recursive functions f1,…,fnf1,…,fnf_1,\ldots, f_n  and
relations R1,…,RmR1,…,RmR_1,\ldots, R_m obtaining the structure
(N,f1,…,fn,R1,…,Rm)(N,f1,…,fn,R1,…,Rm)(\oN,f_1,\ldots, f_n,R_1,\ldots, R_m) and this is second-order
characterizable. We can endow RR\oR with any familiar analytic
functions such as trigonometric functions or any other functions given
by a convergent power series the coefficients of which are given by a
recursive function, and the result is second-order
characterizable.

It is easy to see that the second-order theory of a second-order
characterizable structure AA\ma is Turing-reducible to the
second-order theory of any bigger second-order characterizable
structure BB\mb, as for all second-order ϕϕ\phi: 
A⊨ϕ⟺B⊨∃P(θPA∧ϕP).A⊨ϕ⟺B⊨∃P(θPA∧ϕP).\ma\models\phi\iff\mb\models\exists P(\theta_\ma^{P}\land\phi^{P}).


The bigger the characterizable structure is, the more complex is the
second-order theory. That there is no largest characterizable
structure can be seen as follows: If AA\ma is second-order
characterizable, then so is the reduct of AA\ma to the empty
 vocabulary[8],
 that is, the cardinality |A||A||A| of AA\ma is characterizable. Such
cardinal numbers were studied by Garland (1974). For example, if
κκ\kappa is characterizable, then so are κ+κ+\kappa^+ and
2κ2κ2^\kappa.

If ϕϕ\phi is a second-order sentence, we define 
Mod(ϕ)={M:M⊨ϕ}.Mod(ϕ)={M:M⊨ϕ}.\Mod(\phi)=\{\mm: \mm\models\phi\}.


If ϕϕ\phi characterizes a model AA\ma, then Mod(ϕ)Mod(ϕ)\Mod(\phi) is just
the class of models isomorphic to AA\ma. If we look at
Mod(ϕ)Mod(ϕ)\Mod(\phi) from the perspective of set theory, we know it is
Δ2Δ2\Delta_2
 (Theorem 4).
 On the other hand, the set of Gödel numbers of valid
second-order sentences is Π2Π2\Pi_2-complete
 (Theorem 4),
 hence not Σ2Σ2\Sigma_2 and in particular, not Δ2Δ2\Delta_2. This
contemplation leads us to the following extension of
 Theorem 3
 above:


Theorem 6 (Väänänen 2012) Second-order
validity is not second-order definable on any second-order
characterizable structure.


This raises the question, how can we understand second-order validity
from the second-order perspective? In view of the above theorem we
cannot understand second-order validity as something that can be
expressed in second-order logic on some structure which itself can be
characterized in second-order logic. The reference to set theory seems
inevitable in understanding second-order validity. Let us discuss what
this might mean from the point of view of structuralism. Parsons
defines structuralism as follows:


By the “structuralist view” of mathematical objects, I
mean the view that reference to mathematical objects is always in the
context of some background structure, and that the objects involved
have no more to them than can be expressed in terms of the basic
relations of the structure. (Parsons 1990: 303)


Structuralism in this sense (for other kinds of structuralism, see,
e.g., Hellman 2001) seems to fit well into the second-order logic
framework. Contrary to set theory, second-order logic always assumes
an underlying (limited) structure which is supposed to reflect one
particular aspect of mathematics such as the semi-ring of natural
numbers, the ordered field of real numbers, the field of complex
numbers, the well-ordered structure (ω1,<)(ω1,<)(\omega_1,&lt;), and so on.
Ideally, these underlying structures are second-order characterizable.
This leads to a problem with universal truths such as validity, but
also with less complex ones such as the statement that every linear
order has a completion, or that every field has an algebraic closure.
Such universal truths are not about any particular structure.


7.2 Second-order logic and large cardinals

We refer to the SEP entries
 independence and large cardinals
 and
 large cardinals and determinacy
 for the definition of concepts related to large cardinals.

The following early result on the connection between model theory of
second-order logic and large cardinals is a model for other more
delicate results. It is a kind of Downward Löwenheim-Skolem
Theorem for second-order logic. It says that if a second-order
sentence has a model of the cardinality of a measurable cardinal, then
it has a smaller submodel:


Theorem 7 (Scott 1961) Suppose κκ\kappa is a
measurable cardinal. If ϕϕ\phi is a second-order sentence and
ϕϕ\phi has a model MM\mm of cardinality κκ\kappa, then for every
X⊆MX⊆MX\subseteq M of cardinality <κ<κ&lt;\kappa there is
N⊆MN⊆M\mn\subseteq\mm such that X⊆NX⊆NX\subseteq N and N⊨ϕN⊨ϕ\mn\models\phi.
 [9]


A particular consequence is that the first measurable cardinal cannot
be second-order characterizable as a model of the empty vocabulary (a
fact that was referred to above in
 §7.1).
 Theorem 7 resembles remarkably the Downward Löwenheim-Skolem
Theorem of first order logic. The only difference is that one has to
start with a big model, a model of the size of a measurable cardinal.
Smaller cardinals need not work. For example, if λλ\lambda is the
least weakly compact cardinal >ω>ω&gt;\omega, then there is a sentence
ϕϕ\phi which has λλ\lambda (with the empty vocabulary) as a model
but no smaller models. The
 sentence[10]
ϕϕ\phi says that λλ\lambda is inaccessible (>ω>ω&gt;\omega) and
that every λλ\lambda-tree (a tree of height λλ\lambda with all
levels of size <λ<λ&lt;\lambda) has a branch of length
λλ\lambda.

If we want to obtain a Downward Löwenheim-Skolem Theorem which
works for any structure, not only for structures of a measurable
cardinality, we have to look at even bigger cardinals: The
LST-number of second-order logic is defined to be the least
(if any exist) κκ\kappa such that if AA\ma is any structure and
ϕϕ\phi is a second-order sentence true in AA\ma, then there is a
substructure BB\mb of AA\ma which also satisfies ϕ.ϕ.\phi.


Theorem 8 (Magidor 1971) The LST-number of
second-order logic exists if and only if there are supercompact
cardinals >ω>ω&gt;\omega and then it is the smallest of them.


Second-order logic is said to satisfy strong
κκ\kappa-compactness if every second-order theory, every
subset of size <κ<κ&lt;\kappa of which has a model, has itself a
model.


Theorem 9 (Magidor 1971) The least κκ\kappa such
that second-order logic satisfies the strong κκ\kappa-compactness
is the least extendible
cardinal.



7.3 The model theory of general and Henkin models

The situation changes completely if we adopt so-called general models
 (§9.1).
 With general models second-order logic has similar model theoretic
properties as first order logic, as it can simply be thought of as
many sorted first order logic (see
 §9.1
 and Manzano 1996). By and large, results of many-sorted first order
logic translate immediately to second-order logic.



8. Decidability Results

The second-order theory of even the empty vocabulary is undecidable,
as we noted in
 §5.1.
 In contrast, monadic second-order logic gives rise to many
important decidability results. Let us first observe that (not only in
the empty vocabulary but also) in a monadic vocabulary, i.e., one
consisting of monadic predicates only, monadic second-order logic is
certainly decidable as proved already in 1915 by Löwenheim (1915)
in one of the earliest papers on the mathematical aspects of formal
logic. Löwenheim’s result can be proved easily by
quantifier elimination, or alternatively by the more recent method of
Ehrenfeucht-Fraïssé-games (see
 §3).
 However, monadic third (and higher) order logic in monadic
vocabulary, with quantifiers over not only subsets and also over sets
of subsets of the domain, is undecidable (Tharp 1973). We now focus on
vocabularies which are not merely monadic.

Compared to a monadic vocabulary, the other extreme can be described
as follows: Let P be a ternary predicate (a “pairing
function”) on a non-empty set S. Suppose that for every
x,y∈Sx,y∈Sx,y\in S there is z∈Sz∈Sz\in S with (x,y,z)∈P(x,y,z)∈P(x, y, z) \in P and for
every z∈Sz∈Sz\in S there is at most one pair (x,y)(x,y)(x, y) with (x,y,z)∈P(x,y,z)∈P(x, y, z)
\in P. Then the true (full) second-order theory of S is
interpretable in the monadic theory of (S,P)(S,P)(S, P) (Gurevich 1985). In
other words, in a context where a pairing function is present, as in
set theory and number theory, no special advantage arises from
limiting second-order logic to its monadic fragment.

The next step from a vocabulary consisting of only monadic predicates
is a vocabulary with exactly one unary function. To describe some
highly non-trivial results in this case we introduce the following
concept, which has independent interest: The spectrum of a
first or second-order sentence is the set of cardinalities of its
finite models. Spectra were introduced by Scholz, see Durand, Jones,
Makowsky, and More (2012) for a history. A spectrum is of course
always recursive. In fact, a set of natural numbers is a spectrum of a
first order sentence iff it is in NEXPTIME, that is, recognizable by a
nondeterministic Turing machine in exponential time (Jones &
Selman 1974). In the case of sentences with just one unary function
symbol there is a surprising characterization. Let us call a set
S of natural numbers eventually periodic if there are
natural numbers N and p with p>0p>0p &gt; 0 such that for
every n with n>Nn>Nn &gt; N, we have n∈Sn∈Sn \in S iff n+p∈Sn+p∈Sn +p \in
S.


Theorem 10 (Durand, Fagin, & Loescher 1998; Shelah
2004) Suppose the vocabulary has just one unary function.
Then a set of natural numbers is the spectrum of a monadic
second-order sentence if and only if it is the spectrum of a first
order sentence if and only if it is eventually periodic.


In graphs monadic second-order logic can still express most
interesting properties. For example, the connectivity of the
graph (here E is the edge relation) can be expressed by the
sentence 
∀X((∃xX(x)∧∀x∀y((X(x)∧xEy)→X(y)))→∀xX(x))∀X((∃xX(x)∧∀x∀y((X(x)∧xEy)→X(y)))→∀xX(x))\forall X((\exists x\,X(x)\land\forall x\forall y((X(x)\land xEy)\to
X(y)))\to\forall x\,X(x)) 

and the 3-colorability of the graph by the sentence 
∃X∃Y∃Z(∀x(X(x)∨Y(x)∨Z(x))∧∀x∀y(((X(x)∧X(y))∨(Y(x)∧Y(y))∨(Z(x)∧Z(y)))→¬xEy))∃X∃Y∃Z(∀x(X(x)∨Y(x)∨Z(x))∧∀x∀y(((X(x)∧X(y))∨(Y(x)∧Y(y))∨(Z(x)∧Z(y)))→¬xEy))\begin{align}
&amp;\exists X\,\exists Y\,\exists Z ( \forall x(
X(x)
\lor Y(x)
\lor Z(x)
)\land{}\\
&amp;\quad\forall x\,\forall y ((
(X(x)\land X(y))
\lor(Y(x)\land Y(y))
\lor(Z(x)\land Z(y))
)\to{}\\
&amp;\quad\neg xEy))
\end{align}

There is a wealth of decidability results of monadic second-order
logic on linear orders, trees and graphs.


Theorem 11 (Büchi 1962; Elgot 1961; Rabin 1968)
The monadic second-order theory of (N,s)(N,s)(\oN,s), i.e., the successor
function on NN\oN and of the full infinite binary tree, i.e., two
successor functions on NN\oN, are both decidable.


The proof goes via a reduction to automata. An automaton is a
restricted form of a Turing machine. In an automaton the machine never
writes on the tape, so the tape just contains the input (Rabin &
Scott 1959). However, the computation may be infinite. The input is
considered accepted in the case of an infinite computation if
an accepting state is reached infinitely many times. (There are also
more complicated criteria of acceptance). With monadic second-order
logic we can guess an accepting computation of the automaton. It is
possible but more difficult to show that an automaton can check the
truth of a monadic second-order sentence. The monadic second-order
theory of ordinals (α,<)(α,<)(\alpha,&lt;) have been studied extensively
from the point of view of decidability. For example, the monadic
second-order theory of all countable ordinals, the theory of
ω1ω1\omega_1, and the theory of all ordinals <ω2<ω2&lt;\omega_2 are
decidable (Büchi 1973), but ZFC cannot decide whether the monadic
second-order theory of ω2ω2\omega_2 is decidable (Gurevich, Magidor,
& Shelah 1983).


9. Axioms of Second-Order Logic

The deductive system of second-order logic, presented first explicitly
in Hilbert-Ackermann (Hilbert & Ackermann 1938), is based on the
obvious extension of axioms and rules of first order logic together
with the Comprehension Axiom Schema, defined as follows:
Suppose ϕ(x1,…,xn)ϕ(x1,…,xn)\phi(x_1,\ldots,x_n) is a second-order formula with
x1,…,xnx1,…,xnx_1,\ldots, x_n among its free individual variables and the
second-order variable R is not free in ϕϕ\phi. Then
the following formula is an instance of the Comprehension Axiom
Schema: 
∃R∀x1…xn(ϕ(x1,…,xn)↔R(x1,…,xn)).(10)∃R∀x1…xn(ϕ(x1,…,xn)↔R(x1,…,xn)).\tag{10}\label{CA} \exists R\,\forall x_1\ldots x_n(\phi(x_1,\ldots,
x_n)\leftrightarrow R(x_1,\ldots, x_n)).  

There is a similar schema for second-order formulas that define a
function but we omit it here.

An example of a very simple second-order inference in number theory
would be 
2+5<9∃R R(2+5,9)∃F∃R R(F(2,5),9)2+5<9∃R R(2+5,9)∃F∃R R(F(2,5),9)
\frac{\dfrac{2+5&lt;9}{\exists R\ R(2+5,9)}}{\exists F\,\exists R\ R(F(2,5),9)}


A priori (1010\ref{CA}) might appear very strong as it stipulates the
existence of a relation. However, such an R seems reasonable to
accept because it is definable: 
R={(a1…an)∈Mn:M⊨ϕ(a1,…,an)}.R={(a1…an)∈Mn:M⊨ϕ(a1,…,an)}.R=\{(a_1\ldots a_n) \in M^n: \mm\models \phi(a_1,\ldots, a_n)\}.


Our Comprehension Axiom Schema is impredicative in the sense
that the bound n-ary relation variables which may potentially
occur in the formula ϕ(a1,…,an)ϕ(a1,…,an)\phi(a_1,\ldots, a_n) have R in their
range. In this sense second-order logic is utterly impredicative. The
Comprehension Axiom Schema has weaker forms that are less
impredicative. In the Arithmetic Comprehension Schema we
assume ϕ(a1,…,an)ϕ(a1,…,an)\phi(a_1,\ldots, a_n) is first order. In the
Π11Π11\Pi^1_1-Comprehension Schema we assume ϕ(a1,…,an)ϕ(a1,…,an)\phi(a_1,\ldots, a_n)
is Π11Π11\Pi^1_1. In mathematical practice these two weaker principles
usually suffice, see Simpson (1999 [2009]) and
 §14.

Hilbert-Ackermann (1938) added to the proof system of second-order
logic also two different schemas that they call Axioms of
Choice. We are used to thinking of the Axiom of Choice as a
set-theoretical principle. But second-order logic has the same
situation with choice principles as set theory. It makes perfect sense
in second-order logic to ask whether there is a well-order of the
domain. The existence of such a well-order does in general not follow
from the Comprehension Schema because the well-order may be---and is
likely to be---undefinable. So the only way to get a well-order of,
say, the real numbers, in second-order logic is to assume some form of
second-order Axiom of Choice. The first choice principle is 
∀x1…xm∃xm+1R(x1,…,xm+1)→∃F∀x1…∀xmR(x1,…,xm,F(x1…xm))(AC)∀x1…xm∃xm+1R(x1,…,xm+1)→∃F∀x1…∀xmR(x1,…,xm,F(x1…xm))\tag{AC}\forall x_1\ldots x_m\exists
x_{m+1}\, R(x_1,\ldots, x_{m+1}) \rightarrow {}\\ \exists F\,\forall
x_1\ldots\forall x_m\, R(x_1,\ldots, x_m, F(x_1\ldots x_m))

and the second is 
∀x1…xm∃Fφ→∃F′∀x1…xmφ′,\tag{AC′} \forall x_1\ldots x_m\exists F\,\varphi\rightarrow\exists
F'\,\forall x_1\ldots x_m\varphi', 

where the formula φ′\varphi' is obtained from the formula
φ\varphi by replacing everywhere F(t1,…,tk)F(t_1,\ldots, t_k) by
F′(t1…tk,x1,…,xm)F'(t_1\ldots t_k,x_1,\ldots, x_m).

The first Axiom of Choice (AC) says intuitively that if a set 
{an+1∈M:M⊨R(a1,…,an,an+1)}\{a_{n+1}\in M : \mm\models R(a_1,\ldots,a_n, a_{n+1})\}


is non-empty, then there is a function which picks an element
an+1a_{n+1} from the set, using the parameters a1,…,ana_1,\ldots,a_{n} as
arguments. The second Axiom of Choice (AC′) is a kind of
second-order choice: We have for all a1,…,ana_1,\ldots,a_n a function
F with the property ϕ\phi, so in fact F depends on
a1,…,ana_1,\ldots, a_n and should be denoted Fa1…anF_{a_1\ldots a_n}. What
(AC′) says now is that we can collect the functions
Fa1…anF_{a_1\ldots a_n} together to form just one function F′F' of
higher arity such that 
F′(a1,…,an+1)=Fa1…an(an+1).F'(a_1,\ldots,a_{n+1})=F_{a_1\ldots a_n}(a_{n+1}).


Although F′F' appears to be definable, this is not the case, as the
mapping 
(a1,…,an)↦Fa1…an(a_1,\ldots,a_n)\mapsto F_{a_1\ldots a_n}


may be highly undefinable.

Naturally, we may also want to assume the Well-ordering
Principle which states that there is a binary relation which is a
total order on the individuals and satisfies the condition that every
non-empty set of individuals has a least element in the order. It is
easy to see that this principle implies (AC′). In ZFC there are
hundreds of equivalent formulations of the Axiom of Choice or weaker
versions of it. Most of the formulations that are equivalent in ZFC
are non-equivalent in second-order logic. This is because set theory
allows free movement between sets and their power sets, but
second-order logic does
 not[11].
 To obtain similar equivalence proofs as in set theory, one would have
to move between second-order logic and third order logic, see
Gaßner (1994).

9.1 General models and Henkin models

The concept of “general model” was introduced by Henkin
(1950) in order to obtain a Completeness Theorem for second-order
logic. General models are not the intended models of the axioms in the
sense that bound relation and function variables do not range in these
models over all relations and functions, only over a
collection of them. The generally accepted attitude towards them is
that they are not what one wants but they are necessary for obtaining
a smooth theory. They are like irrational numbers in calculus: it
would be ideal if all lengths that we encounter in calculus (or
geometry) were commensurable, but that is not how things turned out.
Some lengths are incommensurable, and we end up accepting irrational
numbers in order to have a smooth general theory of lengths and their
proportions. General models can be also compared to transitive models
of set theory. One transitive model may say one thing is true, another
says just the opposite is true. But together the transitive models
help us understand the axioms of set theory. The current methods in
the metamathematical investigation of the axioms of set theory, namely
inner models and forcing extensions, all use transitive models of set
theory in an essential way. Similarly general models of second-order
logic help us investigate metamathematical properties of second-order
logic and its axioms.


Definition 12 A general model is a pair
(M,G)(\mm,\G), where M\mm is a usual L-structure and G\G
is a set of subsets, relations (of any arity) and functions (of any
arity) on M. In monadic second-order logic G\G is assumed to
contain unary predicates only.


We can define the concept 
(M,G)⊨sϕ(\mm,\G)\models_s\phi


for second-order ϕ\phi by induction on ϕ\phi by stipulating 
(M,G)⊨s∃Xϕ⟺(M,G)⊨s(P/X)ϕ for some P∈G.(M,G)⊨s∃Fϕ⟺(M,G)⊨s(f/X)ϕ for some f∈G.
\begin{align}
(\mm,\G)\models_s\exists X\,\phi &amp; \iff (\mm,\G)\models_{s(P/X)} \phi\text{ for some  $P\in \G$}.\\
(\mm,\G)\models_s\exists F\,\phi &amp;\iff (\mm,\G)\models_{s(f/X)} \phi\text{ for some  $f\in \G$}.
\end{align}


The difference to the original truth definition of second-order logic
is thus that the interpretations of the second-order variables cannot
be quite arbitrary, they have to be found in G\G. The smaller the
G\G is, the weaker the logic. On the other hand, if G⋆\G^\star is
the set of all relations and functions on M, then the
truth definition for the general model (M,G⋆)(\mm,\G^\star) is the same
as the original truth definition. We call such general models
full and indeed identify (M,G⋆)(\mm,\G^\star) with M\mm. The
other extreme is that G=∅\G=\emptyset. Then we are back in first
order logic. To distinguish second-order logic with general models
from the original second-order logic, we call the latter
full.


Definition 13 A general model which satisfies all the
axioms of second-order logic, including the Comprehension Axiom Schema
and the Axioms of Choice, is called a Henkin model.


Note that there is no sentence of second-order logic which
says that the model is full. That is, there is no
second-order ϕ\phi such that for all general models (M,G)(\mm,\G) it
holds that 
(M,G)⊨ϕ⟺(M,G) is full.
(\mm,\G)\models\phi\iff (\mm,\G) \text{ is full.}


If we attempt to use ∀X∃Y∀x(X(x)↔Y(x))\forall X\,\exists Y\,\forall
x(X(x)\leftrightarrow Y(x)) as such a ϕ\phi, we just obtain the
result that ϕ\phi is always true and says that the general model
(M,G)(\mm,\G) is “full” in its own sense of
“full”, not in the sense of the metatheory.

A natural attempt to get a Henkin model (M,G)(\mm,\G) would be to let
G\G consist of first order definable relations and
functions on M\mm. However, in this way we get only Arithmetic
Comprehension, not the full Comprehension Axiom.

An easy way to obtain a Henkin model (M,G)(\mm,\G) is to take a
transitive model N of ZFC such that M∈N\mm\in N and let G\G
consist of all relations and functions on M that are elements
of N. It follows from N⊨ZFCN\models ZFC that (M,G)(\mm,\G) is a
Henkin model.

Truth in a general model, namely the proposition
“(M,G)⊨sϕ(\mm,\G)\models_s\phi” is absolute relative to ZFC,
contrary to the truth definition of (full) second-order logic. In this
respect second-order logic with general models resembles first order
logic. As we will see, it resembles first order logic in many other
respects, too.

Second-order logic with general models can be thought of in terms of
many sorted logic. Many sorted logic is first order logic
with several different sorts of variables. Respectively,
relations and functions may be between elements of different sorts.
Here “sort” just means that variables of different
“sorts” are kept apart by giving them different names.
Otherwise the variables are just ordinary first order variables.
Structures M\mm of many-sorted logic have a separate domain MsM_s
for each sort s. We may think of second-order logic as many
sorted logic in which the individual variables are of a sort sin\si,
for each n the n-ary relation variables are of a sort
sren\sr, and the n-ary function variables of a sort sfuns_n^{\rm
fu}. In addition there is an n+1n+1-ary relation symbol Aren\sA
between n-tuples of individuals and n-ary relation
variables indicating which n-tuples are in a relation and which
are not. Finally there is an n+1n+1-ary function symbol Afun\sF
between n-tuples of individual, individuals, and n-ary
function variables indicating what value a function variable gives to
each n-tuple. There are obvious first order axioms which
guarantee that the many sorted logic just described faithfully mirrors
second-order logic with general models.
 [12]

For more on the reduction of second-order logic to many-sorted logic,
we refer to Manzano (1996). For example, the proof theory of
second-order logic can be understood via the translation to many
sorted logic. For more on the proof theory of second-order logic, see
Buss (1998). There is a translation of many sorted logic further to
single sorted first order logic due essentially to Herbrand (1930),
see also Wang (1952) and Schmidt (1951). This can be used to obtain
many of the basic properties of first order logic first for many
sorted logic and then further for second-order logic with general
models.

The most important application of general models is the Completeness
Theorem:


Theorem 14 (Henkin 1950) A second-order sentence
follows from the axioms if and only if it is true in all Henkin
models.
 [13]


Respectively, we obtain the Compactness
 Theorem[14]
 as well as the downward and the upward versions of the
Löwenheim-Skolem
 Theorem.[15]

One way to think about Henkin models is that they fill the gaps left
by full models, just as irrational numbers fill the gaps left by
rational numbers. They are needed in order to obtain a smooth theory
of second-order logic. They manifest “paradoxical”
phenomena that we do not see among full models. For example we obtain
non-standard models of number theory, countable models of the axioms
of real numbers, etc. The categorical sentences characterizing
mathematical structures among full models now suddenly have also other
“models”, namely Henkin models, and they come in all
infinite cardinalities.

If ϕ\phi is a second-order sentence we define 
ModH(ϕ)={(M,G):(M,G)⊨ϕ}\tag{11}\label{henkin}
\textit{Mod}_H(\phi)=\{(\mm,\G) : (\mm,\G)\models\phi\} 


Obviously, Mod(ϕ)⊆ModH(ϕ)\Mod(\phi)\subseteq \textit{Mod}_H(\phi). If ϕ\phi
characterizes M\mm up to isomorphism, then M∈Mod(ϕ)\mm\in \Mod(\phi) .
In all non-trivial
 cases[16]
ModH(ϕ)≠{M}\textit{Mod}_H(\phi)\ne \{\mm\}. We can think of
ModH(ϕ)\textit{Mod}_H(\phi) as a class of “approximations” of
M\mm. One of the approximations is the “real” M\mm
but by means of deductions in second-order logic we cannot tell which.
Because of the inherent weakness of formal systems, going back to
Skolem and Gödel, infinite structures are shrouded by Henkin
models and cannot be gotten perfectly into focus by deductive
means.

The Fraenkel-Mostowski method is a construction of Henkin
models which was first used in set theory to obtain models where Axiom
of Choice fails, and later used in second-order logic to obtain
similar models before the method of forcing emerged. The method goes
as follows: Suppose A\ma is a structure and H is a group of
permutations on A. A subset B of AnA^n is called
symmetric if there is a finite set E⊆AE\subseteq A, called a
support of B, such that for all π∈H\pi\in H which fix
E
 pointwise[17],
 
∀x1…∀xn((x1,…,xn)∈B→(π(x1),…,π(xn))∈B).\forall x_1\ldots\forall x_n((x_1,\ldots, x_n)\in B\to (\pi(x_1),\ldots, \pi(x_n))\in B).


The respective condition for a function f:An→Af:A^n\to A is 
∀x1…∀xn((x1,…,xn)∈B→f(π(x1),…,π(xn))∈B∧f(π(x1),…,π(xn))=π(f(x1,…,xn)))
\forall x_1\ldots\forall x_n ((x_1,\ldots ,x_n) \in B
\to  f(\pi(x_1), \ldots ,\pi(x_n)) \in B  \land {}\\
f(\pi(x_1),\ldots ,\pi(x_n)) = \pi (f (x_1,\ldots ,x_n
)))


Let G\G be the set of symmetric relations and functions on
A. The pair (A,G)(\ma,\G) is always a Henkin model.

Among the early applications of the Fraenkel-Mostowski method were the
result of Mostowski (1938) that one cannot prove from the
Comprehension Axiom Schema alone the equivalence of two different
definitions of finiteness and of Lindenbaum and Mostowski (1938) that
Zermelo's axioms for set theory are not enough to prove the Axiom of
Choice, or even just that every infinite set is the disjoint union of
two infinite sets.

The Fraenkel model arises if H is the group of all
permutations of an infinite set A. In the Freankel model the
set A is infinite but Dedekind-finite (i.e., A has no
one-one function into a proper subset) and cannot be well-ordered, not
even linearly ordered. Moreover, the set A is not the disjoint
union of two infinite sets. There is no choice function for two
element subsets of A.

The Mostowski model arises if A=QA=\oQ and H is the
group of automorphisms of (Q,<)(\oQ,&lt;). In the Mostowski model the
set A can be linearly ordered but not well-ordered. The Axiom
of Choice holds for (sets of) non-empty finite sets.

For more on Fraenkel-Mostowski models as Henkin models for
second-order logic, see Gaßner (1994).

9.2 Axioms of infinity

The axioms of second-order logic are trivially true in a (full) model
with just one element. This raises the question how to guarantee that
there are more than one element in the domain. Of course, we can add,
for every n, an axiom which says that there are more than
n elements. There are various ways to say in second-order logic
with one axiom that there are infinitely many
individuals. These are equivalent in full models but may be
non-equivalent in Henkin models. Some are equivalent if the Axiom of
Choice is assumed. Let us call a second-order sentence ϕ\phi of the
empty vocabulary an Axiom of Infinity if 
A⊨ϕ if and only if A is infinite.\ma\models\phi\text{ if and only if $A$ is infinite}.


An axiom of infinity can say in second-order logic that a proper
subset of the domain has the same cardinality as the entire domain
(i.e., that the domain is not Dedekind-finite), or that there is a
partial order without a maximal element, or that there is a set with a
unary function and a constant which constitute a structure isomorphic
to (N,s,0)(\oN,s,0), or that the domain is the union of two disjoint sets
which have the same cardinality as the domain, and so on. As is the
case in set theory without the Axiom of Choice, the different
formulations of infiniteness need not be equivalent. In second-order
logic the situation is even more diffuse because of the variety of
different formulations of the Axiom of Choice. We refer to Asser
(1981) for a discussion of the different variants and to Hasenjaeger
(1961) for a proof that the various non-equivalent forms of Axioms of
Infinity form in a sense a dense set. For a survey of different
concepts of finiteness, see de la Cruz (2002).


10. Categoricity

A theory in second (or first) order logic is said to be
categorical if any two of its models are isomorphic. A single
sentence (which has a model) is categorical if and only if it
characterizes some model up to isomorphism (see
 §7.1).
 A nice property of a categorical theory Γ\Gamma is (semantic)
completeness: Any sentence ϕ\phi in the language in which
the theory is written is decided by Γ\Gamma in the following sense.
Either every model of Γ\Gamma satisfies ϕ\phi or every model of
Γ\Gamma satisfies ¬ϕ\neg\phi. In other words, either ϕ\phi or
¬ϕ\neg\phi is a (semantic) logical consequence of Γ\Gamma. The
reason is very simple: Γ\Gamma has, up to isomorphism, only one
model M. Since isomorphism preserves truth in second-order
logic, ϕ\phi or ¬ϕ\neg\phi is a (semantic) logical consequence of
Γ\Gamma according to whether ϕ\phi is true in M or false
in M.

If ϕ\phi is a second-order sentence we defined above Mod(ϕ)\Mod(\phi)
as the class {M:M⊨ϕ}\{\mm : \mm\models\phi\}. If ϕ\phi characterizes
M\mm up to isomorphism, then, up to isomorphism, 
Mod(ϕ)={M}.\Mod(\phi)=\{\mm\}.


The project of axiomatizing mathematical structures with second-order
sentences was so successful in the first quarter of the twentieth
century that Carnap even proposed that every mathematical
structure is determined, up to isomorphism, by its second-order
theory. There are trivial cardinality reasons why this could not
possibly hold for all models of size 2ω2^\omega and larger. There
are simply not enough second-order theories in comparison with the
number of non-isomorphic models. However, the proposal of Carnap is
trivially true for finite models, and not entirely unreasonable for
countable models. In fact Ajtai (1979) showed that it is consistent
with ZFC, provided ZFC itself is consistent, that any two countable
structures in a finite vocabulary that satisfy the same second-order
sentences are isomorphic. Ajtai showed that it is also consistent with
ZFC, provided ZFC itself is consistent, that there are two countable
structures in a finite vocabulary that satisfy the same second-order
sentences without being isomorphic. Thus Carnap’s conjecture
(for countable models) is independent of ZFC.

Solovay has made a posting in FOM (2006
 Other Internet Resources)
 in which he shows that the related statement that every complete
second-order sentence θ\theta is categorical, is independent
of ZFC.

There is a strong form of categoricity which holds for Henkin
structures in important cases and agrees with the usual concept of
categoricity in the case of full Henkin models. It builds on the
remarkable ability of second-order logic to express its own
categoricity. The isomorphism (M,R)≅(M′,R′)(M,R)\cong(M',R') of two structures
(M,R)(M,R) and (M′,R′)(M',R'), where the predicates R and R′R'
are, say, binary, can be expressed in second-order logic as follows,
letting A=(A,M,M′,R,R′)\ma=(A,M,M',R,R'), where A is any set containing
M∪M′M\cup M', M=UAM=U^\ma, M′=U′AM'={U'}^\ma, R=PAR=P^\ma and
R′=P′AR'=P'^\ma. Now 
(M,R)≅(M′,R′)⟺A⊨ISOM(U,P,U′,P′),(M,R)\cong(M',R')\iff\ma\models\isom(U,P,U',P'),


where ISOM(U,P,U′,P′)\isom(U,P,U',P') is the sentence 
∃F[∀x(U(x)→U′(F(x)))∧∀x∃y(U′(x)→(U(y)∧x=F(y)))∧∀x∀y((U(x)∧U(y))→[(F(x)=F(y)→x=y)∧(P(x,y)↔P′(F(x),F(y)))])].
\begin{align}
&amp;\exists F[
\forall x(U(x)\to U'(F(x))) \land {}\\
&amp;\quad  \forall x\,\exists y
(
U'(x)\to 
(
U(y)\land 
x=F(y)
)
) 
 \land {}\\
&amp;\quad\forall x\,\forall y(
(
U(x) \land U(y)) \to {}\\
&amp;\quad[
(F(x)=F(y)\to x=y)   \land {}\\
&amp;\quad(P(x,y)\leftrightarrow P'(F(x),F(y)))
]
)
].
\end{align}


This suggests that the categoricity of a sentence θ(P)\theta(P) with a
binary predicate symbol P can be redefined
 equivalently,[18]
 letting CATEG(θ(P))\categ(\theta(P)) be the sentence 
∀P∀P′∀U∀U′((θ(P)U∧θ(P′)U′)→ISOM(U,P,U′,P′)),\forall P\,\forall P'\,\forall U\,\forall U'\left(\left(\theta(P)^{U}\land\theta(P')^{U'}\right)\to\isom(U,P,U',P')\right),


as 
⊨CATEG(θ(P)).\tag{12}\label{redef}
\models\categ(\theta(P)).


In fact, this is how Tarski defines categoricity in 1956 (page 387).
This leads us to define:


Definition 15 We say that θ(P)\theta(P) is
internally categorical if 
⊢CATEG(θ(P)).\tag{13}\label{internal}
\vdash\categ(\theta(P)).



Internal categoricity could also be called provable
categoricity. The phrase ‘internal categoricity’ was
introduced in the context of arithmetic in Walmsley (2002). It was
advocated more generally in Väänänen (2012), with more
details in Väänänen and Wang (2015). We refer to Button
and Walsh (2016) for a recent discussion on this concept.

Note that (13\ref{internal}) is stronger than (12\ref{redef}) because
provable sentences are certainly valid. Owing to the Completeness
Theorem we can rewrite (13\ref{internal}) as 
(A,G)⊨CATEG(θ(P)) for all Henkin models (A,G).\tag{14}\label{internals}
(\ma,\G)\models\categ(\theta(P))\text{ for all Henkin models $(\ma,\G)$}.


Thus internal categoricity means categoricity not only for ordinary
models, i.e., full Henkin models, but categoricity inside an arbitrary
Henkin model. Note that categoricity is a meta-theoretical concept as
it refers to the semantics of second-order logic. In
CATEG(θ(P))\categ(\theta(P)) the categoricity of θ(P)\theta(P) is written in
the language of second-order logic. That is, the categoricity, despite
being a meta-theoretical concept, is written in the object language.
It can be asked, whether this leads us to a different concept? Be that
as it may, when the meaning of CATEG(θ(P))\categ(\theta(P)) is uncovered by
considering its semantics in the meta-theory, the meaning is the same
as the meaning we give to the categoricity of θ(P)\theta(P). In the
concept of internal categoricity we take advantage of this situation
by switching from semantical meaning to proof-theoretic meaning. We
insist that CATEG(θ(P))\categ(\theta(P)) is (not only valid but even)
provable. Proof-theory requires less meta-theory than semantics. We
can investigate provability of second-order sentences even in number
theory by using numbers to code sentences and proofs, as Gödel
did in his proof of the Incompleteness Theorem. Of course, the
Completeness Theorem brings us back to the semantics.

To verify the categoricity of a second-order sentence one has to go
through infinite structures in a way which essentially calls for set
theory. The situation with internal categoricity is different. To
verify the internal categoricity of a second-order sentence one just
has to produce a proof. So there is a dramatic difference. And still
internal categoricity is stronger than categoricity. So it would be
foolish to establish categoricity if one could establish even internal
categoricity. Fortunately, the classical examples of categorical
sentences are all internally categorical:


Theorem 16 (Väänänen & Wang 2015)
The received second-order sentences characterizing the structures
(N,<)(\oN,&lt;) and (R,<,+,⋅,0,1)(\oR,&lt;,+,\cdot,0,1) are internally
categorical.


The concept of internal categoricity provides a bridge between full
semantics and Henkin semantics. It works in the same way in both cases
and shows that the full semantics is a limit case of Henkin semantics
but does not have a monopoly when it comes to categoricity.

11. Logics Between First and Second Order

First order logic and second-order logic are in a sense two opposite
extremes. There are many logics between them i.e., logics that extend
properly first order logic, and are properly contained in second-order
logic. One example is the extension of first order logic by the
generalized quantifier known as the Henkin quantifier:
(∀x∃y∀u∃v)ϕ(x,y,u,v,z1,…,zn)\left( \begin{array}{cc}
\forall x&amp;\exists y\\
\forall u&amp;\exists v
\end{array}\right)\phi(x,y,u,v,z_1,\ldots,z_n)


which has the meaning 
∃f∃g∀x∀uϕ(x,f(x),u,g(u),z1,…,zn).\exists f\,\exists g\,\forall x\,\forall u\,\phi(x,f(x),u,g(u),z_1,\ldots,z_n).


The extension L(H)L(H) of first order logic by the Henkin quantifier
is almost the same as second-order logic: they have the same
Δ\Delta-extension (Krynicki & Lachlan
 1979).[19]

The equicardinality or Härtig quantifier 
Ixyϕ(x,z1,…,zn)ψ(x,z1,…,zn)Ixy\,\phi(x,z_1,\ldots,z_n)\psi(x,z_1,\ldots,z_n)


has the meaning “there are as many elements x satisfying
ϕ(x,z1,…,zn)\phi(x,z_1,\ldots,z_n) as there are elements y satisfying
ψ(y,z1,…,zn)\psi(y,z_1,\ldots,z_n)”, i.e.,
∃f∀x[(ϕ(x,z1,…,zn)↔ψ(f(x),z1,…,zn))∧∀x∀y(f(x)=f(y)→x=y)∧∀y∃x(ψ(y,z1,…,zn)→f(x)=y)]
\begin{align}
&amp;\exists f\,\forall x[
(\phi(x,z_1,\ldots,z_n)\leftrightarrow\psi(f(x),z_1,\ldots,z_n))
\land {}\\
&amp;\quad\forall x\,\forall y(f(x)=f(y)\to x=y)
\land {}\\
&amp;\quad\forall y\,\exists x(\psi(y,z_1,\ldots,z_n)\to f(x)=y)
]
\end{align}


The extension L(I)L(I) of first order logic by the Härtig
quantifier is
 weaker[20]
 than second-order logic as its Löwenheim number can be
<2ω&lt;2^\omega, but if V=LV=L, then it is Δ\Delta-equivalent
with second-order logic (Väänänen 1980).

Here are some other generalized quantifiers that are clearly
second-order definable:

In weak second-order logic we have no function variables and
the relation variables range over finite relations only. The resulting
logic is in many ways similar to the extension of first order logic by
the generalized quantifier Q0Q_0. Another way to limit the power of
second-order logic is the following: Suppose ψ\psi is a first order
formula with an n-ary relation variable X and no
non-logical symbols. For infinite A, we define A⊨sQψXϕ\ma\models_s
Q_{\psi}X\phi if and only if there is a relation P⊆MnP\subseteq M^n
such that A⊨s(P/X)ϕ∧ψ\ma\models_{s(P/X)}\phi\land\psi. The quantifier
QψQ_{\psi} allows second-order quantification over relations that
satisfies ψ\psi. If ψ\psi is ∀x(x=x)\forall x(x=x) we obtain the
usual second-order quantifier which we denote QIIQ_{II}. If moreover
n=1 n=1 we obtain the monadic second-order quantifier which we denote
QmonQ_{mon}. If n=1n=1 and ψ\psi says that X is a
singleton, we obtain the usual first order quantifier which we now
denote QIQ_I. Finally, if ψ\psi says X is the graph of a
permutation of the model, we denote this quantifier by Q1−1Q_{1-1}.
Rather surprisingly, it turns out that with the right concept of
interpretability the quantifiers QI,Qmon,Q1−1Q_I,Q_{mon},Q_{1-1} and
QIIQ_{II} are, up to biinterpretability, the only
second-order quantifiers of the form QψQ_{\psi} (Shelah 1973).

12. Higher Order Logic vis-à-vis Type Theory

There are many ways to further extend second-order logic. The most
obvious is third, fourth, and so on order logic. The general
principle, already recognized by Tarski (1933 [1956]), is that in
higher order logic one can formalize the semantics—define
truth—of lower order logic. Therefore one certainly gains
expressive power by using higher order logic. Let us take number
theory as an example. With first order logic we can express properties
such as “n is a prime number” and propositions such
as “there are infinitely many prime numbers”,
Fermat’s Last Theorem and Goldbach’s Conjecture. First
order properties of natural numbers fall into a natural hierarchy
called the arithmetical hierarchy the levels of which are
denoted Σ0n\Sigma^0_n and Π0n\Pi^0_n. With second-order logic we can
talk about properties of sets of natural numbers, or in other words,
properties of real numbers. In particular, we can define the
rationals. A continuous function on the real numbers is determined by
its values on rationals. Also, an open set is determined by which
rational points it contains. Using these observations we can talk
about continuous functions and open sets of reals. Basic facts in
calculus, such as Bolzano’s Theorem stating that “If a
continuous function has values of opposite sign inside an interval,
then it has a root in that interval” are expressible in
second-order logic over the structure (N,+,⋅)(\oN,+,\cdot) of natural
numbers. Second-order properties of natural numbers fall into a
natural hierarchy called the analytical hierarchy and its
levels are denoted Σ1n\Sigma^1_n and Π1n\Pi^1_n. With third order
logic we can talk about sets of real numbers. We can write
the Continuum Hypothesis in third order logic and ask the hard
question, whether the model (N,+,⋅)(\oN,+,\cdot) satisfies this sentence.
Third order properties of natural numbers have again a natural
hierarchy and its levels are denoted Σ2n\Sigma^2_n and
Π2n\Pi^2_n.

It is obvious that if we keep a base model, such as (N,+,⋅)(\oN,+,\cdot)
fixed, and move to higher and higher order logic, we can express more
and more complicated concepts and propositions. However,
third order logic over 
N1=(N,+,⋅)\mn_1=(\oN,+,\cdot)


is nothing more than second order logic over 
N2=(P(N),E,N,+,⋅),\mn_2=(\P(\oN),E,\oN,+,\cdot),


where E⊆N×P(N)E\subseteq \oN\times\P(\oN) is the relation nEr⟺n∈rnEr\iff n\in
r, which again is nothing more than first order logic over

N3=(P(P(N))),E′,P(N),E,N,+,⋅),\mn_3=(\P(\P(\oN))),E',\P(\oN),E,\oN,+,\cdot),


where E′⊆P(N)×P(P(N)E'\subseteq \P(\oN)\times\P(\P(\oN) is the relation
rE′X⟺r∈XrE'X\iff r\in X. Moreover, second-order logic over N1\mn_1 is
nothing more than first order logic over N2\mn_2. When this line of
thought is taken to its limit we can see that first order logic over
the cumulative hierarchy of sets covers higher order logic over any
individual level VαV_\alpha of the hierarchy. In a sense, first
order logic over the cumulative hierarchy of sets is a very very high
order logic over N1\mn_1.

There is a marked similarity in the way N2\mn_2 arises from
N1\mn_1 and in the way N3\mn_3 arises from N2\mn_2. In both
cases we simply add a power set construction on top of what the model
already has. Second-order logic alone is very good with power sets as
we saw in
 §5.3.
 A consequence of this is that all the higher order logics (of any
finite order and up to a point also of infinite order) from
second-order on have Turing-equivalent decision problems and the same
Hanf- and Löwenheim numbers (see
 §4).
 Thus, even though higher than second-order logics are strictly
speaking stronger than second-order logic no difference can be seen by
the usual criteria of strength of expressive power.

Type theory is a systematic approach to higher order logics.
Variables are assigned types just as in second-order logic we have
variables for individual type, relation type and function type. In a
higher order logic it would make sense to have variables for relations
between objects of any lower types as well as functions mapping
objects of lower type to objects of lower type. In set theory objects
have a rank. Elements of a set have a lower rank than the set itself.
However, the difference between set-theoretical rank and typing in
type theory is that in set theory the rank can be computed when the
set is known while in type theory the type of an object can be seen
from the type of the variable that the object is the value of. In a
sense type theory imposes from the syntax a type for each object
considered while in set theory a set has a rank given by the
semantics. Arguably set theory gained dominance over type theory after
the 1930s because of its simpler syntax and semantics. On the other
hand type theory is used in computer science, especially in the theory
of programming languages (see SEP entry on
 type theory).

13. Foundations of Mathematics

Mathematics can be based on set theory. This means that mathematical
objects are construed as sets and their properties are derived from
the axioms of set theory. The intuitive informal picture behind set
theory is that there is a cumulative hierarchy VαV_\alpha
(α\alpha an ordinal) of sets and the axioms are intended to
describe the basic properties of such sets. This kind of set
theoretical foundation of mathematics has become widely accepted among
working mathematicians. We refer to the SEP entry on
 set theory
 for more details. Alternatives to set theory are at least
 category theory,
 constructive mathematics, and second-order logic.

If one tries to follow as a logician the language mathematicians use
in their research, one cannot help seeing that they use second-order
concepts very freely. For example, the Induction Axiom is without
doubt used by mathematicians in the second-order form depicted in
(1\ref{ind}). In their natural language mathematicians do not hesitate
to use higher order concepts, and indeed do not always even (need to)
know the difference.

Second-order logic as a foundation for mathematics focuses on
mathematical structures rather than mathematical
“objects”, as set theory does. In principle every
structure has its own “foundation” based on the special
features of the structure. The role of second-order logic is to
provide a common framework for this. The intuitive informal picture
behind second-order logic on a structure is that there is a domain
A of individuals and then separate domains for all n-ary
relations for all n∈Nn\in\oN and for all n-ary functions for
all n∈Nn\in\oN, associated with A. In comparison to the
informal picture of set theory, we have only the domains of subsets,
relations and functions, not iterations such as sets of sets, sets of
sets of sets and so on, as in set theory. Therefore the intuitive
picture behind second-order logic is simpler than the picture behind
set theory. In particular, there is no transfinite iteration over all
ordinals. Most structures A\ma used in mathematics have a
second-order characterization θA\theta_\ma, see
 §10.
 Proving (second order) properties ϕ\phi of such structures means
deriving ϕ\phi from θA\theta_\ma. Opinions differ as to whether
this derivation should be a syntactic (formal) derivation using some
(incomplete) axiom system of second-order logic or whether it should
be a semantic derivation (of the form “Every model of the
assumptions is a model of the conclusion”). For a working
mathematician there is not much difference and probably a semantic
derivation is usually favored.

Suppose a mathematician wants to convince someone about the truth of
Bolzano’s Theorem “If a continuous function on the reals
has negative values as well as positive values inside an interval,
then it has a root in that interval”. They would start with the
ordered field of real numbers. It would be (thought to be) clear what
this means because the second-order axiomatization of the field is
categorical. Then they would take an arbitrary continuous function
f on this field such that it has values of opposite sign inside
a fixed interval (a,b)(a,b). It would be clear what this means because
second-order logic has variables for functions. Let c,d∈(a,b)c,d\in (a,b)
such that f(c)<0f(c)&lt;0 and f(d)>0f(d)&gt;0. Without loss of generality,
c<dc&lt;d. Let X={e∈(a,b):f(e)<0}X=\{e\in(a,b) : f(e)&lt;0\}. Since we have
relation variables for subsets of the domain, we can think of X
simply as a value of such a relation variable. It is obvious that
X exists, but a priori we could have imposed contradictory
conditions on X (e.g., X={e:e∉X}X=\{e : e\notin X\}) and then we
should not be able to claim that it exists. However, in this case the
Comprehension Axiom Schema implies that X exists. Clearly,
X≠∅X\ne\emptyset and X is bounded from above by d. One
of the second-order axioms characterizing the field of real numbers is
that every non-empty set which is bounded from above has a supremum.
Thus we can let z to be the supremum of X. Now it
follows from basic properties of continuous functions that
f(z)=0f(z)=0.

It would be difficult to tell in the above proof whether it was a
syntactical derivation from the axioms or a semantic argument. On the
surface it looks like a semantic argument. But every step can be
derived from the axioms, so it could be considered a shorthand version
of a syntactic derivation.

Syntactic derivations in second-order logic based on the Comprehension
Axiom Schema and Axioms of Choice are very much like syntactic
derivations in set theory. In neither case would a working
mathematicians write all the details of the argument but would resort
to shorthand notation. In both cases—second-order logic and set
theory—we can interpret the proofs as shorthand versions of
syntactic formal proofs or as semantic proofs. First order logic
satisfies the Completeness Theorem with the help of which semantic
proofs can be turned into syntactic formal proofs. Since the
Completeness Theorem uses the concept of a first order structure,
sentences proved from the axioms are true in all models of the axioms,
both countable models and non-standard models. Are they true in the
intuitive model of cumulative hierarchy of sets? By the Reflection
Theorem such sentences are true in the class of all sets, but since
the intuitive model is informal, we cannot prove that the
class of all sets is the same as the intuitive model.

On the other hand, in order for the Completeness Theorem to be
applicable, a semantic argument has to be such that it works whatever
model of set theory we are using. This means that a semantic argument
in set theory should not use properties of individual models of set
theory unless they are universal first order properties of all models
of ZFC. In practice this means that if a property such as CHCH,
◊\Diamond, 2ℵ0=ℵ22^{\aleph_0}=\aleph_2, and so on, is used, it is
mentioned separately as an assumption. Non-first order properties of
models cannot be used at all, or else the Completeness Theorem cannot
be used. Still, sometimes non-first order properties are
used. For example, we may have an argument that every
countable model of ZFC satisfies ϕ\phi. But then, by the
Downward Löwenheim-Skolem Theorem, every model of ZFC
satisfies ϕ\phi. Thus we have been able to eliminate the non-first
order assumption of the countability of the model.

Second-order logic satisfies the Completeness Theorem if Henkin models
are used. Thus semantic arguments in second-order logic can be turned
into syntactic formal proofs, but as with set theory the semantic
argument has to be valid in all Henkin models, not only in
all of the full Henkin models. Thus, as in set theory, the
semantic argument cannot use properties of the Henkin models that are
not shared by all Henkin models, In particular, fullness (see
 §9.1)
 cannot be assumed because in general models it is not a second-order
property. What happens to categoricity when fullness is abandoned? We
still have internal categoricity, so we can use categoricity in proofs
as long as we make sure we work inside one model. One certain way to
make sure of this is that we base everything on the axioms, the
Comprehension Axiom Schema and the Axioms of Choice.

When second-order logic is used as a foundation for mathematics, a
situation may emerge in which third order logic is needed. For
example, a topology is usually defined as a family of sets
and is therefore a third order object. It would be well in the spirit
of second-order logic to simply include third (or higher) order logic
when needed. Naturally, the Comprehension Axiom Schema and the Axioms
of Choice have to be then assumed for third order quantifiers.

We have devoted a fair amount of space in this entry to the power of
second-order logic to characterize structures (see
 §7.1).
 Putting it briefly, if a structure has mathematical interest, it is
second-order characterizable. Structures constructed by means of the
Axiom of Choice may escape being second-order characterizable. But
what is the power of second-order logic to demonstrate the
existence of structures? The axioms, including the
Comprehension Axioms and the Axioms of Choice, can be satisfied in a
one element domain. So we cannot prove from the axioms that
there are any structures of any size >1&gt;1. This undermines
Quine’s characterization of second-order logic as “set
theory in sheep’s clothing” (1970, section heading in
chapter 5), meant probably to suggest that the ontological commitments
of second-order logic are on the same level as those of set
theory.

Perhaps the philosophy of second-order logic is that if a structure
can be characterized, it exists, echoing Hilbert’s formalist
philosophy. However, even in that sense we need to know that the
characterizing sentence θA\theta_\ma is consistent. A trivial
approach is to observe that A\ma itself certainly satisfies
θA\theta_\ma, but this clearly begs the question. Still, this is how
Hilbert argues for the consistency of his axioms for the real numbers
(1900). If A=(N,+,⋅)\ma=(\oN,+,\cdot), an Axiom of Infinity saying that
that a proper subset of the domain has the same cardinality as the
entire domain, is what is needed. In combination with the
Comprehension Axiom Schema the existence of A\ma follows. For
(R,+,⋅,0,1)(\oR,+,\cdot,0,1) this is not enough, we need a stronger Axiom of
Infinity, for example the existence of a dense order which satisfies
the Completeness Axiom: Every bounded non-empty set has a supremum. It
seems inevitable that when we move from a structure to a bigger
structure we need to make a largeness assumption. Such assumptions are
called Large Domain Assumptions in Väänänen (2012). In
set theory this aspect is taken care of at the outset by assuming the
Power Set Axiom and the Replacement Axioms which together make sure
that there are large enough sets. In second-order logic we have to
assume new and new Large Domain Assumptions, as we move along. This
can be seen as a drawback, having to make new assumptions all the
time. On the other hand it can be seen as an asset, not having to make
too ambitious assumptions before they are really needed.

14. Second-Order Arithmetic

Owing to the central role that real numbers play in mathematics, the
second-order theory of natural numbers, known as second-order
arithmetic (Simpson 1999 [2009]), and denoted Z2Z_2, is an
important foundational theory. It is stronger than (first order) Peano
arithmetic but weaker than set theory. It has variables for
individuals thought of as natural numbers as well as variables for
sets of natural numbers thought of as real numbers. In addition there
are ++ and ×\times for arithmetic operations on the individuals.
As axioms Z2Z_2 has some rather obvious axioms about ++ and
×\times, the Induction Axiom (1\ref{ind}), and the axioms of
second-order logic, including the Comprehension Principles (10\ref{CA}).
A surprising amount of mathematics can be derived in Z2Z_2. We refer
to Simpson (1999 [2009]) for details. In a sense, Z2Z_2 is a great
success story for second-order logic.

Reverse mathematics uses Z2Z_2 to isolate the exact axioms
on which well-known theorems from mathematics rely. In a textbook such
theorems are proved perhaps in an informal set theory, but how much
set theory is actually needed in each case? For example, we may ask
what is the weakest set of axioms from which the Bolzano-Weierstrass
 Theorem[21]
 can be proved? How much set theory, comprehension, choice, induction,
etc is needed? Since Z2Z_2 is a natural and sufficient environment
for many mathematical theorems, it is an appropriate framework for
answering questions raised by the reverse mathematics program. The
main (but not the only) distinctions that are made in reverse
mathematics concern the amount of the Comprehension Principle that is
needed in proving this or that mathematical result. In particular, the
role of Arithmetic and Π11\Pi^1_1-Comprehension Principles is
clarified. The basic theory of real numbers can be developed on the
basis of Arithmetic Comprehension only, but proofs relying on the
notion of a countable ordinal require the Π11\Pi^1_1-Comprehension
Principle. Again, we refer to Simpson (1999 [2009]) for details.

15. Second-Order Set Theory

We have up to now treated set theory (ZFC) as a first order theory.
However, when Zermelo (1930) introduced the axioms which constitute
the modern ZFC axiom system, he formulated the axioms in second-order
logic. In particular, his Separation Axiom is 
∀x∀X∃y∀z(z∈Y↔(z∈x∧X(z)))\forall x\,\forall X\,\exists y\,\forall z(z\in Y\leftrightarrow (z\in x\land X(z)))


and the Replacement Axiom is 
∀x∀F∃y∀z(z∈y↔∃u(u∈x∧z=F(u))).\forall x\,\forall F\,\exists y\,\forall z(z\in y\leftrightarrow\exists u(u\in x\land z=F(u))).


Second-order ZFC, ZFC2\ZFC^2, is simply the received first order ZFC
with the Separation Schema replaced by the above single Separation
Axiom, and the Replacement Schema replaced by the above single
Replacement Axiom. Accordingly, ZFC2\ZFC^2 is a finite axiom system.
Zermelo proved that the models of ZFC2\ZFC^2 are, up to isomorphism,
of the form (Vκ,∈)(V_\kappa,\in), where κ\kappa is (strongly)
inaccessible >ω&gt;\omega.

Kreisel (1967) has pointed out that second-order set theory in a sense
decides the CH, i.e., decides whether it is true or not, even if we do
not know which way the decision goes. More exactly ZFC2⊨CH\ZFC^2\models
CH or ZFC2⊨¬CH\ZFC^2\models \neg CH, because CHCH is true if and only
if Vκ⊨CHV_\kappa\models CH for inaccessible κ\kappa, i.e., if and
only if ZFC2⊨CH\ZFC^2\models CH. Of course we can express CH in first
order set theory, too, so the situation is not really different from
first order set theory. Many set theorists think that the concept of
set is definitive enough to decide eventually also CH even if ZFC does
not decide it. Likewise, we may argue that the concept of second-order
semantics is definitive enough to decide CH even if the current axioms
of second-order logic cannot do it.

The question arises, why do we not use second-order set theory
ZFC2\ZFC^2 as the metatheory of second-order logic, as recommended in
Shapiro (1991). In fact we could use it. However, the question might
rise, what is the semantics of our metatheory? In principle such
questions can lead to an infinite regress. By using first order set
theory as the metatheory, the question about the semantics of the
metatheory would simply be the question about the semantics of first
order logic. We have pointed out in
 §6
 that semantics of first order logic is absolute relative to ZFC. This
gives some assurance that we need not continue asking, what the
metatheory is.

16. Finite Model Theory

The rise of mathematical logic in the first half of the twentieth
century was interwoven with different approaches to understanding the
infinite structures of the natural and the real numbers. With the
emergence of computer science in the second half of the twentieth
century logic went through a process of rebirth. The concepts of a
computation and of a database both emphasized the need to understand
not so much the finite/infinite distinction as the new measures of
degrees of finiteness. For example, the question whether a problem can
be decided in polynomial time arose to challenge the well-developed
theory of what can be decided in finite time. The analogy between
finite relational structures and databases led to the emergence of
finite model theory. For a good review we refer to Fagin
(1993).

In the context of finite models second-order logic does not suffer
from the same philosophical problems as in the context of infinite
models. It is just one language among many others. One of the early
successes was the result of Fagin (1974) to the effect that classes of
models definable in existential second-order logic, i.e., in the
Σ11\Sigma^1_1-fragment, are exactly those that are NP, i.e., that can
be recognized by a non-deterministic Turing machine running in time
which is polynomial in the size of the encoding of the model as a
binary sequence. The question whether NP is closed under complements
is notoriously open. From the point of view of second-order logic this
is surprising because on all models, finite or infinite,
Σ11\Sigma^1_1 is of course not closed under complements. For example,
the class of infinite models (in the empty vocabulary) is
Σ11\Sigma^1_1 but not Π11\Pi^1_1. Also, the class of well-orders is
Π11\Pi^1_1 but not Σ11\Sigma^1_1. Therefore the following early
result about second-order logic on finite models was remarkable. Here
MON-Σ11\mon\Sigma^1_1 refers to Σ11\Sigma^1_1 in monadic second-order
logic, similarly MON-Π11\mon\Pi^1_1.


Theorem 17 (Fagin 1975) Connectivity of graphs is not
definable in MON-Σ11\mon\Sigma^1_1. Hence
MON-Σ11≠MON-Π11\mon\Sigma^1_1\ne\mon\Pi^1_1.


This has subsequently been extended to graphs with certain other
structure present, see Fagin, Stockmeyer, and Vardi (1995). The proofs
use the Ehrenfeucht-Fraïssé games (see
 §3.1)
 and their elaborations.

Let Σ11,m\Sigma^1_{1,m} denote the class of Σ11\Sigma^1_1-formulas
∃X1…∃Xkϕ\exists X_1\ldots\exists X_k\phi, where the bound second-order
variables XiX_i are at most m-ary and ϕ\phi is first
order. Similarly Π11,m\Pi^1_{1,m} and Δ11,m\Delta^1_{1,m}.


Theorem 18 (Ajtai 1983) The property of a finite
structure (A,R)(A,R), where R is n+1n+1-ary, of |R||R| being
even, is Δ11,n+1\Delta^1_{1,n+1} but not Σ11,n\Sigma^1_{1,n} or
Π11,n\Pi^1_{1,n}.


This highly non-trivial theorem is one of the corner stones of the
study of second-order logic on finite structures. We do not know
whether Δ11\Delta^1_1 is different from Σ11\Sigma^1_1 on finite
structures, but the above theorem gives an arity-based hierarchy
result inside Δ11\Delta^1_1.
