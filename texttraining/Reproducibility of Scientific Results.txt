The terms “reproducibility crisis” and “replication
crisis” gained currency in conversation and in print over the
last decade (e.g., Pashler & Wagenmakers 2012), as disappointing
results emerged from large scale reproducibility projects in various
medical, life and behavioural sciences (e.g., Open Science
Collaboration, OSC 2015). In 2016, a poll conducted by the journal
Nature reported that more than half (52%) of scientists
surveyed believed science was facing a “replication
crisis” (Baker 2016). More recently, some authors have moved to
more positive terms for describing this episode in science; for
example, Vazire (2018) refers instead to a “credibility
revolution” highlighting the improved methods and open science
practices it has motivated.

The crisis often refers collectively to at least the following things:


 the virtual absence of replication studies in the published
literature in many scientific fields (e.g., Makel, Plucker, &
Hegarty 2012), 
widespread failure to reproduce results of published studies in
large systematic replication projects (e.g., OSC 2015; Begley &
Ellis 2012), 
evidence of publication bias (Fanelli 2010a), 
a high prevalence of “questionable research
practices”, which inflate the rate of false positives in the
literature (Simmons, Nelson, & Simonsohn 2011; John, Loewenstein,
& Prelec 2012; Agnoli et al. 2017; Fraser et al. 2018), and 
the documented lack of transparency and completeness in the
reporting of methods, data and analysis in scientific publication
(Bakker & Wicherts 2011; Nuijten et al. 2016). 


The associated open science reform movement aims to rectify conditions
that led to the crisis. This is done by promoting activities such as
data sharing and public pre-registration of studies, and by advocating
stricter editorial policies around statistical reporting including
publishing replication studies and statistically non-significant
results.

This review consists of four distinct parts. First, we look at the
term “reproducibility” and related terms like
“repeatability” and “replication”, presenting
some definitions and conceptual discussion about the epistemic
function of different types of replication studies. Second, we
describe the meta-science research that has established and
characterised the reproducibility crisis, including large scale
replication projects and surveys of questionable research practices in
various scientific communities. Third, we look at attempts to address
epistemological questions about the limitations of replication, and
what value it holds for scientific inquiry and the accumulation of
knowledge. The fourth and final part describes some of the many
initiatives the open science reform movement has proposed (and in many
cases implemented) to improve reproducibility in science. In addition,
we reflect there on the values and norms which those reforms embody,
noting their relevance to the debate about the role of values in the
philosophy of science.
 
1. Replicating, Repeating, and Reproducing Scientific Results

A starting point in any philosophical exploration of reproducibility
and related notions is to consider the conceptual question of what
such notions mean. According to some (e.g., Cartwright 1991), the
terms “replication”, “reproduction” and
“repetition” denote distinct concepts, while others use
these terms interchangeably (e.g., Atmanspacher & Maasen 2016a).
Different disciplines can have different understandings of these terms
too. In computational disciplines, for example,
reproducibility often refers to the ability to reproduce
computations alone, that is, it relates exclusively to sharing and
sufficiently annotating data and code (e.g., Peng 2011, 2015). In
those disciplines, replication describes the redoing of whole
experiments (Barba 2017, Other Internet Resources). In psychology and
other social and life
sciences, however, reproducibility may refer to either the
redoing of computations, or the redoing of experiments. The
Reproducibility Projects, coordinated by the Center for Open Science,
redo entire studies, data collection and analysis. A recent funding
program announcement by DARPA (US Defense Advanced Research Programs
Agency) distinguished between reproducibility and replicability, where
the former refers to computational reproducibility and the latter to
the redoing of experiments. Here we use all three
terms—“replication”, “reproduction” and
“repetition”—interchangeably, unless explicitly
describing the distinctions of other authors.

When describing a study as “replicable”, people could have
in mind either of at least two different things. The first is that the
study is replicable in principle the sense that it can be
carried out again, particularly when its methods, procedures and
analysis are described in a sufficiently detailed and transparent way.
The second is that the study is replicable in that sense that it can
be carried out again and, when this happens, the replication study
will successfully produce the same or sufficiently
similar results as the original. A study may be replicable in the
former sense but not in the second sense: one might be able to
replicate the methods, procedures and analysis of a study, but fail to
successfully replicate the results of the original study. Similarly,
when people talk of a “replication”, they could also have
in mind two different things: the replication of the methods,
procedures and analysis of a study (irrespective of the results) or,
alternatively, the replication of such methods, procedures and
analysis as well as the results.

Arguably, most typologies of replication make more or less
fine-grained distinctions between direct replication (which
closely follow the original study to verify results) and
conceptual replications (which deliberately alter important
features of the study to generalize findings or to test the underlying
hypothesis in a new way). As suggested, this distinction may not
always be known by these terms. For example, roughly the same
distinction is referred to as exact and inexact
replication by Keppel (1982); concrete and
conceptual replication by Sargent (1981), and literal,
operational and constructive replication by Lykken (1968).
Computational reproducibility is most often direct (reproducing
particular analysis outcomes from the same data set using the same
code and software), but it can also be conceptual (analysing the same
raw data set with alternative approaches, different models or
statistical frameworks). For an example of a conceptual computational
reproducibility study, see Silberzahn and Uhlmann 2015.

We do not attempt to resolve these disciplinary differences or to
create a new typology of replication, and instead we will provide a
limited snapshot of the conceptual terrain by surveying three existing
typologies—from Stefan Schmidt (2009), from Omar Gómez,
Natalia Juristo, and Sira Vegas (2010) and from Hans Radder.
Schmidt’s account has been influential and widely-cited in
psychology and social sciences, where the replication crisis
literature is heavily concentrated. Gómez, Juristo, and
Vegas’s (2010) typology of replication is based on a
multidisciplinary survey of over 18 scholarly classifications of
replication studies which collectively contain more than 79 types of
replication. Finally, Radder’s (1996, 2003, 2006, 2009, 2012)
typology is perhaps best known within philosophy of science
itself.
1.1 An Account from the Social Sciences

Schmidt outlines five functions of replication studies in the social
sciences:

Function 1. Controlling for sampling
error—that is, to verify that previous results in a sample were
not obtained purely by chance outcomes which paint a distorted picture
of reality
Function 2. Controlling for artifacts
(internal validity)—that is, ensuring that experimental results
are a proper test of the hypothesis (i.e., have internal validity) and
do not reflect unintended flaws in the study design (such as when a
measurement result is, say, an artifact of a faulty thermometer rather
than an actual change in a substance’s temperature)
Function 3. Controlling for fraud,
Function 4. Enabling
generalizability,
Function 5. Enabling verification of the
underlying hypothesis.


Modifying Hendrik’s (1991) classes of variables that define a
research space, Schmidt (2009) presents four classes of variables
which may be altered or held constant in order for a given replication
study to fulfil one of the above functions. The four classes are:

Class 1. Information conveyed to
participants (for example, their task instructions).
Class 2. Context and background. This is a
large class of variables, and it includes: participant characteristics
(e.g., age, gender, specific history); the physical setting of the
research; characteristics of the experimenter; incidental
characteristics of materials (e.g., type of font, colour of the
room),
Class 3. Participant recruitment, including
selection of participants and allocation to conditions (such as
experimental or control conditions),
Class 4. Dependent variable measures (or in
Schmidt’s terms “procedures for the constitution of the
dependent variable”, 2009: 93)


Schmidt then systematically works through examples of how each
function can be achieved by altering and/or holding a different class
or classes of variable constant. For example, to fulfil the function
of controlling for sampling error
 (Function 1),
 one should alter only variables regarding participant recruitment
(Class 3), attempting to keep variables in all other classes as close
to the original study as possible. To control for artefacts
 (Function 2),
 one should alter variables concerning the context and dependent
variable measures (variables in Classes 2 and 4 respectively), but
keep variables in 1 and 3 (information conveyed to participants and
participant recruitment) as close to the original as possible.
Schmidt, like most other authors in this area, acknowledges the
practical limits of being able to hold all else constant. Controlling
for fraud
 (Function 3)
 is served by the same arrangements as controlling for artefacts
 (Function 2).
 In Schmidt’s account, controlling for sampling error, artefacts
and fraud (Functions 1 to 3) are connected by a theme of confirming
the results of the original study. Functions 4 and 5 go beyond
this—generalizing to new populations
 (Function 4)
 which is served by changes to participant recruitment (Class 3) and
confirming the underlying hypothesis
 (Function 5),
 which served by changes to the information conveyed, the context and
dependant variable measures (Classes 1, 2 and 4 respectively) but not
changes to participant recruitment (Class 3, although Schmidt
acknowledges that holding the latter class of variables constant
whilst varying everything else is often practically impossible).
Attempts to enable verification of the underlying research hypothesis
(i.e., to fulfil Function 5) alone are what Schmidt classifies as
conceptual replications, following Rosenthal (1991). Attempts
to fulfil the other four functions are considered variants of
direct replications.

In summary, for Schmidt, direct replications control for sampling
error, artifacts, and fraud, and provide information about the
reliability and validity of prior empirical work. Conceptual
replications help corroborate the underlying theory or substantive (as
opposed to statistical) hypothesis in question and the extent to which
they generalize in new circumstances and situations. In practice,
direct and conceptual replications lie on a continuum, with
replication studies varying more or less compared to the original on
potentially a great number of dimensions.
1.2 An Interdisciplinary Account

Gómez, Juristo, and Vega’s (2010) survey of the
literature in 18 disciplines identified 79 types of replication, not
all of which they considered entirely distinct. They identify five
main ways in which a replication study may diverge from an initial
study. With some similarities to Schimdt’s four classes
above:

The site or spatial location of the
replication experiment: replication experiments may be conducted in a
location that is or is not the same as the site of the initial
study.
The experimenters conducting a replication may
be exclusively the same as the original, exclusively different, or a
combination of new and original experimenters
The apparatus, including the design,
materials, instruments and other important experimental objects and/or
procedures may vary between original and replication studies.
The operationalisations employed may differ,
where operationalisation refers to measurement of variables. For
example, in psychology this might include using two different scales
measuring for depression (as a dependent variable).
Finally, studies may vary on population
properties.


A change in any one or combination of these elements in a replication
study corresponds to different purposes underlying the study, and
thereby establishes a different kind of validity. Like Schmidt et al.
then systematically work through how changes to each of the above work
to fulfil different epistemic functions.

Function 1. Conclusion Validity and
Controlling for Sampling Error: If each of the five elements
above are unchanged in a replication study, then the purpose of the
replication is to control for sampling error, that is, to
verify that previous results in a sample were not obtained purely by
chance outcomes which make the sample misleading or unrepresentative.
This provides a safeguard against what is known as a type I
error: incorrectly failing to reject the null hypothesis
(that is, the hypothesis that there is no relationship between two
phenomena under investigation). These studies establish conclusion
validity, that is, the credibility or believability of an
observed relationship or phenomenon.
Function 2. Internal Validity and Controlling
for Artefactual Results: If a replication study differs with
respect to the site, experimenters or apparatus, then its purpose is
to establish that previously observed results are not an artefact of a
particular apparatus, lab or so on. These studies establish
internal validity, that is, the extent to which results can
be attributed to the experimental manipulation itself rather than to
extraneous variables.
Function 3. Construct Validity and Determining
Limits for Operationalizations: If a replication study differs
with respect to operationalisations, then its purpose is to determine
the extent to which the effect generalizes across measures of
manipulated or dependent variables (e.g., the extent to which the
effect does not depend on the particular psychometric test one uses to
evaluate depression or IQ). Such studies fulfil the function of
establishing construct validity in that they provide evidence
that the effect holds across different ways of measuring the
constructs.
Function 4. External Validity and Determining
Limits in the Population Properties: If a replication study
differs with respect to its population properties, then its purpose is
to ascertain the extent to which the results are generalizable to
different populations, populations which, in Gómez, Juristo,
and Vegas’s view, concern subjects and experimental objects such
as programs. Such studies reinforce external
validity—the extent to which the results are generalizable
to different populations.

1.3 A Philosophical Account

Radder (1996, 2003, 2006, 2009, 2012) distinguishes three types of
reproducibility. One is the reproducibility of what Radder calls an
experiment’s material realization. Using one of
Radder’s own examples as an illustration, two people may carry
out the same actions to measure the mass of an object. Despite doing
the same actions, person A regards themselves as measuring the
object’s Newtonian mass while person B regards themselves
as measuring the object’s Einsteinian mass. Here, then, the
actions or material realization of the experimental procedure can be
reproduced, but the theoretical descriptions of their significance
differ. Radder, however, does not specify what is required for one
material realisation to be a reproduction of another, a pertinent
question, especially since, as Radder himself affirms, no reproduction
will be exactly the same as any other reproduction (1996:
82–83).

A second type of reproducibility is the reproducibility of an
experiment, given a fixed theoretical description. For
example, a social scientist might conduct two experiments to examine
social conformity. In one experiment, a young child might be
instructed to give an answer to a question before a group of other
children who are, unknown to the former child, instructed to give
wrong answers to the same question. In another experiment, an adult
might be instructed to give an answer to a question before a group of
other adults who are, unknown to the former adult, instructed to give
wrong answers to the same question. If the child and the adult give a
wrong answer that conforms to the answers of others, then the social
scientist might interpret the result as exemplifying social
conformity. For Radder, the theoretical description of the experiment
might be fixed, specifying that if some people in a
participant’s surroundings give intentionally false answers to
the question, then the genuine participant will conform to the
behaviour of their peers. However, the material realization of these
experiments differs insofar as one concerns children and the other
adults. It is difficult to see how, in this example at least, this
differs from what either Schmidt or Gómez, Juristo, and Vegas
would refer to as establishing generalizability to a different
population (Schmidt’s [2009]
 Class 3
 and
 Function 5;
 Gómez, Juristo, and Vegas’s [2010]
 way 5
 and
 Function 4).

The third kind of reproducibility is what Radder calls
replicability. This is where experimental procedures differ
to produce the same experimental result (otherwise known as a
successful replication). For example, Radder notes that multiple
experiments might obtain the result “a fluid of type f
has a boiling point b”, despite having different kinds of
thermometers by which to measure this boiling point (2006:
113–114).

Schmidt (2009) points out that the difference between Radder’s
second and third types of reproducibility is small in comparison to
their differences to the first type. He consequently suggests his
alternative distinction between direct and conceptual replication,
presumably intending a conceptual replication to cover Radder’s
second and third types.

In summary, whilst Gómez, Juristo, and Vegas’s typology
draws distinctions in slightly different places to Schmidt’s,
its purpose is arguably the same—to explain what types of
alterations in replication studies fulfil different scientific goals,
such as establishing internal validity or the extent of generalization
and so on. With the exception of his discussion of reproducing the
material realization, Radder’s other two categories can perhaps
be seen as fitting within the larger range of functions described by
Schmidt and Gómez et al., who both acknowledge that in
practice, direct and conceptual replications lie on a noisy continuum.

2. Meta-Science: Establishing, Monitoring, and Evaluating the Reproducibility Crisis

In psychology, the origin of the reproducibility crisis is often
linked to Daryl Bem’s (2011) paper which reported empirical
evidence for the existence of “psi”, otherwise known as
Extra Sensory Perception (ESP). This paper passed through the standard
peer review process and was published in the high impact Journal
of Personality and Social Psychology. The controversial nature of
the findings inspired three independent replication studies, each of
which failed to reproduce Bem’s results. However, these
replication studies were rejected from four different journals,
including the journal that had originally published Bem’s study,
on the grounds that the replications were not original or novel
research. They were eventually published in PLoS ONE
(Ritchie, Wiseman, & French 2012). This created controversy in the
field, and was interpreted by many as demonstrating how publication
bias impeded science’s self-correction mechanism. In medicine,
the origin of the crisis is often attributed to Ioannidis’
(2005) paper “Why most published findings are false”. The
paper offered formal arguments about inflated rates of false positives
in the literature—where a “false positive” result
claims a relationship exists between phenomena when it in fact does
not (e.g., a claim that consuming a drug is correlated with symptom
relief when it in fact is not). Ioannidis’ (2005) also reported
very low (11%) empirical reproducibility rates from a set of
pre-clinical trial replications at Amgen, later independently
published by Begley and Ellis (2012). In all disciplines, the
replication crisis is also more generally linked to earlier criticisms
of Null Hypothesis Significance Testing (e.g., Szucs & Ioannidis
2017), which pointed out the neglect of statistical power (e.g., Cohen
1962, 1994) and a failure to adequately distinguish statistical and
substantive hypotheses (e.g., Meehl 1967, 1978). This is discussed
further below.

In response to the events above, a new field identifying as
meta-science (or meta-research) has become
established over the last decade (Munafò et al. 2017).
Munafò et al. define meta-science as “the scientific
study of science itself” (2017: 1). In October 2015, Ioannidis,
Fanelli, Dunne, and Goodman identified over 800 meta-science papers
published in the five-month period from January to May that year, and
estimated that the relevant literature was accruing at the rate of
approximately 2,000 papers each year. Referring to the same bodies of
work with slightly different terms, Ioannidis et al. define
“meta-research” as 


an evolving scientific discipline that aims to evaluate and improve
research practices. It includes thematic areas of methods, reporting,
reproducibility, evaluation, and incentives (how to do, report,
verify, correct, and reward science). (2015: 1) 


Multiple research centres dedicated to this work now exist, including,
for example, the Tilburg University Meta-Research Center in
psychology, the Meta-Research Innovation Center at Stanford (METRICS),
and others listed in Ioannidis et al. 2015 (see
 Other Internet Resources).
 Relevant research in medical fields is also covered in Stegenga
2018.

Projects that self-identify as meta-science or meta-research
include:

Large, crowd-sourced, direct (or close) replication projects such
as The Reproducibility Projects in Psychology (OSC 2015) and Cancer
Biology (Errington et al. 2014) and the Many Labs projects in
psychology (e.g., Klein et al. 2014);
Computational reproducibility projects, that is, redoing analysis
using the same original data set (e.g., Chang & Li 2015);
Bibliographic studies documenting the extent of publication bias
in different scientific fields and changes over time (e.g., Fanelli
2010a, 2010b, 2012);
Surveys of the use of Questionable Research Practices (QRPs)
amongst researchers and their impact on the publication literature
(e.g., John, Loewenstein, & Prelec 2012; Fiedler & Schwarz
2016; Agnoli et al. 2017; Fraser et al. 2018);
Surveys of the completeness, correctness and transparency of
methods and analysis reporting in scientific journals (e.g., Nuijten
et al. 2016; Bakker & Wicherts 2011; Cumming et al. 2007; Fidler
et al. 2006);
Survey and interview studies of researchers’ understanding
of core methodological and statistical concepts, and real and
perceived obstacles to improving practices (Bakker et al. 2016;
Washburn et al. 2018; Allen, Dorozenko, & Roberts 2016);
Evaluation of incentives to change behaviour, thereby improving
reproducibility and encouraging more open practices (e.g., Kidwell et
al. 2016).

2.1 Reproducibility Projects

The most well known of these projects is undoubtedly the
Reproducibility Project: Psychology, coordinated by the now Center for
Open Science in Charlottesville, VA (then the Open Science
Collaboration). It involved 270 crowd sourced researchers in 64
different institutions in 11 different countries. Researchers
attempted direct replications of 100 studies published in three
leading psychology journals in the year 2008. Each study was
replicated only once. Replications attempted to follow original
protocols as closely as possible, though some differences were
unavoidable (e.g., some replication studies were done with European
samples when the original studies used US samples). In almost all
cases, replication studies used larger sample sizes that the original
studies and therefore had greater statistical power—that is, a
greater probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis (i.e.,
that no relationship exists) when the hypothesis is false. A number of
measures of reproducibility were reported:

The proportion of studies in which there was a match in the
statistical significance between original and replication. (Here, the
statistical significance of a result is the probability that it would
occur given the null hypothesis, and p values are common
measures of such probabilities. A replication study and an original
study would have a match in statistical significance if, for example,
they both specified that the probability of the original and
replication results occurring given the null hypothesis is less than
5%—i.e., if the p values for results in both studies are
below 0.05.) Thirty nine percent (36%) of results were successful
reproduced according to this measure.
The proportion of studies in which the Effect Size (ES) of the
replication study fell within the 95% Confidence Interval (CI) of the
original. (Here, an ES represents the strength of a relationship
between phenomena—a toy example of which is how strongly
consumption of a drug is correlated with symptom relief—and a
Confidence Interval provides some indication of the probability that
the ES of the replication study is close to the ES of the original
study.) Forty seven percent (47%) of results were successfully
reproduced according to this measure.
The correlation between original ES and replication ES.
Replication study ESs were roughly half the size of original ESs.
The proportion of studies for which subjective ratings by
independent researchers indicated a match between the replication and
the original. Thirty nine percent (39%) were considered successful
reproductions according to this measure. The closeness of this figure
to measure 1 suggests that raters relied very heavily on p
values in making their judgements.


There have been objections to the implementation and interpretation of
this project, most notably by Gilbert et al. (2016), who took issue
with the extent to which the replications studies were indeed direct
replications. For example, Gilbert et al. highlighted 6 specific
examples of “low fidelity protocols”, that is, where
replication studies differed in their view substantially from the
original (in one case, using a European sample rather than a US sample
of participants). However, Anderson et al. (2016) explained in a reply
that in half of those cases, the authors of the original study had
endorsed the replication as being direct or close to on relevant
dimensions and that furthermore, that independently rated similarity
between original and replication studies failed to predict replication
success. Others (e.g., Etz & Vandekerckhove 2016) have applied
Bayesian reanalysis to the OSC’s (2015) data and conclude that
up to 75% (as opposed to the OSC’s 36–47%) of replications
could be considered successful. However, they do note that in many
cases this is only with very weak evidence (i.e., Bayes factors of
<10). They too conclude that the failure to reproduce many effects
is indeed explained by the overestimation of effect sizes, itself a
product of publication bias. A Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology
(also coordinated by the Center for Open Science) is currently
underway (Errington et al. 2014), originally attempting to replicate
50 of the highest impact studies in Cancer Biology published between
2010–2012. This project has recently announced it will complete
with only 18 replication studies, as too few originals reported enough
information to proceed with full replications (Kaiser 2018). Results
of the first 10 studies are reportedly mixed, with only 5 being
considered “mostly repeatable” (Kaiser 2018).

The Many Labs project (Klein et al. 2014) coordinated 36 independent
replications of 13 classic psychology phenomena (from 12 studies, that
is, one study tested two effects), including anchoring, sunk cost bias
and priming, amongst other well-known effects in psychology. In terms
of matching statistical significance, the project demonstrated that 11
out of 13 effects could be successful replicated. It also showed great
variation in many of the effect sizes across the 36 replications.

In biomedical research, there have also been a number of large scale
reproducibility projects. An early one by Begley and Ellis (2012, but
discussed earlier in Ioannidis 2005) attempted to replicate 56
landmark pre-clinical trials and reported an alarming reproducibility
rate of only 11%, that is, only 6 of the 56 results could be
successfully reproduced. Subsequent attempts at large scale
replications in this field have produced more optimistic estimates,
but routinely failed to successfully reproduce more than half of the
published results. Freedman et al. (2015) report five replication
projects by independent groups of researchers which produce
reproducibility estimates ranging from 22% to 49%. They estimate the
cost of irreproducible research in US biomedical science alone to be
in the order of USD$28 billion per year. A reproducibility project in
Experimental Philosophy is an exception to the general trend,
reporting reproducibility rates of 70% (Cova et al. forthcoming).

Finally, the Social Science Replication Project (SSRP) redid 21
experimental social science studies published in the journals Nature
and Science between 2010 and 2015. Depending on the measure taken, the
replication success rate was 57–67% (Camerer et al. 2018).
2.2 Publication Bias, Low Statistical Power and Inflated False Positive Rates

The causes of irreproducible results are largely the same across
disciplines we have mentioned. This is not surprising given that they
stem from problems with statistical methods, publishing practices and
the incentive structures created in a “publish or perish”
research culture, all of which are largely shared, at least in the
life and behavioral sciences.

Whilst replication is often casually referred to as a cornerstone of
the scientific method, direct replication studies (as they might be
understood from Schmidt or Gómez, Juristo, and Vegas’s
typologies above) are a rare event in the published literature of some
scientific disciplines, most notably the life and social sciences. For
example, such replication attempts constitute roughly 1% of the
published psychology literature (Makel, Plucker, & Hegarty 2012).
The proportion in published ecology and evolution literature is even
smaller (Kelly 2017, Other Internet Resources).

This virtual absence of replication studies in the literature can
explained by the fact that many scientific journals have historically
had explicit policies against publishing replication studies (Mahoney
1985)—thus giving rise to a “publication bias”. Over
70% of editors from 79 social science journals said they preferred new
studies over replications and over 90% said they would did not
encourage the submission of replication studies (Neuliep &
Crandall 1990). In addition, many science funding bodies also fund
only “novel”, “original” and/or
“groundbreaking” research (Schmidt 2009).

A second type of publication bias has also played a substantial role
in the reproducibility crisis, namely a bias towards
“statistically significant” or “positive”
results. Unlike the bias against replication studies, this is rarely
an explicitly stated policy of a journal. Publication bias towards
statistically significant findings has a long history, and was first
documented in psychology by Sterling (1959). Developments in text
mining techniques have led to more comprehensive estimates. For
example, Fanelli’s work has demonstrated the extent of
publication bias in various disciplines, and the proportions of
statistically significant results given below are from his 2010a
paper. He has also documented the increase of this bias over time
(2012) and explored the causes of the bias, including the relationship
between publication bias and a publish or perish research culture
(2010b).

In many disciplines (e.g., psychology, psychiatry, materials science,
pharmacology and toxicology, clinical medicine, biology and
biochemistry, economics and business, microbiology and genetics) the
proportion of statistically significant results is very high, close to
or exceeding 90% (Fanelli 2010a). This is despite the fact that in
many of these fields, the average statistical power is low—that
is, the average probability that a study will correctly reject the
null hypothesis is low. For example, in psychology the proportion of
published results that are statistically significant is 92% despite
the fact that the average power of studies in this field to detect
medium effect sizes (arguably typical of the discipline) is roughly
44% (Szucs & Ioannidis 2017). If there was no bias towards
publishing statistically significant results, the proportion of
significant results should roughly match the average statistical power
of the discipline. The excess in statistical significance (in this
case, the difference between 92% and 44%) is therefore an indicator
the strength of the bias. For a second example, in ecology,
environment and plant and animal sciences the proportion of
statistically significant results is 74% and 78% respectively,
admittedly lower than in psychology. However, the most recent estimate
of the statistical power, again of medium effect sizes, of ecology and
animal behaviour is 23–26% (Smith, Hardy, & Gammell 2011)
(An earlier more optimistic assessment was 40–47%, Jennions
& Møller, 2003.) For a third example, the proportion of
statistically significant results in neuroscience and behaviour is
85%. Our best estimate of the statistical power in neuroscience is at
best 31%, with a lower bound estimate of 8% (Button et al. 2013). The
associated file-drawer problem (Rosenthal 1979)—where
researchers relegate failed statistically non-significant studies to
their file drawers, hidden from public view—has long been
established in psychology and others disciplines, and is known to lead
to distortions in meta-analysis (where a “meta-analysis”
is a study which analyses results across multiple other studies).
2.3 Questionable Research Practices

In addition to creating the file-drawer problem described above,
publication bias has been held at least partially responsible for the
high prevalence of Questionable Research Practices (QRPs) uncovered in
both self-report survey research (John, Loewenstein, & Prelec
2012; Agnoli 2017 et al. 2017; Fraser
et al. 2018) and in journal studies that have detected, for example,
unusual distributions of p values (Masicampo & Lalande
2012; Hartgerink et al. 2016). Pressure to publish, now ubiquitous
across academic institutions, means that researchers often cannot
afford to simply assign “failed” or statistically
non-significant studies to the file drawer, so instead they p
hack and cherry-pick results (as discussed below) back to
significance, and back into the published literature. Simmons, Nelson,
and Simonsohn (2011) explained and demonstrated with simulated results
how engaging in such practices inflates the false positive error rate
of the published literature, leading to a lower rate of reproducible
results.

“P hacking” refers to a set of practices which
include: checking the statistical significance of results before
deciding whether to collect more data; stopping data collection early
because results have reached statistical significance; deciding
whether to exclude data points (e.g., outliers) only after checking
the impact on statistical significance and not reporting the impact of
the data exclusion; adjusting statistical models, for instance by
including or excluding covariates based on the resulting strength of
the main effect of interest; and rounding of a p value to meet
a statistical significance threshold (e.g., presenting 0.053 as
P < .05). “Cherry picking” includes failing to
report dependent or response variables or relationships that did not
reach statistical significance or other threshold and/or failing to
report conditions or treatments that did not reach statistical
significance or other threshold. “HARKing” (Hypothesising
After Results are Known) includes presenting ad hoc and/or unexpected
findings as though they had been predicted all along (Kerr 1998); and
presenting exploratory work as though it was confirmatory hypothesis
testing (Wagenmakers et al. 2012). Five of the most widespread QRPs
are listed below in Table 1 (from Fraser et al. 2018), with associated
survey measures of prevalence.

2.4 Over-Reliance on Null Hypothesis Significance Testing

Null Hypothesis Significance Testing (NHST)—discussed
above—is a commonly diagnosed cause of the current replication
crisis (see Szucs & Ioannidis 2017). The ubiquitous nature of NHST
in life and behavioural sciences is well documented, most recently by
Cristea and Ioannidis (2018). This is important pre-condition for
establishing its role as a cause, since it could not be a cause if its
actual use was rare. The dichotomous nature of NHST facilitates
publication bias (Meehl 1967, 1978). For example, the language of
accept and reject in hypothesis testing maps conveniently on to
acceptance and rejection of manuscripts, a fact that led Rosnow and
Rosenthal (1989) to decry that “surely God loves the .06 nearly
as much as the .05” (1989: 1277). Techniques that failed to
enshrine a dichotomous threshold would be harder to employ in service
of publication bias. For example, a case has been made that estimation
using effect sizes and confidence intervals (introduced above) would
be less prone to being used in service of publication bias (Cumming
2012, Cumming and Calin-Jageman 2017.

As already mentioned, the average statistical power in various
disciplines is low. Not only is power often low, but it is virtually
never reported; less than 10% of published studies in psychology
report statistical power and even fewer in ecology do (Fidler et al.
2006). Explanations for the widespread neglect of statistical power
often highlight the many common misconceptions and fallacies
associated with p values (e.g., Haller & Krauss 2002;
Gigerenzer 2018). For example, the inverse probability
 fallacy[1]
 has been used to explain why so many researchers fail to calculate
and report statistical power (Oakes 1986).

In 2017, a group of 72 authors proposed in a Nature Human
Behaviour paper that alpha level in statistical significance
testing be lowered to 0.005 (as opposed to the current standard of
0.05) to improve the reproducibility rate of published research
(Benjamin et al. 2018). A reply from a different set of 88 authors was
published in the same journal, arguing against this proposal and
stating instead that researchers should justify their alpha level
based on context (Lakens et al. 2018). Several other replies have
followed, including a call from Andrew Gelman and colleagues to
abandon statistical significance altogether (McShane et al. 2018, 
Other Internet Resources). The
exchange has become known on social media as the Alpha Wars
(e.g., in the Barely Significant blog,
 Other Internet Resources)).
 Independently, the American Statistical Association released a
statement on the use of p values for the first time in its
history, cautioning against their overinterpretation and pointing out
the limits of the information they offer about replication (Wasserman
& Lazar 2016) and devoted their association’s 2017 annual
convention to the theme “Scientific Method for the
21st Century: A World Beyond p<0.05p<0.05p &lt;0.05” (see
 Other Internet Resources).
 
2.5 Scientific Fraud

A number of recent high-profile cases of scientific fraud have
contributed considerably to the amount of press around the
reproducibility crisis in science. Often these cases (e.g., Diedrik
Staple in psychology) are used as a hook for media coverage, even
though the crisis itself has very little to do with scientific fraud.
(Note also that the Questionable Research Practices above are not
typically counted as “fraud” or even “scientific
misconduct” despite their ethically dubious status.) For
example, Fang, Grant Steen, and Casadevall (2012) estimated that 43%
of retracted articles in biomedical research are withdrawn because of
fraud. However, roughly half a million biomedical articles are
published annually and only 400 of those are retracted (Oransky 2016,
founder of the website RetractionWatch), so this amounts to a very
small proportion of the literature (approximately 0.1%). There are, of
course, many cases of pharmaceutical companies exercising financial
pressure on scientists and the publishing industry that raise
speculation about how many undetected (or unretracted) cases there may
still be in the literature. Having said that, there is widespread
consensus amongst scientists in the field that the main cause of the
current reproducibility crisis is the current incentive structure in
science (publication bias, publish or perish, non-transparent
statistical reporting, lack of rewards for data sharing). Whilst this
incentive structure can push some to scientific fraud, it appears to
be a very small proportion. 
3. Epistemological Issues Related to Replication

Many scientists believe that replication is epistemically valuable in
some way, that is to say, that replication serves a useful function in
enhancing our knowledge, understanding or beliefs about reality. This
section first discusses a problem about the epistemic value of
replication studies—called the “experimenters
regress”—and it then considers the claim that replication
plays an epistemically valuable role in distinguishing scientific
inquiry. It lastly examines a recent attempt to formalise the logic of
replication in a Bayesian framework.
3.1 The Experimenters’ Regress

Collins (1985) articulated a widely discussed problem that is now
known as the experimenters’ regress. He initially lays
out the problem in the context of measurement (Collins 1985: 84).
Suppose a scientist is trying to determine the accuracy of a
measurement device and also the accuracy of a measurement result.
Perhaps, for example, a scientist is using a thermometer to measure
the temperature of a liquid, and it delivers a particular measurement
result, say, 12 degrees Celsius.

The problem arises because of the interdependence of the accuracy of
the measurement result and the accuracy of the measurement device: to
know whether a particular measurement result is accurate, we need to
test it against a measurement result that is previously known to be
accurate, but to know that the result is accurate, we need to know
that it has been obtained via an accurate measuring device, and so on.
This, according to Collins, creates a “circle” which he
refers to as the “experimenters’ regress”.

Collins extends the problem to scientific replication more generally.
Suppose that an experiment B is a replication study of an
initial experiment A, and that B’s result
apparently conflicts with A’s result. This seeming
conflict may have one of two interpretations:

The results of A and B deliver genuinely conflicting
verdicts over the truth of the hypothesis under investigation
 Experiment B was not in fact a proper replication of
experiment A.


The regress poses a problem about how to choose between these
interpretations, a problem which threatens the epistemic value of
replication studies if there are no rational grounds for choosing in a
particular way. Determining whether one experiment is a proper
replication of another is complicated by the facts that scientific
writing conventions often omit precise details of experimental
methodology (Collins 2016), and, furthermore, much of the knowledge
that scientists require to execute experiments is tacit and
“cannot be fully explicated or absolutely established”
(Collins 1985: 73).

In the context of experimental methodology, Collins wrote:


To know an experiment has been well conducted, one needs to know
whether it gives rise to the correct outcome. But to know what the
correct outcome is, one needs to do a well-conducted experiment. But
to know whether the experiment has been well conducted…! (2016:
66; ellipses original)


Collins holds that in such cases where a conflict of results arises,
scientists tend to fraction into two groups, each holding opposing
interpretations of the results. According to Collins, where such
groups are “determined” and the “controversy runs
deep” (Collins 2016: 67), the dispute between the groups cannot
be resolved via further experimentation, for each additional result is
subject to the problem posed by the experimenters’
 regress.[2]
 In such cases, Collins claims that particular non-epistemic factors
will partly determine which interpretation becomes the lasting view:



the career, social, and cognitive interests of the scientists, their
reputations and that of their institutions, and the perceived utility
for future work. (Franklin & Collins 2016: 99)


Franklin was the most vociferous opponent of Collins, although recent
collaboration between the two has fostered some agreement (Collins
2016). Franklin presented a set of strategies for validating
experimental results, all of which relate to “rational
argument” on epistemic grounds (Franklin 1989: 459; 1994).
Examples include, for instance, appealing to experimental checks on
measurement devices or eliminating potential sources of error in the
experiment (Franklin & Collins 2016). He claimed that the fact
that such strategies were evidenced in scientific practice
“argues against those who believe that rational arguments plays
little, if any, role” in such validation (Franklin 1989: 459),
with Collins being an example. He interprets Collins as suggesting
that the strategies for resolving debates of the validation of results
are social factors or “culturally accepted practices”
(Franklin, 1989: 459) which do not provide reasons to underpin
rational belief about results. Franklin (1994) further claims that
Collins conflates the difficulty in successfully executing
experiments with the difficulty of demonstrating that
experiments have been executed, with Feest (2016) interpreting him to
say that although such execution requires tacit knowledge, one can
nevertheless appeal to strategies to demonstrate the validity of
experimental findings.

Feest (2016) examines a case study involving debates about the Mozart
effect in psychology (which, roughly speaking, is the effect whereby
listening to Mozart beneficially affects some aspect of intelligence
or brain structure). Like Collins, she agrees that there is a problem
in determining whether conflicting results suggest a putative
replication experiment is not a proper replication attempt, in part
because there is uncertainty about whether scientific concepts such as
the Mozart effect have been appropriately operationalised in earlier
or later experimental contexts. Unlike Collins (on her
interpretation), however, she does not think that this uncertainty
arises because scientists have inescapably tacit knowledge of the
linguistic rules about the meaning and application of concepts like
the Mozart effect. Rather the uncertainty arises because such concepts
are still themselves developing and because of assumptions about the
world that are required to successfully draw inferences from
it. Experimental methodology then serves to reveal the previously
tacit assumptions about the application of concepts and the legitimacy
of inferences, assumptions which are then susceptible to scrutiny.

For example, in her study of the Mozart effect, she notes that
replication studies of the Mozart effect failed to find that Mozart
music had a beneficial influence on spatial abilities. Rauscher, who
was the first to report results supporting the Mozart effect,
suggested that the later studies were not proper replications of her
study (Rauscher, Shaw, and Ky 1993, 1995). She clarified that the
Mozart effect applied only to a particular category
of spatial abilities (spatio-temporal processes) and that the later
studies operationalised the Mozart effect in terms of different
spatial abilities (spatial recognition). Here, then, there was a
difficulty in determining whether to interpret failed replication
results as evidence against the initial results or rather as an
indication that the replication studies were not proper replications.
Feest claims this difficulty arose because of tacit knowledge or
assumptions: assumptions about the application of the Mozart effect
concept to different kinds of spatial abilities, about whether the
world is such that Mozart music has an effect on such abilities and
about whether the failure of Mozart to impact other kinds of spatial
abilities warrants the inference that the Mozart effect does not
exist. Contra Collins, however, experimental methodology enabled the
explication and testing of these assumptions, thus allowing scientists
to overcome the interpretive impasse.

Against this background, her overall argument is that scientists often
are and should be sceptical towards each other’s results.
However, this is not because of inescapably tacit knowledge and the
inevitable failure of epistemic strategies for validating results.
Rather, it is at least in part because of varying tacit assumptions
that researchers have about the meaning of concepts, about the world
and about what to draw inferences from it. Progressive experimentation
serves to reveal these tacit assumptions which can then be
scrutinised, leading to the accumulation of knowledge.

There is also other philosophical literature on the
experimenters’ regress, including Teira’s (2013) paper
arguing that particular experimental debiasing procedures are
defensible against the regress from a contractualist perspective,
according to which self-interested scientists have reason to adopt
good methodological standards.
3.2 Replication as a Distinguishing Feature of Science

There is a widespread belief that science is distinct from other
knowledge accumulation endeavours, and some have suggested that
replication distinguishes (or is at least essential to) science in
this respect. (See also the entry on 
  science and pseudo-science.).
According to the Open Science Collaboration, “Reproducible
research practices are at the heart of sound research and integral to
the scientific method.” (OSC 2015: 7). Schmidt echoes this theme:
“To confirm results or hypotheses by a repetition procedure is
at the basis of any scientific conception” (2009: 90). Braude
(1979) goes so far as to say that reproducibility is a
“demarcation criterion between science and nonscience”
(1979: 2). Similarly, Nosek, Spies, and Motyl state that:


[T]he scientific method differentiates itself from other approaches by
publicly disclosing the basis of evidence for a claim…. In
principle, open sharing of methodology means that the entire body of
scientific knowledge can be reproduced by anyone. (2012: 618)


If replication played such an essential or distinguishing role in
science, we might expect it to be a prominent theme in the history of
science. Steinle (2016) considers the extent to which it is such a
theme. He presents a variety of cases from the history of science
where replication played very different roles, although he understands
“replication” narrowly to refer to when an experiment is
re-run by different researchers. He claims that the role and
value of replication in experimental replication is “much more
complex than easy textbook accounts make us believe” (2016: 60),
particularly since each scientific inquiry is always tied to a variety
of contextual considerations that can affect the importance of
replication. Such considerations include the relationship between
experimental results and the background of accepted theory at the
time, the practical and resource constraints on pursuing replication
and the perceived credibility of the researchers. These contextual
factors, he claims, mean that replication was a key or even overriding
determinant of acceptance of research claims in some cases, but not in
others.

For example, sometimes replication was sufficient to embrace a
research claim, even if it conflicted with the background of accepted
theory and left theoretical questions unresolved. A case of this is
high-temperature superconductivity, the effect whereby an electric
current can pass with zero resistance through a conductor at
relatively high temperatures. In 1986, physicists Georg Bednorz and
Alex Müller reported finding a material which acted as a
superconductor at 35 kelvin (−238 degrees Celsius). Scientists
around the world successfully replicated the effect, and Bednorz and
Muller were then awarded with a Nobel Prize in Physics a year after
their announcement. This case is remarkable since not only did their
effect contradict the accepted physical theory at the time, but there
is still no extant theory that adequately explains the effects which
they reported (Di Bucchianico, 2014).

As a contrasting example, however, sometimes claims were accepted
without any replication. In the 1650s, German scientist Otto von
Guericke designed and operated the world’s first vacuum pump
that would visibly suck air out of a larger space. He performed
experiments with his device to various audiences. Yet the replication
of his experiments by others would have been very difficult, if not
impossible: not only was Guericke’s pump both expensive and
complicated to build, but it was also unlikely that his descriptions
of it sufficed to enable anyone to build the pump and to consequently
replicate his findings. Despite this, Steinle claims that “no
doubts were raised about his results”, probably as a results of
his “public performances that could be witnessed by a large
number of participants” (2016: 55).

Steinle takes such historical cases to provide normative guidance for
understanding the epistemic value as replication as context-sensitive:
whether replication is necessary or sufficient for establishing a
research claim will depend on a variety of considerations, such as
those mentioned earlier. He consequently eschews wide-reaching claims,
such as those that “it’s all about replicability” or
that “replicability does not decide anything” (2016:
60).

3.3 Formalising the Logic of Replication

Earp and Trafimow (2015) attempt to formalise the way in which
replication is epistemically valuable, and they do this using a
Bayesian framework to explicate the inferences drawn from replication
studies. They present the framework in a context similar to that of
Collins (1985), noting that “it is well-nigh impossible to say
conclusively what [replication results] mean” (Earp &
Trafimow, 2015: 3). But while replication studies are often not
conclusive, they do believe that such studies can be
informative, and their Bayesian framework depicts how this is
so.

The framework is set out with an example. Suppose an aficionado of
Researcher A is highly confident that anything said by
Researcher A is true. Some other researcher, Researcher
B, then attempts to replicate an experiment by Researcher
A, and Researcher B find results that conflict with
those of Researcher A. Earp and Trafimow claim that the
aficionado might continue to be confident in Researcher
A’s findings, but the aficionado’s confidence is
likely to slightly decrease. As the number of failed replication
attempts increases, the aficionado’s confidence accordingly
decreases, eventually falling below 50% and thereby placing more
confidence in the replication failures than in the findings initially
reported by Researcher A.

Here, then, suppose we are interested in the probability that the
original result reported by Researcher A is true given
Researcher B’s first replication failure. Earp and
Trafimow represent this probability with the notation p(T∣F)p(T∣F)p(T\mid F)
where p is a probability function, T represents the
proposition that the original result is true and F represents
Researcher B’s replication failure. According to
Bayes’s theorem below, this probability is calculable from the
aficionado’s degree of confidence that the original result is
true prior to learning of the replication failure p(T)p(T)p(T), their
degree of expectation of the replication failure on the condition that
the original result is true p(T∣F)p(T∣F)p(T\mid F), and the degree to which they would
unconditionally expect a replication failure prior to learning of the
replication failure p(F)p(F)p(F):
(1)p(T∣F)=p(T)p(F∣T)p(F)(1)p(T∣F)=p(T)p(F∣T)p(F)\tag{1}
p(T\mid F) = \frac{p(T)p(F\mid T)}{p(F)}


Relatedly, we could instead be interested in the confidence ratio that
the original result is true or false given the failure to replicate.
This ratio is representable as p(T∣F)p(∼T∣F)p(T∣F)p(∼T∣F)\frac{p(T\mid F)}{p(\nneg T\mid F)}
where ∼T∼T\nneg T represents the proposition that the original result
is false. According to the standard Bayesian probability calculus,
this ratio in turn is related to a product of ratios concerning 

the confidence that the original result is true
p(T)p(∼T)p(T)p(∼T)\frac{p(T)}{p(\nneg T)} and 
the expectation of a replication failure on the condition that the
result is true or false p(F∣T)p(F∣∼T)p(F∣T)p(F∣∼T)\frac{p(F\mid T)}{p(F\mid \nneg T)}. 


This relation is expressed in the equation:
(2)p(T∣F)p(∼T∣F)=p(T)p(∼T)p(F∣T)p(F∣∼T)(2)p(T∣F)p(∼T∣F)=p(T)p(∼T)p(F∣T)p(F∣∼T)\tag{2}
\frac{p(T\mid F)}{p(\nneg T\mid F)} = \frac{p(T)}{p(\nneg T)} \frac{p(F\mid T)}{p(F\mid \nneg T)}


Now Earp and Trafimow assign some values to the terms on the
right-hand of the equation for (2). Supposing that the aficionado is
confident in the original results, they set the ratio
p(T)p(∼T)p(T)p(∼T)\frac{p(T)}{p(\nneg T)} to 50, meaning that the aficionado is
initially fifty times more confident that the results are true than
that the results are false.

They also set the ratio p(F∣T)p(F∣∼T)p(F∣T)p(F∣∼T)\frac{p(F\mid T)}{p(F\mid \nneg T)}. about
the conditional expectation of a replication failure to 0.5, meaning
that the aficionado is considerably less confident that there will be
a replication failure if the original result is true than if it is
false. They point out that the extent to which the aficionado is less
confident depends on the quality of so-called auxiliary
assumptions about the replication experiment. Here, auxiliary
assumptions are assumptions which enable one to infer that particular
things should be observable if the theory under test is true. The
intuitive idea is that the higher the quality of the assumptions about
a replication study, the more one would expect to observe a successful
replication if the original result was true. While they do not specify
precisely what makes such auxiliary assumptions have high
“quality” in this context, presumably this quality
concerns the extent to which the assumptions are probably true and the
extent to which the replication experiment is an appropriate test of
the veracity of the original results if the assumptions are true.

Once the ratios on the right-hand of equation (2) are set as such, one
can see that a replication failure would reduce one’s confidence
in the original results:
(3)p(T∣F)p(∼T∣F)=p(T)p(∼T)p(F∣T)p(F∣∼T)=(50)(0.5)=25(3)p(T∣F)p(∼T∣F)=p(T)p(∼T)p(F∣T)p(F∣∼T)=(50)(0.5)=25\tag{3}
\begin{align}
\frac{p(T\mid F)}{p(\nneg T\mid F)} &amp; = \frac{p(T)}{p(\nneg T)} \frac{p(F\mid T)}{p(F\mid \nneg T)} \\
&amp; = (50)(0.5) \\
&amp; = 25\\
\end{align}


Here, then, a replication failure would reduce the aficionado’s
confidence that the original result was true so that the aficionado
would be only 25 times more confident that the result is true given a
failure (as per p(T∣F)p(∼T∣F)p(T∣F)p(∼T∣F)\frac{p(T\mid F)}{p(\nneg T\mid F)}) rather than
50 times more confident that it is true (as per p(T)p(∼T)p(T)p(∼T)\frac{p(T)}{p(\nneg
T)}).

Nevertheless, the aficionado may still be confident that the original
result is true, but we can see how such confidence would decrease with
successive replication failures. More formally, let FNFNF_N be the
last replication failure in a sequence of N replication
failures ⟨F1,F2,…,FN⟩⟨F1,F2,…,FN⟩\langle F_1,F_2,\ldots,F_N\rangle. Then, the
aficionado’s confidence in the original result given the
Nth replication failure is expressible in the
 equation:[3]

(4)p(T∣FN)p(∼T∣FN)=p(T)p(∼T)p(F1∣T)p(F1∣∼T)p(F2∣T)p(F2∣∼T)⋯p(FN∣T)p(FN∣∼T)(4)p(T∣FN)p(∼T∣FN)=p(T)p(∼T)p(F1∣T)p(F1∣∼T)p(F2∣T)p(F2∣∼T)⋯p(FN∣T)p(FN∣∼T)\tag{4}
\frac{p(T\mid F_N)}{p(\nneg T\mid F_N)} = \frac{p(T)}{p(\nneg T)} \frac{p(F_1\mid T)}{p(F_1\mid \nneg T)}
\frac{p(F_2\mid T)}{p(F_2\mid \nneg T)} \cdots \frac{p(F_N\mid T)}{p(F_N\mid \nneg T)} 


For example, suppose there are 10 replication failures, and so
N=10N=10N=10. Suppose further that the confidence ratios for the
replication failures are set such that:
(5)abp(F1∣T)p(F1∣∼T)p(F2∣T)p(F2∣∼T)⋯p(F10∣T)p(F10∣∼T)ab=(0.5)(0.8)(0.7)(0.65)(0.75)(0.56)(0.69)(0.54)(0.73)(0.52)(5)abp(F1∣T)p(F1∣∼T)p(F2∣T)p(F2∣∼T)⋯p(F10∣T)p(F10∣∼T)ab=(0.5)(0.8)(0.7)(0.65)(0.75)(0.56)(0.69)(0.54)(0.73)(0.52)\tag{5}
\begin{multline}
\phantom{ab}\frac{p(F_1\mid T)}{p(F_1\mid \nneg T)}
\frac{p(F_2\mid T)}{p(F_2\mid \nneg T)} \cdots \frac{p(F_{10}\mid T)}{p(F_{10}\mid \nneg T)}\\ \phantom{ab}  =
(0.5)(0.8)
(0.7)(0.65)
(0.75)(0.56)
(0.69)(0.54)
(0.73)(0.52)

Then,
(6)p(T∣F10)p(∼T∣F10)=0.54=p(T)p(∼T)p(F1∣T)p(F1∣∼T)p(F2∣T)p(F2∣∼T)⋯p(F10∣T)p(F10∣∼T)=(50)(0.5)(0.8)…(0.52)(6)p(T∣F10)p(∼T∣F10)=0.54=p(T)p(∼T)p(F1∣T)p(F1∣∼T)p(F2∣T)p(F2∣∼T)⋯p(F10∣T)p(F10∣∼T)=(50)(0.5)(0.8)…(0.52)\tag{6}
\begin{align}
\frac{p(T \mid F_{10})}{p(\nneg T \mid F_{10})} &amp; = 0.54 \\
&amp; = \frac{p(T)}{p(\nneg T)} \frac{p(F_1\mid T)}{p(F_1\mid \nneg T)}
\frac{p(F_2\mid T)}{p(F_2\mid \nneg T)} \cdots \frac{p(F_{10}\mid T)}{p(F_{10}\mid \nneg T)} \\
&amp; = (50)(0.5)(0.8)\ldots(0.52)
\end{align}


Here, then, the aficionado’s confidence in the original result
decreases so that they are more confident that it was false than that
it was true. Hence, on Earp and Trafimow’s Bayesian account,
successive replication failures can progressively erode one’s
confidence that an original result is true, even if one was initially
highly confident in the original result and even if no single
replication failure by itself was
 conclusive.[4]

Some putative merits of Earp and Trafimow’s account, then, are
that it provides a formalisation whereby replication attempts are
informative even if they are not conclusive, and furthermore, the
formalisation provides a role for both quantity of replication
attempts as well as auxiliary assumptions about the replications.

4. Open Science Reforms: Values, Tone, and Scientific Norms

The aforementioned meta-science has unearthed a range of problems
which give rise to the reproducibility crisis, and the open science
movement has proposed or promoted various solutions—or
reforms—for these problems. These reforms can be grouped into
four categories: (a) methods and training, (b) reporting and
dissemination, (c) peer review processes, and (d) evaluating new
incentive structures (loosely following the categories used by
Munafò et al. 2017 and Ioannidis et al. 2015). In subsections
4.1–4.4 below, we present a non-exhaustive list of initiatives
in each of the above categories. These initiatives are reflections of
various values and norms that are at the heart of the open science
movement, and we discuss these values and norms in 4.5.
4.1 Methods and Training

Combating bias. The development of methods for combating
bias, for example, masked or blind analysis techniques to combat
confirmation bias (e.g., MacCoun & Perlmutter 2017).
Support. Providing methodological support for
researchers, including published guidelines and statistical
consultancy (for example, as offered by the Center for Open Science)
and large online courses such as that developed by Daniel Lakens (see
 Other Internet Resources).
Collaboration. Promoting collaboration and team/crowd
sourced science to combat low power and other methodological
limitations of single studies. The Reproducibility Projects themselves
are an example of this, but there are other initiatives too such
StudySwap in psychology and the Collective Replication and Education
Project (CREP, see
 Other Internet Resources
 for both of these , see also Munafò et al. for a more detailed
description) which aims to increase the prevalence of replications
through undergraduate education.

4.2 Reporting and Dissemination

The TOP Guidelines. The Transparency and Openness
Promotion (TOP) guidelines (Nosek et al. 2015) have, as at the end of
May, 2018, almost 5,000 journals and organizations as signatories.
Developed within psychology, TOP guidelines have formed the basis of
other disciplinary specific guidelines, such as the Tools for
Transparency in Ecology and Evolution (TTEE). As the name suggests,
these guidelines promote more complete and transparent reporting of
methodological and statistical practices. This in turn enables
authors, reviewers and editors to consider detailed aspects of their
sample size planning and design decisions, and to clearly distinguish
between confirmatory (planned) analysis and exploratory (post hoc)
analysis.
Pre-registration. In its simplest form, pre-registration
involves making a public, date-stamped statement of predictions and/or
hypotheses, either before data is collected, viewed or analysed. The
purpose is to distinguish prediction from postdiction (Nosek et al.
2018), or what is elsewhere referred to as confirmatory research from
exploratory research (Wagenmakers et al. 2012) and a distinction
perhaps more commonly known as hypothesis testing versus hypothesis
generating research. Pre-registration of predictive research helps
control for HARKing (Kerr 1998) and hindsight bias, and within the
frequentist Null Hypothesis Significance Testing, helps contain the
false positive error rate to the set alpha level. There are several
platforms that host pre-registrations, such as the Open Science
Framework (osf.io) and As Predicted (aspredicted.org). The Open
Science Framework also hosts a “pre-registration
challenge” offering monetary rewards for publishing
pre-registered work.
Specific Journal Initiatives. Some high impact journals,
having been singled out in the science media as having particularly
problematic publishing practices (e.g., Schekman 2013), have taken
exceptional steps to improve the completeness, transparency and
reproducibility of the research they publish. For example, since 2013,
Nature and Nature research journals have engaged in a range
of editorial activities aimed at improving reproducibility of research
published in their journals 
 (see the editorial announcement, 
Nature 496, 398, 25 April 2013,  doi:10.1038/496398a).  In
2017, they introduced checklists and reporting summaries (published
alongside articles) in an effort to improve transparency and
reproducibility. In 2018, they produced discipline specific versions
for Nature Human Behaviour and Nature Ecology &
Evolution. Within psychology, the journal Psychological
Science (flagship journal of the Association of Psychological
Science) was the first to adopt open science practices, such the COS
Open Science badges described below. Following a meeting of ecology
and evolution journal editors in 2015, a number of journals in these
fields have run editorials on this topic, often committing to TTEE
guidelines (discussed above). Conservation Biology has in
addition adopted a checklist for associate editors (Parker et
al. 2016).

4.3 Peer Review

Registered reports. Registered reports shift the point at
which peer review occurs in the research process, in an effort to
combat publication bias against null (negative) results. Manuscripts
are submitted, reviewed and a publication decision made on the basis
of the introduction, methods and planned analysis alone. If accepted,
authors then have a defined period of time to carry out the planned
research and submit the results. Assuming authors followed their
original plans (or adequately justified deviations from them), the
journal will honour its decision to publish, regardless of the result
outcomes. In psychology, the Registered Report format has been
championed by Chris Chambers, with the journal Cortex being
the first to adopt the format under Chambers’ editorship
(Chambers 2013, 2017; Nosek & Lakens 2014). Currently (end of May
2018), 108 journals in a range of biomedical, psychology and
neuroscience fields, offer the format (see Registered Reports in
 Other Internet Resources).
Pre-prints. Well-established in some sciences like
physics, the use of pre-print servers is relatively new in biological
and social sciences.

4.4 Incentives and Evaluations

Open Science badges. A recent review of initiatives for
improving data sharing identified the awarding of open data and open
materials badges as the most effective scheme (Rowhani-Farid, Allen,
& Barnett 2017). One such badge scheme is coordinated by the
Center for Open Science who currently award three badges: Open Data,
Open Materials and Pre-Registration. Badges are attached to articles
that follow a specific set of criteria to engage in these activities.
Kidwell et al. (2016) evaluated the effectiveness of badges in the
journal Psychological Science and found substantial increases
(from 3 to 39%) in data sharing over a less than two-year period. Such
increases were not found in similar journals without badge schemes
over the same period.

4.5 Values, Tone, and Scientific Norms in Open Science Reform

There has long been philosophical debate about what role values do and
should play in science (Churchman 1948; Rudner 1953; Douglas 2016),
and the reproducibility crisis is intimately connected to questions
about the operations of, and interconnections between, such values. In
particular, Nosek et al. (2017) argue that there is a tension between truth and
publishability. More specifically, for reasons discussed in section 2
above, the accuracy of scientific results are compromised by the value
which journals place on novel and positive results and, consequently,
by scientists who value career success to seek to exclusively publish
such results in these journals. Many others in addition to Nosek et
al. (Hackett 2005; Martin 1992; Sovacool 2008) have taken also take issue
with the value which journals and funding bodies have placed on
novelty.

Some might interpret the tension as a manifestation of how epistemic
values (such as truth and replicability) can be compromised by
(arguably) non-epistemic values, such the value of novel, interesting
or surprising results. Epistemic values are typically taken to be
values that, in the words of Steel “promote the acquisition of
true beliefs” (2010: 18; see also Goldman 1999). Canonical
examples of epistemic values include the predictive accuracy and
internal consistency of a theory. Epistemic values are often
contrasted with putative non-epistemic or non-cognitive values, which
include ethical or social values like, for example, the novelty of a
theory or its ability to improve well-being by lessening power
inequalities (Longino 1996). Of course, there is no complete consensus
as to precisely what counts as an epistemic or non-epistemic value
(Rooney 1992; Longino 1996). Longino, for example, claims that, other
things being equal, novelty counts in favour of accepting a theory,
and convincingly argues that, in some contexts, it can serve as a
“protection against unconscious perpetuation of the sexism and
androcentrism” in traditional science (1997: 22). However, she
does not discuss novelty specifically in the context of the
reproducibility crisis.

Giner-Sorolla (2012), however, does discuss novelty in the context of
the crisis, and he offers another perspective on its value. He claims
that one reason novelty has been used to define what is publishable or
fundable is that it is relatively easy for researchers to establish
and for reviewers and editors to detect. Yet, Giner-Sorolla argues,
novelty for its own sake perhaps should not be valued, and should in
fact be recognized as merely an operationalisation of a deeper
concept, such as “ability to advance the field” (567).
Giner-Sorolla goes on to point out how such shallow
operationalisations of important concepts often lead to problems, for
example, using statistical significance to measure the importance of
results, or measuring the quality of research by how well outcomes fit
with experimenters’ prior expectations.

Values are closely connected to discussions about norms in the open
science movement. Vazire (2018) and others invoke norms of
science—communality, universalism, disinterestedness and
organised skepticism—in setting the goals for open science,
norms originally articulated by Robert Merton (1942). Each such norm
arguably reflects a value which Merton advocated, and each norm may be
opposed by a counternorm which denotes behaviour that is in conflict
with the norm. For example, the norm of communality (which Merton
called “communism”) reflects the value of collaboration
and the common ownership of scientific goods since the norm recommends
such collaboration and common ownership. Advocates of open science see
such norms, and the values which they reflect, as an aim for open
science. For example, the norm of communality is reflected in sharing
and making data open, and in open access publishing. In contrast, the
counternorm of secrecy is associated with a closed, for profit
publishing system (Anderson et al. 2010). Likewise, assessing
scientific work on its merits upholds the norm of
universalism—that the evaluation of research claims should not
depend on the socio-demographic characteristics of the proponents of
such claims. In contrast, assessing work by the age, the status, the
institution or the metrics of the journal it is published in reflects
a counternorm of particularism.

Vazire (2018) and others have argued that, at the moment, scientific
practice is dominated by counternorms and that a move to Mertonian
norms is a goal of the open science reform movement. In particular,
self-interestedness, as opposed to the norm of disinterestedness,
motivates p-hacking and other Questionable Research Practices.
Similarly, a desire to protect one’s professional reputation
motivates resistance to having one’s work replicated by others
(Vazire 2018). This in turn reinforces a counternorm of organized
dogmatism rather than organized skepticism which, according to Merton,
involves the “temporary suspension of judgment and the detached
scrutiny of beliefs” (Merton, 1973).

Anderson et al.’s (2010) focus groups and surveys of scientists
suggest that scientists do want to adhere to Merton’s norms but
that the current incentive structure of science makes this difficult.
Changing the structure of penalty and reward systems within science to
promote communality, universalism, disinterestedness and organized
skepticism instead of their counternorms is an ongoing challenge for
the open science reform movement. As Pashler and Wagenmakers (2012)
have said: 


replicability problems will not be so easily overcome, as they reflect
deep-seated human biases and well-entrenched incentives that shape the
behavior of individuals and institutions. (2012: 529)


The effort to promote such values and norms has generated heated
controversy. Some early responses to the Reproducibility Project:
Psychology and Many Labs projects were highly critical, not just of
the substance of the nature and process of the work. Calls for
openness were interpreted as reflecting mistrust, and attempts to
replicate others’ work as personal attacks (e.g., Schnail 2014
in
 Other Internet Resources).
 Nosek, Spies, & Motyl (2012) argue that calls for openness should
not be interepreted as mistrust: 


Opening our research process will make us feel accountable to do our
best to get it right; and, if we do not get it right, to increase the
opportunities for others to detect the problems and correct them.
Openness is not needed because we are untrustworthy; it is needed
because we are human. (2012: 626)


Exchanges related to this have become known as the tone
debate.[]

5. Conclusion

The subject of reproducibility is associated with a turbulent period
in contemporary science. This period has called for a re-evaluation of
the values, incentives, practices and structures which underpin
scientific inquiry. While the meta-science has painted a bleak picture
of reproducibility in some fields, it has also inspired a parallel
movement to strengthen the foundations of science. However, more
progress is to be made, especially in understanding the solutions to
the reproducibility crisis. In this regard, there are fruitful avenues
for future research, including a deeper exploration of the role that
epistemic and non-epistemic values can or should play in scientific
inquiry.
