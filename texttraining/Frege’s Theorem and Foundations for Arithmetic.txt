Over the course of his life, Gottlob Frege formulated two logical
systems in his attempts to define basic concepts of mathematics and to
derive mathematical laws from the laws of logic. In his book of 1879,
Begriffsschrift: eine der arithmetischen nachgebildete
Formelsprache des reinen Denkens, he developed a second-order
predicate calculus and used it both to define interesting mathematical
concepts and to state and prove mathematically interesting
propositions. However, in his two-volume work of 1893/1903,
Grundgesetze der Arithmetik, Frege added (as an axiom) what
he thought was a logical proposition (Basic Law V) and tried to derive
the fundamental axioms and theorems of number theory from the
resulting system. Unfortunately, not only did Basic Law V fail to be a
logical proposition, but the resulting system proved to be
inconsistent, for it was subject to Russell’s Paradox.

Until recently, the inconsistency in Frege’s
Grundgesetze overshadowed a deep theoretical accomplishment
that can be extracted from his work. The Grundgesetze
contains all the essential steps of a valid proof (in second-order
logic) of the fundamental propositions of arithmetic from a single
consistent principle. This consistent principle, known in the
literature as “Hume’s Principle”, asserts that for
any concepts FFF and GGG, the number of FFF-things is equal to
the number GGG-things if and only if there is a one-to-one
correspondence between the FFF-things and the GGG-things. Though
Frege derived Hume’s Principle from Basic Law V in the
Grundgesetze, the subsequent derivations of the fundamental
propositions of arithmetic from Hume’s Principle do not
essentially require Basic Law V. So by setting aside the problematic
Basic Law V and the derivation of Hume’s Principle, one can
focus on Frege’s derivations of the basic propositions of
arithmetic using Hume’s Principle as an axiom. His theoretical
accomplishment then becomes clear: his work shows us how to prove, as
theorems, the Dedekind/Peano axioms for number theory from
Hume’s Principle in second-order logic. This achievement, which
involves some remarkably subtle chains of definitions and logical
reasoning, has become known as Frege’s Theorem.

The principal goal of this entry is to present Frege’s Theorem
in the most logically perspicuous manner, without using
Frege’s own notation. Of course, Frege’s own notation is
fascinating and interesting in its own right, and one must come to
grips with that notation when studying Frege’s original work.
But one doesn’t have to understand Frege’s notation to
understand Frege’s Theorem, and so we will, for the most part,
put aside Frege’s own notation and the many interpretative
issues that arise in connection with it. We strive to present
Frege’s Theorem by representing the ideas and claims involved in
the proof in clear and well-established modern logical notation. With
a clear understanding of what Frege accomplished, one will be better
prepared to understand Frege’s own notation and derivations, as
one reads Frege’s original work (whether in German or in
translation). Moreover, our efforts below should prepare the reader to
understand a number of scholarly books and articles in the secondary
literature on Frege’s work, e.g., Wright 1983, Boolos 1990, and
Heck 1993, 2011, and 2012.

To accomplish these goals, we presuppose only a familiarity with the
first-order predicate calculus. We show how to extend this language
and logic to the second-order predicate calculus, and show how to
represent the ideas and claims involved in Frege’s Theorem in
this calculus. These ideas and claims all appear in Frege 1893/1903,
which we refer to as Gg I/II. But we
sometimes also cite to his book of 1879 and his book of 1884 (Die
Grundlagen der Arithmetik), referring to these works as
Begr and Gl, respectively.
 
1. The Second-Order Predicate Calculus and Theory of Concepts

In this section, we describe the language and logic of the
second-order predicate calculus. We then extend this calculus with the
classical comprehension principle for concepts and we introduce and
explain λλ\lambda-notation, which allows one to turn open formulas
into complex names of concepts. Although Frege’s own logic is
rather different from the modern second-order predicate calculus, the
latter’s comprehension principle for concepts and
λλ\lambda-notation provide us with a logically perspicuous way of
representing Frege’s Theorem. We shall sometimes remark on the
differences between the calculus presented below and the calculus that
Frege developed, but such remarks are not intended to be a scholarly
guide to the many subtleties involved in understanding Frege’s
original works.
1.1 The Language

The language of the second-order predicate calculus starts with the
following lists of simple terms:

object names: aaa, bbb, ……\ldots
object variables: x,y,…x,y,…x, y,\ldots
nnn-place relation names: Pn,Qn,…   (n≥1)Pn,Qn,…   (n≥1)P^{n}, Q^{n}, \ldots \ \ \ (n\geq
1)
nnn-place relation variables: Fn,Gn,…   (n≥1)Fn,Gn,…   (n≥1)F^{n}, G^{n}, \ldots \ \ \
(n\geq 1)


The object names and variables denote, or take values in, a domain of
objects and the nnn-place relation names and variables
denote, or take values in, a domain of nnn-place relations.
Objects and relations are to be regarded as mutually exclusive
domains: no object is a relation and no relation is an object. When
giving examples of nnn-place relation names or variables for n≥2n≥2n\geq
2, we often write R,S,…R,S,…R, S,\ldots instead of writing
P2,Q2,…P2,Q2,…P^2,Q^2,\ldots. 

From these simple terms, one can define the formulas of the
language as follows:

If ΠΠ\Pi is any nnn-place relation term and v1,…,vnv1,…,vnv_1,\ldots
,v_n are any object terms (n≥1)(n≥1)( n\geq 1), then Πv1…vnΠv1…vn\Pi v_1\ldots v_n
is an (atomic) formula.
If ϕ,ψϕ,ψ\phi, \psi are any formulas, then ¬ϕ¬ϕ\neg\phi and (ϕ→ψ)(ϕ→ψ)
(\phi\to\psi) are (molecular) formulas. (We drop the parenthesis
around (ϕ→ψ)(ϕ→ψ)(\phi\to\psi) when there is no potential for
ambiguity.)
Where ϕϕ\phi is any formula and αα\alpha any variable, then
∀αϕ∀αϕ\forall\alpha\phi is a (quantified) formula. 


So, for example, PaPaPa, RxyRxyRxy, etc., are atomic formulas and these
assert, respectively, that object aaa exemplifies the 1-place
relation PPP and that xxx and yyy stand in the relation RRR.
The formulas ¬Pa¬Pa\neg Pa and Pa→RxyPa→RxyPa \to Rxy are molecular formulas,
and these assert, respectively, that it is not the case that
aaa exemplifies PPP, and that if aaa exemplifies PPP
then xxx and yyy stand in the relation RRR. Finally, here
are some examples of quantified formulas:


∀xRxa∀xRxa\forall xRxa
Every xxx stands in the relation RRR to aaa.

∀x∀y(Px→Qy)∀x∀y(Px→Qy)\forall x\forall y(Px \to Qy)
For all xxx, for all yyy, if PxPxPx then QyQy Qy

 ∀FFa∀FFa\forall F \, Fa
Every FFF is such that aaa falls under FFF

 ∀F(Fx→Fy)∀F(Fx→Fy)\forall F(Fx \to Fy)
For all FFF, if FxFxFx then FyFyFy


The language we defined above is second-order because the last
clause in the definition of the formulas sanctions both quantified
formulas of the form ∀xϕ∀xϕ\forall x\phi and of the form ∀Fϕ∀Fϕ\forall
F\phi. In what follows, we employ the standard definitions of the
following formulas:

ϕ&ψ=df¬(ϕ→¬ψ)ϕ∨ψ=df¬ϕ→ψϕ≡ψ=df(ϕ→ψ)&(ψ→ϕ)∃αϕ=df¬∀α¬ϕϕ&ψ=df¬(ϕ→¬ψ)ϕ∨ψ=df¬ϕ→ψϕ≡ψ=df(ϕ→ψ)&(ψ→ϕ)∃αϕ=df¬∀α¬ϕ\begin{align*}
&amp; \phi \amp \psi    \eqdef \neg(\phi \to \neg\psi) \\
&amp; \phi \lor \psi    \eqdef \neg\phi \to \psi \\
&amp; \phi\equiv\psi    \eqdef (\phi\to\psi) \amp (\psi\to\phi) \\
&amp; \exists\alpha\phi \eqdef \neg\forall\alpha\neg\phi
\end{align*}


The first of the above defines the conjunction ϕϕ\phi and
ψψ\psi; the second defines the disjunction ϕϕ\phi or
ψψ\psi; the third defines the biconditional ϕϕ\phi if and only
if ψψ\psi (which we often abbreviate as iff); and the
last defines the existentially quantified formula there is an
αα\alpha such that ϕϕ\phi. It should be noted here that
instead of using a linear string of symbols to express molecular and
quantified formulas, Frege developed a two-dimensional notation for
such formulas. Since we won’t be using Frege’s notation
for complex formulas in what follows, we need not spend time
describing it
 here.[1]

But even if we put aside Frege’s notation for complex formulas,
it is important to point out that Frege didn’t use atomic
formulas of the form PxPxPx, RxyRxyRxy, etc., as we have done. Instead
of including nnn-place relation names and variables among his
primitive terms, he included primitive function names and variables such
as fff, ggg, hhh, …, and used them to
signify functions. That is, instead of distinguishing objects
and relations, Frege distinguished objects from
functions. Though some developments of the modern predicate
calculus include function terms among the simple terms of the
language, we have not included them because we shall not need them in
the development of Frege’s Theorem.

It is also important to point out that Frege used functional
application ‘f(x)f(x)f(x)’ to form
complex names in his language and used these names to represent
natural language statements. To see how, note that Frege would use the
expression ‘f(x)f(x)f(x)’ to denote the value of the function
fff for the argument xxx. Since he also recognized two special
objects he called truth-values (The True and The False), he
defined a concept to be any function that always maps its
arguments to truth-values. For example, whereas ‘x2+3x2+3x^{2}
+3’ and ‘father-of
xxx’ signify ordinary functions, the expressions ‘xxx
is happy’ (which we might represent as ‘HxHxHx’) and
‘x>5x>5x \gt 5’ signify concepts. The former signifies a
concept which maps any object that is happy to The True and all other
objects to The False; the latter signifies a concept that maps any
object that is greater than 5 to The True and all other objects to The
False. In this way, ordinary language predications like ‘bbb
is happy’ and ‘4 is greater than 5’, once
represented in Frege’s language as ‘HbHbHb’ and
‘4>54>54 \gt 5’, become names of truth-values.

For the purposes of understanding Frege’s Theorem, we can think
of our 1-place relation terms as denoting, or ranging over, Fregean
concepts. Once we do this, we can take the formula ‘HbHb
Hb’ to mean that bbb falls under the concept being
happy. But for the purposes of understanding Frege’s
Theorem, it is not necessary to suppose, with Frege, that concepts
like being happy are functions from objects to truth values.
So, in what follows, one should remember that whereas we can interpret
the atomic formula FxFxFx to mean either that xxx exemplifies
the 1-place relation (i.e., property) FFF or that xxx falls under
the concept FFF, Frege would understand such formulas as instances
of functional application. Nevertheless, we’ll henceforth call
1-place relations concepts. For all practical purposes then,
we may use the symbols FFF, GGG, … as variables ranging
over concepts and though we sometimes write ‘F(x)F(x)F(x)’
instead of ‘FxFxFx’ for perspicuity in parsing an
expression, we should still think of this as a predication.

Frege also supposed that when a binary function fff (i.e., a
function of two arguments) always maps the arguments xxx and yyy
to a truth value, fff is a relation. So it should be
remembered that when we use the expression ‘RxyRxyRxy’
(or sometimes
‘R(x,y)R(x,y)R(x,y)’) to assert that the objects xxx and yyy
stand in the relation RRR, Frege would say that RRR maps the pair
of objects xxx and yyy (in that order) to The True. But again,
this Fregean interpretation is not required for understanding
Frege’s Theorem. In what follows, we shall sometimes write the
symbol that denotes a mathematical relation in the usual
‘infix’ notation; for example, ‘>>&gt;’ denotes
the greater-than relation in the expression ‘x>yx>yx \gt
y’.

Finally, it is important to mention that one can add the following
clause to the definition of the formulas of our second-order
language so as to include formulas that express identity claims:

If v1v1v_{1} and v2v2v_{2} are any object terms, v1=v2v1=v2v_{1} = v_{2}
is a formula.


Thus, formulas such as ‘x=yx=yx = y’ are part of the
second-order predicate calculus with identity. Frege, too, had
primitive identity statements; for him, identity is a binary function
that maps a pair of objects to The True whenever those objects are the
same object. So whereas we shall suppose that statements like
‘22=422=42^{2} = 4’ are simply true assertions and statements
like ‘22=322=32^{2} = 3’ are simply false ones, Frege took
‘22=422=42^{2} = 4’ to be a name of The True and took
‘22=322=32^{2} = 3’ to be a name of The False. The statement
form ‘f(x)=yf(x)=yf(x) = y’ plays an
important role in Frege’s axioms and definitions, but we shall
not need to assert claims of this form in order to derive
Frege’s Theorem. Instead, we shall assume (a) that identity is
simply a 2-place relation and (b) that a unary function fff is
really a relation RRR that has the following property: Rxy&Rxz→y=zRxy&Rxz→y=zRxy \amp
Rxz \to y = z (i.e., that functions are relations that always relate
their first argument to at most one second argument). We may call such
relations functional relations. In other words, when Frege
asserts f(x)=yf(x)=y f(x) = y, we may represent this as asserting that fff
is a functional relation RRR such that RxyRxyRxy. This generalizes to
nn n-place relations for n≥2n≥2n\geq2. For example, where +++ is the
binary addition function of arithmetic, we may represent the
arithmetic statement 2+3=52+3=52+3 = 5 in our language as a claim of the
form +(2,3,5)+(2,3,5)+(2,3,5), where +++ is taken to be a 3-place functional
relation that obeys the condition: +(x,y,z)&+(x,y,w)→z=w+(x,y,z)&+(x,y,w)→z=w+(x,y,z) \amp +(x,y,w) \to z =
w.
1.2 The Logic

The basic axioms and rules of inference governing statements in our
second-order language are similar to those of the first-order
predicate calculus with identity, though they’ve been extended
to apply to claims involving universal quantifiers binding relation
variables. Where ϕϕ\phi, ψψ\psi, and χχ\chi are any formulas,
αα\alpha any variable and ττ\tau any term of the same type as
αα\alpha (i.e., both are object terms or both are nnn-place
relation terms), then the following are the basic axioms and rules of
second-order logic: 

The axioms for propositional logic. E.g.,


ϕ→(ψ→ϕ)ϕ→(ψ→ϕ)\phi \to (\psi \to \phi)

(ϕ→(ψ→χ))→((ϕ→ψ)→(ϕ→χ))(ϕ→(ψ→χ))→((ϕ→ψ)→(ϕ→χ))(\phi \to (\psi \to \chi)) \to ((\phi \to \psi) \to (\phi \to
\chi))

(¬ϕ→¬ψ)→((¬ϕ→ψ)→ϕ)(¬ϕ→¬ψ)→((¬ϕ→ψ)→ϕ)(\neg\phi \to \neg\psi) \to ((\neg\phi \to \psi) \to \phi)

Universal Instantiation: ∀αϕ→ϕτα∀αϕ→ϕτα\forall\alpha\phi \to
\phi^{\tau}_{\alpha}, where both ϕταϕτα\phi^{\tau}_{\alpha} is the
result of uniformly substituting ττ\tau for the free occurrences of
αα\alpha in ϕϕ\phi, and ττ\tau is substitutable for αα\alpha
(i.e., no variable free in ττ\tau becomes bound by any quantifier in
ϕταϕτα\phi^{\tau}_{\alpha}). E.g., where ‘a’ is an object
term and ‘P’ is a 1-place relation term,


∀xPx→Pa∀xPx→Pa\forall xPx \to Pa

∀FFa→Pa∀FFa→Pa\forall FFa \to Pa
 (The corresponding principle, Existential Introduction, for the
existential quantifier, i.e., ϕτα→∃αϕϕτα→∃αϕ\phi^{\tau}_{\alpha}\to \exists \alpha
\phi, is derivable.)
Quantifier Distribution:


∀α(ϕ→ψ)→(ϕ→∀αψ),∀α(ϕ→ψ)→(ϕ→∀αψ),\forall\alpha(\phi \to \psi) \to (\phi \to \forall\alpha\psi),
 where αα\alpha is any variable that isn’t free in
ϕϕ\phi
Laws of Identity:


x=xx=xx\eqclose x

x=y→(ϕ→ϕ′),x=y→(ϕ→ϕ′),x\eqclose y \to (\phi \to \phi'),
 where ϕ′ϕ′\phi' is the result of substituting one or more
occurrences of yyy for xxx in ϕϕ\phi.
Modus Ponens (MP): from ϕϕ\phi and ϕ→ψϕ→ψ\phi\to\psi, we may infer
ψψ\psi.
Rule of Generalization (GEN): from ϕϕ\phi, we may infer
∀αϕ∀αϕ\forall\alpha\phi.


In what follows, we shall assume familiarity with the above axioms and
rules as we derive Frege’s Theorem. As noted, these are
essentially the same as the axioms for the first-order predicate
calculus, except for the addition of laws for the second-order
quantifiers ∀F∀F\forall F and ∃F∃F\exists F that correspond to the
laws governing the first-order quantifiers ∀x∀x\forall x and ∃x∃x\exists
x.

Some of the above laws are found explicitly in Gg I, though
expressed in Frege’s notation. For example, in Gg
I, §47, we find Frege’s versions of the
following:


I.
ϕ→(ψ→ϕ)ϕ→(ψ→ϕ)\phi \to (\psi\to \phi) 

IIa.
∀xPx→Pa∀xPx→Pa\forall xPx \to Pa 

IIb.
∀FFx→Px∀FFx→Px\forall FFx \to Px 

III.
x=y→∀F(Fx→Fy)x=y→∀F(Fx→Fy)x = y \to \forall F (Fx \to Fy) 


These are first introduced, however, in Gg I,
§§18, 20, 25, and 20, respectively.

Though Frege essentially had a second-order logic in Gg, his
rules of inference don’t look as familiar, or as simple, as MP
and GEN. The reason is that Frege’s rules of inference govern
not only his graphical notation for molecular and quantified formulas,
but also his special purpose symbols, such as certain lowercase
letters used as placeholders, certain Gothic letters and letters used
as bound variables, and various other signs of his system we have not
yet mentioned. Since Frege’s notation for rules of inference
will play no role in the discussion that follows, we shall again
simplify our task by not describing it further.
1.3 The Theory of Concepts

The modern second-order predicate calculus includes a
comprehension principle that effectively guarantees that there
exists an nnn-place relation corresponding to every open formula
with nnn free object variables x1,…,xnx1,…,xnx_1,\ldots,x_n. We introduce this
principle by considering the following 1-place case:

Comprehension Principle for Concepts: 
∃G∀x(Gx≡ϕ)∃G∀x(Gx≡ϕ)\exists G \forall x(Gx \equiv \phi),  where ϕϕ\phi is any
formula in which GGG doesn't occur free. 

Similarly the following is a Comprehension Principle for 2-place
Relations: 

Comprehension Principle for 2-place Relations: 
∃R∀x∀y(Rxy≡ϕ)∃R∀x∀y(Rxy≡ϕ)\exists R\forall x\forall y(Rxy \equiv \phi),  where
ϕϕ\phi is any formula in which RRR doesn't occur free. 

Although Frege didn’t explicitly formulate these comprehension
principles, they are derivable in his system and constitute very
important generalizations within his system that reveal its underlying
theory of concepts and relations. We can see these principles at work
by formulating the following instance of comprehension, where
‘OxOxOx’ asserts that xxx is odd:

∃G∀x(Gx≡(Ox&x>5))∃G∀x(Gx≡(Ox&x>5))\exists G\forall x(Gx \equiv (Ox \amp x \gt 5)) 

This asserts: there exists a concept GGG such that for every object
xxx, xxx falls under GGG if and only if xxx is odd and greater
than 5. If our second-order language were extended to include the
primitive predicates ‘OOO’ and ‘>>&gt;’ and
the primitive object term ‘5’, then the above instance of
the Comprehension Principle for Concepts would be an axiom (and hence,
theorem) of second-order logic.

Similarly, the following is an instance of the Comprehension Principle
for Relations: 

∃R∀x∀y(Rxy≡(Ox&x>y))∃R∀x∀y(Rxy≡(Ox&x>y))\exists R\forall x\forall y(Rxy \equiv (Ox \amp x \gt y)) 

This asserts the existence of a relation that objects xxx and yy y
bear to one another just in case the complex condition Ox&x>yOx&x>yOx \amp x \gt
y holds.

Logicians nowadays typically distinguish the open formula ϕϕ\phi in
which the variable xxx is free from the corresponding name of a
concept. For example, they use the notation [λxOx&x>5][λxOx&x>5][\lambda x \, Ox \amp x
\gt 5] as the name of the complex concept being an xxx such
that xxx is odd and xxx is greater than 5 (or, more
naturally, ‘being odd and greater than 5’). The
term-forming operator λxλx\lambda x (which we read as ‘being an
xxx such that’) combines with a formula ϕϕ\phi in which
xxx is free to produce [λxϕ][λxϕ][\lambda x\,\phi]. The
λλ\lambda-expression is a name of the concept expressed by the
formula ϕϕ\phi. In what follows, the scope of the variable-binding
operator λxλx\lambda x in [λxϕ][λxϕ][\lambda x\,\phi] applies to the entire
formula ϕϕ\phi, no matter how complex, so that instead of writing,
for example, [λx(Ox&x>5)][λx(Ox&x>5)][\lambda x\,(Ox \amp x \gt 5)], we shall simply
write: [λxOx&x>2][λxOx&x>2][\lambda x\, Ox \amp x \gt 2].

This notation can be extended for relations. The expression:

[λxyOx&x>y][λxyOx&x>y][\lambda xy \, Ox \amp x \gt y] 

names the 2-place relation being an xxx and yyy
such that xxx is odd and xxx is greater
than yyy.

It is important to emphasize that Frege didn’t use
λλ\lambda-notation. By contrast, he thought that predicative
expressions such as ‘())\, ) is happy’ are incomplete
expressions and that the concepts they denoted were
unsaturated. We need not discuss Frege’s reasons for
this in this entry, though interested readers may consult his 1892
essay “Concept and Object”.

For the purposes of understanding Frege’s Theorem, we only need
to introduce one axiom that governs λλ\lambda-notation, namely, the
principle known as λλ\lambda -Conversion. Let ϕϕ\phi be any
formula and let ϕyxϕyx\phi^y_x be the result of substituting the
variable yyy for free occurrences of xxx everywhere in ϕϕ\phi.
Then the principle of λλ\lambda-Conversion is:

λλ\lambda-Conversion:

∀y([λxϕ]y≡ϕyx)∀y([λxϕ]y≡ϕyx)\forall y([\lambda x \, \phi]y \equiv \phi^y_x) 

This asserts: for any object yyy, yyy falls under the concept
[λxϕ][λxϕ][\lambda x \, \phi] if and only if yyy is such that
ϕyxϕyx\phi^y_x. So, using our example, the following is an instance of
λλ\lambda-conversion:

∀y([λxOx&x>5]y≡Oy&y>5)∀y([λxOx&x>5]y≡Oy&y>5)\forall y([\lambda x \, Ox \amp x \gt 5]y \equiv Oy \amp y \gt 5)


This asserts: for any object yyy, yyy falls under the
concept being odd and greater than 5 if and only if yyy is
odd and greater than 5. Note that when the quantified variable yyy
is instantiated to some object term, the resulting instance of
λλ\lambda-Conversion is a biconditional. Thus, among the many
consequences of this axiom we find: 6 falls under the
concept being odd and greater than 5 if and only if 6 is odd
and greater than 5 (in this case, the biconditional remains true
because both sides are false). 

Some logicians call the rule of inference derived from the
right-to-left direction of such biconditionals
‘λλ\lambda-Abstraction’. For example, the inference from
the premise: 

O6&6>5O6&6>5O6 \amp 6 \gt 5 

to the conclusion:

[λxOx&x>5]6[λxOx&x>5]6[\lambda x \, Ox \amp x \gt 5]6 

is justified by λλ\lambda-Abstraction. (Here we have a case of a
valid inference in which both the premise and the conclusion are both
false.)

The principle of λλ\lambda-Conversion can be generalized, so that it
governs nnn-place λλ\lambda-expressions as well. Here is the
2-place case:

∀z∀w([λxyϕ]zw≡ϕz,wx,y)∀z∀w([λxyϕ]zw≡ϕz,wx,y)\forall z\forall w([\lambda xy\, \phi]zw \equiv \phi^{z,w}_{x,y})


(In this formula ϕz,wx,yϕz,wx,y\phi^{z,w}_{x,y} is the result of simultaneously
substituting zzz for xxx and www for yyy in ϕϕ\phi.)

The reader should construct an instance of this principle using our
example [λxyOx&x>y][λxyOx&x>y][\lambda xy \, Ox \amp x \gt y].

It should be noted at this point that instead of using comprehension
principles, Frege had a distinguished rule in his system that is
equivalent to such principles, namely, his Rule of Substitution.
Though Frege’s Rule of Substitution allowed him to substitute
formulas ϕϕ\phi for free concept variables FFF in theorems of
logic, we can understand this rule in terms of the second-order logic
we’ve defined as follows: in any theorem of logic with a free
variable FnFnF^{n}, one may both substitute any nnn-place
λλ\lambda-expression [λx1…xnϕ][λx1…xnϕ][\lambda x_{1}\ldots x_{n}\, \phi] for
FnFnF^{n} and then perform λλ\lambda-conversion. For example, in the
second-order system we now have, one can infer ∀x(Ox&x>5≡Ox&x>5)∀x(Ox&x>5≡Ox&x>5)\forall x(Ox \amp x
\gt 5 \equiv Ox \amp x \gt 5) from ∀y(Fy≡Fy)∀y(Fy≡Fy)\forall y(Fy \equiv Fy) by
first substituting [λxOx&x>5][λxOx&x>5][\lambda x \, Ox \amp x \gt 5] for FFF and
then using λλ\lambda-Conversion on all the resulting subformulas
containing the λλ\lambda-expression that flank the ≡≡\equiv sign.
Frege’s Rule of Substitution allows one to do all this in one
step. Readers interested in learning a bit more about the connection
between the Rule of Substitution and Comprehension Principles
described above can consult the following supplementary document:

Frege’s Rule of Substitution


Finally, it is important to point out that the system we have just
described, i.e., second-order logic with identity and comprehension
principles, extended with λλ\lambda-expressions and
λλ\lambda-Conversion, is consistent. Its axioms are true even in
very small interpretations, e.g., ones in which the domain of objects
contains a single object and each domain of nnn-place relations (n≥1)(n≥1)
(n\geq1) has just two relations. For example, if the domain of
objects contains a single object, say b, and the domain of
1-place relations contains two concepts (i.e., one which b
falls under and one which nothing falls under), then all of the above
axioms are true, including the Comprehension Principle for Concepts
and 1-place λλ\lambda-Conversion. Even so, the system described
above requires that every concept has a negation, every pair of
concepts has a conjunction, every pair of concepts has a disjunction,
etc. The reader should be able to write down instances of the
comprehension principle which demonstrate these claims.

Readers whose main goal is to understand Frege’s Theorem can now
skip directly to Section 3.
2. Frege’s Theory of Extensions: Basic Law V

Though the present section is not required for understanding the proof
of Frege’s Theorem, we include it so that the reader can get
some sense of how second-order logic (with comprehension) gives rise
to Russell’s paradox when one adds Frege’s theory of
courses-of-values and extensions. Though we shall briefly discuss
Frege’s notation for courses-of-values, we’ll subsequently
switch to simpler notation for naming the extensions of concepts. For
the purposes of this section, let us suppose that we have primitive
function terms fff, ggg, hhh, … in our language and that
functional applications such as f(x)f(x)f(x), g(y)g(y)g(y), etc., are
allowed.

The principle that undermined Frege’s system, Basic Law V, was
one that attempted to systematize the notions ‘course-of-values
of a function’ and ‘extension of a concept’. The
course-of-values of a function fff is something like a set of
ordered pairs that records the value f(x)f(x)f(x) for every argument xx
x. For example, the course-of-values of the function father of
x records, among other things, that Bill Clinton is the value of
the function when Chelsea Clinton is the argument. The
course-of-values for the function x2x2x^2 records, among other things,
that the number 4 is the value when the number 2 is the argument, that
9 is the value when 3 is the argument, etc. When a function fff is a
concept, Frege called the course-of-values for that concept its
extension. The extension of a concept is something like the
set of all objects that fall under the concept, for the extension
records all of the objects that the concept maps to The True. For
example, the extension of the concept xxx is a positive even
integer less than 8 is something like the set consisting of the
numbers 2, 4, and 6.
2.1 Notation for Courses-of-Values of Functions

Frege introduces primitive notation for courses-of-values in
Gg I, §9. He switched to the lower case Greek
letters ϵϵ\epsilon and αα\alpha when writing the names of
courses-of-values and extensions, and placed smooth breathing marks
over them to indicate they were variable-binding operators. So:

,ϵf(ϵ),ϵf(ϵ)\stackrel{,}{\epsilon} f(\epsilon) 

and

,αg(α),αg(α)\stackrel{,}{\alpha}\! g(\alpha) 

designate the course-of-values of the functions fff and ggg,
respectively. In this notation, the symbols ,ϵ,ϵ\stackrel{,}{\epsilon}
and ,α,α\stackrel{,}{\alpha} bind the object variables ϵϵ\epsilon
and αα\alpha in the expressions f(ϵ)f(ϵ)f(\epsilon) and g(α)g(α)g(\alpha),
respectively, and the resulting expression denotes a
course-of-values.

Here is a pair of examples of Frege’s notation for
courses-of-values. This pair of examples comes from Gg
I, §9. Frege uses the expression:

,ϵ(ϵ2−ϵ),ϵ(ϵ2−ϵ)\stackrel{,}{\epsilon}\! (\epsilon^{2}- \epsilon) 

to denote the course-of-values of the function represented by the open
formula:

x2−xx2−xx^{2} - x 

He also uses:

,α(α⋅(α−1)),α(α⋅(α−1))\stackrel{,}{\alpha}\! (\alpha \cdot (\alpha - 1)) 

to denote the course-of-values of the function represented by the open
formula: 

x⋅(x−1)x⋅(x−1)x \cdot (x - 1) 

Frege then notes that if the functions x2−xx2−xx^{2} - x and x⋅(x−1)x⋅(x−1)x \cdot (x
- 1) map the same arguments to the same values, then the extensions
of those two functions are the same, and vice versa. That is, he notes
that:

∀x[x2−x=x⋅(x−1)]∀x[x2−x=x⋅(x−1)]\forall x[x^{2}-x = x \cdot (x - 1)] 

holds if and only if: 

,ϵ(ϵ2−ϵ)=,α(α⋅(α−1)),ϵ(ϵ2−ϵ)=,α(α⋅(α−1)){\stackrel{,}{\epsilon}}(\epsilon^{2} - \epsilon) =
{\stackrel{,}{\alpha}} (\alpha \cdot (\alpha - 1)) 

This equivalence will become embodied in Basic Law V. Indeed,
Frege’s formulation of Basic Law V in Gg I,
§20 can now be represented in our language (temporarily extended
with function terms and functional application) as follows: 

Basic Law V:

,ϵf(ϵ)=,αg(α)≡∀x[f(x)=g(x)],ϵf(ϵ)=,αg(α)≡∀x[f(x)=g(x)]\stackrel{,}{\epsilon}\! f(\epsilon) \eqclose \stackrel{,}{\alpha}\!
g(\alpha) \equivwide \forall x[f(x) \eqclose g(x)] 

This principle asserts: the course-of-values of the function fff is
identical to the course-of-values of the function ggg if and only if
fff and g map every object to the same value. [Actually, Frege uses
an identity sign instead of the biconditional sign as the main
connective of the principle. The reason he could do this is that, in
his system, when two sentences are materially equivalent, they
name the same truth value.] We shall soon see why this
principle is inconsistent. 
2.2 Notation for Extensions of Concepts

Since concepts, for Frege, are functions that always map their
arguments to a truth value, we may introduce some new notation to help
us represent Frege’s method of forming names of the extensions
of concepts. This new notation takes advantage of our
λλ\lambda-notation for naming concepts, and so allows us to
introduce a new kind of function term where Frege introduced a
variable-binding operator.

Let us stipulate that where ΠΠ\Pi is any 1-place concept term (name
or variable), the notation ‘ϵΠϵΠ\epsilon\Pi’ designates
the extension of the concept ΠΠ\Pi. So, for example, ϵFϵF\epsilon F
denotes the extension of the concept FFF. Note that 1-place
λλ\lambda-expressions of the form [λxϕ][λxϕ][\lambda x\,\phi] are 1-place
concept terms, and so ϵ[λxϕ]ϵ[λxϕ]\epsilon[\lambda x\,\phi] is well-formed and
designates the extension of the concept [λxϕ][λxϕ][\lambda x\,\phi]. Thus,
whereas Frege used ,ϵ,ϵ\stackrel{,}{\epsilon} as a variable-binding
operator that binds an object variable in a formula to produce the
name of an extension, we are using ϵϵ\epsilon as a term-forming
function symbol that applies to 1-place concept terms to produce terms
denoting, or ranging over, objects. Thus, when ϵϵ\epsilon is
prefixed to a concept name, the resulting expression is a name of an
object, and in particular, a name of the extension of the concept
denoted by the concept name. When the ϵϵ\epsilon is prefixed to a
concept variable, e.g., as in ϵFϵF\epsilon F, the resulting expression
is a kind of complex variable that ranges over extensions: for each
value of the variable FFF, ϵFϵF\epsilon F denotes the extension of
FFF.

Here is an example of our notation involving a pair of complex
concepts. Consider the concept that which when added to 4
equals 5, or using λλ\lambda-notation, the following
concept:

[λxx+4=5][λxx+4=5][\lambda x \, x+4 = 5] 

We use the following notation to denote the extension of this concept:


ϵ[λxx+4=5]ϵ[λxx+4=5]\epsilon[\lambda x \, x+4 = 5] 

Now consider the concept that which when added to 22222^{2}
equals 5 (i.e., [λx x+22=5])[λx x+22=5])[\lambda x~x+2^{2} = 5]). We use the
following notation to denote the extension of this concept: 

ϵ[λxx+22=5]ϵ[λxx+22=5]\epsilon[\lambda x \, x+2^{2} = 5] 

Note that it seems natural to identify these two extensions given that
all and only the objects that fall under the first concept fall under
the second. Those readers already familiar with the
λλ\lambda-calculus should remember that ϵ[λx ϕ]ϵ[λx ϕ]\epsilon[\lambda x~\phi]
denotes an object, that [λx ϕ][λx ϕ][\lambda x~\phi] denotes a concept, and
that Frege rigorously distinguished objects and concepts and supposed
them to constitute mutually exclusive domains.
2.3 Membership in an Extension

If we remember that the extension of a concept is something like the
set of objects that fall under the concept, then we could replace
Frege’s talk of ‘extensions’ by talk of
‘sets’ and use the following ‘set notation’ to
refer to the set of objects that when added to 4 yield 5 and the set
of objects that when added to 22222^{2} yield 5, respectively: 

{x∣x+4=5}{x∣x+22=5}{x∣x+4=5}{x∣x+22=5}\begin{align*}
&amp;\{x\mid x + 4 = 5\} \\
&amp;\{x\mid x + 2^{2} = 5\}
\end{align*}


Frege took advantage of his second-order language to define
what it is for an object to be a member of an extension or set.
Although Frege used the notation x∩yx∩yx \cap y to designate the
membership relation, we shall follow the more usual practice of using
x∈yx∈yx\in y. Thus, the following captures the main features of
Frege’s definition of membership in Gg I,
§34:

x∈y=df∃G(y=ϵG&Gx)x∈y=df∃G(y=ϵG&Gx)x\in y =_{df}\exists G (y\eqclose \epsilon G \amp Gx) 

In other words, xxx is an element of yyy just in case xxx falls
under a concept of which yyy is the extension. For example, given
this definition, one can prove that John is a member of the extension
of the concept being happy (formally: j∈ϵH)j∈ϵH)j \in \epsilon H)
from the premise that John falls under the concept being
happy (‘HjHjHj’). Here is a simple proof: 


1.  Hj Hj~ Hj
Premise

2.  ϵH=ϵH ϵH=ϵH~ \epsilon H = \epsilon H
Instance of axiom x=xx=xx=x

3.  ϵH=ϵH&Hj ϵH=ϵH&Hj~ \epsilon H\eqclose \epsilon H \amp Hj
from 1,2, by &-Introduction 

4. ∃G(ϵH=ϵG&Gj)∃G(ϵH=ϵG&Gj)\exists G (\epsilon H\eqclose \epsilon G \amp Gj)
from 3, by Existential
Introduction

5.  j∈ϵH j∈ϵH~ j \in \epsilon H
from 4, by definition of ∈∈\in


Some readers may wish to examine a somewhat more complex example, in
which the above definition of membership is used to prove that 1 ∈ϵ[λxx+22=5]∈ϵ[λxx+22=5]\in
\epsilon[\lambda x \, x+2^2 = 5] given the premise that 1+22=51+22=5 1+2^{2} =
5.
 (A More Complex Example)

Before we turn to Basic Law V, it is important to mention an important
fact about our representation of Frege’s system, in which
we’ve introduced the term-forming operator ϵϵ\epsilon into
second-order logic with identity. The resulting system has the
following principle, which asserts that every concept has an
extension, as a theorem:

Existence of Extensions:

∀G∃x(x=ϵG)∀G∃x(x=ϵG)\forall G\exists x(x = \epsilon G) 

To see that this is derivable given our work thus far, recall line 2
of the proof in the above example: the laws of identity allow us to
assert that:

ϵF=ϵFϵF=ϵF\epsilon F = \epsilon F 

In second-order logic with identity, this is an instance of x=xx=xx = x
(strictly speaking, one first derives ∀x(x=x)∀x(x=x)\forall x(x = x) from the
axiom x=xx=xx = x by GEN, and then instantiates the universally
quantified variable xxx to ϵFϵF\epsilon F). So, by existential
generalization, it follows that:

∃x(x=ϵF)∃x(x=ϵF)\exists x(x = \epsilon F) 

But now the Existence of Extensions principle follows by universal
generalization on the concept variable FFF. Thus, simply by adding a
term-forming operator such as ϵϵ\epsilon to classical logic with
identity, it is provable that every concept gets correlated with an
extension. Basic Law V will not only imply, but also place a condition
on, this correlation.
2.4 Basic Law V for Concepts

We can now represent the special case of Frege’s Basic Law V
that applies to concepts, using our ϵϵ\epsilon notation:

Basic Law V (Special Case):

ϵF=ϵG≡∀x(Fx≡Gx)ϵF=ϵG≡∀x(Fx≡Gx)\epsilon F\eqclose \epsilon G \equivwide \forall x(Fx \equiv Gx)


In this special case, Basic Law V asserts: the extension of the
concept FFF is identical to the extension of the concept GGG if
and only if all and only the objects that fall under FFF fall under
GGG (i.e., if and only if the concepts FFF and GGG are
materially equivalent). In more modern guise, Frege’s Basic Law
V asserts that the set of FFFs is identical to the set of GGGs if
and only if FFF and GGG are materially equivalent:

{x∣Fx}={y∣Gy}≡∀z(Fz≡Gz){x∣Fx}={y∣Gy}≡∀z(Fz≡Gz)\{x\mid Fx\}\eqclose \{y\mid Gy\} \equivwide \forall z(Fz \equiv
Gz) 

The example discussed above can now be seen as an instance of Basic
Law V:

ϵ[λyy+4=5]=ϵ[λyy+22=5]≡∀x([λyy+4=5]x≡[λyy+22=5]x)ϵ[λyy+4=5]=ϵ[λyy+22=5]≡∀x([λyy+4=5]x≡[λyy+22=5]x)\begin{align*}
&amp;\epsilon[\lambda y \, y + 4 = 5] = \epsilon[\lambda y \, y+2^{2} = 5] \equiv\\
&amp;\quad \forall x([\lambda y \, y+4 = 5]x\equiv [\lambda y \, y+2^{2} = 5]x)
\end{align*}


This asserts that the extension of the concept that which added
to 4 yields 5 is identical to the extension of the
concept that which added to 22222^{2} yields 5 if
and only if all and only the objects that when added to 4 yield 5 are
objects that when added to 22222^{2} yield 5.

There are two important corollaries to Law V that play a role in what
follows: the Law of Extensions and the Principle of Extensionality.
The Law of Extensions (cf. Gg I, §55, Theorem 1)
asserts that an object is a member of the extension of a concept if
and only if it falls under that concept:

Law of Extensions:

∀F∀x(x∈ϵF≡Fx)∀F∀x(x∈ϵF≡Fx)\forall F \forall x(x \in\epsilon F \equiv Fx) 

 (Derivation of the Law of Extensions)

Basic Law V also correctly implies the Principle of Extensionality.
This principle asserts that if two extensions have the same members,
they are identical. Let us define ‘xxx is an
extension’ as follows:

Extension(x)=df∃F(x=ϵF)Extension(x)=df∃F(x=ϵF)\mathit{Extension}(x) \eqdef \exists F (x = \epsilon F) 

Then we may formally represent and derive the principle of
extensionality as follows:

Principle of Extensionality:

Extension(x)&Extension(y)→[∀z(z∈x≡z∈y)→x=y]Extension(x)&Extension(y)→[∀z(z∈x≡z∈y)→x=y]\mathit{Extension}(x) \amp \mathit{Extension}(y) \to [\forall z(z
\in x\equiv z\in y) \to x\eqclose y] 

 (Derivation of the Principle of Extensionality)

The above facts about Basic Law V will be used in the next subsections
to show why it may not be consistently added to second-order
logic with comprehension. Frege was made aware of the inconsistency by
Bertrand Russell, who sent him a letter formulating
‘Russell’s Paradox’ just as the second volume of
Gg was going to press. Frege quickly added an
Appendix to the second volume, describing two distinct ways of
deriving a contradiction from Basic Law V. He also suggested a way of
repairing Law V, but Quine (1995) later showed that such a repair was
disastrous, since it would force the domain of objects to contain at
most one object.

In the next subsections, we describe the two ways of deriving a
contradiction from Basic Law V that Frege described in the Appendix to
Gg. The first establishes the contradiction directly, without
any special definitions. The second deploys the membership relation
and more closely follows Russell’s Paradox. As we shall see, the
following combination is a volatile mix: (a) the Comprehension
Principle for concepts, which ensures that there is a concept
corresponding to every formula with free variable xxx, (b) the
Existence of Extensions principle, which ensures every concept is
correlated with an extension, and (c) Basic Law V, which ensures that
the correlation of concepts with extensions behaves in a certain
way.
2.5 First Derivation of the Contradiction

In the Appendix to Gg II, Frege shows that a
contradiction can be derived from Basic Law V once we formulate the
concept being an x that is the extension of some concept which x
doesn’t fall under. We may use the following
λλ\lambda-expression to represent this concept: 

[λx∃F(x=ϵF&¬Fx)][λx∃F(x=ϵF&¬Fx)][\lambda x \, \exists F (x\eqclose \epsilon F \amp \neg Fx)] 

We know that there exists such a concept, since the open formula in
the scope of λxλx\lambda x can be used in the Comprehension Principle
for Concepts. Now by the Existence of Extensions principle, the
following concept exists and is correlated with it: 

ϵ[λx∃F(x=ϵF&¬Fx)]ϵ[λx∃F(x=ϵF&¬Fx)]\epsilon[\lambda x \, \exists F(x\eqclose \epsilon F \amp \neg
Fx)] 

It can now be proved that this extension falls under the concept
[λx∃F(x=ϵF&¬Fx)][λx∃F(x=ϵF&¬Fx)][\lambda x \, \exists F(x\eqclose \epsilon F \amp \neg Fx)] if and
only if it does not. 

 (First Derivation of the Contradiction.)
 
2.6 Second Derivation of the Contradiction

In the Appendix to Gg II, Frege also explains how
Basic Law V implies the existence of the paradoxical Russell set. We
can represent his reasoning as follows. From the Law of Extensions
(which was derived from Basic Law V above), one can establish a Naive
Comprehension Axiom for Extensions in three simple steps. First we
instantiate the Law of Extensions to the free variable FFF, to
yield:

∀x(x∈ϵF≡Fx)∀x(x∈ϵF≡Fx)\forall x(x \in \epsilon F\equiv Fx) 

By existentially generalizing on ϵFϵF\epsilon F, it follows that:

∃y∀x(x∈y≡Fx)∃y∀x(x∈y≡Fx)\exists y\forall x(x \in y \equiv Fx) 

Now at this point, we may universally generalize on the variable FFF
to get the following second-order Naive Comprehension Axiom for
extensions, which asserts that for every concept FFF, there is an
extension which has as members all and only the objects that fall
under FFF:

Naive Comprehension Axiom for Extensions:

∀F∃y∀x(x∈y≡Fx)∀F∃y∀x(x∈y≡Fx)\forall F\exists y\forall x(x\in y \equiv Fx) 

The Naive Comprehension Axiom gives rise to Russell’s Paradox
once we instantiate the quantified variable FFF to the concept
[λzz∉z][λzz∉z][\lambda z \, z\notinclose z], where z∉zz∉zz \notinclose z simply
abbreviates ¬(z∈z)¬(z∈z)\neg(z\in z), to yield:

∃y∀x(x∈y≡[λzz∉z]x)∃y∀x(x∈y≡[λzz∉z]x)\exists y\forall x(x\inclose y \equiv [\lambda z \, z\notinclose
z]x) 

By λλ\lambda-Conversion, this is equivalent to:

∃y∀x(x∈y≡x∉x)∃y∀x(x∈y≡x∉x)\exists y\forall x(x\inclose y \equiv x \notinclose x) 

(Note: Frege could have reached this last result in one step from
∃y∀x(x∈y≡Fx)∃y∀x(x∈y≡Fx)\exists y\forall x(x\inclose y \equiv Fx) using his Rule of
Substitution.)

The contradiction now goes as follows. Let bbb be such an object
asserted to exist by the claim we just derived. So we know: 

∀x(x∈b≡x∉x)∀x(x∈b≡x∉x)\forall x(x\inclose b \equiv x\notinclose x) 

But we can now instantiate the universally quantified variable to the
object bbb to yield the following contradiction: 

b∈b≡b∉bb∈b≡b∉bb\inclose b \equiv b\notinclose b 

(See the entry
 on Russell’s Paradox.)
2.7 How the Paradox is Engendered

We’ve now reconstructed the inconsistency in Frege’s
system by representing his logic and Basic Law V in a modern system of
second-order logic. Philosophers have diagnosed the inconsistency in
various ways, and it is safe to say that the matter is still somewhat
controversial. In this subsection, we discuss only the basic elements
of the problem. Most philosophers and logicians agree that the reason
second-order logic can’t be extended by Basic Law V is that the
resulting system requires the impossible situation in which the domain
of concepts has to be strictly larger than the domain of extensions
while at the same time the domain of extensions has to be as large as
the domain of concepts.


To analyze the inconsistency in more detail, consider
an extensional model of concepts, in which the material
equivalence of concepts FFF and GGG serves as both necessary and
sufficient conditions for the identity of FFF and GGG, i.e., in
which F=G≡∀x(Fx≡Gx)F=G≡∀x(Fx≡Gx)F = G \equiv \forall x(Fx \equiv Gx).  So, given this
understanding, if it is not the case that FFF and GGG are
materially equivalent, then FFF and GGG are distinct concepts; and
if FFF and GGG are distinct concepts, then they are not materially
equivalent.

With this extensional view of concepts in mind, we can see how a
paradox is engendered. Recall first that the Existence of Extensions
principle correlates each concept FFF with an extension ϵFϵF\epsilon
F. Each direction of Basic Law V requires that this correlation have
certain properties. We shall see, for example, that the right-to-left
direction of Basic Law V (i.e., Va) requires that no concept gets
correlated with two distinct extensions. [Frege uses the label
‘Vb’ to designate the left-to-right direction of Basic Law
V, and uses ‘Va’ for a variant of the right-to-left
direction. See, for example, Gg I, §52. However,
many commentators use ‘Va’ to designate the left-to-right
direction. We shall follow Frege’s use, since that will make
sense of his Appendix to Gg II, in which he discusses
the paradoxes by discussing Vb and Va.] We may represent Frege’s
Va as follows:

Basic Law Va:

∀x(Fx≡Gx)→ϵF=ϵG∀x(Fx≡Gx)→ϵF=ϵG\forall x(Fx \equiv Gx) \to\epsilon F = \epsilon G 

So the contrapositive asserts that if ϵF≠ϵGϵF≠ϵG\epsilon F \neq \epsilon G,
then ¬∀x(Fx≡Gx)¬∀x(Fx≡Gx)\neg \forall x(Fx \equiv Gx).  But in the case where the
material equivalence of FFF and GGG is a necessary condition for
F=GF=GF = G, i.e., in the case where ¬∀x(Fx≡Gx)¬∀x(Fx≡Gx)\neg \forall x(Fx \equiv Gx)
implies F≠GF≠GF \neq G, then Va implies that if ϵF≠ϵGϵF≠ϵG\epsilon F \neq
\epsilon G, then F≠GF≠GF \neq G, i.e., that whenever the extensions of
FFF and GGG differ, the concepts with which they are correlated,
namely FFF and GGG, differ. This means that the correlation
between concepts and extensions that Basic Law V sets up must be a
function – no concept gets correlated with two distinct
extensions (though for all Va tells us, distinct concepts might get
correlated with the same extension). Frege noted (in the Appendix
to Gg II) that this direction of Basic Law V
doesn’t seem problematic. 

However, the left-to-right direction of Basic Law V (i.e., Vb) is more
serious. We may represent Vb as follows:

Basic Law Vb:

ϵF=ϵG→∀x(Fx≡Gx)ϵF=ϵG→∀x(Fx≡Gx)\epsilon F = \epsilon G \to\forall x(Fx \equiv Gx) 

So the contrapositive asserts that if ¬∀x(Fx≡Gx)¬∀x(Fx≡Gx)\neg \forall x(Fx \equiv Gx)
then ϵF≠ϵGϵF≠ϵG\epsilon F \neq \epsilon G.  But in the case where the
material equivalence of FFF and GGG is a sufficient condition for
F=GF=GF = G, i.e., in the case where F≠GF≠GF \neq G implies ¬∀x(Fx≡Gx)¬∀x(Fx≡Gx)\neg \forall
x(Fx \equiv Gx), then Vb implies F≠G→ϵF≠ϵGF≠G→ϵF≠ϵGF \neq G \to \epsilon F \neq
\epsilon G, i.e., that if concepts FFF and GGG differ, the
extensions of FFF and GGG differ. So, the correlation that Basic
Law V sets up between concepts and extensions will have to be
one-to-one; i.e., it correlates distinct concepts with distinct
extensions. Since every concept is correlated with some extension,
there have to be at least as many extensions as there are
concepts.

But the problem is that second-order logic with Basic Law V as a
whole requires that there be more concepts than
extensions. The requirement that there be more concepts than
extensions is imposed jointly by the Comprehension Principle for
Concepts and the new significance this principle takes on in
the presence of Basic Law V. The Comprehension Principle for Concepts
asserts the existence of a concept for every condition on objects
expressible in the language. Now although it may seem that this
principle, in and of itself, forces the domain of concepts to be
larger than the domain of objects, it is a model-theoretic fact that
there are models of second-order logic with the Comprehension
Principle for Concepts (but without Basic Law V) in which the domain
of concepts is not larger than the domain of
 objects.[2]
 However, the addition of Basic Law V to Frege’s system forces
the domain of concepts to be larger than the domain of objects (and so
larger than the domain of extensions), due to the endless cycle of new
concepts that arise in connection with the new extensions contributed
by Basic Law V. However, as we saw in the last paragraph, Vb requires
that there be at least as many extensions as there are concepts.

Thus, the addition of Basic Law V to second-order logic implies an
impossible situation in which the domain of concepts has to be
strictly larger than the domain of extensions while at the same time
the domain of extensions has to be as large as the domain of
concepts.

Recently, there has been a lot of interest in discovering ways of
repairing the Fregean theory of extensions. The traditional view is
that one must either restrict Basic Law V or restrict the
Comprehension Principle for Concepts. Recently, Boolos (1986, 1993)
developed one of the more interesting suggestions for revising Basic
Law V without abandoning second-order logic and its comprehension
principle for concepts. On the other hand, there have been many
suggestions for restricting the Comprehension Principle for Concepts.
The most severe of these is to abandon second-order logic (and the
Comprehension Principle for Concepts) altogether. Schroeder-Heister
(1987) conjectured that the first-order portion of Frege’s
system (i.e., the system which results by adding Basic Law V to the
first-order predicate calculus) was consistent and this was proved by
T. Parsons (1987) and Burgess
 (1998).[3]
 Heck (1996), Wehmeier (1999), Ferreira & Wehmeier (2002), and
Ferreira (2005) consider less drastic moves. They investigate systems
of second-order logic which have been extended by Basic Law V but in
which the Comprehension Principle for Concepts is restricted in some
way. See also Anderson & Zalta (2004) and Antonelli & May
(2005) for different approaches to repairing Frege’s system. See
Fine (2002) for a discussion of the limits of Frege’s method and
see Burgess (2005) for a good general overview.

We will not discuss the above research further in the present entry,
for none of these alternatives have achieved a clear consensus.
Instead, we focus on the theoretical accomplishment revealed by
Frege’s work in Gg. As noted in the
Introduction, Frege validly proved a rather deep fact about the
natural numbers notwithstanding the inconsistency of Basic Law V. He
derived the Dedekind/Peano axioms for number theory in second-order
logic from Hume’s Principle (which was briefly mentioned above
and which will be discussed in the next section). But this fact went
unnoticed for many years. Though Geach (1955) claimed such a
derivation was possible, C. Parsons (1965) was the first to note that
Hume’s Principle was powerful enough for the derivation of the
Dedekind/Peano axioms. Though Wright (1983) actually carried out most
of the derivation, Heck (1993) showed that although Frege did use
Basic Law V to derive Hume’s principle, his (Frege’s)
subsequent derivations of the Dedekind/Peano axioms of number theory
from Hume’s Principle never made an essential appeal to
Basic Law V. Since Hume’s Principle can be consistently added to
second-order logic, we may conclude that Frege himself validly derived
the basic laws of number theory. It will be the task of the next few
sections to explain Frege’s accomplishments in this regard. We
will do this in two stages. In §3 we study Frege’s attempt
to derive Hume’s Principle from Basic Law V by analyzing
cardinal numbers as extensions. Then, we put this aside in §4 and
§5 to examine how Frege was able to derive the Dedekind/Peano
axioms of number theory from Hume’s Principle alone.
3. Frege’s Analysis of Cardinal Numbers

Cardinal numbers are the numbers that can be used to answer the
question ‘How many ……\ldots are there?’, and Frege
discovered that such numbers bear an interesting relationship to the
natural numbers. Frege’s insights concerning this relationship
trace back to his work in Gl, in which the notion of
an extension played very little role. The seminal idea of
Gl §46 was the observation that a statement of
number (e.g., “There are eight planets”) is an assertion
about a concept. To explain this idea, Frege noted that one and the
same external phenomenon can be counted in different ways; for
example, a certain external phenomenon could be counted as 1 army, 5
divisions, 25 regiments, 200 companies, 600 platoons, or 24,000
people. Each way of counting the external phenomenon corresponds to a
manner of its conception. The question “How many are
there?” is only properly formulated as the question “How
many FFFs are there?” where a concept FFF is supplied. On
Frege’s view, the statements of number which answer such
questions (e.g., “There are nnn FFFs”) tell us
something about the concept involved. For example, the statement
“There are eight planets in the solar system” tells us
that the ordinary concept planet in the solar system falls
under the second-level numerical concept being
exemplified by eight objects. 

In Gl, Frege then moves from this realization, in which
statements of numbers are analyzed as predicating second-level
numerical concepts of first-level concepts, to develop an account of
the cardinal and natural numbers as ‘self-subsistent’
objects. He introduces a ‘cardinality operator’ on
concepts, namely, ‘the number belonging to the concept FF
F’, which designates the cardinal number which numbers the
objects falling under FFF. In what follows, we say this more simply
as ‘the number of FFFs’ and use the simple notation
‘#F#F\#F’. Note that the operator # behaves like the
ϵϵ\epsilon operator – when it is prefixed to a concept name
like planet (PPP), then #P#P\#P (“the number of
planets”) denotes an object; when it is prefixed to a variable
like FFF, then #F#F\# F ranges over the domain of objects (for each
concept that FFF can take as a value, #F#F\#F denotes an object
relative to that concept). Frege offers both an implicit (i.e.,
contextual) and an explicit definition of this operator in
Gl. Both of these definitions require a preliminary
definition of when two concepts FFF and GGG are in one-to-one
correspondence or ‘equinumerous’. The notion of
equinumerosity plays an important and fundamental role in the
development of Frege’s Theorem. After developing the definition
of equinumerosity, we then discuss Frege’s implicit and explicit
definition of the number of FFFs. Only the former is needed for the
proof of Frege’s Theorem, however.
3.1 Equinumerosity

In order to state the definition of equinumerosity, we shall employ
the well-known logical notion ‘there exists a unique xxx such
that ϕϕ\phi’. To say that there exists a unique xxx such
that ϕϕ\phi is to say: there is some xxx such that ϕϕ\phi, and
anything yyy which is such that ϕϕ\phi is identical to xxx. In
what follows, we use the notation ‘∃!xϕ∃!xϕ\exists!x\phi’ to
abbreviate this notion of a formula being uniquely satisfied, and we
define it formally as follows (where again, ϕyxϕyx\phi^y_x is the result
of substituting yyy for the free occurrences of xxx in ϕϕ\phi:


∃!xϕ=df∃x[ϕ&∀y(ϕyx→y=x)]∃!xϕ=df∃x[ϕ&∀y(ϕyx→y=x)]\exists!x\phi \eqdef \exists x[\phi \amp\forall y(\phi^y_x \to y =
x)] 

Now, in terms of this logical notion of unique existence, we can state
a definition of equinumerosity that is weaker than the one Frege gives
in Gl (§§71, 72) but which nevertheless does the
job:[4]

FFF and GGG are equinumerous just in case there is a
relation RRR such that: (1) every object falling under FFF is
RRR-related to a unique object falling under GGG, and (2) every
object falling under GGG is such that there is a unique object
falling under FFF which is RRR-related to it.


In other words, FFF and GGG are equinumerous just in case there is
a relation that establishes a one-to-one correspondence between the
FFFs and the GGGs. If we let ‘F≈GF≈GF \approx G’ stand
for equinumerosity, then the definition of this notion can be rendered
formally as follows: 

F≈G=df∃R[∀x(Fx→∃!y(Gy&Rxy))&∀x(Gx→∃!y(Fy&Ryx))]F≈G=df∃R[∀x(Fx→∃!y(Gy&Rxy))&∀x(Gx→∃!y(Fy&Ryx))]\begin{align*} &amp;F \approx G \eqdef \\ &amp;\quad \exists
R[\forall x(Fx \to \exists !y(Gy \amp Rxy)) \;\amp\; \forall x(Gx \to
\exists!y (Fy \amp Ryx))] \end{align*}


To see that Frege’s definition of equinumerosity works
correctly, consider the following two examples. In the first example,
we have two concepts, FFF and GGG, that are equinumerous:



Figure 1


Although there are several different relations RRR which demonstrate
the equinumerosity of FFF and GGG, the particular relation used in
Figure 1 is:

R1=[λxy(x=a&y=f)∨(x=b&y=g)∨(x=c&y=e)]R1=[λxy(x=a&y=f)∨(x=b&y=g)∨(x=c&y=e)]R_{1} = [\lambda xy \, (x\eqclose a\amp y\eqclose f) \lor (x\eqclose
b \amp y\eqclose g) \lor (x\eqclose c\amp y\eqclose e)] 

It is a simple exercise to show that R1R1R_{1}, as defined, is a
‘witness’ to the equinumerosity of FFF and GGG
(according to the definition).

In Figure 2, we have two concepts that are not equinumerous:



Figure 2


In this example, no relation RRR can satisfy the definition of
equinumerosity.

Given the discussion so far, it seems reasonable to suggest that
concepts FFF and GGG will be equinumerous whenever the number of
objects falling under FFF is identical to the number of objects
falling under GGG. This suggestion will be codified by Hume’s
Principle. However, before discussing this principle, the reader
should convince him- or herself of the following four facts: (1) that
the material equivalence of two concepts implies their equinumerosity,
(2) that equinumerosity is reflexive, (3) that equinumerosity is
symmetric, and (4) that equinumerosity is transitive. In formal terms,
the following facts are provable:

Facts About Equinumerosity:

1. ∀x(Fx≡Gx)→F≈G∀x(Fx≡Gx)→F≈G\forall x(Fx \equiv Gx) \to F\apprxclose G 

2. F≈FF≈FF \approx F

3. F≈G→G≈FF≈G→G≈FF\apprxclose G \to G\apprxclose F

4. F≈G&G≈H→F≈HF≈G&G≈H→F≈HF\apprxclose G \amp G\apprxclose H \to F\apprxclose H 

The proofs of these facts, in each case, require the identification of
a relation that is a witness to the relevant equinumerosity claim. In
some cases, it is easy to identify the relation in question. In other
cases, the reader should be able to ‘construct’ such
relations (using λλ\lambda-notation) by considering the examples
described above. Facts (2) – (4) establish that equinumerosity
is an ‘equivalence relation’ which divides up the domain
of concepts into ‘equivalence classes’ of equinumerous
concepts.
3.2 Contextual Definition of ‘The Number of FFFs’: Hume’s Principle

In Gl, Frege contextually defined ‘the number of
FFFs’ in terms of the principle now known as Hume’s
 Principle:[5]

Hume’s Principle:

The number of FFFs is identical to the number of GGGs if and only
if FFF and GGG are equinumerous. 

Using our notation ‘#F#F\#F’ to abbreviate ‘the
number of FFFs’, we may formalize Hume’s Principle as
follows: 

Hume’s Principle:

#F=#G≡F≈G#F=#G≡F≈G\#F\eqclose \#G \equiv F \approx G 

Hume’s Principle is taken to be a contextual definition of
#F#F\#F when the latter is assumed as a primitive notion governed by
the principle: the principle doesn't explicitly define
‘#F#F\#F’, but contextually defines it by defining
contexts (in this case, identity statements) in which it
 occurs.[6]
 As we shall see, Hume's Principle is the basic principle upon which
Frege forged his development of the theory of natural numbers. In
Gl, Frege sketched the derivations of the basic laws
of number theory from Hume’s Principle; these sketches were
developed into more rigorous proofs in Gg I. We will
examine these derivations in the following sections.

Once Frege had a contextual definition of #F#F\#F, he then defined a
cardinal number as any object which is the number of some concept:

x is a cardinal number=df∃F(x=#F)x is a cardinal number=df∃F(x=#F)x \textit{ is a cardinal number} \eqdef \exists F(x = \#F) 

This represents the definition that appears in Gl,
§72.

Notice that Hume’s Principle bears an obvious formal resemblance
to Basic Law V. Both are biconditionals asserting the equivalence of
an identity among singular terms (the left-side condition) with an
equivalence relation on concepts (the right-side condition). Indeed,
both correlate concepts with certain objects. In the case of
Hume’s Principle, each concept FFF is correlated with #F#F\#F.
However, whereas Basic Law V problematically requires that the
correlation between concepts and extensions be one-to-one,
Hume’s Principle only requires that the correlation between
concepts and numbers be many-to-one. Hume’s Principle often
correlates distinct concepts with the same number. For example, the
distinct concepts author of Principia Mathematica
(‘[λxAxp][λxAxp][\lambda x \, Axp]’)
and positive integer between 1
and 4 (‘[λx1<x<4][λx1<x<4][\lambda x \, 1&lt;x&lt;4]’) are
equinumerous (both have two objects falling under them). So
#[λxAxp]#[λxAxp]\#[\lambda x\, Axp] = #[λx1<x<4]#[λx1<x<4]\#[\lambda x \, 1&lt;x&lt;4]. Thus,
Hume’s Principle, unlike Basic Law V, does not require that the
domain of numbers be as large as the domain of concepts. Indeed,
several authors have developed models that show Hume’s Principle
can be consistently added to second-order logic. See the independent
work of Geach (1976, 446–7), Hodes (1984, 138), Burgess (1984)
and Hazen (1985).
3.3 Explicit Definition of ‘The Number of FFFs’

[Note: The remaining two subsections are not strictly necessary for
understanding the proof of Frege’s Theorem. They are included
here for those who wish to have a more complete understanding of what
Frege in fact attempted to do. They presuppose the material in
§2. Readers interested in just the positive aspects of
Frege’s accomplishments should skip directly to §4.]

Before we examine the powerful consequences that Frege derived from
Hume’s Principle, it is worth digressing to describe his attempt
to define ‘#F#F\#F’ explicitly and to derive Hume’s
Principle from Basic Law V. The idea behind this attempt was the
realization that if given any concept FFF, the notion of
equinumerosity can be used to define the second-level concept
being a concept G that is equinumerous to F. Frege found a
way to collect all of the concepts equinumerous to a given concept
FFF into a single extension. In Gl §68, he
informally took this to be an extension consisting of first-order
concepts by stipulating that the number of FFFs is the extension of
the second-level concept: being a first-level concept equinumerous
to F.

In terms of the example used at the end of the previous subsection,
this informal definition identifies the number of the concept
author of Principia Mathematica as the extension consisting
of all and only those first-level concepts that are equinumerous to
this concept; this extension has both [λxAxp][λxAxp][\lambda x \, Axp] and
[λx1<x<4][λx1<x<4][\lambda x \, 1&lt;x&lt;4] as members. Frege in fact identifies
the cardinal number 2 with this extension, for it contains all and
only those concepts under which two objects fall. Similarly, Frege
identifies the cardinal number 0 with the extension consisting of all
those first-level concepts under which no object falls; this extension
would include such concepts as unicorn, centaur,
prime number between 3 and 5, etc. Frege’s
insight here inspired Russell to develop a somewhat similar definition
in his work, and it is now common to see references to the so-called
“Frege-Russell definition of the cardinal numbers” as
classes of equinumerous concepts or
 sets.[7]
 Of course, this explicit definition of ‘the number of FF
Fs’ stands or falls with a coherent conception of
‘extension’. We know that Basic Law V does not offer such
a coherent conception. 
3.4 Derivation of Hume’s Principle

Frege’s derivations of Hume’s Principle were invalidated
by the fact that it appeals to the inconsistent Basic Law V.
Neverthelss, we briefly describe in this subsection, for interested
readers, Frege’s derivations. In Gl, §73,
Frege sketches an informal proof of the right-to-left direction of
Hume’s Principle using the above informal definition of the
number of FFFs. The derivation appeals to the fact that a concept
GGG is a member of the extension of the second-level concept
concept equinumerous to F if and only if GGG is
equinumerous to FFF. In other words, the proof relies on a kind of
higher-order version of the Law of Extensions (described above), the
ordinary version of which we know to be a consequence of Basic Law
 V.[8]
 Here is a reconstruction of Frege’s proof in
Gl, §73, extended so as to cover both directions
of Hume’s Principle.

Reconstruction of the Grundlagen Derivation of Hume’s Principle


However, in the development of Gg, Frege didn’t
formulate the extensions of second-level concepts. In Gg,
extensions do not contain concepts as members but rather
objects. So Frege had to find another way to express the explicit
definition described in the previous subsection. His technique was to
let extensions go proxy for their corresponding concepts. Since a full
reconstruction of this technique and the proof of Hume’s
Principle in Gg would constitute a digression for the
present exposition, we shall describe the details for interested
readers in a separate document: 

Reconstruction of the Grundgesetze ‘Derivation’ of Hume’s Principle


Interestingly, Tennant (2004) and May & Wehmeier (forthcoming)
point out that in Gg, Frege does not, in actual fact, derive
Hume’s Principle as a biconditional. Instead, he derives both
directions separately without combining them or indicating that the
two directions should be conceived as a biconditional. Finally, as
noted on several occasions, the inconsistency in Basic Law V
invalidated Frege’s derivation of Hume’s Principle. But
Hume’s Principle, in and of itself, is a powerful and consistent
principle.
4. Frege’s Analysis of Predecessor, Ancestrals, and the Natural Numbers

In what follows, we shall suppose that the second-order predicate
calculus with which we began has been extended with (a) a primitive
##\# operator, so that we can formulate terms such as #F#F\#F to
signify ‘the number of FFFs’, and (b) a new axiom,
namely, Hume’s Principle, to govern the new terms. As previously
mentioned, Frege’s Theorem is that the Dedekind/Peano axioms of
number theory are derivable as theorems in a second-order predicate
calculus extended in this way. In this section, we introduce the
definitions required for the proof of Frege’s Theorem. In the
next section, we go through the proof. In the final section, we
conclude with a discussion of the philosophical questions that arise
when we extend the predicate calculus in this way, and take
Hume’s Principle as a replacement for Basic Law V.

Before we turn to the definitions required for the proof of
Frege’s Theorem, it would serve well to discuss one other group
of insights underlying Frege’s analysis of numbers. The first is
that the following series of concepts has a rather interesting
property:

C0=[λxx≠x]C1=[λxx=#C0]C2=[λxx=#C0∨x=#C1]C3=[λxx=#C0∨x=#C1∨x=#C2]etc.C0=[λxx≠x]C1=[λxx=#C0]C2=[λxx=#C0∨x=#C1]C3=[λxx=#C0∨x=#C1∨x=#C2]etc.\begin{align*}
&amp;C_0 = [\lambda x \, x\neqclose x] \\
&amp;C_1 = [\lambda x \, x\eqclose \#C_0] \\
&amp;C_2 = [\lambda x \, x\eqclose \#C_0 \lor x\eqclose \#C_1] \\
&amp;C_3 = [\lambda x \, x\eqclose \#C_0 \lor x\eqclose \#C_1 \lor x\eqclose \#C_2] \\
&amp;\text{etc.}
\end{align*}


The interesting property of this series is that for each concept CkCk
C_k, all and only the numbers of the concepts preceding
CkCkC_k in the sequence fall under CkCkC_k. So, for example, the
concepts preceding C3C3C_3 are C0C0C_0, C1C1C_1, and C2C2 C_2.
Accordingly, all and only the following numbers fall under C3:#C0,#C1C3:#C0,#C1
C_3:\#C_0, \#C_1, and #C2#C2\#C_2.

Frege’ next insight was that these concepts can be used,
respectively, to define the finite cardinal numbers, as follows:

0=#C01=#C12=#C23=#C3etc.0=#C01=#C12=#C23=#C3etc.\begin{align*}
&amp;0 = \#C_0 \\
&amp;1 = \#C_1 \\
&amp;2 = \#C_2 \\
&amp;3 = \#C_3 \\
&amp;\text{etc.}
\end{align*}


This insight, however, led to another. Frege realized that though we
may identify this sequence of numbers with the natural numbers, such a
sequence is simply a list: it does not constitute a definition of a
concept (e.g., natural number) that applies to all and only
the numbers defined in the sequence. Such a concept is required if we
are to prove as theorems the following axioms of
Dedekind/Peano number theory: 

Dedekind/Peano Axioms for Number Theory:


0 is a natural number.
0 is not the successor of any natural number.
No two natural numbers have the same successor.
If both (a) 0 falls under FFF, and (b) for any two natural
numbers nnn and mmm such that mmm is the successor of nnn, the
fact that nnn falls under FFF implies that mmm falls under
FFF, then every natural number falls under FFF. (Principle of
Mathematical Induction)
Every natural number has a successor.



Moreover, Frege recognized the need to employ the Principle of
Mathematical Induction in the proof that every number has a successor.
One cannot prove the claim that every number has a successor
simply by producing the sequence of expressions for cardinal numbers
(e.g., the second of the two sequences described above). All such a
sequence demonstrates is that for every expression listed in the
sequence, one can define an expression of the appropriate form to
follow it in the sequence. This is not the same as proving that 
every natural number has a successor.
4.1 Predecessor

To accomplish these further goals, Frege proceeded
(Gl, §76, and Gg I, §43)
by defining the concept xxx (immediately) precedes
yyy: 

xxx (immediately) precedes yyy if and only if
there is a concept FFF and an object www such that: (a) www
falls under FFF, (b) yyy is the number of FFFs, and (c) xx x
is the number of the concept object falling under FFF other than
w.


We may represent Frege’s definition formally in our language as
follows:

Precedes(x,y)=df∃F∃w(Fw&y=#F&x=#[λzFz&z≠w])Precedes(x,y)=df∃F∃w(Fw&y=#F&x=#[λzFz&z≠w])\begin{align*} &amp;\mathit{Precedes}(x,y) \eqdef \\ &amp;\quad
\exists F\exists w(Fw\amp y\eqclose \#F \amp x\eqclose \#[\lambda z\,
Fz \amp z\neqclose w]) \end{align*}


To illustrate this definition, let us temporarily assume that we know
some facts about the natural numbers 1 and 2 to show that the
definition properly predicts that Precedes(1,2)Precedes(1,2)\mathit{Precedes}(1,2), even
though we haven’t yet defined these natural numbers. Let the
expression ‘[λzAzp][λzAzp][\lambda z \,
Azp]’ denote the concept
author of Principia Mathematica. Only Bertrand Russell
(‘rrr’) and Alfred Whitehead fall under this concept.
Let the expression ‘[λzAzp&z≠r][λzAzp&z≠r][\lambda z \, Azp \amp
z\neqclose r]’ denote the concept author of
Principia Mathematica other than
Russell.[9]
Then the following may, for the purposes of this example, be taken as
facts: 

Russell falls under the concept author of Principia
Mathematica, i.e.,

    [λzAzp]r[λzAzp]r[\lambda z \, Azp]r
2 is the number of the concept author of Principia
Mathematica, i.e.,

    2=#[λzAzp]2=#[λzAzp]2 = \#[\lambda z \, Azp]
1 is the number of the concept author of Principia Mathematica
other than Russell, i.e.,

    1=#[λzAzp&z≠r]1=#[λzAzp&z≠r]1 = \#[\lambda z \, Azp \amp z\neqclose r] 


If we assemble these truths into a conjunction and apply existential
generalization in the appropriate places, the result is the definiens
of the definition of predecessor instantiated to the numbers 1 and 2.
Thus, if given certain facts about the number of objects falling under
the certain concepts, the definition of predecessor correctly predicts
that Precedes(1,2)Precedes(1,2)\mathit{Precedes}(1,2).
4.2 The Ancestral of a Relation R

Frege next defines the relation x is an ancestor of y in the
R-series. This new relation is called ‘the ancestral of the
relation R’ and we henceforth designate this relation
as R∗R∗R^*. Frege first defined the ancestral of a relation R
in Begr (Part III, Proposition 76), though the word
‘ancestral’ comes to us from Russell and Whitehead.
Frege’s phrase for the ancestral is: “xxx comes before
yyy in the RRR-series”; alternatively, “yyy follows
xxx in the RRR-series”. (See also Gl, §79,
and Gg I, §45.) The intuitive idea is easily
grasped if we consider the relation xxx is the father of
yyy. Suppose that aaa is the father of bbb, that bbb is the
father of ccc, and that ccc is the father of ddd. Then
‘xxx is an ancestor of yyy in the fatherhood-series’
is defined so that aaa is an ancestor of bbb, ccc, and ddd,
that bbb is an ancestor of ccc and ddd, and that ccc is an
ancestor of ddd.

Frege’s definition of the ancestral of R requires a preliminary
definition:

F is hereditary in the R-series if and only if every pair of
RRR-related objects xxx and yyy are such that yyy falls under
FFF whenever xxx falls under FFF 

In formal terms: 

Her(F,R)=abbr∀x∀y(Rxy→(Fx→Fy))Her(F,R)=abbr∀x∀y(Rxy→(Fx→Fy))\mathit{Her}(F,R) \eqabbr \forall x\forall y(Rxy \to (Fx \to Fy))


Intuitively, the idea is that FFF is hereditary in the
R-series if FFF is always ‘passed along’ from
xxx to yyy whenever xxx and yyy are a pair of
R-related objects. (We warn the reader here that the notation
‘Her(F,R)Her(F,R)\mathit{Her}(F,R)’ is merely an abbreviation of a
much longer statement. It is not a formula of our language
having the form ‘R(x,y)R(x,y)R(x,y)’. In what follows, we
sometimes introduce other such abbreviations.)

Frege’s definition of the ancestral of RRR can now be stated
as follows:

x comes before y in the R-series =df=df\eqdef y falls
under all those R-hereditary concepts F under which
falls every object to which x is R-related. 

In other words, yyy follows xxx in the R-series whenever yyy
falls under every R-hereditary concept FFF that is
exemplified by everything immediately R-related to xxx. In
formal terms: 

R∗(x,y)=df∀F[(∀z(Rxz→Fz)&Her(F,R))→Fy]R∗(x,y)=df∀F[(∀z(Rxz→Fz)&Her(F,R))→Fy]R^*(x,y) \eqdef \forall F[(\forall z(Rxz \to Fz) \amp
\mathit{Her}(F,R)) \to Fy] 

For example, Clinton’s father stands in the relation father*
of (i.e., forefather) to Chelsea because she falls under
every hereditary concept that Clinton and his brother inherited from
Clinton’s father. However, Clinton’s brother is not one of
Chelsea’s forefathers, since he fails to be her father, her
grandfather, or any of the other links in the chain of fathers from
which Chelsea descended.

It is important to grasp the differences between a relation RRR and
its ancestral R∗R∗R^*. Rxy implies R∗(x,y)R∗(x,y)R^*(x,y) (e.g., if
Clinton is a father of Chelsea, then Clinton is a forefather of
Chelsea), but the converse doesn’t hold (Clinton’s father
is a father* of Chelsea, but he is not a father of Chelsea). Indeed, a
grasp of the definition of R∗R∗R^* should leave one able to prove the
following easy consequences, many of which correspond to theorems in
Begr and
 Gg:[10]

Facts About R∗R∗R^*:

Rxy→R∗(x,y)Rxy→R∗(x,y)Rxy \to R^*(x,y)
¬∀R∀x∀y(R∗(x,y)→Rxy)¬∀R∀x∀y(R∗(x,y)→Rxy)\neg\forall R\forall x\forall y(R^*(x,y)\to Rxy)
[R∗(x,y)&∀z(Rxz→Fz)&Her(F,R)]→Fy[R∗(x,y)&∀z(Rxz→Fz)&Her(F,R)]→Fy[R^*(x,y) \amp \forall z(Rxz \to Fz) \amp \mathit{Her}(F,R)] \to
 Fy[11]
R∗(x,y)→∃zRzyR∗(x,y)→∃zRzyR^*(x,y) \to \exists z \, Rzy
[Fx&R∗(x,y)&Her(F,R)]→Fy[Fx&R∗(x,y)&Her(F,R)]→Fy[Fx \amp R^*(x,y) \amp \mathit{Her}(F,R)] \to Fy
Rxy&R∗(y,z)→R∗(x,z)Rxy&R∗(y,z)→R∗(x,z)Rxy \amp R^*(y,z) \to R^*(x,z) 
R∗(x,y)&R∗(y,z)→R∗(x,z)R∗(x,y)&R∗(y,z)→R∗(x,z)R^*(x,y) \amp R^*(y,z) \to R^*(x,z)


The reader should consider what happens when RRR is taken to be the
relation (immediately) precedes. Appealing to our
intuitive grasp of the numbers, we can say that it is an instance of
Fact (1) that if 10 precedes 11, then 10 precedes* 11. Moreover,
precedes is a witness to Fact 2: that 10 precedes* 12 does not imply
that 10 precedes 12. The transitivity of precedes* is an instance of
Fact (7). Below, when we restrict ourselves to the natural numbers, it
becomes intuitive to think of the difference between precedes and
precedes* as the difference between immediately precedes and
less-than. 
4.3 The Weak Ancestral of R

Given the notion of the ancestral of relation RRR, Frege then
defines its weak ancestral, which he termed “yyy is a member
of the RRR-series beginning with xxx” (cf.
Begr, Part III, Proposition 99; Gl,
§81, and Gg I, §46):

yyy is a member of the RRR-series beginning with xxx if
and only if either xxx bears the ancestral of RRR to yyy or x=yx=yx
= y.


In formal terms: 

R+(x,y)=dfR∗(x,y)∨x=yR+(x,y)=dfR∗(x,y)∨x=yR^{+}(x,y) \eqdef R^*(x,y) \lor x\eqclose y 

Frege would also read R+(x,y)R+(x,y)R^{+}(x,y) as: xxx is a member of the
R-series ending with yyy. Logicians call R+R+R^{+} the
‘weak-ancestral’ of RRR because it is a weakened version
of R∗R∗R^*. When we define the natural numbers below, and take RRR
to be precedes, we can intuitively regard its weak ancestral,
precedes++^{+}, as the relation
less-than-or-equal-to on the natural numbers. 

The general definition of the weak ancestral of RRR yields the
following facts, many of which correspond to theorems in
 Gg:[12]

Facts About R+R+R^{+}:

R∗(x,y)→R+(x,y)R∗(x,y)→R+(x,y)R^*(x,y) \to R^{+}(x,y)
Rxy→R+(x,y)Rxy→R+(x,y)Rxy \to R^{+}(x,y)
Rxy&R+(y,z)→R∗(x,z)Rxy&R+(y,z)→R∗(x,z)Rxy \amp R^{+}(y,z) \to R^*(x,z)
R+(x,y)&Ryz→R∗(x,z)R+(x,y)&Ryz→R∗(x,z)R^{+}(x,y) \amp Ryz \to R^*(x,z)
R∗(x,y)&Ryz→R+(x,z)R∗(x,y)&Ryz→R+(x,z)R^*(x,y) \amp Ryz \to R^{+}(x,z)
R+(x,x)R+(x,x)R^{+}(x,x)       (Reflexivity)
R∗(x,y)→∃z[R+(x,z)&Rzy]R∗(x,y)→∃z[R+(x,z)&Rzy]R^*(x,y) \to \exists z[R^{+}(x,z) \amp Rzy]

 (Proof of Fact 6 Concerning the Weak Ancestral)
[Fx&R+(x,y)&Her(F,R)]→Fy[Fx&R+(x,y)&Her(F,R)]→Fy[Fx \amp R^{+}(x,y) \amp \mathit{Her}(F,R)] \to Fy

 R^{+}(x,z)[13]


The proofs of these facts are left as exercises. 
4.4 The Concept Natural Number

Frege’s definition of natural number requires one more
preliminary definition. Frege identified the number 0 as the number of
the concept being non-self-identical. That is: 

0=df#[λxx≠x]0=df#[λxx≠x]0 \eqdef \#[\lambda x \, x\neq x] 

Since the logic of identity guarantees that no object is
non-self-identical, nothing falls under the concept being
non-self-identical. Had Frege’s explicit definition of the
#F#F\#F worked as he had intended, the number 0 would, in effect, be
identified with the extension consisting of all those extensions of
concepts under which nothing falls. However, for the present purposes,
we may note that 0 is defined in terms of (a) the primitive notion
‘the number of FFFs’ and (b) a concept ([λxx≠x])([λxx≠x])([\lambda x \,
x\neq x]) whose existence is guaranteed by our second-order logic
with identity and comprehension. It is straightforward to prove the
following Lemma Concerning Zero from this definition of 0: 

Lemma Concerning Zero:

#F=0≡¬∃xFx#F=0≡¬∃xFx\#F\eqclose 0 \equivwide \neg\exists xFx 

 (Proof of Lemma Concerning Zero)

Note that the proof appeals to Hume’s Principle and facts about
equinumerosity.

Frege’s definition of the concept natural number can
now be stated in terms of the weak-ancestral of Predecessor:

x is a natural number if and only if xxx is a member of the
predecessor-series beginning with 0 

This definition appears in Gl, §83, and
Gg I, §46 as the definition of ‘finite
number’. Indeed, the natural numbers are precisely the finite
cardinals. In formal terms, Frege’s definition becomes: 

Nx =df Precedes+(0,x)Nx =df Precedes+(0,x)Nx ~ =_{df} ~ \mathit{Precedes}^{+}(0,x) 

In what follows, we shall sometimes use the variables mmm, nnn,
and ooo to range over the natural numbers. In other words,
we’ll use formulas of the form ∀n(…n…)∀n(…n…)\forall n(\ldots n\ldots) to
abbreviate formulas of the form ∀x(Nx→…x…)∀x(Nx→…x…)\forall x(Nx \to \ldots x\ldots),
and use formulas of the form ∃n(…n…)∃n(…n…)\exists n(\ldots n\ldots) to
abbreviate formulas of the form ∃x(Nx&…x…)∃x(Nx&…x…)\exists x(Nx \amp \ldots
x\ldots).
5. Frege’s Theorem

Frege’s Theorem is that the five Dedekind/Peano axioms for
number theory can be derived from Hume’s Principle in
second-order logic. In this section, we reconstruct the proof of this
theorem; it can be extracted from Frege’s work using the
definitions and theorems assembled so far. Some of the steps in this
proof can be found in Gl. (See the Appendix to Boolos
1990 for a reconstruction.) Our reconstruction follows Frege’s
Gg in spirit and in most details, but we have tried
to simplify the presentation in several places. For a stricter
description of Frege’s Gg proof, the reader is
referred to Heck 1993. The following should help prepare the reader
for Heck’s excellent essay.
5.1 Zero is a Natural Number

The statement that zero is a natural number is an immediate
consequence of the definition of natural number:

Theorem 1:

N0N0N0 

Proof: It is a simple consequence of the definition of
‘weak ancestral’ that R+R+R^{+} is reflexive (see Fact 4
about R+R+R^{+} in our subsection on the Weak Ancestral in §4).
So Precedes+(0,0)Precedes+(0,0)\mathit{Precedes}^{+}(0,0). Hence, by the definition of natural
number, 000 is a natural number.

It seems that Frege never actually identified this fact explicitly in
Gl or labeled this fact as a numbered Theorem in
Gg I.
5.2 Zero Isn’t the Successor of Any Natural Number

It is also a simple consequence of the foregoing that 0 doesn’t
succeed any natural number. This can be represented formally as
follows: 

Theorem 2:

¬∃x(Nx&Precedes(x,0))¬∃x(Nx&Precedes(x,0))\neg\exists x(Nx \amp \mathit{Precedes}(x,0))

Proof: Assume, for reductio, that some number, say
nnn, is such that Precedes(n,0)Precedes(n,0)\mathit{Precedes}(n,0). Then, by the
definition of predecessor, it follows that there is a concept, say
QQQ and an object, say ccc, such that Qc&0=#Q&n=#[λzQz&z≠c]Qc&0=#Q&n=#[λzQz&z≠c]Qc \amp 0\eqclose \#Q \amp
n\eqclose \#[\lambda z\, Qz \amp z\neq c]. But by the Lemma
Concerning Zero (above), 0=#Q0=#Q0 = \#Q implies ¬∃xQx¬∃xQx\neg\exists xQx,
which contradicts the fact that QcQcQc.

See Gl, §78, Item (6); and Gg
I, §109, Theorem 126.
5.3 No Two Natural Numbers Have the Same Successor

The fact that no two natural numbers have the same successor is
somewhat more difficult to prove (cf. Gl, §78,
Item (5); Gg I, §95, Theorem 89). We may
formulate this theorem as follows, with mmm, nnn, and ooo as
restricted variables ranging over the natural numbers: 

Theorem 3:

∀m∀n∀o[Precedes(m,o)&Precedes(n,o)→m=n]∀m∀n∀o[Precedes(m,o)&Precedes(n,o)→m=n]\forall m\forall n\forall o[\mathit{Precedes}(m,o)\amp
\mathit{Precedes}(n,o) \to m = n] 

In other words, this theorem asserts that predecessor is a one-to-one
relation on the natural numbers. To prove this theorem, it suffices to
prove that predecessor is a one-to-one relation full stop. One can
prove that predecessor is one-to-one from Hume’s Principle, with
the help of the following Equinumerosity Lemma, the proof of which is
rather long and involved. The Equinumerosity Lemma asserts that when
FFF and GGG are equinumerous, xxx falls under FFF, and yy y
falls under GGG, then the concept object falling under F other
than x is equinumerous to the concept object falling under G
other than yyy. The picture is something like this: 




Figure 3


In terms of Figure 3, the Equinumerosity Lemma tells us that if there
is a relation RRR which is a witness to the equinumerosity of FF F
and GGG, then there is a relation R′R′R' which is a witness to the
equinumerosity of the concepts that result when you restrict FF F
and GGG to the objects other than xxx and yyy, respectively.


To help us formalize the Equinumerosity Lemma, let F−xF−xF^{-x}
abbreviate the concept [λzFz&z≠x][λzFz&z≠x][\lambda z \, Fz \amp z\neq x] and let
G−yG−yG^{-y} abbreviate the concept [λzGz&z≠y][λzGz&z≠y] [\lambda z \, Gz \amp z \neq
y]. Then we have:

Equinumerosity Lemma:

F≈G&Fx&Gy→F−x≈G−yF≈G&Fx&Gy→F−x≈G−yF\apprxclose G \amp Fx \amp Gy \to F^{-x}\apprxclose G^{-y} 

 (Proof of Equinumerosity Lemma)

Now we can prove that Predecessor is a one-to-one relation from this
Lemma and Hume’s Principle (cf. Gg I,
§108): 


Predecessor is One-to-One:

∀x∀y∀z[Precedes(x,z)&Precedes(y,z)→x=y]∀x∀y∀z[Precedes(x,z)&Precedes(y,z)→x=y]\forall x\forall y\forall z[\mathit{Precedes}(x,z) \amp
\mathit{Precedes}(y,z) \to x\eqclose y]  

Proof: Assume that both a and b are precedessors of ccc. By
the definition of predecessor, we know that there are concepts and
objects PPP, QQQ, ddd, and eee, such that:

Pd&c=#P&a=#P−dQe&c=#Q&b=#Q−ePd&c=#P&a=#P−dQe&c=#Q&b=#Q−e\begin{align*}
&amp; Pd \amp c\eqclose \#P \amp a\eqclose \#P^{-d} \\
&amp; Qe \amp c\eqclose \#Q \amp b\eqclose \#Q^{-e} 
\end{align*}


But if both c=#Pc=#Pc = \#P and c=#Qc=#Qc = \#Q, then #P=#Q#P=#Q\#P = \#Q. So, by
Hume’s Principle, P≈QP≈QP \approx Q. So, by the Equinumerosity
Lemma, it follows that P−d≈Q−eP−d≈Q−eP^{-d} \approx Q^{-e}. If so, then by
Hume’s Principle, #P−d=#Q−e#P−d=#Q−e\#P^{-d} = \#Q^{-e}. But then, a=ba=ba =
b.


So, if Predecessor is a one-to-one relation, it is a one-to-one
relation on the natural numbers. Therefore, no two numbers have the
same successor. This completes the proof of Theorem 3.

It is important to mention here that not only is Predecessor a
one-to-one relation, it is also a functional relation:

Predecessor is a Functional Relation:

∀x∀y∀z[Precedes(x,y)&Precedes(x,z)→y=z]∀x∀y∀z[Precedes(x,y)&Precedes(x,z)→y=z]\forall x\forall y\forall z[\mathit{Precedes}(x,y)\amp
\mathit{Precedes}(x,z)\to y\eqclose z] 

This fact can be proved with the help of a kind of converse to the
Equinumerosity Lemma: 

Equinumerosity Lemma ‘Converse’:

F−x≈G−y&Fx&Gy,o,F≈GF−x≈G−y&Fx&Gy,o,F≈GF^{-x}\apprxclose G^{-y} \amp Fx \amp Gy \towide F\apprxclose G


We leave the proof of the Equinumerosity Lemma ‘Converse’
and the proof of Predecessor is a Functional Relation as exercises for
the reader.
5.4 The Principle of Mathematical Induction

Let us say that a concept FFF is hereditary on the natural
numbers just in case every ‘adjacent’ pair of numbers
nnn and mmm (nnn preceding mmm) is such that mmm falls under
FFF whenever nnn falls under FFF, i.e.,

HerOn(F,N)=abbr∀n∀m[Precedes(n,m)→(Fn→Fm)]HerOn(F,N)=abbr∀n∀m[Precedes(n,m)→(Fn→Fm)]\mathit{HerOn}(F,N) \eqabbr \forall n\forall
m[\mathit{Precedes}(n,m)\to (Fn \to Fm)] 

Then we may state the Principle of Mathematical Induction as follows:
if (a) 000 falls under FFF and (b) FFF is hereditary on the
natural numbers, then every natural number falls under FFF. In
formal terms:

Theorem 4: Principle of Mathematical
Induction:

F0&HerOn(F,N)→∀nFnF0&HerOn(F,N)→∀nFnF0 \amp \mathit{HerOn}(F,N) \to \forall n Fn 

Frege actually proves the Principle of Mathematical Induction from a
more general principle that governs any RRR-series whatsoever. We
will call the latter the General Principle of Induction. It asserts
that whenever a falls under FFF, and FFF is hereditary on the
RRR-series beginning with aaa, then every member of that
RRR-series falls under FFF. We can formalize the General Principle
of Induction with the help of a strict understanding of
‘hereditary on the RRR-series beginning with aaa’.
Here is a definition:

HerOn(F,aR+)=abbr∀x∀y[R+(a,x)&R+(a,y)&Rxy,o,(Fx→Fy)]HerOn(F,aR+)=abbr∀x∀y[R+(a,x)&R+(a,y)&Rxy,o,(Fx→Fy)]\begin{align*}
&amp;\mathit{HerOn}(F, {}^{a}R^{+}) \eqabbr  \\
&amp;\quad \forall x\forall y[R^{+}(a,x)\amp R^{+}(a,y) \amp Rxy \towide (Fx \to Fy)]
\end{align*}


In other words, FFF is hereditary on the members of the RRR-series
beginning with aaa just in case every adjacent pair xxx and yyy
in this series (with xxx bearing RRR to yyy) is such that yyy
falls under FFF whenever xxx falls under FFF. Now given this
definition, we can reformulate the General Principle of Induction more
strictly as: 

General Principle of Induction:

[Fa&HerOn(F,aR+)] → ∀x[R+(a,x)→Fx][Fa&HerOn(F,aR+)] → ∀x[R+(a,x)→Fx][Fa \amp \mathit{HerOn}(F, {}^{a}R^{+})] ~\to~ \forall x[R^{+}(a,x)
\to Fx] 

This is a version of Frege’s Theorem 152 in Gg
I, §117.

We may sketch the proof strategy as follows. Assume that the
antecedent of the General Principle of Induction holds for an
arbitrarily chosen concept, say PPP. That is, assume:

Pa&HerOn(P,aR+)Pa&HerOn(P,aR+)Pa \amp \mathit{HerOn}(P, {}^{a}R^{+}) 

Now to show ∀x(R+(a,x)→Px)∀x(R+(a,x)→Px)\forall x(R^{+}(a,x) \to Px), pick an arbitrary
object, say bbb, and further assume R+(a,b)R+(a,b)R^{+}(a,b). We then simply
have to show PbPbPb. We do this by invoking Fact (7) about R+R+R^{+}
(in our subsection on the Weak Ancestral in §4). Recall that Fact
(7) is: 

[Fx&R+(x,y)&Her(F,R)]→Fy[Fx&R+(x,y)&Her(F,R)]→Fy[Fx \amp R^{+}(x,y) \amp \mathit{Her}(F,R)] \to Fy 

This is a theorem of logic containing the free variables xxx, yyy,
and FFF. First, we instantiate xxx and yyy to aaa and bbb,
respectively. Then, we instantiate FFF to the concept [λzR+(a,z)&Pz][λzR+(a,z)&Pz][\lambda z
\, R^{+}(a,z) \amp Pz] and apply λλ\lambda-Conversion (though
Frege could simply use his Rule of Substitution to achieve the same
inference). The concept being instantiated for FFF is the concept
member of the R-series beginning with a and which falls under
P. The result of instantiating the free variables in Fact (7) and
then applying λλ\lambda-Conversion yields a rather long conditional,
with numerous conjuncts in the antecedent and the claim that PbPbPb in
the consequent. Thus, if the antecedent can be established, the proof
is done. For those following along with pencil and paper, all of the
conjuncts in the antecedent are things we already know, with the
exception of the claim that [λzR+(a,z)&Pz][λzR+(a,z)&Pz][\lambda z \, R^{+}(a,z)\amp Pz] is
hereditary on RRR. However, this claim can be established
straightforwardly from things we know to be true (and, in particular,
from facts contained in the antecedent of the Principle we are trying
to prove, which we assumed as part of our conditional proof). The
reader is encouraged to complete the proof as an exercise. For those
who would like to check their work, we give the complete Proof of the
General Principle of Induction here: 

Proof of the General Principle of Induction


Now to derive Principle of Mathematical Induction from the General
Principle of Induction, we formulate an instance of the latter by
setting aaa to 000 and RRR to Precedes:

[F0&HerOn(F,0Precedes+)],o,∀x[Precedes+(0,x)→Fx][F0&HerOn(F,0Precedes+)],o,∀x[Precedes+(0,x)→Fx]{[}F0 \amp \mathit{HerOn}(F, {}^{0}\mathit{Precedes}^{+}){]} \towide
\forall x{[}\mathit{Precedes}^{+}(0,x) \to Fx{]} 

When we expand the defined notation for HerOnHerOn\mathit{HerOn}, substitute
the notation NxNxNx and NyNyNy for Precedes+(0,x)Precedes+(0,x)\mathit{Precedes}^{+}(0,x) and
Precedes+(0,y)Precedes+(0,y)\mathit{Precedes}^{+}(0,y), respectively, and then employ our
restricted quantifiers ∀n(…n…)∀n(…n…)\forall n(\ldots n\ldots) and ∀m(…m…)∀m(…m…)\forall
m(\ldots m\ldots) for the claims of the form ∀y(Ny→…y…)∀y(Ny→…y…)\forall y(Ny \to
\ldots y\ldots) and ∀x(Nx→…x…)∀x(Nx→…x…)\forall x(Nx \to \ldots x\ldots),
respectively, the result is the Principle of Mathematical Induction
(in which the notation HerOn(F,N)HerOn(F,N)\mathit{HerOn}(F,N) has been eliminated in
terms of its definiens). 
5.5 Every Natural Number Has a Successor

Frege uses the Principle of Mathematical Induction to prove that every
natural number has a successor that's a natural number. We may
formulate the theorem as follows:

Theorem 5:

∀x[Nx→∃y(Ny&Precedes(x,y))]∀x[Nx→∃y(Ny&Precedes(x,y))]\forall x{[}Nx \to \exists y(Ny \amp \mathit{Precedes}(x,y)){]}


To reconstruct Frege’s strategy for proving this theorem, recall
that the weak ancestral of the Predecessor relation, i.e.,
Precedes+(x,y)Precedes+(x,y)\mathit{Precedes}^{+}(x,y), can be read as: xxx is a member of
the predecessor-series ending with yyy. Frege then considers the
concept member of the predecessor-series ending with n, i.e.,
[λzPrecedes+(z,n)][λzPrecedes+(z,n)][\lambda z \, \mathit{Precedes}^{+}(z,n)], where nnn is a
natural number. Frege then shows, by induction, that every natural
number nnn precedes the number of the concept member of the
predecessor-series ending with n. That is, Frege proves that
every natural number has a successor by proving the following Lemma on
Successorsby induction:

Lemma on Successors:

∀nPrecedes(n,#[λzPrecedes+(z,n)])∀nPrecedes(n,#[λzPrecedes+(z,n)])\forall n \mathit{Precedes}(n,\#[\lambda z \,
\mathit{Precedes}^{+}(z,n)]) 

This asserts that every natural number nnn precedes the number of
numbers in the predecessor series ending with nnn. Frege can
establish Theorem 5 by proving the Lemma on Successors and by showing
that the successor of a natural number is itself a natural number.

To see an intuitive picture of why the Lemma on Successors gives us
what we want, we may temporarily regard Precedes+Precedes+\mathit{Precedes}^{+} as
the relation ≤. (One can prove that Precedes+Precedes+\mathit{Precedes}^{+} has
the properties that ≤ has on the natural numbers.) Although we
haven’t yet assigned any meaning to the numerals ‘1’
and ‘2’, the following intuitive sequence is driving
Frege’s strategy:

0 precedes #[λzz≤0]1 precedes #[λzz≤1]2 precedes #[λzz≤2]etc.0 precedes #[λzz≤0]1 precedes #[λzz≤1]2 precedes #[λzz≤2]etc.\begin{align*}
&amp;0 \text{ precedes } \#[\lambda z \, z \leq 0] \\
&amp;1 \text{ precedes } \#[\lambda z \, z \leq 1] \\
&amp;2 \text{ precedes } \#[\lambda z \, z \leq 2] \\
&amp;\text{etc.}
\end{align*}


For example, the third member of this sequence is true because there
are 3 natural numbers (0, 1, and 2) that are less than or equal to 2;
so the number 2 precedes the number of numbers less than or equal to
2. Frege’s strategy is to show that the general claim, that
nnn precedes the number of numbers less than or equal to nnn,
holds for every natural number. So, given this intuitive understanding
of the Lemma on Successors, Frege has a good strategy for proving that
every number has a successor. (For the remainder of this subsection,
the reader may wish to continue to think of Precedes+Precedes+\mathit{Precedes}^{+}
in terms of ≤≤\leq.)

Now to prove the Lemma on Successors by induction, we need to
reconfigure this Lemma to a form which can be used as the consequent
of the Principle of Mathematical Induction; i.e., we need something of
the form ∀nFn∀nFn\forall n\, Fn. We can get the Lemma on Successors into
this form by ‘abstracting out’ a concept from the Lemma
using the right-to-left direction of λλ\lambda-Conversion (i.e.,
λλ\lambda-Abstraction) to produce the following equivalent statement
of the Lemma:

∀n[λyPrecedes(y,#[λzPrecedes+(z,y)])]n∀n[λyPrecedes(y,#[λzPrecedes+(z,y)])]n\forall n [\lambda y \, \mathit{Precedes}(y, \#[\lambda z \,
\mathit{Precedes}^{+}(z,y)])]n 

The concept ‘abstracted out’ is the following:

[λyPrecedes(y,#[λzPrecedes+(z,y)])][λyPrecedes(y,#[λzPrecedes+(z,y)])][\lambda y\, \mathit{Precedes}(y,\#[\lambda z \,
\mathit{Precedes}^{+}(z,y)])] 

This is the concept: being an object yyy which precedes
the number of the concept: member of the predecessor series ending
in yyy. Let us abbreviate the λλ\lambda-expression that
denotes this concept as ‘QQQ’. Our strategy is to
instantiate the variable FFF in the Principle of Mathematical
Induction to QQQ. The result is therefore something that has been
proved and that we therefore know to be true: 

Q0&HerOn(Q,N)→∀nQnQ0&HerOn(Q,N)→∀nQnQ0 \amp \mathit{HerOn}(Q,N) \to \forall nQn 

Since the consequent is the reconfigured Lemma on Successors, Frege
can prove this Lemma by proving both that 000 falls under QQQ (cf.
Gg I, Theorem 154) and that QQQ is hereditary on
the natural numbers (cf. Gg I, Theorem 150): 

Proof that 000 falls under QQQ


Proof that QQQ is hereditary on the natural numbers


Given this proof of the Lemma on Successors, Theorem 5 is not far
away. The Lemma on Successors shows that every number precedes some
cardinal number of the form #F#F\#F. We still have to show that such
successor cardinals are natural numbers. That is, it still remains to
be shown that if a number nnn precedes something yyy, then yyy
is a natural number: 

Successors of Natural Numbers are Natural Numbers:

∀n∀y(Precedes(n,y)→Ny)∀n∀y(Precedes(n,y)→Ny)\forall n\forall y (\mathit{Precedes}(n,y) \to Ny)

Proof: Suppose that Precedes(n,a)Precedes(n,a)\mathit{Precedes}(n,a). Then, by
definition, since nnn is a natural number,
Precedes+(0,n)Precedes+(0,n)\mathit{Precedes}^{+}(0,n). So by Fact (3) about R+R+R^{+} (in the
subsection on the Weak Ancestral in §4), it follows that
Precedes∗(0,a)Precedes∗(0,a)\mathit{Precedes}^*(0,a), and so by the definition of
Precedes+Precedes+\mathit{Precedes}^{+}, it follows that
Precedes+(0,a)Precedes+(0,a)\mathit{Precedes}^{+}(0,a); i.e., aaa is a natural number.

Theorem 5 now follows from the Lemma on Successors and the fact that
successors of natural numbers are natural numbers. With the proof of
Theorem 5, we have completed the proof of Frege’s Theorem.
Before we turn to the last section of this entry, it is worth
mentioning the mathematical significance of this theorem. 
5.6 Arithmetic

From Frege’s Theorem, one can derive arithmetic. It is an
immediate consequence Theorem 5 and the fact that Predecessor is a
functional relation that every number has a unique successor.
That means we can define the successor function by adding definite
descriptions of the form ‘the xxx such that ϕϕ\phi’ to
our language:

n′=dfn′=dfn' \eqdef the xxx such that Precedes(n,x)Precedes(n,x)\mathit{Precedes}(n,x) 

We may then define the sequence of natural numbers succeeding 000 as
follows:

1=0′2=1′3=2′etc.1=0′2=1′3=2′etc.\begin{align*}
&amp;1 = 0' \\
&amp;2 = 1' \\
&amp;3 = 2' \\
&amp;\text{etc.}
\end{align*}


Moreover, the recursive definition of addition can now be given: 

n+0=nn+m′=(n+m)′n+0=nn+m′=(n+m)′\begin{align*}
&amp;n + 0 = n \\
&amp;n + m' = (n + m)'
\end{align*}


We may also officially define:

n<m=dfPrecedes∗(n,m)n≤m=dfPrecedes+(n,m)n<m=dfPrecedes∗(n,m)n≤m=dfPrecedes+(n,m)\begin{align*}
&amp;n &lt; m \eqdef \mathit{Precedes}^*(n,m) \\
&amp;n ≤ m \eqdef \mathit{Precedes}^{+}(n,m)
\end{align*}


These definitions constitute the foundations of arithmetic. Frege has
thus insightfully derived the basic laws of arithmetic from
Hume’s Principle in second-order logic. (Readers interested in
how these results are affected when Hume’s Principle is combined
with predicative second-order logic should consult Linnebo
2004.)
6. Philosophical Questions Surrounding Frege’s Theorem

As we've now seen, the proof of Frege’s Theorem can be carried
out independently of the portion of Frege’s system which led to
inconsistency. Frege himself never identified “Frege’s
Theorem” as a “result”. As previously noted, he
attempted to derive Hume’s Principle from Basic Law V in
Gg, but once the contradiction became known to him,
he never officially retreated to the ‘fall-back’ position
of claiming that the proof of the Dedekind-Peano axioms from
Hume’s Principle alone constituted an important result. One of
several reasons why he didn’t adopt this fall-back position is
that he didn’t regard Hume’s Principle as a sufficiently
general principle – he didn’t believe it was strong
enough, from an epistemological point of view, to help us answer the
question, “How are numbers given to us?”. We discuss the
thinking behind this attitude, and other things, in what follows.

A discussion of the philosophical questions surrounding Frege’s
Theorem should begin with some statement of how Frege conceived of his
own project when writing Begr, Gl,
and Gg. It seems clear that epistemological
considerations in part motivated Frege’s work on the foundations
of mathematics. It is well documented that Frege had the following
goal, namely, to explain our knowledge of the basic laws of arithmetic
by giving an answer to the question “How are numbers
‘given’ to us?” without making an appeal to the
faculty of intuition. If Frege could show that the basic laws of
number theory are derivable from analytic truths of logic, then he
could argue that we need only appeal to the faculty of understanding
(as opposed to some faculty of intuition) to explain our knowledge of
the truths of arithmetic. Frege’s goal then stands in contrast
to the Kantian view of the exact mathematical sciences, according to
which general principles of reasoning must be supplemented by a
faculty of intuition if we are to achieve mathematical knowledge. The
Kantian model here is that of geometry; Kant thought that our
intuitions of figures and constructions played an essential role in
the demonstrations of geometrical theorems. (In Frege’s own
time, the achievements of Frege’s contemporaries Pasch, Pieri
and Hilbert showed that such intuitions were not essential.)
6.1 Frege’s Goals and Strategy in His Own Words

Frege’s strategy then was to show that no appeal to intuition is
required for the derivation of the theorems of number theory. This in
turn required that he show that the latter are derivable using only
rules of inference, axioms, and definitions that are purely analytic
principles of logic. This view has become known as
‘Logicism’. Here is what Frege says: 


[Begr, Preface, p. 5:]

To prevent anything intuitive from penetrating here unnoticed, I had
to bend every effort to keep the chain of inferences free of gaps.
[from the Bauer-Mengelberg translation in van Heijenoort 1967]

[Begr, Part III, §23:]

Through the present example, moreover, we see how pure thought,
irrespective of any content given by the senses or even by an
intuition a priori, can, solely from the content that results
from its own constitution, bring forth judgements that at first sight
appear to be possible only on the basis of some intuition. ……\ldots
The propositions about sequences [RRR-series] in what follows far
surpass in generality all those that can be derived from any intuition
of sequences. [from the Bauer-Mengelberg translation in van Heijenoort
1967]

[Gl, §62:]

How, then, are numbers to be given to us, if we cannot have any ideas
or intuitions of them? Since it is only in the context of a
proposition that words have any meaning, our problem becomes this: To
define the sense of a proposition in which a number word occurs. [from
the Austin translation in Frege 1974]

[Gl, §87:]

I hope I may claim in the present work to have made it probable that
the laws of arithmetic are analytic judgements and consequently a
priori. Arithmetic thus becomes simply a development of logic, and
every proposition of arithmetic a law of logic, albeit a derivative
one. [from the Austin translation in Frege 1974]

[Gg I, §0:]

In my Grundlagen der Arithmetik, I sought to make it
plausible that arithmetic is a branch of logic and need not borrow any
ground of proof whatever from either experience or intuition. In the
present book, this shall be confirmed, by the derivation of the
simplest laws of Numbers by logical means alone. [from the Furth
translation in Frege 1967]

[Gg II, Appendix:]

The prime problem of arithmetic is the question, In what way are we to
conceive logical objects, in particular, numbers? By what means are we
justified in recognizing numbers as objects? Even if this problem is
not solved to the degree I thought it was when I wrote this volume,
still I do not doubt that the way to the solution has been found.
[from the Furth translation in Frege 1967]

6.2 The Basic Problem for Frege’s Strategy

The basic problem for Frege’s strategy, however, is that for his
logicist project to succeed, his system must at some point include
(either as an axiom or theorem) statements that explicitly assert the
existence of certain kinds of abstract entities and it is not obvious
how to justify the claim that we know such explicit existential
statements. Given the above discussion, it should be clear that Frege
at some point in Gg endorsed existence claims, either directly
in his formalism or in his metalanguage, for the following entities:


concepts (more generally, functions)
extensions (more generally, courses-of-value or value-ranges)
truth-values
numbers


Although Frege attempted to reduce the latter two kinds of entities
(truth-values and numbers) to extensions, the fact is that the
existence of concepts and extensions are derivable from his Rule of
Substitution and Basic Law V, respectively.

In light of these existence claims, a Kantian might well suggest not
only that explicit existence claims are synthetic rather than analytic
(i.e., aren’t true in virtue of the meanings of the words
involved) but also that since the Rule of Substitution and Basic Law V
imply existence claims, Frege cannot claim that such principles are
purely analytic principles of logic. If the Kantian is right, then
some other faculty (such as intuition) might still be needed to
account for our knowledge of the existence claims of arithmetic.
6.3 The Existence of Concepts

Boolos (1985) noted that the Rule of Substitution causes a problem of
this kind for Frege’s program given that it is equivalent the
Comprehension Principle for Concepts. Boolos suggests a defense for
Frege with respect to this particular aspect of his logic, namely, to
reinterpret (by paraphrasing) the second-order quantifiers so as to
avoid commitment to concepts. (See Boolos (1985) for the details.)
Boolos’s suggestion, however, is one which would require Frege
to abandon his realist theory of concepts. Moreover, although
Boolos’s suggestion might lead us to an epistemological
justification of the Comprehension Principle for Concepts, it
doesn’t do the same for the Comprehension Principle for
Relations, for his reinterpretation of the quantifiers works only for
the ‘monadic’ quantifiers (i.e., those ranging over
concepts having one argument) and thus doesn’t offer a
paraphrase for quantification over relational concepts.

Another problem for a strategy of the type suggested by Boolos is that
if the second-order quantifiers are interpreted so that they do not
range over a separate domain of entities, then there is nothing
appropriate to serve as the denotations of λλ\lambda-expressions.
Although Frege wouldn’t quite put it this way, our
reconstruction suggests that Frege treats open formulas with free
object variables as if they denoted concepts. Although Frege
doesn’t use λλ\lambda-notation, the use of such notation seems
to be the most logically perspicuous way of reconstructing his work.
The use of such notation faces the same epistemological puzzles that
Frege’s Rule of Substitution faces.

To see why, note that the Principle of λλ\lambda-Conversion:

∀y([λxϕ]y≡ϕyx)∀y([λxϕ]y≡ϕyx)\forall y([\lambda x\, \phi ]y \equiv \phi^y_x) 

seems to be an analytic truth of logic. It says this: 

An object yyy exemplifies the complex property being such
that ϕϕ\phi if and only if yyy is such that ϕϕ\phi. 

One might argue that this is true in virtue of the very meaning of the
λλ\lambda-expression, the meaning of ≡≡\equiv, and the meaning of
the statement [λxϕ]y[λxϕ]y[\lambda x\, \phi]y (which has the form Fx)Fx) Fx).
However, λλ\lambda-Conversion also implies the Comprehension
Principle for Concepts, for the latter follows from the former by
existential generalization: 

∃F∀y(Fy≡ϕyx)∃F∀y(Fy≡ϕyx)\exists F\forall y(Fy \equiv \phi^y_x) 

The point here is that the fact that an existential claim is derivable
casts at least some doubt on the purely analytic status of
λλ\lambda-Conversion. The question of how we obtain knowledge of
such principles is still an open question in philosophy. It is an
important question to address, since Frege’s most insightful
definitions are cast using quantifiers ranging over concepts and
relations (e.g., the ancestrals of a relation) and it would be useful
to have a philosophical explanation of how such entities and the
principles which govern them become known to us. In contemporary
philosophy, this question is still poignant, since many philosophers
do accept that properties and relations of various
sorts exist. These entities are the contemporary analogues of
Frege’s concepts.
6.4 The Existence of Extensions

Though the existence of extensions falls right out of the theory of
identity (§2.3) once terms of the form ϵFϵF\epsilon F are added
to second-order logic, the existence of extensions that are correlated
one-to-one with concepts is a consequence of Basic Law V. The question
for Frege’s project, then, is why should we accept as a law of
logic a statement that implies the existence of individuals and a
correlation of this kind? Frege recognized that Basic Law V’s
status as a logical law could be doubted: 

[Gg I, Preface, p. 3:]

A dispute can arise, so far as I can see, only with regard to my Basic
Law concerning courses-of-values (V) ……\ldots I hold that it is a
law of pure logic. [from the Furth translation in Frege 1967]


Moreover, he thought that an appeal to extensions would answer one of
the questions that motivated his work: 

[Letter to Russell, July 28, 1902:]

I myself was long reluctant to recognize ranges of values and hence
classes [sets]; but I saw no other possibility of placing arithmetic
on a logical foundation. But the question is, How do we apprehend
logical objects? And I have found no other answer to it than this, We
apprehend them as extensions of concepts, or more generally, as ranges
of values of functions. [from the Kaal translation in Frege 1980]


Now it is unclear why Frege thought that he could answer the question
posed here by saying that we apprehend numbers as the extensions of
concepts. He seems to think we can answer the obvious next question
“How do we apprehend extensions?” by saying “by way
of Basic Law V”. 

His idea here seems to be that since Basic Law V is supposed to be
purely analytic or true in virtue of the meanings of its terms, we
apprehend a pair of extensions whenever we truly judge that concepts
FFF and GGG are materially equivalent. Some philosophers do argue
that certain
consistent principles having the same logical form as Basic
Law V are analytic, and that such principles justify
reference to the entities described in the left-side
condition by grounding such reference in the truth of the
right-side
 condition.[14]

Why did Frege think that Basic Law V is analytic and that the material
equivalence of concepts FFF and GGG is analytically equivalent to
an identity that implies the existence of extensions? To hold that
Basic Law V is analytic, it seems that one must hold that the
right-side condition implies the corresponding left-side condition as
a matter of
 meaning.[15]
 This view, however, can be questioned. Suppose the right hand
condition implies the left-side condition as a matter of meaning. That
is, suppose that (R) implies (L) as a matter of meaning:

∀x(Fx≡Gx)ϵF=ϵG∀x(Fx≡Gx)ϵF=ϵG(R)(L)\begin{align*}
\tag{R} &amp;\forall x(Fx \equiv Gx) \\
\tag{L} &amp;\epsilon F = \epsilon G
\end{align*}


Now note that (L) itself can be analyzed, from a logical point of
view. The expression ‘ϵFϵF\epsilon F’, though constructed
from a term-forming operator, is really a definite description
(‘the extension of FFF’) and so, using
Russell’s theory of descriptions, (L) can be logically analyzed
as the claim: 

There is an object xxx and an object yyy such that:

(1) xxx is a unique extension of FFF,

(2) yyy is a unique extension of GGG, and

(3) x=yx=yx = y. 

That is, for some defined or primitive notion
Extension(x,F)Extension(x,F)\mathit{Extension}(x,F) (‘xxx is an extension of
FFF’), (L) implies the analysis (D) as a matter of
meaning:

∃x∃y[Extension(x,F)&∀z(Extension(z,F)→z=x) &Extension(y,G)&∀z(Extension(z,G)→z=y)&x=y]∃x∃y[Extension(x,F)&∀z(Extension(z,F)→z=x) &Extension(y,G)&∀z(Extension(z,G)→z=y)&x=y](D)\begin{align*} \tag{D} &amp;\exists x\exists
y[\mathit{Extension}(x,F) \amp \forall z(\mathit{Extension}(z,F) \to
z\eqclose x)\ \amp \\ &amp;\quad \mathit{Extension}(y,G) \amp \forall
z(\mathit{Extension}(z,G) \to z\eqclose y) \amp x\eqclose y]
\end{align*}


But if (R) implies (L) as a matter of meaning, and (L) implies (D) as
a matter of meaning, then (R) implies (D) as a matter of meaning. This
conclusion can be questioned: why should the material equivalence of
FF and GG imply the existence claim (D) as a matter of meaning?
In other words, the suggestion that Va (i.e., the right-to-left
direction of Basic Law V) is analytic leads to a question that has no
obvious answer. Below, this line of reasoning will be adapted to
question the analyticity of the right-to-left direction of
Hume’s Principle. See Boolos 1997 (307–309), for reasons
why VbVb (the left-to-right direction of Hume’s Principle) is
not analytic.]

The moral to be drawn here is that, even if Basic Law V were
consistent, it is not exactly clear how its right side analytically
implies the existence of extensions. In the end, we may need some
other way of justifying our knowledge of principles like Basic Law V,
that imply the existence of abstract objects – the justification
discussed so far seems to contain a gap. Even if we follow Frege in
conceiving of extensions as ‘logical objects’, the
question remains: how can the claims that such objects exist be true
on logical or analytic grounds alone? We might agree that there must
be logical objects of some sort if logic is to have a subject matter,
but if Frege is to achieve his goal of showing that our knowledge of
arithmetic is free of intuition, then at some point he has to address
the question of how we can know that numbers exist. We’ll return
to this issue in the final subsection.
6.5 The Existence of Numbers and Truth-Values: The Julius Caesar Problem

Given that the proof of Frege’s Theorem makes no appeal to Basic
Law V, some philosophers have argued Frege’s best strategy for
producing an epistemologically-justified foundation for arithmetic is
to replace the primitive term ϵF\epsilon F with the primitive term
#F\#F, replace Basic Law V with Hume’s Principle, and argue
that Hume’s Principle is an analytic principle of
 logic.[16]
 However, we have just seen one reason why such a strategy does not
suffice. The claim that Hume’s Principle is an analytic
principle of logic is subject to the same problem just posed for Basic
Law V. A reason must be given as to why the claim:

F≈GF \approx G 

implies, as a matter of meaning, that:

#F=#G\#F = \#G 

After all, the statement “#F=#G\#F = \#G” is analyzable in
a manner analogous to the way we analyzed “ϵF=ϵG\epsilon F =
\epsilon G” in the previous section, where we used
Russell’s theory of description to analyze the sentence (L) as
the sentence (D). Following that pattern, we take the primitive notion
Numbers(x,F)\mathit{Numbers}(x,F) and analyze #F=#G\#F = \#G as:

∃x∃y[Numbers(x,F)&∀z(Numbers(z,F)→z=x) &Numbers(y,G)&∀z(Numbers(z,G)→z=y)&x=y]\begin{align*} &amp;\exists x\exists y[\mathit{Numbers}(x,F) \amp
\forall z(\mathit{Numbers}(z,F) \to z\eqclose x)\ \amp \\ &amp;\quad
\mathit{Numbers}(y,G) \amp \forall z (\mathit{Numbers}(z,G) \to
z\eqclose y) \amp x\eqclose y] \end{align*}


It is not clear why we should think that this last claim is implied by
F≈GF \approx G as a matter of meaning. The right-to-left direction of
Hume’s Principle is not obviously analytic.

Moreover, Frege had his own reasons for not replacing Basic Law V with
Hume’s Principle. One reason was that he thought Hume’s
Principle offered no answer to the epistemological question,
‘How do we grasp or apprehend logical objects, such as the
numbers?’. A second reason is that Hume’s Principle is
clearly subject to ‘the Julius Caesar problem’. Frege
first raises this problem in connection with an inductive definition
of ‘n=#Fn = \#F’ that he tries out in Gl,
§55. Concerning this definition, Frege says:

[Gl, §56:]

… but we can never – to take a crude example —
decide by means of our definitions whether any concept has the number
Julius Caesar belonging to it, or whether that conqueror of Gaul is a
number or is not. [from the Austin translation in Frege 1974]


Frege raises this same concern again for a contextual definition that
gives a ‘criterion of identity’ for the objects being
defined. In Gl §66, Frege considers the
following contextual definition of ‘the direction of line
xx’: 

The direction of line aa = the direction of line bb if and only
if aa is parallel to bb.


With regard to this definition, Frege says: 

[Gl, §66:]

It will not, for instance, decide for us whether England is the same
as the direction of the Earth’s axis – if I may be
forgiven an example which looks nonsensical. Naturally no one is going
to confuse England with the direction of the Earth’s axis; but
that is no thanks to our definition of direction. [from the Austin
translation in Frege 1974]


Now trouble for Hume’s Principle begins to arise when we
recognize that it is a contextual definition that has the same logical
form as this definition for directions. It is central to Frege’s
view that the numbers are objects, and so he believes that it
is incumbent upon him to say which objects they are. But the
‘Julius Caesar problem’ is that Hume’s Principle, if
considered as the sole principle offering identity conditions for
numbers, doesn’t describe the conditions under which an
arbitrary object, say Julius Caesar, is or is not to be identified
with the number of planets. That is, Hume’s Principle
doesn’t define the condition ‘#F=x\#F = x’, for
arbitrary xx. It only offers identity conditions when xx is an
object known to be a cardinal number (for then x=#Gx = \#G, for some
GG, and Hume’s Principle tells us when #F=#G\#F = \#G).

In Gl, Frege solves the problem by giving his
explicit definition of numbers in terms of extensions. (We described
this in §4 above.) Unfortunately, this is only a stopgap measure,
for when Frege later systematizes extensions in Gg,
Basic Law V has the same logical form as Hume’s Principle and
the above contextual definition of directions. Frege is aware that the
Julius Caesar problem affects Basic Law V, as the discussion in
Gg I, §10 shows. In that section, he says
(remembering that for Frege, ϵ\epsilon binds object variables and
is not a function term):

[Gg I, §10:]

…\ldots this by no means fixes completely the denotation of a name
like ‘,ϵΦ(ϵ)\stackrel{,}{\epsilon}\!\Phi(\epsilon)’.
We have only a means of always recognizing a course-of-values if it is
designated by a name like ‘,ϵΦ(ϵ)\stackrel{,}{\epsilon}\!\Phi
(\epsilon)’, by which it is already recognizable as a
course-of-values. But, we can neither decide, so far, whether an
object is a course-of-values that is not given us as such …\ldots
[from the Furth translation in Frege 1967]


In other words, Basic Law V does not tell us the conditions under
which an arbitrarily chosen object xx may be identified with some
given extension, such as ϵF\epsilon F.

Until recently, it was thought that Frege solved this problem in
§10 by restricting the universal quantifier ∀x\forall x of his
Gg system so that it ranges only over extensions. If
Frege could have successfully restricted this quantifier to
extensions, then when the question arises, whether (arbitrarily
chosen) object xx is identical with ϵF\epsilon F, one could
answer that xx has to be the extension of some concept, say G G,
and that Basic Law V would then tell you the conditions under which
xx is identical to ϵF\epsilon F. On this interpretation of
§10, Frege is alleged to have restricted the quantifiers when he
identified the two truth values (The True and The False) with the two
extensions that contain just these objects as members, respectively.
By doing this, it was thought that all of the objects in the range of
his quantifier ∀x\forall x in Gg become extensions
which have been identified as such, for the truth values were the only
two objects of his system that had not been introduced as extensions
or courses of value.

However, recent work by Wehmeier (1999) suggests that, in §10,
Frege was not attempting to restrict the quantifiers of his system to
extensions (nor, more generally, to courses-of-values). The extensive
footnote to §10 indicates that Frege considered, but did not hold
much hope of, identifying every object in the domain with the
extension consisting of just that
 object.[17]
 But, more importantly, Frege later considers cases (in
Gg, Sections 34 and 35) which seem to presuppose that
the domain contains objects which aren’t extensions. (In these
sections, Frege considers what happens to the definition of ‘x
x is a member of yy’ when yy is not an
 extension.)[18]

Even if Frege somehow could have successfully restricted the
quantifiers of Gg to avoid the Julius Caesar problem,
he would no longer have been able to apply his system by extending it
to include names of ordinary non-logical objects. For if he were to
attempt to do so, the question, “Under what conditions is
ϵF\epsilon F identical with Julius Caesar?”, would then be
legitimate but have no answer. That means his logical system could not
be used for the analysis of ordinary language. But it was just the
analysis of ordinary language that led Frege to his insight that a
statement of number is an assertion about a concept.
6.6 Final Observations

Even when we replace the inconsistent Basic Law V with the powerful
Hume’s Principle, Frege’s work still leaves two questions
unanswered: (1) How do we know that numbers exist?, and (2) How do we
precisely specify which objects they are? The first question arises
because Hume’s Principle doesn’t seem to be a purely
analytic truth of logic; if neither Hume’s Principle nor the
existential claim that numbers exist is analytically true, by what
faculty do we come to know (the truth of) the existential claim? The
second question arises because the Julius Caesar problem applies to
Hume's Principle; without a solution to that problem, Frege can't
claim to have precisely specified which objects the numbers are, so as
to delineate them within the domain of all logical and non-logical
objects? So questions about the very existence and identity of numbers
still affect Frege’s work.

These two questions arise because of a limitation in the logical form
of these Fregean biconditional principles such as Hume’s
Principle and Basic Law V. These contextual definitions combine two
jobs which modern logicians now typically accomplish with separate
principles. A properly reformulated theory of ‘logical’
objects should have separate principles: (1) one or more principles
which assert the existence of logical objects, and (2) a
separate identity principle which asserts the conditions under which
logical objects are identical. The latter should specify
identity conditions for logical objects in terms of their most salient
characteristic, one which distinguishes them from other objects. Such
an identity principle would then be more specific than the global
identity principle for all objects (Leibniz’s Law) which asserts
that if objects xx and yy fall under the same concepts, they are
identical.

By way of example, consider modern set theory. Zermelo set theory (Z)
(Z) has several distinctive set existence principles. For example,
consider the well-known Subset (or Separation) Axiom:

Subset (Separation) Axiom of Z:

∀x[Set(x)→∃y[Set(y)&∀z(z∈y≡(z∈x&ϕ))]]\forall x[\mathit{Set}(x) \to \exists y[\mathit{Set}(y) \amp \forall
z(z \in y \equiv (z \in x \amp \phi))]],

where ϕ\phi is any formula in which yy isn’t free 

The Subset Axiom and the other set existence axioms in Z are distinct
from Z’s identity principle for sets:

Identity Principle for Sets:

Set(x)&Set(y)→[∀z(z∈x≡z∈y)→x=y]\mathit{Set}(x) \amp \mathit{Set}(y) \to [\forall z(z \in x \equiv z
\in y) \to x\eqclose y] 

Note that the second principle offers identity conditions in terms of
the most salient features of sets, namely, the fact that they, unlike
other objects, have members. The identity conditions for objects which
aren’t sets, then, can be the standard principle that
identifies objects whenever they fall under the same concepts. This
leads us naturally to a very general principle of identity for any
objects whatever:

General Principle of Identity: 

x=y=df[Set(x)&Set(y)&∀z(z∈x≡z∈y)] ∨[¬Set(x)&¬Set(y)&∀F(Fx≡Fy)]\begin{align*} &amp;x = y \eqdef [\mathit{Set}(x) \amp
\mathit{Set}(y) \amp \forall z(z \in x \equiv z \in y)]\ \lor \\
&amp;\quad [\neg \mathit{Set}(x) \amp \neg \mathit{Set}(y) \amp
\forall F(Fx \equiv Fy)] \end{align*}


Now, if something is given to us as a set and we ask whether
it is identical with an arbitrarily chosen object xx, this
specifies a clear condition that settles the matter. The only
questions that remain for the theory ZZ concern its existence
principle: Do we know that the Subset Axiom and other set existence
principles are true, and if so, how? The question of existence is thus
laid bare. We do not approach it by attempting to justify a principle
that implies the existence of sets via definite descriptions which we
don’t yet know to be well-defined.

In some classic essays (1987 and 1986), Boolos appears to recommend
this very procedure of using separate existence and identity
principles. In those essays, he eschews the primitive mathematical
relation of set membership and suggests that Frege could formulate his
theory of numbers (‘Frege Arithmetic’) by using a single
nonlogical comprehension axiom which employs a special
instantiation relation that holds between a concept GG and an
object xx whenever, intuitively, xx is an extension consisting
solely of concepts and GG is a concept ‘in’ xx. He
calls this nonlogical axiom ‘Numbers’ and uses the
notation ‘GηxGηx’ to signify that GG is in
xx:

Numbers:

∀F∃!x∀G(Gηx≡G≈F)\forall F\exists !x\forall G(Gηx \equiv G\approx F) 

[See Boolos 1987 (5), 1986 (140).] This principle asserts that for any
concept FF, there is a unique object which contains in it all and
only those concepts GG which are equinumerous to FF. Boolos then
makes two observations: (1) Frege can then define #F\#F as
“the unique object xx such that for all concepts GG, GG
is in xx iff GG is equinumerous to FF”, and (2)
Hume’s Principle is derivable from Numbers. [See Boolos 1986
(140).] Given these observations, we know from our work in
§§4 and 5 above that Numbers suffices for the derivation of
the basic laws of arithmetic.

Since Boolos calls this principle ‘Numbers’, it is no
stretch to suppose that he would accept the following reformulation
(in which ‘Number(x)\mathit{Number}(x)’ is an undefined,
primitive notion):

Numbers:

∀F∃!x[Number(x)&∀G(Gηx≡G≈F)]\forall F\exists !x [\mathit{Number}(x) \amp \forall G(Gηx
\equiv G\approx F)] 

Though Boolos doesn’t explicitly formulate an identity principle
to complement Numbers, it seems clear that the following principle
would offer identity conditions in terms of the most distinctive
feature of numbers:

Identity Principle for Numbers:

Number(x)&Number(y)→[∀G(Gηx≡Gηy)→x=y]\mathit{Number}(x) \amp \mathit{Number}(y) \to [\forall G(Gηx
\equiv Gηy) \to x\eqclose y] 

It is then straightforward to formulate a general principle of
identity, as we did in the case of the set theory ZZ: 

General Principle of Identity: 

x=y=df[Number(x)&Number(y)&∀F(Fηx≡Fηy)]∨[¬Number(x)&¬Number(y)&∀F(Fx≡Fy)]\begin{align*} &amp;x = y \eqdef [\mathit{Number}(x)\amp
\mathit{Number}(y) \amp \forall F(Fηx \equiv Fηy)] \:\lor \\
&amp;\quad [\neg \mathit{Number}(x) \amp \neg \mathit{Number}(y) \amp
\forall F(Fx\equiv Fy)] \end{align*}


This formulation of Frege Arithmetic, in terms of Numbers and the
General Principle of Identity, puts the Julius Caesar problem
(described above) into better perspective; the condition ‘#F=x\#F
= x’ is defined for arbitrary concepts FF and objects
xx. It openly faces the epistemological questions head-on: Do we
know that Numbers is true, and if so, how? This is where philosophers
need to concentrate their energies. [For a reconstruction of Frege
Arithmetic with a more general version of the special instantiation
relation η, see Zalta 1999.] 

By replacing Fregean biconditionals such as Hume’s Principle
with separate existence and identity principles, we reduce two
problems to one and and isolate the real problem for Fregean
foundations of arithmetic, namely, the problem of giving an
epistemological justification for distinctive existence claims (e.g.,
Numbers) for abstract objects of a certain kind. For if anything like
Frege’s program is to succeed, it must at some point assert (as
an axiom or theorem) the existence of (logical) objects of some kind.
Those separate existence claims should be the focus of attention.
