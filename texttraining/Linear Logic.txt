Linear logic is a refinement of classical and intuitionistic logic.
Instead of emphasizing truth, as in classical logic, or
proof, as in intuitionistic logic, linear logic emphasizes the
role of formulas as resources. To achieve this focus, linear
logic does not allow the usual structural rules of contraction and
weakening to apply to all formulas but only those formulas marked with
certain modals. Linear logic contains a fully involutive negation while
maintaining a strong constructive interpretation. Linear logic also
provides new insights into the nature of proofs in both classical and
intuitionistic logic. Given its focus on resources, linear logic has
found many applications in Computer Science.
 
1. Introduction
1.1 A bit of history


Linear logic was introduced by Jean-Yves Girard in his
seminal work
(Girard 1987).
 While the origin of the discovery of this new logic comes from a
semantical analysis of the models of System F (or polymorphic λλ\lambda-calculus), 
one can see the whole system of linear logic as a bold
attempt to reconcile the beauty and symmetry of the systems for
classical logic with the quest for constructive proofs that had led to
intuitionistic logic.


Indeed, one could present a fragment of linear logic, known as
multiplicative additive linear logic (MALL), as the outcome
of two simple observations.
 In the sequent calculus presentation of classical logic, the
rules for the connectives “and” and
“or”, as well as the Cut rule and the rule for
implication may be presented equivalently in an additive form (the
context of the premises are the same) or a multiplicative form (the
context of the premises are different). These two presentations are
equivalent, in classical logic, because of the availability of a few
so-called “structural” rules, namely, contraction and
weakening.
The non-constructive proofs that one can perform in classical logic
actually use, in the sequent calculus presentation, one or the other of
these structural rules.



So, if we want to eliminate the non-constructive proofs without
destroying the symmetry of the sequent calculus, as is done in
intuitionistic logic, we can try to eliminate the contraction and
weakening rules instead. In doing so, we are left with two different
versions of each connective: an additive version and a multiplicative
version of conjunction and of disjunction. These different versions
of the same connecitve are now no longer equivalent. These new
connectives are & (“with”, additive and),
⊕⊕\oplus (“plus”, additive or, ⊗⊗\otimes
(“tensor”, multiplicative and) and ⅋⅋\lpar
(“par”, multiplicative or).

This duplication of the connectives actually leads to a much clearer
understanding of the conflict between classical and intuitionistic
logic. For example, the law of excluded middle (AAA or
not-AAA) is considered valid in the classical world and absurd in
the intuitionistic one. But in linear logic, this law has two
readings: the additive version (A⊕¬A)(A⊕¬A)(A \oplus \neg A) is not provable
and corresponds to the intuitionistic reading of disjunction; the
multiplicative version (A⅋¬A)(A⅋¬A)(A \lpar \neg A) is trivially provable and
simply corresponds to the tautology (A(A(A
implies A)A)A) that is perfectly acceptable in
intuitionistic logic too.


Also, the disjunction property, essential in constructivism, is
easily established for the additive disjunction.


We find then inside this richer logic a way to represent both the
needs of intuitionism and the elegance of classical logic: negation is
involutive, sequents are symmetric, and connectives are inter-definable.
Contrast these properties with those of intuitionistic logic,
where negation is not involutive, sequents are not symmetric, and
connectives are all not inter-definable.


Notice though that once one has eliminated the contraction and
weakening rule, formulas no longer behave as immutable truth values:
indeed, when we have a proof of A⇒BA⇒BA \Rightarrow B and a
proof of AAA in linear logic, by composing them we actually
consume them to get a proof of BBB, so that A⇒BA⇒BA \Rightarrow B and AAA are no longer available after the
composition. Linear logic formulas behave now more like
resources that can only be used once.


To recover the full expressive power of intuitionistic and classical
logic, it is then necessary to add to the MALL fragment two dual
modalities, which are usually called exponentials in the
linear logic literature. In particular, the “of-course”
exponential !!\bang permits contraction and weakening to be
applied to the formula !B!⁡B\bang B in the left-hand sequent context
while the “why-not” exponential
??\quest permits contraction and weakening to be applied to
the formula ?B?⁡B\quest B on the right-hand sequent context. This
leads to the full propositional linear logic and to a very nice
connection with computer science.

Notice that besides MALL, there are two other widely used fragments of
Linear Logic: Multiplicative Linear Logic (MLL), which is MALL without
the additive connectives; and Multiplicative Exponential Linear Logic
(MELL), which is Linear Logic without the additive connectives.


Prior to the introduction of linear logic in 1987, various researchers
had been working on various kinds of substructural logic in which not
all of Gentzen’s structural rules (contraction, weakening, and
exchange) are accepted. Lambek studied a sequent calculus proof
systems in which none of these structural rules were permitted (Lambek 1958).
Other examples of such logics are relevant logic (in which weakening
is not accepted)
(Avron 1988, Read 1988).
and affine logic (in which contraction is not accepted)
(Grishin 1981).

1.2 Linear logic and computer science


Proof-theory is focused on formal proof systems and such formal
systems have been developed for intuitionistic predicate calculus,
classical predicate calculus, arithmetics, higher-order calculi, among
many others. Intuitionistic and constructive logic began when people
saw the possibility of reading ‘A⇒BA⇒BA \Rightarrow B’ as
‘if you give me an AAA, I will give you a BBB’, which
is a significant departure from the classical reading ‘AAA is
false or BBB is true’.


Computer science, on the other hand, focuses on computational
mechanisms: function application, exception handling, method
invocation in object-oriented languages, variable assignment and
similar sets of process-building rules. Except that the mechanisms of
these processes have to be made explicit: a function of type A→BA→BA
\rightarrow B gives a formal account of how to transform an AAA
into a BBB.


At a given moment these two senses met. H. B. Curry and W. Howard
realized that the set of implication-only intuitionistic
deductions was a core functional language called simply-typed
λλ\lambda-calculus: the programming language was a logic, the logic a
programming language. This memorable meeting was called the
‘Curry-Howard isomorphism’ 
(Howard 1980).


Linear logic provides a further twist in the interpretation of the implication
‘A⇒BA⇒BA \Rightarrow B’: now it can be read as ‘give me
as many AAA's as I might need and I will give you
one BBB’. The notion of copy which is
so central to the idea of computation is now wired into the logic.



This new viewpoint opens up new possibilities, including:

new formulas expressing refined operational properties
like ‘give me AAA once and I will give you
BBB’. Applications here range from refined logic programming
where the ability of linear logic to represent states is put to use
(Hodas & Miller, 1994), to the analysis
of classical logic and computational interpretations thereof
(Abramsky 1993), to the specification of
exception mechanisms in programming languages
(Miller, 1996), to linearity analysis
(Wadler, 1991).
new rules expressing constraints on the use of copies
resulting in a fragment of linear logic for polytime computations to
mention only the most spectacular application 
(Baillot & Terui, 2004, 
Baillot 2015).
new ways of representing proofs
(Abramsky & Jagadeesan, 1994,
Girard 1987).


2. Proof Systems


The core propositional connectives of linear logic are divided into
additive and multiplicative connectives. The classical conjunction and
its identity, ∧∧\wedge and ⊤⊤\top, split into the additive
&&\amp (with) and ⊤⊤\top (top) and the multiplicative ⊗⊗\otimes
(tensor) and 1 (one). Similarly, the classical disjunction and its
identity, ∨∨\vee and ⊥⊥\bot, split into the additive ⊕⊕\oplus
(oplus) and 0 (zero) and the multiplicative ⅋⅋\lpar (par) and
⊥⊥\bot (bottom). Negation is generally treated in one of two ways in
presentations a linear logic. Negation can be viewed as a primitive
propositional connective with no restrictions on its occurrences
within formulas. Since De Morgan dualities exist between negation and
all propositional connectives, exponentials, and quantifiers, it is
also possible to treat negation as a special symbol that only occurs
applied to atomic formulas. Implications are also commonly introduced
into linear logic via definitions: the linear implication B−∘CB−∘CB \limp
C can be defined as B⊥⅋CB⊥⅋CB^{\bot} \lpar C, while the intuitionistic
implication B⇒CB⇒CB \Rightarrow C can be defined as !B−∘C!⁡B−∘C\bang B \limp
C. The operators !!\bang and ??\quest are variously called
modals or exponentials. The term “exponential” is
particularly appropriate since, following the usual relationship
between exponentiation, addition, and multiplication, linear logic
supports the equivalences !(B&C)≡(!B⊗!C)!⁡(B&C)≡(!⁡B⊗!⁡C)\bang (B \amp C) \equiv (\bang B \otimes
\bang C) and ?(B⊕C)≡(?B⅋?C)?⁡(B⊕C)≡(?⁡B⅋?⁡C)\quest(B \oplus C) \equiv (\quest B \lpar \quest C),
as well as the 0-ary versions of these equivalences, namely,
(!⊤≡1)(!⁡⊤≡1)(\bang\top \equiv 1) and (?0≡⊥)(?⁡0≡⊥)(\quest 0 \equiv \bot). Here, we use the
binary equivalence B≡CB≡CB \equiv C to mean that the formula (B−∘C)&(C−∘B)(B−∘C)&(C−∘B)(B \limp
C) \amp(C \limp B) is derivable in linear logic.
2.1 Sequent calculus


A two-sided sequent calculus for linear logic is presented in the
figure below. Notice here that negation is treated as if it were any
other logic connective: that is, its occurrences in formulas are not
restricted and there are introduction rules on the left and right for
negation.  The left and right side of sequents are multiset of
formulas: thus, the order of formulas in these contexts does not
matter but their multiplicity does matter.

Notice that the rules of weakening and
contraction are available only for formulas marked with the
exponential !!\bang on the left or ??\quest on
the right of the sequent. 
The ??\questR and !!\bangL rules
are often called “dereliction” rules.
The ??\questL and !!\bangR rules
are often called “promotion” rules and are the same as the
possibility and necessity rules found in Kripke’s S4 modal logic.
The usual proviso for the ∀∀\forall-right and
∃∃\exists-left introduction rules are assumed: in particular, the
variable yyy must not be free in the formulas of the lower sequent
of those inference rules. Quantification here is assumed to
be first-order: higher-order versions of linear logic can be written
along standard lines.


The cut rule can be eliminated and completeness is still maintained.
Dually, the init rule can also be eliminated as well except
for the occurrences of init involving atomic formulas.
2.2 Focused proofs


An important normal form theorem for the structure of cut-free
proofs was provided by Andreoli
 (1992).
He classified a non-atomic formula as asynchronous if its
top-level logical connective is ⊤⊤\top, &, ⊥,⅋⊥,⅋\bot , \lpar,
??\quest, or ∀∀\forall or synchronous if its
top-level logical connective is 0,⊕,1,⊗0,⊕,1,⊗0, \oplus , 1, \otimes,
!!\bang, or ∃∃\exists.


When viewing proof search as a computational model, we can see
formulas in a sequent as being “agents” that may act
independently or in concert with others in their environment. Here, the actions
of such agents are determined by reading the introduction rule for them
bottom-up. If an asynchronous formula occurs on the right of a sequent,
it can evolve without affecting provability and without interacting
with its context,
i.e., the corresponding introduction rule is invertible. 
For example, the agent (B⅋C)(B⅋C)(B \lpar C) becomes (by applying the ⅋⅋\lpar-right introduction rule)
the two agents BBB and CCC (now working in parallel).
Similarly, the agent (B&C)(B&C)(B \amp C) yields (by applying
the &-right introduction rule) two different identical worlds
(sequents) except that BBB is in one of these worlds and
CCC is in the other.


On the other hand, if we view a synchronous formula as an agent
whose evolution is determined by the corresponding right-introduction
rule, then it is possible for a provable sequent to evolve to a
non-provable sequent (for example, by applying the ⊕⊕\oplus
right-introduction rule). Also, the instances of such inference rules
depend on details of the context of the formula. For example, the
success of the 1-right introduction rule requires that the surrounding
context is empty and the success of the ⊗⊗\otimes-right
introduction rule depends on how the agent’s surrounding context is
divided into two contexts. Thus, the evolution of such agents
depends on “synchronizing” with other parts of the
context.


Now consider a one-sided sequent calculus presentation of linear
logic where the only introduction rules are right-introduction rules.
Given the above classification of connectives, it is possible to show
that proof search can be structured into the following phases without
loss of completeness. The asynchronous phase occurs if there
is an asynchronous formula present in the sequent. In this phase,
right-introduction rules are applied in any order until there are no
further asynchronous formulas. In the synchronous phase some
synchronous formula is selected and becomes the “focus” of
this phase: that is, right-introduction rules are applied to it and to
any synchronous subformula that it might generate.


The following figure illustrates the focusing proof system linear
logic. Notice that the two phases are represented by different arrows:
the up-arrow denotes the asynchronous phase and the down-arrow denotes
the synchronous phase. Also, sequents are divided into three zones
(where the zones are separated by either a semicolon or an up or down-arrow).
In particular, to the left of the up-arrow and down-arrow are the two zones.
The zone written as ΨΨ\Psi denotes a set of
formulas that can be used any number of times in the proof of that sequent.
The zone written as ΔΔ\Delta denotes a multiset of formulas
that are restricted as in MALL.
The zone to the right of an up-arrow is also a multiset of
formulas while the zone to the right of a down-arrow is a single formula.
It is
possible to impose an arbitrary order on the formulas to the right of
the up-arrow since the introduction of asynchronous formulas can be
done in any order. 
Atoms are given polarity and in the figure below,
AAA stands for positive atoms and the negation of AAA stands 
for negative atoms.
Proofs built by these inference rules are called
focused proofs. The result in
 Andreoli 1992
 is that focused proofs are complete for linear logic.

Focused proof systems have also been designed for classical and intuitionistic
logics (Danos et al. 1997; 
Laurent et al. 2005; 
Liang & Miller 2009).
2.3 Proof nets


Proofs presented using sequent calculus contain a lot of detail that
sometimes is uninteresting: consider for example how many
uninterestingly different ways there are to form a proof of ⊢Γ,(A1⅋A2),…,(An−1⅋An)⊢Γ,(A1⅋A2),…,(An−1⅋An)\vdash \Gamma , (A_1\lpar A_2),
\ldots ,(A_{n-1}\lpar A_n) from a derivation of ⊢Γ,A1,A2,…,An⊢Γ,A1,A2,…,An\vdash \Gamma ,
A_1, A_2 , \ldots ,A_n. This unpleasant fact derives from the
sequential nature of proofs in sequent calculus: if we want to apply a
set SSS of nnn rules to different parts of a sequent, we
cannot apply them in one step, even if they do not interfere with each
other! We must sequentialize them,
i.e., choose a linear order on SSS and apply the rules in
nnn steps, according to this order.


A natural question arises: “Is there a representation of
proofs that abstracts from such uninteresting details?”. A
similar question is answered positively in the case of intuitionistic
sequent calculus by means of what is known as natural
deduction, that has, via the Curry-Howard correspondence, a strong
connection with the computational device known as λλ\lambda-calculus.


For linear logic, this succinct representation of proofs is given by
proof nets, graph-like structures that enjoy particularly
good properties for the MLL fragment of the logic. The first step
towards this representation is to convert all the sequent calculus
system, using the involutivity of negation, into a one-sided system,
where sequents are of the form ⊢Γ⊢Γ\vdash \Gamma. As a consequence, the
number of rules is reduced since we have no left-introduction rules,
but we keep the same expressive power, as provability stays the
same.


To each sequent calculus proof in MLL, one can
inductively associate a proof net with the same conclusions
as follows:

To a proof reduced to the axiom rule, we associate an axiom
link. 





For a proof obtained by applying the cut rule to two proofs,
we first inductively build the proof nets associated to those two proofs,
and then we combine them using a cut link.





For a proof obtained by applying the tensor rule to two proofs, we
first inductively build the proof nets associated to those two proofs,
and then we combine them using a tensor link.





For a proof obtained by applying the par rule to a proof, first
inductively build the proof net associated to that proof, and then we
add a “par link”.








All this can be properly formalized using hypergraphs (formulas are
nodes and “links” are oriented hyperedges with hypotheses
and conclusions), and we can formally define as a proof net a
hypergraph inductively built out of a sequent calculus derivation of
MLL. Notice that there are quite a lot of hypergraphs that are not
proof nets.


Now if you look at the proof net built from the derivations of ⊢Γ,(A1⅋A2),…,(An−1⅋An)⊢Γ,(A1⅋A2),…,(An−1⅋An)\vdash \Gamma , (A_1\lpar A_2),
\ldots ,(A_{n-1}\lpar A_n) obtained from ⊢Γ,A1,A2,…,An⊢Γ,A1,A2,…,An\vdash \Gamma ,
A_1, A_2 , \ldots ,A_n, you will see that all trace of the
order of application of the rules has disappeared. In a sense, the
proof nets are an equivalence class of sequent calculus derivations
with respect to the derivation order of rules whose application
commute.


Suppose that somebody now comes to you with a huge hypergraph built
with axiom, cut, par and tensor links, pretending that it is actually a
representation of the proof of some long-standing open mathematical
problem. How can you verify that it is actually a representation
of a proof, and not just a random structure?


Performing this correctness check is a challenge that amounts
to rebuilding a sequential construction history for your structure,
corresponding to a derivation in sequent calculus, and seems at first
a very complex problem: the first correctness criterion for MLL proof
nets, called the “long trip criterion”, and present in
Girard’s original paper, is exponential, as well as the ACC (Acyclic
connected) criterion of Danos and Regnier (1989) 
found later on.
Nevertheless, there exists a much more efficient criterion, known as
Contractibility, due to Danos and Regnier, that has more recently been
reformulated as the following elegant graph parsing criterion by
Guerrini, Martini and Masini: a hypergraph is a proof net if and only
if it reduces to the singleton node “net” via the
following graph reduction rules





Performing this check naively can take quadratic time (each
application of a rule may require an entire lookup of the graph to
find the redex, and we need to perform as many steps as there are
hyperlinks in the graph).
Linear time algorithms have been give by Guerrini (2011) 
and by Murawski and Ong (2006).

Another style of correctness criterion for MLL proof nets is given by 
Retoré (2003) in which a quadratic
algorithm is given for MLL.



On proof nets, one can perform cut elimination in a particularly clean
way: due to their parallel nature, cuts can be eliminated locally via
two simplification rules:

Axiom move: 





Multiplicative move: 








These are actually computation rules over proof nets, and the
correctness criteria allow to verify easily that any such rule
preserves correctness, and as a consequence, the reduction of a proof net
still comes from a sequent calculus proof of the same sequent.


Hence, cut elimination in MLL proof nets can be performed in linear
time and gives a simple, elegant cut-elimination result for all of
MLL.


The proof nets approach can be extended to larger subsets of linear
logic, but then it is less clear how to obtain the same elegant results
as for MLL: the original system proposed in
 Girard 1987
 works for MELL, for example, by associating to the four exponential
rules the following hypergraph constructions:

Contraction 





Weakening 





Dereliction 





Promotion, that introduces the notion of “box”, a
sequentialization mark around a piece of a proof net materialized in
the pictures of the graphs by the rectangle drawn around the proof net
of conclusions AAA and ?Γ?⁡Γ\quest\Gamma. 








While these constructions and the associated graph reductions bear
striking similarity with λλ\lambda-calculus with explicit substitutions,
as first remarked by Di Cosmo & Kesner
 (1997),
 they are too similar to the corresponding sequent calculus rules: the
parallelization effect so elegant for MLL does not properly carry on
here, and the graph reduction rules involve boxes and are not
local.


To recover a satisfactory system, many proposals have been made,
starting from the one by Danos & Regnier
 (1995)
 but we want to mention here the very elegant
approach by Guerrini, Martini and Masini
 (Guerrini et al. 2003),
 that neatly shows the connection between two level proof systems for
modal logic, proper proof nets for MELL, and optimal reduction in the
λλ\lambda-calculus.

A recent paper by Heijltjes and Houston (2016)
has shown that there can be no satisfactory notion of proof nets for MLL if 
units are also allowed. 


It is possible to provide a canonical treatment of additive
connectives, even with first-order quantification 
(Heijltjes et al. 2018). 
Proof nets for formulas containing both multiplicative and
additive connectives have various technical presentations, none of
which appears canonical and satisfactory. Their treatment in
proof-net-like proof systems is currently a topic of active research.
In particular, see (Hughes and van Glabbeek 2005) and 
(Hughes and Heijltjes 2016).

3. Semantics


Approaching the semantics of linear logic is usually done along two
different paths. First, there are various semantic structures
available that can be used to map formulas to denotations in such
structures. That approach can be used to establish soundness and
completeness for various fragments of linear logic. A more novel
semantic approach to linear logic involves giving semantics to proofs
directly. We describe briefly these two approaches and provide some
links to the literature.
3.1 Semantics of provability


One approach to attempting a sound and complete semantics for
fragments of linear logic associates to a formula the set of all
contexts that can be used to prove that formula. Of course, such a
collection may need to be more abstract and to be given various
closure properties. The phase semantics of Girard
 (1987)
 provides one such semantics: some uses of such semantics have been
made in computer science to provide counterexamples and as a tool that
can help establish that a given concurrent system cannot evolve into
another with certain properties
 (Fages et al. 2001).
 Similarly,
Kripke-style semantics have been provided in
 Allwein & Dunn 1993
 and
 Hodas & Miller 1994.
 Quantales, certain kind of partially ordered algebraic structures,
have also been used to provide early semantic models for parts of
linear logic
 (Yetter 1990).
3.2 Semantics of proofs


In the formulas-as-types analogy which is so popular and fruitful in
theoretical computer science, a logical system is put in
correspondence with a typed computational device (like typed λλ\lambda-calculus), 
by associating to each proof of that formula a program having
that formula as a type. For example, a proof of the tautology
A⇒AA⇒AA \Rightarrow A corresponds to the program
fun(x:A).x:A→A(x:A).x:A→A(x:A).x:A\rightarrow A,
the identity function on objects of type AAA. This is why, in
constructive logical systems (such as intuitionistic logic and arithmetic),
and in linear logic, so much importance
is attached to proofs, to the point that building and studying models
of proofs gets so much more attention than building and studying
models of provability: we are not satisfied to know that a formula is
provable, we really want to know the computational content of
its proof.


Many models of linear logic proofs have been proposed; we consider
that, to date, the simplest and most intuitive construction is those
based on the so-called “relational semantics” or
“Kripke-style semantics”, where formulas are interpreted
as multisets, one-sided sequents are interpreted as tuples of
multisets, and proofs are interpreted as relations over the
interpretation of sequents. If one wants to give a purely
set-theoretic semantics, without resorting to multisets, it is
possible to do it by means of coherence spaces, sets equipped with a
special coherence relation, as originally shown by in
 Girard 1987.
 There are interesting
category theoretical models of linear logic, such as the *-autonomous
categories
 (Barr 1991)
 and hypercoherences
 (Ehrhard 1993).


Another approach to the semantics of proofs is given by Girard’s
Geometry of Interaction, that allows us to obtain a fully
algebraic characterization of proofs. To each proof net, one can
associate a partial permutation matrix σσ\sigma corresponding to the
cut links, and a proper matrix MMM corresponding expressions built out of a 
certain
dynamic algebra, that describe the possible paths inside the proof
net. It is then possible to fully describe the proof net via the
execution formula
EX(σ,M)=(1−σ2)(∑iM(σM))(1−σ2)EX(σ,M)=(1−σ2)(∑iM(σM))(1−σ2)
\mathrm{EX}(\sigma ,M) = (1-\sigma^2) \left(\sum_i M(\sigma M)\right) (1-\sigma^2)



which, in the MLL case, is an invariant of the normalization
process. Some nice connection to results coming from data-flow theory
has been shown in some early work of Abramsky & Jagadeesan
 (1994).

The area of semantics that has developed around so-called game
semantics deserves special attention. The strong connection between
games and linear logic was pointed out quite early by A. Blass 
(1992).
In fact, there are two different traditions to connecting logic
to games. In the tradition of dialog games dating back to
Lorenzen, one player attempts to prove a formula while a second player
attempts to refute it. It is possible to provide MALL with such a
dialog game that is completely symmetric for both the prover and the
refuter (Delande et al. 2010).
In another tradition, formulas are
interpreted as games, logical connectives as game constructors, and
proofs as strategies that describe how a player reacts to opponent
moves. By imposing different restrictions on the rules of the game,
one can actually provide a precise semantics (technically, a
fully abstract model) for various features of actual programming
languages, hence the huge interest in this area over the past
years. See, for example, 
 Abramsky & Jagadeesan 1994,
 Abramsky & Melliès 1999,
 and
 Hyland & Ong 2000.

4. Complexity

For any given logic, it is useful to know whether or not there is an
effective procedure to determine, for each sentence in the logic, if
it is provable or not. A decidable logic—i.e., one for
which there is an effective procedure for provability—is often
described by its
complexity class, which characterizes how difficult it is
to perform the decision procedure.
Extensive research work has been dedicated to the study of the
complexity and decidability issues for several fragments of
propositional linear logic. It is known that

MLL provability is NP-complete
 (Kanovich 1992),
MALL provability is PSPACE-complete
 (Lincoln et al. 1992),
LL provability is undecidable
 (Lincoln et al. 1992, 
 Lincoln 1995), and that


NP, PSPACE, and EXPSPACE are complexity classes such that NP ⊆⊆\subseteq
PSPACE ⊆⊆\subseteq EXPSPACE. Surprisingly, for those that may forget that
the novelty in linear logic lies in the way formulas are managed
without the structural rules of contraction and weakening, 
these results stay the same even if we focus
on the fragments of the logics where only the constants, and no
propositional variables, are allowed (Kanovich 1994,
 Lincoln & Winkler 1994). Indeed, it is
possible to encode arbitrary formulas into constant-only formulas
preserving provability.

MELL is a surprisingly expressive logic. For example, the
reachability problem in Petri nets can be encoded into MELL (Gunter & Gehlot 1989) and that problem is
equivalent to the reachability problem of vector addition systems with
states (VASS) (Reutenauer 1989).
Furthermore, the decidability problem of MELL is equivalent to the
reachability problem for branching VASS (de
Groote et al. 2004) and the latter is known to have a
non-elementary lower bound (Lazic and Schmitz
2015). Thus, if MELL turns out to be decidable it will be at
least TOWER-hard (Lazic and Schmitz 2015).
A proof of the decidability of MELL has been given by Bimbó
(2015) but a gap in that proof 
has been reported in Straßburger (forthcoming).


Linear logic with the unrestricted weakening rule added 
(also known as linear affine logic) is decidable
(Kopylov 1995) and to be exponential 
space hard (Urquhart 2000).


A good overview of complexity results surrounding linear logic can
be found in
 Lincoln 1995.
5. Computer science impact


When intuitionistic logic was first proposed early in the last
century, it was presented as a challenge to the way traditional
mathematicians were supposed to do business. Uses of the excluded middle
and of proof-by-contradiction were considered suspect and problematic,
particularly in the presence of infinity. As intuitionistic logic
concerns were developed into constructive mathematics, new constructive
approaches have arisen to topics such as topology, algebra, and
analysis. Given that linear logic encompasses the dynamics of proof
(algorithm) and resources, its primary impacts has been not in
traditional mathematics but in computer science. Before overviewing the
nature of that impact, we outline the various ways in which logic more
generally is used in computer science.


Logic plays different roles in the specification of computations. We
can identify the following broad different approaches and note which
roles have felt influences from linear logic.


In the computation-as-model approach, computations are
encoded as mathematical structures and consist of such items as nodes,
transitions, and states. Logic is used in an external sense to make
statements about those structures. That is, computations are
used as models for logical expressions. Intensional operators, such as
the modals of temporal and dynamic logics or the triples of Hoare
logic, are often employed to express propositions about the change in
state. This use of logic to represent and reason about computation is
probably the oldest and most broadly successful use of logic for
representing computation. This role for logic has felt little influence
from linear logic.


In the computation-as-deduction approach, pieces of logic’s
syntax (such as formulas, terms, types, and proofs) are used directly
as elements of the specified computation. In this more rarefied
setting, there are two rather different approaches to how computation
is modeled, called the proof normalization approach and the
proof search approach.


We outline below the significant impacts that linear logic has had on
both of these different settings.
5.1 Proof normalization


The proof normalization approach views the state of a
computation as a proof term and the process of computing as
normalization (known alternatively as ββ\beta-reduction or cut-elimination).
Functional programming can be explained using proof-normalization as
its theoretical basis
 (Martin-Löf 1982)
 and has been used to justify the design of new functional
 programming languages, e.g.,
 Abramsky 1993.
 Linear logic provides this approach to computational specification
with new types, new declarative means for statically understanding how
resources may be used in a computation, and provided an appealing
means for formalizing the duality between a function and the
environment that supplies it with arguments.


Another area where linear logic has been a powerful theoretical
instrument is that of optimal reduction. The problem of
building efficient (optimal) interpreters for the λλ\lambda-calculus, that
stayed open for quite a long time after its original definition by J.J.
Lévy, was solved for the first time in 
 Lamping 1990, 
 via a sophisticated sharing graph implementation involving a quite
impressive amount of rules. Using ideas and intuition from linear
logic, many authors reconstructed Lamping’s solution, simplifying it
and leading to a rich theory connected to that of the Geometry of
Interaction. For further reading, a good reference
is Asperti & Guerrini 1998.



The refinement of intuitionistic logic provided by linear logic and
the dualities of linear logic provided a setting in which one could
view a function and its environment as similar entities that interact
dually. For example, a function with the type A−∘BA−∘BA \limp B can be
modeled as a process that consumes a value of type AAA from its
environment and transforms it into a value of type BBB. In linear
logic, this implication is equivalent to its contrapositive form: the
type B⊥−∘A⊥B⊥−∘A⊥B^{\bot} \limp A^{\bot} can lead to interpreting the same
function as a process that transforms a demand for a value of type
BBB into a demand for a value of type AAA (notice that this does
not happen with functions of intuitionistic type since, for example,
input argument may be vacuous)
 (Curien 2003).
 The recent successes of using game semantics to model functional
computation are similarly related to the dual treatment of function
and environment (Abramsky and Jagadeesan 1994,
 Hyland & Ong 2000).


Finally, we mention that in the area of encoding computation as proof
normalization, linear logic has been used to provide a type-based
description of polytime recursive functions. For example, M.
 Hofmann
 (2003)
 introduced a λλ\lambda-calculus with
modal and linear types that extended the function algebra of
 Bellantoni & Cook 1992
 to higher types. Types based on linear logic have also been used
within functional programs: see
 Guzman & Hudak 1990
 and
 Wadler 1991.
5.2 Proof search


The proof search approach views the state of a computation
as a sequent (a structured collection of formulas) and the process of
computing as the process of searching for a proof of a sequent: the
changes that take place in sequents capture the dynamics of
computation. 
With this view of computation, we generally read
inference rules bottom up, i.e., 
as a transformation of their conclusion into their premise(s). 
Logic programming can be explained using proof search as
its theoretical basis, and linear logic provides this approach to
computational specification with new combinators for building logic
programs, new means to capture rich dynamics, and new
declarative approaches to specifying concurrent computations. (See
 Miller 2004
 for an overview of linear logic programming languages.)


The completeness of focusing proof system can be used to provide a
declarative explanation of part of the operational semantics of logic
programming within linear logic. Consider, for example, the subset
LLL of formulas of linear logic that are built from only the
connectives ⊤⊤\top, &, −∘,⇒−∘,⇒\limp , \Rightarrow, and ∀∀\forall. (Notice
that if one adds ⊥⊥\bot to this list, it is possible to encode all
connectives of linear logic.) It is possible to see that cut-free
proof search in LLL can be defined into to phases. Given a
sequent ΓΓ\Gamma; Δ→GΔ→G\Delta \rightarrow G, where ΓΓ\Gamma is a set of
formulas (which can be contracted and weakened), ΔΔ\Delta is multiset
of formulas (which cannot be contracted nor weakened), and GGG
(the “goal” formula) is a single formula (all
from L)L)L), then proof search proceeds as follows.

If GGG is non-atomic, then only a right introduction rule
can be used to conclude this sequent. Given this set of connectives,
the right rules are invertible and this goal-reduction phase
corresponds exactly to the asynchronous phase of focused proofs.
If GGG is atomic, then proof search proceeds by
deciding on a single formula from a left-hand context.
Once a formula is chosen for the focus, all
left-introduction rules are applied to only that formula and any
positive subformulas that arise. This backchaining phase
corresponds to the asynchronous phase of focused proof
construction.



Formally, these various phases can be described using the following
inference rules. Here, a new sequent arrow is introduced:
this arrow is labeled with the formula that is the result of a
left-introduction rule. Notice that the rule for left-introduction of
−∘−∘\limp requires splitting the ΔΔ\Delta context
into two parts Δ1,Δ2Δ1,Δ2\Delta_1,\Delta_2 (when reading
the rule bottom up). There are, of course, 2n2n2^n such
splittings if that context has n≥0n≥0n \ge 0 distinct
formulas.
The syntactic variable AAA in these inference rules ranges over
atomic formulas.

Linear logic restricted to LLL can be viewed as a linear logic
programming language. As a consequence, it can serve as a
specification language for computational systems, a role that is also
occupied by, say, Petri nets, process calculi, λλ\lambda-calculus,
etc. Given that linear logic has a proof theory and various kinds of
semantics, broad avenues of reasoning about computations specified in
LLL are provided by the meta-theory of linear logic.


Given that the sequent calculus for linear logic uses multisets of formulas,
proof search can directly encode multiset rewriting. Since
many computations can naturally be seen as multiset rewriting, it has
been possible to make numerous connections between linear logic and
Petri nets
 (Gunter & Gehlot 1989),
 process calculi
 (Andreoli & Pareschi 1991,
 Kobayashi et al. 1999,
 Miller 1996),
 and security protocols
 (Cervesato et al. 1999,
 Miller 2003).
6. Variations
6.1 Different treatments of modality


The exponentials !!\bang and ??\quest in linear
logic are less carved in the marble than the other
connectives. Indeed, if one uses traditional sequent calculus
presentations, the exponentials are not canonical in the following sense: if
you introduce another copy of exponentials, say
!′!′\bang' and ?′?′\quest', with the same
rules as the original ones, there is no way to prove that
!!\bang is equivalent to !′!′\bang', and
??\quest to ?′?′\quest', while for the other
connectives this is easily established. 
Various applications of non-canonical exponentials can be
found in (Danos et. al., 1993; 
Nigam & Miller, 2009). 
Although the decidability of MELL is currently being debated 
(Bimbó 2015,
Straßburger forthcoming), 
extending MLL with three pairs of !!\bang and
??\quest yields a logic that is undecidable
 (Chaudhuri 2018). 
Martini and 
Masini 1995 describe a “2-sequent” 
proof system in which the exponentials are canonical.

The fact that cut-elimination can make proofs in classical and
intuitionistic logic grow to enormous size can be analyzed in terms of the
application of the contraction rule in those proof systems. If proof systems
introduce restrictions on contraction, it is possible to design new
logics and proof systems for which cut-elimination has a much-reduced
complexity. For example, elementary linear logic (ELL) is
obtained by replacing the !!\bang and ??\quest
introduction by a single rule introducing !!\bang and
??\quest at the same time. As a consequence, ELL can encode
all and only the Kalmar elementary functions (computable in time
bounded by a tower of exponentials of fixed height) 
(Girard 1998, 
Baillot 2015). Still, other variations on the inference rules for the
exponentials have been studied. For example, light linear
logic (Girard 1998) and soft linear
logic (Lafont 2004) both characterize
functions computable in polynomial time: see also
 (Baillot & Terui 2004).

6.2 Non-commutative linear logic


While linear logic rejects the universal application of the two
structural rules of weakening and contraction, it allows the
unrestricted use of the structural rule called exchange. A sequent
calculus that does not universally employ the exchange rule has
sequents whose left and right contexts are lists: the order of formulas
within context becomes an expressive element of the logic. In this
case, the multiplicative disjunction and conjunction can become
non-commutative.


One of the first logics that rejects all three structural rules of
the sequent calculus was given in 
 Lambek 1958.
 While this logic contains two implications, it does not
contain a negation nor exponentials. Various recent papers have
proposed extending linear logic to include non-commutative features
and, at present, no proposal seems canonical. For a sampling of
non-commutative linear logics, see
 Yetter 1990,
 Abrusci 1991,
 Retoré 1997,
 Abrusci & Ruet 1999, and
 Guglielmi & Straßburger 2001.
6.3 Treatment of unbounded behavior

While the MALL logic is an expressive and novel logic, it is also
decidable and, thus, not capable of capturing the unbounded behaviors 
found in, say, mathematics and computer science. As described above, 
the addition of the exponentials ! and ? enriches MALL to full linear 
logic and to a setting where unbounded behaviors can be captured. 
A second approach to extending MALL to capture unbounded behaviors 
involves the addition of
the least and greatest fixed point operators as logical connectives 
directly into MALL. In order to properly characterize fixed points 
as being either the least
or the greatest, it is necessary for the inference rules for fixed
points to be
“higher-order” in 
the sense that they involve invariants. Such an extension to MALL 
(also with first-order
quantification and term equality) has been developed by Baelde 
(Baelde & Miller, 
2007; 
Baelde 2012) and has been used to 
provide a proof-theoretic foundation for model checking 
(Heath & Miller 2018).
