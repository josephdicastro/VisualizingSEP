“Curry’s paradox”, as the term is used by
philosophers today, refers to a wide variety of paradoxes of
 self-reference or circularity
 that trace their modern
ancestry to Curry (1942b) and Löb
 (1955).[1]
 The common characteristic of these so-called Curry paradoxes is the
way they exploit a notion of implication, entailment or consequence,
either in the form of a connective or in the form of a predicate.
Curry’s paradox arises in a number of different domains. Like
 Russell’s paradox, it can take
 the form of a paradox of
set theory or the theory of properties. But it can also take the form
of a semantic paradox, closely akin to the 
  Liar paradox.
Curry’s paradox differs from both Russell’s paradox and
the Liar paradox in that it doesn’t essentially involve the
notion of negation. Common truth-theoretic versions involve a sentence
that says of itself that if it is true then an arbitrarily chosen
claim is true, or—to use a more sinister instance—says of
itself that if it is true then every falsity is true. The paradox is
that the existence of such a sentence appears to imply the truth of
the arbitrarily chosen claim, or—in the more sinister
instance—of every falsity. In this entry, we show how the
various Curry paradoxes can be constructed, examine the space of
available solutions, and explain some ways Curry’s paradox is
significant and poses distinctive challenges.
 
1. Introduction: Two Guises of the Paradox
1.1 An Informal Argument

Suppose that your friend tells you: “If what I’m saying
using this very sentence is true, then time is infinite”. It
turns out that there is a short and seemingly compelling argument for
the following conclusion:

(P)The mere
existence of your friend’s assertion entails (or has as a
consequence) that time is infinite.


Many hold that (P) is beyond belief (and, in that sense, paradoxical),
even if time is indeed infinite. Or, if that isn’t bad enough,
consider another version, this time involving a claim known to be
false. Let your friend say instead: “If what I’m saying
using this very sentence is true, then all numbers are prime”.
Now, mutatis mutandis, the same short and seemingly
compelling argument yields (Q):

(Q)The mere
existence of your friend’s assertion entails (or has as a
consequence) that all numbers are prime.


Here is the argument for
 (P).
 Let kkk be the self-referential sentence your friend uttered,
simplified somewhat so that it reads “If kkk is true then time
is infinite”. In view of what kkk says, we know this much:

(1)Under the
supposition that kkk is true, it is the case that if k is true
then time is infinite.


But, of course, we also have

(2)Under the
supposition that kkk is true, it is the case that k is
true.


Under the supposition that kkk is true, we have thus derived a
conditional together with its antecedent. Using modus ponens
within the scope of the supposition, we now derive the
conditional’s consequent under that same supposition:

(3)Under the
supposition that kkk is true, it is the case that time is
infinite.


The rule of conditional proof now entitles us to affirm a conditional
with our supposition as antecedent:

(4)If kkk is true
then time is infinite.


But, since (4) just is kkk itself, we thus have

(5)kkk is
true.


Finally, putting (4) and (5) together by modus ponens, we
get

(6)Time is
infinite.


We seem to have established that time is infinite using no assumptions
beyond the existence of the self-referential sentence kkk, along with
the seemingly obvious principles about truth that took us to (1) and
also from (4) to (5). And the same goes for
 (Q),
 since we could have used the same form of argument to reach the false
conclusion that all numbers are prime.
1.2 A Constraint on Theories

One challenge posed by Curry’s paradox is to pinpoint what goes
wrong in the foregoing informal argument for
 (P),
 (Q) or the like. But starting with Curry’s initial
presentation in Curry 1942b (see the supplementary document on 
 Curry on Curry’s Paradox), discussion
of Curry’s paradox has usually had a different focus. It has
concerned various formal systems —most often set theories or
theories of truth. In this setting what poses the paradox is a proof
that the system has a particular feature. Typically, the feature at
issue is triviality. A theory is said to be trivial, or
absolutely inconsistent, when it affirms every claim that is
expressible in the language of the
 theory.[2]


An argument establishing that a particular formal theory is trivial
will pose a problem if either of the following is the case: (i) we
wish to use the formal theory in our inquiries, as we use set theory
when doing mathematics, or (ii) we wish to use the formal theory in
order to model features of language or thought, in particular the
claims to which some speakers or thinkers are committed. Either way,
the target theory’s triviality would show that it is inadequate
for its intended purpose. So this is a second challenge posed by
Curry’s paradox.

To spell out the sense in which Curry’s paradox constrains
theories we need to say what a Curry sentence is. Informally,
a Curry sentence is a sentence that is equivalent, by the lights of
some theory, to a conditional with itself as antecedent. For
example, one might think of the argument of
 section 1.1
 as appealing to an informal theory of truth. Then the sentence
“kkk is true” serves as a Curry sentence for that
theory. That is because, given what our informal theory tells us about
what kkk’s truth involves, “kkk is true” should
be equivalent to “If kkk is true, then time is infinite”
(since this conditional is kkk itself).

In what follows, the notation ⊢Tα⊢Tα\vdash_{\mathcal{T}} \alpha is used
to say that theory TT\mathcal{T} contains sentence αα\alpha, and
Γ⊢TαΓ⊢Tα\Gamma \vdash_{\mathcal{T}} \alpha is used to say that αα\alpha
follows from the premises collected in ΓΓ\Gamma according to
TT\mathcal{T} (i.e., according to TT\mathcal{T}’s
consequence relation
 ⊢T⊢T\vdash_{\mathcal{T}}).[3]
 Except in
 section 4.2.1,
 however, we will be concerned only with claims about what follows
according to the theory from a single premise, i.e., claims expressed by 
sentences of form
γ⊢Tαγ⊢Tα\gamma \vdash_{\mathcal{T}} \alpha. (We rely on context to make clear 
where such a sentence is being used and where it is only being mentioned.)

Two sentences (in the language
of theory TT\mathcal{T}) will be called intersubstitutable
according to TT\mathcal{T} provided the truth of any claim of the
form Γ⊢TαΓ⊢Tα\Gamma \vdash_{\mathcal{T}} \alpha is unaffected by
substitutions of one for the other within αα\alpha or within any of
the sentences in ΓΓ\Gamma. Finally, we assume that the language
contains a connective →→{\rightarrow} that serves, in some suitable
sense, as a conditional. For purposes of the following definition, we
don’t place any specific requirements on the behavior of this
conditional. We can now define the notion of a Curry sentence for
a sentence-theory pair.


Definition 1 (Curry sentence) Let ππ\pi be a
sentence of the language of TT\mathcal{T}. A Curry sentence for
ππ\pi and TT\mathcal{T} is any sentence κκ\kappa such that
κκ\kappa and κ→πκ→π\kappa {\rightarrow}\pi are intersubstitutable
according to
 TT\mathcal{T}.[4]


The various versions of Curry’s paradox arise from the existence
of arguments in favor of the following very general claim. (These
arguments, which rest on assumptions about the conditional
→→{\rightarrow}, will be discussed in detail in
 section 3.)


Troubling Claim For every theory TT\mathcal{T}, and
any sentence ππ\pi in the language of TT\mathcal{T}, if there is a
Curry sentence for ππ\pi and TT\mathcal{T}, then
⊢Tπ⊢Tπ\vdash_{\mathcal{T}} \pi.


An argument that appears to establish the Troubling Claim will count
as paradoxical provided there is also compelling reason to believe
that this claim is false. A counterexample to the Troubling Claim
would be any theory TT\mathcal{T} and sentence ππ\pi such that
there is a Curry sentence for ππ\pi and TT\mathcal{T} but it is
not the case that ⊢Tπ⊢Tπ\vdash_{\mathcal{T}} \pi.

As noted above, Curry’s paradox is often understood as a
challenge to the existence of nontrivial theories. Given the Troubling
Claim, a theory will be trivial whenever a Curry sentence can be
formulated for any sentence in the language of the theory.
Indeed, triviality follows from a weaker condition, which the
following definition makes explicit.


Definition 2 (Curry-complete theory) A theory
TT\mathcal{T} is Curry-complete provided that for every sentence
ππ\pi in the language of TT\mathcal{T}, there is some π′π′\pi'
such that (i) there is a Curry sentence for π′π′\pi' and
TT\mathcal{T} and (ii) if ⊢Tπ′⊢Tπ′\vdash_{\mathcal{T}} \pi' then
⊢Tπ⊢Tπ\vdash_{\mathcal{T}} \pi.


While one instance of π′π′\pi' satisfying the condition (ii) would be
ππ\pi itself, another instance would be an “explosive”
sentence ⊥⊥\bot that is contained in a theory only if every
sentence is contained in the
 theory.[5]


The Troubling Claim now has an immediate consequence: a Curry-complete
theory must contain every sentence in its language.


Troubling Corollary Every Curry-complete theory is
trivial.


Again, any argument that appears to establish the Troubling Corollary
will count as paradoxical provided that there is compelling reason to
believe that there are nontrivial theories (indeed true theories) that are
Curry-complete.
1.3 Overview

For the remainder of this entry, Curry’s paradox will be
understood as imposing a paradoxical constraint on theories, namely
the one stated by the above Troubling Corollary. Presenting a version
of Curry’s paradox, understood this way, involves doing two
things:



arguing that TT\mathcal{T} is Curry-complete, for some apparently
nontrivial target theory TT\mathcal{T}, and


giving an argument for the Troubling
 Claim.[6]



Sections
 2
 and
 3
 discuss these two tasks in that order. For now, the basic idea can be
conveyed using the example of the self-referential sentence kkk that
reads “If kkk is true then time is infinite”. First,
given our understanding of truth, we recognize that the sentence
“kkk is true” is intersubstitutable with “If kkk
is true, then time is infinite”. Second, the informal argument
of
 section 1.1
 derives a paradoxical conclusion from this equivalence. Readers
chiefly interested in the logical principles involved in that argument
and related ones, and the options for resisting such arguments, may
wish to turn to
 section 3.
2. Constructing Curry Sentences

As it is standardly presented today, Curry’s paradox afflicts
“naive” truth theories (those featuring a
“transparent” truth predicate) and “naive” set
theories (those featuring unrestricted set abstraction). This section
will explain how each kind of theory can give rise to Curry sentences.
We start, however, with a version that concerns theories of
 properties, a version that more closely resembles
Curry’s formulation. (The supplementary document
 Curry on Curry’s Paradox
 briefly characterizes the targets of Curry’s own versions of
the paradox.)

A theory of properties features unrestricted property
abstraction provided that for any condition statable in the
language of the theory, there exists a property that (according to the
theory) is exemplified by precisely the things that meet this
condition. Consider a theory TPTP\mathcal{T_P} formulated in a
language with a property abstraction device [x:ϕx][x:ϕx][x: \phi x] and an
exemplification relation ϵϵ\epsilon. For example, if ϕ(t)ϕ(t)\phi(t)
says that the object which the term ttt stands for is triangular,
t ϵ [x:ϕx]t ϵ [x:ϕx]t \ \epsilon \ [x: \phi x] says that this object exemplifies the
property of triangularity. Then, given unrestricted property
abstraction, we should have the following principle.


(Property) For every open sentence ϕϕ\phi with one
free variable, and every term ttt, the sentences t ϵ [x:ϕx]t ϵ [x:ϕx]t \ \epsilon \
[x: \phi x] and ϕtϕt\phi t are intersubstitutable according to
TPTP\mathcal{T_P}.


In effect, Curry (1942b) sketches two
“methods of constructing” Curry sentences using his
counterpart of (Property). He says that the first is “based on
the Russell paradox”, while the second is “based on the
Epimenides paradox”. Although both methods are
property-theoretic, the first method yields a precursor of
set-theoretic versions of Curry’s paradox, while the second
yields a precursor of truth-theoretic versions.
2.1 Curry’s First Method, and Set-Theoretic Curry Sentences

The version of Russell’s paradox which Curry’s
first method resembles is the one that concerns property
exemplification. Its topic is the property of being such that one
fails to exemplify oneself. We obtain a property-theoretic Curry
sentence by considering instead the property of being such that
one exemplifies oneself only if time is infinite. Say that we
introduce the name hhh for that property, by stipulating h=def[x:x ϵ x→π]h=def[x:x ϵ x→π]h =_{def}
[x: x \ \epsilon \ x {\rightarrow}\pi], where the sentence ππ\pi
says that time is
 infinite.[7]
 Applying the principle
 (Property)
 to the sentence h ϵ hh ϵ hh \ \epsilon \ h, we find:


h ϵ hh ϵ hh \ \epsilon \ h and h ϵ h→πh ϵ h→πh \ \epsilon \ h {\rightarrow}\pi are
intersubstitutable according to TPTP\mathcal{T_P}.


In other words, h ϵ hh ϵ hh \ \epsilon \ h is a Curry sentence for ππ\pi
and TPTP\mathcal{T_P}.

Curry’s first method subsequently gave rise to set-theoretic
Curry sentences. A theory of sets features unrestricted set
abstraction provided that for any condition statable in the
language of the theory, there exists a set that (according to the
theory) contains all and only the things that meet this condition. Let
TSTS\mathcal{T_S} be our theory of sets, formulated in a language that
expresses set abstraction using {x:ϕx}{x:ϕx}\{ x: \phi x\} and set membership
using ∈∈\in. Then the counterpart of
 (Property)
 is


(Set) For every open sentence ϕϕ\phi with one free
variable, and every term ttt, the sentences t∈{x:ϕx}t∈{x:ϕx}t \in \{ x: \phi x\}
and ϕtϕt\phi t are intersubstitutable according to
TSTS\mathcal{T_S}.


To obtain a set-theoretic Curry sentence, consider the set consisting
of anything that is a member of itself only if time is infinite. Say
that we introduce the name ccc for that set, by stipulating c=def{x:x∈x→π}c=def{x:x∈x→π}c
=_{def} \{ x: x \in x {\rightarrow}\pi \}. Applying the principle
 (Set)
 to the sentence c∈cc∈cc \in c, we find:


c∈cc∈cc \in c and c∈c→πc∈c→πc \in c {\rightarrow}\pi are intersubstitutable
according to TSTS\mathcal{T_S}.


In other words, c∈cc∈cc \in c is a Curry sentence for ππ\pi and
TSTS\mathcal{T_S}.

The set-theoretic version of Curry’s paradox was introduced in
Fitch
 1952[8]
 and is also presented in Moh 1954 and
Prior 1955.
2.2 Curry’s Second Method, and Truth-Theoretic Curry Sentences

Despite his remark about the “Epimenides paradox”, a form
of the Liar paradox, Curry’s second method is a variant
of a related semantic paradox, Grelling’s
 paradox.[9]
 In its original form, Grelling’s paradox considers a property
possessed by many words, namely the property a word has when it
fails to exemplify the property it stands for (Grelling
& Nelson 1908). For example, the
word “offensiveness” has that property: it fails to
exemplify the property it stands for, since it isn’t offensive
(see entry on
 paradoxes and contemporary logic).
 In effect, Curry considers instead the property a word has provided
it exemplifies the property it stands for only if time is
infinite. Now suppose that our theory introduces a name uuu for
this property. Curry then shows how to construct a sentence that
(speaking informally) says that the name uuu exemplifies the
property it stands for. He shows that this sentence will serve as a
Curry sentence for a theory of properties and the denotation of
 names.[10]


Though this method of obtaining a Curry sentence is based on a
semantic feature of expressions, it still relies on property
abstraction. Nonetheless, it can be viewed as a precursor to a wholly
semantic version. (Rather than consider the above-introduced property,
one could consider the predicate “applies to itself only if time
is infinite”.) Accordingly, as Geach
(1955) and Löb (1955) were
the first to show, Curry sentences can be obtained using semantic
principles alone, without any reliance on property abstraction. Their
route corresponds to the informal argument, in
 section 1.1,
 involving the self-referential sentence kkk that reads “If
kkk is true then time is infinite.”

For this purpose, let TTTT\mathcal{T_T} be a theory of truth, where
TTT is the truth predicate. Assume the “transparency”
principle


(Truth) For every sentence αα\alpha, the sentences
T⟨α⟩T⟨α⟩T\langle \alpha \rangle and αα\alpha are intersubstitutable
according to TTTT\mathcal{T_T}.


To obtain a Curry sentence using this principle, assume there is a
sentence ξξ\xi that is T⟨ξ⟩→πT⟨ξ⟩→πT\langle \xi \rangle
 {\rightarrow}\pi.[11]
 Then it follows immediately from (Truth) that


T⟨ξ⟩T⟨ξ⟩T\langle \xi \rangle and T⟨ξ⟩→πT⟨ξ⟩→πT\langle \xi \rangle {\rightarrow}\pi
are intersubstitutable according to TTTT\mathcal{T_T}.


In other words, T⟨ξ⟩T⟨ξ⟩T\langle \xi \rangle is a Curry sentence for
ππ\pi and TTTT\mathcal{T_T}.

Geach notes that the semantic paradox that results from a sentence
like T⟨ξ⟩T⟨ξ⟩T\langle \xi \rangle resembles “the Curry paradox in
set theory”. Löb, who doesn’t mention Curry’s
work, credits the paradox to a referee’s observation about the
proof of what is now known as Löb’s theorem concerning
provability (see entry on
 Gödel’s incompleteness theorems).
 The referee, now known to have been Leon Henkin (Halbach
& Visser 2014: 257), suggested
that the method Löb used in his proof “leads to a
new derivation of paradoxes in natural language”, namely the
informal argument of
 section 1.1
 above.[12] 
3. Deriving the Paradox

Suppose that we have used one of the above methods to show, for some
theory of truth, sets, or properties, that the theory is
Curry-complete (in virtue, say, of containing a Curry sentence for
each sentence of the language, or for an explosive sentence). To
conclude that the theory in question is trivial, it now suffices to
give an argument for the Troubling Claim. This is the claim that for
every theory TT\mathcal{T}, if there is a Curry sentence for ππ\pi
and TT\mathcal{T}, then ⊢Tπ⊢Tπ\vdash_{\mathcal{T}} \pi. Such an
argument will make use of assumptions about the logical behavior of
the conditional →→{\rightarrow} mentioned in
 Definition 1.
 Assuming the Troubling Claim must be resisted, this accordingly
places constraints on the behavior of this conditional.
3.1 The Curry-Paradox Lemma

To start, here is a very general limitative result, a close variant of
the Lemma in Curry
 1942b.[13]



Curry-Paradox Lemma Suppose that theory
TT\mathcal{T} and sentence ππ\pi are such that (i) there is a
Curry sentence for ππ\pi and TT\mathcal{T}, (ii) all instances of
the identity rule (Id) α⊢Tαα⊢Tα\alpha \vdash_{\mathcal{T}} \alpha hold,
and (iii) the conditional →→{\rightarrow} satisfies both of the
following principles:
If ⊢Tα→β and ⊢Tα then ⊢Tβ(MP)(MP)If ⊢Tα→β and ⊢Tα then ⊢Tβ\tag{MP} \textrm{If } \vdash_{\mathcal{T}} \alpha {\rightarrow}\beta
\textrm{ and }\vdash_{\mathcal{T}} \alpha \textrm{ then }
\vdash_{\mathcal{T}} \beta 
If α⊢Tα→β then ⊢Tα→β(Cont)(Cont)If α⊢Tα→β then ⊢Tα→β\tag{Cont} \textrm{If } \alpha \vdash_{\mathcal{T}} \alpha
{\rightarrow}\beta \textrm{ then } \vdash_{\mathcal{T}} \alpha
{\rightarrow}\beta 

Then ⊢Tπ⊢Tπ\vdash_{\mathcal{T}} \pi.


Here MP is a version of modus ponens, and Cont is a principle
of contraction: two occurrences of the sentence αα\alpha
are “contracted” into one. (We will soon encounter related
principles that are more commonly referred to as
 contraction.[14]) The
Curry-Paradox Lemma entails that any Curry-complete theory must
violate one or more of Id, MP or Cont on pain of triviality.

To prove the Lemma one shows that Id, MP and Cont, together with the
“Curry-intersubstitutivity” of κκ\kappa with κ→πκ→π\kappa
{\rightarrow}\pi, suffice to establish ⊢Tπ⊢Tπ\vdash_{\mathcal{T}} \pi.
The following derivation resembles the informal argument of
 section 1.1.
 That argument also included a subargument for the principle Cont,
which will be examined below.
12345κ⊢Tκκ⊢Tκ→π⊢Tκ→π⊢Tκ⊢TπId1 Curry-intersubstitutivity2 Cont3 Curry-intersubstitutivity3, 4 MP1κ⊢TκId2κ⊢Tκ→π1 Curry-intersubstitutivity3⊢Tκ→π2 Cont4⊢Tκ3 Curry-intersubstitutivity5⊢Tπ3, 4 MP
\begin{array}{rll}
1 &amp; \kappa \vdash_{\mathcal{T}} \kappa &amp; \textrm{Id}\\
2 &amp; \kappa \vdash_{\mathcal{T}} \kappa {\rightarrow}\pi &amp; \textrm{1 Curry-intersubstitutivity}\\
3 &amp; \vdash_{\mathcal{T}} \kappa {\rightarrow}\pi &amp; \textrm{2 Cont}\\
4 &amp; \vdash_{\mathcal{T}} \kappa &amp; \textrm{3 Curry-intersubstitutivity}\\
5 &amp; \vdash_{\mathcal{T}} \pi &amp; \textrm{3, 4 MP}
\end{array}


Section 4
 will discuss ways in which each of the two principles concerning
→→{\rightarrow} assumed in the Curry-Paradox Lemma might be
justified or rejected.
3.2 Alternative Premises

There are counterparts of the Curry-Paradox Lemma that invoke
alternative sets of logical principles (see, e.g., Rogerson
& Restall 2004 and Bimbó
2006). Probably the most common
version replaces the rules Id and Cont with corresponding
laws:
⊢Tα→α(IdL)(IdL)⊢Tα→α\tag{IdL}
\vdash_{\mathcal{T}} \alpha {\rightarrow}\alpha

⊢T(α→(α→β))→(α→β)(ContL)(ContL)⊢T(α→(α→β))→(α→β)
\tag{ContL} 
\vdash_{\mathcal{T}} (\alpha {\rightarrow}(\alpha {\rightarrow}\beta)) {\rightarrow}(\alpha {\rightarrow}\beta) 


The derivation now goes as follows:
123456⊢Tκ→κ⊢Tκ→(κ→π)⊢T(κ→(κ→π))→(κ→π)⊢Tκ→π⊢Tκ⊢TπIdL 1 Curry-intersubstitutivity 2 ContL 2, 3 MP 4 Curry-intersubstitutivity 4, 5 MP 1⊢Tκ→κIdL 2⊢Tκ→(κ→π)1 Curry-intersubstitutivity 3⊢T(κ→(κ→π))→(κ→π)2 ContL 4⊢Tκ→π2, 3 MP 5⊢Tκ4 Curry-intersubstitutivity 6⊢Tπ4, 5 MP 
\begin{array}{rll}
1  &amp; \vdash_{\mathcal{T}} \kappa {\rightarrow}\kappa &amp;
\textrm{IdL }\\
2  &amp; \vdash_{\mathcal{T}} \kappa {\rightarrow}(\kappa {\rightarrow}\pi) &amp;
\textrm{1 Curry-intersubstitutivity }\\
3  &amp; \vdash_{\mathcal{T}} (\kappa {\rightarrow}(\kappa {\rightarrow}\pi)) {\rightarrow}(\kappa {\rightarrow}\pi) &amp;
\textrm{2 ContL }\\
4  &amp; \vdash_{\mathcal{T}} \kappa {\rightarrow}\pi &amp;
\textrm{2, 3 MP }\\
5  &amp; \vdash_{\mathcal{T}} \kappa &amp;
\textrm{4 Curry-intersubstitutivity }\\
6  &amp; \vdash_{\mathcal{T}} \pi &amp;
\textrm{4, 5 MP }\\
\end{array}


A second common counterpart of the Curry-Paradox Lemma is due to Meyer,
Routley, and Dunn
 (1979).[15]
 It uses two principles concerning conjunction: the law form of
modus ponens and the idempotency of conjunction.
⊢T((α→β)∧α)→β(MPL)(MPL)⊢T((α→β)∧α)→β\tag{MPL}
\vdash_{\mathcal{T}} ((\alpha {\rightarrow}\beta) \wedge \alpha) {\rightarrow}\beta


(Idem∧∧_{\wedge})The sentences
αα\alpha and α∧αα∧α\alpha \wedge \alpha are intersubstitutable
according to TTT


This time the derivation goes as follows:
12345⊢T((κ→π)∧κ)→π⊢T(κ∧κ)→π⊢Tκ→π⊢Tκ⊢TπMPL 1 Curry-intersubstitutivity 2 Idem∧ 4 Curry-intersubstitutivity 3, 4 MP 1⊢T((κ→π)∧κ)→πMPL 2⊢T(κ∧κ)→π1 Curry-intersubstitutivity 3⊢Tκ→π2 Idem∧ 4⊢Tκ4 Curry-intersubstitutivity 5⊢Tπ3, 4 MP 
\begin{array}{rll}
1  &amp; \vdash_{\mathcal{T}} ((\kappa {\rightarrow}\pi) \wedge \kappa) {\rightarrow}\pi &amp;
  \textrm{MPL }\\
2  &amp; \vdash_{\mathcal{T}} (\kappa \wedge \kappa) {\rightarrow}\pi &amp;
  \textrm{1 Curry-intersubstitutivity }\\
3  &amp; \vdash_{\mathcal{T}} \kappa {\rightarrow}\pi &amp;
  \textrm{2 Idem\(_{\wedge}\) }\\
4  &amp; \vdash_{\mathcal{T}} \kappa &amp;
  \textrm{4 Curry-intersubstitutivity }\\
5  &amp; \vdash_{\mathcal{T}} \pi &amp;
  \textrm{3, 4 MP }\\
\end{array}


Formulating the Curry-Paradox Lemma using Cont, rather than ContL or
MPL, will make it easier to call attention (in the next section) to
significant differences within the class of responses that reject both
of the latter
 principles.[16]

4. Responses to Curry’s Paradox

Responses to Curry’s paradox can be divided into two classes,
based on whether they accept the Troubling Corollary that all
Curry-complete theories are trivial.



Curry-incompleteness responses accept the Troubling
Corollary. However, they deny that the target theories of properties,
sets or truth are Curry-complete. Curry-incompleteness responses can,
and usually do, embrace classical logic.


Curry-completeness responses reject the Troubling Corollary;
they insist that there can be nontrivial Curry-complete theories. Any
such theory must violate one or more of the logical principles assumed
in the Curry-Paradox Lemma. Since classical logic validates those
principles, these responses invoke a non-classical
 logic.[17]



There is also the option of advocating a Curry-incompleteness response
to Curry paradoxes arising in one domain, say set theory, while
advocating a Curry-completeness response to Curry paradoxes arising in
another domain, say property theory (e.g.,
Field 2008; Beall 2009).
4.1 Curry-Incompleteness Responses

Examples of prominent theories of truth that supply
Curry-incompleteness responses to Curry’s paradox include
Tarski’s hierarchical theory, the 
  revision theory of truth
 (Gupta & Belnap 1993) and the
contextualist approaches (Burge
1979, Simmons 1993, and 
Glanzberg 2001, 2004). These theories all
restrict the “naive” transparency principle
 (Truth).
 For an overview, see the entry on the 
  Liar paradox. In the
context of set theory Curry-incompleteness responses include
Russellian type theories and various theories that restrict the
“naive” set abstraction principle
 (Set).
 See the entries on
 Russell’s paradox
 and
 alternative axiomatic set theories.

In general, the considerations relevant to evaluating most
Curry-incompleteness responses don’t appear to be specific to
Curry’s paradox, but pertain equally to the Liar paradox (in the
truth-theoretic domain) and Russell’s paradox (in the set- and
property-theoretic
 domains).[18]
 For that reason the rest of this entry will focus on Curry-completeness
responses, though
 section 6.3
 briefly returns to the distinction in the context of so-called
validity Curry paradoxes.

4.2 Curry-Completeness Responses

Curry-completeness responses to Curry’s paradox hold that there
are theories that are Curry-complete yet nontrivial; such a theory
must violate one or more of the logical principles assumed in the
Curry-Paradox Lemma. Since the rule Id has generally been left
unquestioned (but see French 2016 and Nicolai
& Rossi forthcoming), this has meant denying that the
conditional →→{\rightarrow} of a nontrivial Curry-complete theory
satisfies both MP and Cont. Accordingly, responses have fallen into
two categories.

(I)The most common
strategy has been to accept that such a theory’s conditional
obeys MP, but deny that it obeys Cont. Since Cont is a contraction
principle, such responses can be called contraction-free.
This strategy was first proposed by Moh
(1954), who is cited approvingly by Geach
(1955) and Prior
(1955).


(II)A second and much
more recent strategy is to accept that such a theory’s
conditional obeys Cont, but deny that it obeys MP (sometimes called
the rule of “detachment”). Such responses can be called
detachment-free. This strategy is advocated, in different
ways, by Ripley (2013) and Beall
(2015).


Each category of Curry-completeness responses can in turn be
subdivided according to how it blocks purported derivations of Cont
and MP.
4.2.1 Contraction-Free Responses

The principle Cont that is rejected by contraction-free responses
follows from two standard principles. These are single-premise
conditional proof and a slightly more general version of modus
ponens, involving at most one premise γγ\gamma:

(MP′)If γ⊢Tα→βγ⊢Tα→β\gamma
\vdash_{\mathcal{T}} \alpha {\rightarrow}\beta and γ⊢Tαγ⊢Tα\gamma
\vdash_{\mathcal{T}} \alpha then γ⊢Tβγ⊢Tβ\gamma \vdash_{\mathcal{T}}
\beta
(CP)If α⊢Tβα⊢Tβ\alpha
\vdash_{\mathcal{T}} \beta then ⊢Tα→β⊢Tα→β\vdash_{\mathcal{T}} \alpha
{\rightarrow}\beta

1234α⊢Tα→βα⊢Tαα⊢Tβ⊢Tα→βId 1, 2 MP' 3 CP 1α⊢Tα→β2α⊢TαId 3α⊢Tβ1, 2 MP′ 4⊢Tα→β3 CP 
\begin{array}{rll}
1  &amp; \alpha \vdash_{\mathcal{T}} \alpha {\rightarrow}\beta &amp;
  \\
2  &amp; \alpha \vdash_{\mathcal{T}} \alpha &amp;
  \textrm{Id }\\
3  &amp; \alpha \vdash_{\mathcal{T}} \beta &amp;
  \textrm{1, 2 MP′ }\\
4  &amp; \vdash_{\mathcal{T}} \alpha {\rightarrow}\beta &amp;
  \textrm{3 CP }\\
\end{array}


Contraction-free responses must thus reject one or the other of these
two principles for the conditional of a nontrivial Curry-complete
theory. Accordingly, two subcategories of theorists in category (I)
can be identified:

(Ia)A strongly
contraction-free response denies that →→{\rightarrow} obeys
MP′ (e.g., Mares & Paoli 2014; Slaney
1990; Weir 2015; Zardini 2011).


(Ib)A weakly
contraction-free response accepts that →→{\rightarrow} obeys
MP′, but denies that it obeys CP (e.g.,
Field 2008; Beall 2009; Nolan 2016).


The reason why responses in category (Ib) only count as
weakly contraction-free is that, as steps 1-3 show, they
accept the contraction principle according to which if α⊢Tα→βα⊢Tα→β\alpha
\vdash_{\mathcal{T}} \alpha {\rightarrow}\beta then α⊢Tβα⊢Tβ\alpha
\vdash_{\mathcal{T}} \beta.

Proponents of strongly contraction-free responses hold that MP′
doesn’t properly express the relevant form of modus
ponens. They typically present their own form of that rule
 in a “substructural” framework, specifically one that lets us
distinguish between what follows from a premise taken once
and what follows from the same premise taken twice. (See entry on
 substructural logics.)
Accordingly, MP′ needs to be replaced by

(MP″)If γ⊢Tα→βγ⊢Tα→β\gamma
\vdash_{\mathcal{T}} \alpha {\rightarrow}\beta and γ⊢Tαγ⊢Tα\gamma
\vdash_{\mathcal{T}} \alpha then γ,γ⊢Tβγ,γ⊢Tβ\gamma, \gamma
\vdash_{\mathcal{T}} \beta


and the rule of “structural contraction” needs to be
rejected:

(sCont)If Γ,γ,γ⊢TβΓ,γ,γ⊢Tβ\Gamma,
\gamma, \gamma \vdash_{\mathcal{T}} \beta then Γ,γ⊢TβΓ,γ⊢Tβ\Gamma, \gamma
\vdash_{\mathcal{T}} \beta


It is because they reject structural contraction that strongly contraction-free 
approaches can claim to preserve
modus ponens despite rejecting MP′ (see Shapiro 2011, Zardini 2013, and Ripley 2015a).

Strongly contraction-free responses also need to block a derivation of
MP′ using a pair of principles involving conjunction:

(MP′∧∧_{\land})If
γ⊢Tα→βγ⊢Tα→β\gamma \vdash_{\mathcal{T}} \alpha
{\rightarrow}\beta and δ⊢Tαδ⊢Tα\delta \vdash_{\mathcal{T}} \alpha then
γ∧δ⊢Tβγ∧δ⊢Tβ\gamma \wedge \delta \vdash_{\mathcal{T}} \beta


(Idem∧∧_{\wedge})The sentences
αα\alpha and α∧αα∧α\alpha \wedge \alpha are intersubstitutable
according to TTT

1234γ⊢Tα→βγ⊢Tαγ∧γ⊢Tβγ⊢Tβ1, 2 MP'∧ 3 Idem∧ 1γ⊢Tα→β2γ⊢Tα3γ∧γ⊢Tβ1, 2 MP′∧ 4γ⊢Tβ3 Idem∧ 
\begin{array}{rll}
1  &amp; \gamma \vdash_{\mathcal{T}} \alpha {\rightarrow}\beta &amp;
  \\
2  &amp; \gamma \vdash_{\mathcal{T}} \alpha &amp;
  \\
3  &amp; \gamma \wedge \gamma \vdash_{\mathcal{T}} \beta &amp;
  \textrm{1, 2 MP′\(_{\wedge}\) }\\
4  &amp; \gamma \vdash_{\mathcal{T}} \beta &amp;
  \textrm{3 Idem\(_{\wedge}\) }\\
\end{array}


Avoiding this derivation of MP′ requires denying that there is a
conjunction ∧∧\wedge that obeys both MP′∧∧_{\wedge} and
Idem∧∧_{\wedge}. According to many strongly contraction-free
responses (e.g., Mares & Paoli 2014;
Zardini 2011), one kind of conjunction—the
“multiplicative” kind, or “fusion”—obeys MP′∧∧_{\wedge}
but not Idem∧∧_{\wedge}, whereas another kind—the
“additive” kind—obeys Idem∧∧_{\wedge} but not
MP′∧∧_{\wedge} (see entry on
 linear logic,
 and Ripley 2015a).
If the substructural framework discussed above is used, the failure of MP′∧∧_{\wedge} amounts to the fact that for additive conjunction, 
γ,δ⊢Tβγ,δ⊢Tβ\gamma, \delta \vdash_{\mathcal{T}} \beta is not equivalent to γ∧δ⊢Tβγ∧δ⊢Tβ\gamma \wedge \delta \vdash_{\mathcal{T}} \beta.

As for weakly contraction-free responses, the failure of CP has
sometimes been motivated using “worlds” semantics of the
sort that involve a distinction between logically possible
and impossible worlds (e.g., Beall
2009; Nolan 2016). To refute CP we need the truth of α⊢Tβα⊢Tβ\alpha
\vdash_\mathcal{T} \beta and the falsity of ⊢Tα→β⊢Tα→β\vdash_\mathcal{T}
\alpha{\rightarrow}\beta. On the target “worlds”
approaches ⊢T⊢T\vdash_\mathcal{T} is defined as truth preservation
over a proper subset of worlds (in a model), namely, the
“possible worlds” of the model. Hence, for α⊢Tβα⊢Tβ\alpha
\vdash_\mathcal{T} \beta to be true is for there to be no possible
world (in any model) at which αα\alpha is true and ββ\beta untrue.
In turn, to refute ⊢Tα→β⊢Tα→β\vdash_\mathcal{T}\alpha{\rightarrow}\beta we
need a possible world at which α→βα→β\alpha{\rightarrow}\beta is untrue.
How does that happen? Because connectives are defined in a way that
takes account of all (types of) worlds in the model (possible
and, if there be any, impossible) there’s an option for
α→βα→β\alpha{\rightarrow}\beta to be untrue at a possible world in
virtue of αα\alpha being true and ββ\beta being untrue at an
impossible world. And that’s just what happens on the
target approaches. (Exactly how one defines the truth-at-a-world and
falsity-at-a-world conditions for the arrow depends on the exact
“worlds” approach at issue.)
4.2.2 Detachment-Free Responses

Detachment-free responses must block a straightforward derivation of
MP based on a principle of transitivity together with the converse of single-premise
conditional proof:

(Trans)If α⊢Tβα⊢Tβ\alpha
\vdash_{\mathcal{T}} \beta and ⊢Tα⊢Tα\vdash_{\mathcal{T}} \alpha, then
⊢Tβ⊢Tβ\vdash_{\mathcal{T}} \beta
(CCP) If
⊢Tα→β⊢Tα→β\vdash_{\mathcal{T}} \alpha {\rightarrow}\beta then α⊢Tβα⊢Tβ\alpha
\vdash_{\mathcal{T}} \beta

1234⊢Tα→β⊢Tαα⊢Tβ⊢Tβ1 CCP 2, 3 Trans 1⊢Tα→β2⊢Tα3α⊢Tβ1 CCP 4⊢Tβ2, 3 Trans 
\begin{array}{rll}
1  &amp; \vdash_{\mathcal{T}} \alpha {\rightarrow}\beta &amp;
  \\
2  &amp; \vdash_{\mathcal{T}} \alpha &amp;
  \\
3  &amp; \alpha \vdash_{\mathcal{T}} \beta &amp;
  \textrm{1 CCP }\\
4  &amp; \vdash_{\mathcal{T}} \beta &amp;
  \textrm{2, 3 Trans }\\
\end{array}


There are two subcategories of theorists in category (II):

(IIa)A strongly
detachment-free response denies that →→{\rightarrow} obeys CCP
(Goodship 1996; Beall 2015).
(IIb)A weakly
detachment-free response accepts that →→{\rightarrow} obeys
CCP, but rejects Trans (Ripley
2013).


The reason why responses in category (IIb) are only weakly
detachment-free is that CCP, which these responses accept, can be
regarded as a kind of detachment principle for the conditional.

One strategy for replying to the charge that detachment-free responses
are counterintuitive has been to appeal to a connection between
consequence and our acceptance and rejection of sentences. According
to this connection, whenever it is the case that α⊢Tβα⊢Tβ\alpha
\vdash_{\mathcal{T}} \beta, this means (or at least implies) that it
is incoherent by the lights of theory TT\mathcal{T} to accept
αα\alpha while rejecting ββ\beta (see
Restall 2005). Now suppose that, by the lights of a theory
TT\mathcal{T}, it is incoherent to reject αα\alpha and it is also
incoherent to accept αα\alpha while rejecting ββ\beta. Then,
Ripley (2013) argues, there need be nothing incoherent by the theory’s
lights about rejecting ββ\beta, as long as one doesn’t also
accept αα\alpha. There is thus room to give up Trans and adopt a
weakly detachment-free response to Curry’s paradox.
Beall’s defense of the strongly detachment-free approach rests
on related considerations. He argues, in effect, that a principle
weaker than CCP can play the relevant role in constraining the
combinations of acceptance and rejection of sentences including
αα\alpha, ββ\beta, and α→βα→β\alpha {\rightarrow}\beta.
4.2.3 Application to the Informal Argument

The approaches to Curry’s paradox just distinguished 
find fault with different inferences and sub-conclusions of the informal paradoxical argument in 
 section 1.1.
A strongly contraction-free response corresponds to blocking step (3)
of that argument, since it rejects MP′.  A weakly
contraction-free response instead blocks step (4), since it rejects
CP. Neither kind of detachment-free response will accept the reasoning
in step (3). Since they accept Cont, detachment-free responses allow
us to derive the conclusion of (4), whence weakly
detachment-free responses further allow us to derive the conclusion of
(3) by CCP.  However, both kinds of detachment-free response find
fault with the final move by MP to (6).
5. The Significance of Curry’s Paradox

In this section, we explain some distinctive lessons that can be
learned by considering Curry’s paradox. For discussion of the
kinds of significance that versions of Curry’s paradox share
with related paradoxes, see the entries on
 Russell’s paradox
 and the
 Liar paradox.
5.1 Dashing Hopes for Solutions to Negation Paradoxes

Starting with Church (1942), Moh
(1954), Geach
(1955), Löb (1955) and Prior
(1955), discussion of Curry’s
paradox has emphasized that it differs from Russell’s paradox,
and the Liar paradox, in that it doesn’t “involv[e]
negation essentially” (Anderson 1975:
 128).[19]
 One reason the negation-free status of Curry’s paradox matters
is that it renders the paradox resistant to some resolutions that
might be adequate for such “negation paradoxes”.

Geach argues that Curry’s paradox poses a problem for any
proponents of naive truth theory or naive set theory who, faced with
negation paradoxes,


might … hope to avoid [these paradoxes] by using a logical system
in which ‘ppp if and only if not-ppp’ were a theorem
for some interpretations of ‘ppp’ without our being able
to infer thence any arbitrary statement…. (Geach
1955: 71)


The problem, he says, is that Curry’s paradox “cannot be
resolved merely by adopting a system that contains a queer sort of
negation”. Rather, “if we want to retain the naive view of
truth, or the naive view of classes …, then we must modify the
elementary rules of inference relating to ‘if’”
(1955: 72). Geach’s view of the
significance of Curry’s paradox is closely echoed by Meyer,
Routley, and Dunn (1979: 127). They
conclude that Curry’s paradox frustrates those who had
“hoped that weakening classical negation principles” would
resolve Russell’s
 paradox.[20]


In short, the point is that there are non-classical logics with weak
negation principles that resolve Russell’s paradox and the Liar,
yet remain vulnerable to Curry’s paradox. These are logics with
the following features:

(a)They can serve as
the basis for a nontrivial theory according to which some sentence is
intersubstitutable with its own negation.
(b)They can’t
serve as the basis for a nontrivial theory that is
Curry-complete.


While it is unclear which logics Geach may have had in mind, there are
indeed non-classical logics that meet these two conditions. Theories
based on these logics accordingly remain vulnerable to Curry’s
paradox.
5.1.1 Paraconsistent Solutions Frustrated

Meyer, Routley, and Dunn (1979) call
attention to one class of logics that meet conditions (a) and (b).
They are among the 
  paraconsistent logics, which are logics
according to which a sentence together with its negation will 
not entail any arbitrary sentence. Paraconsistent logics can be used to obtain
theories that resolve Russell’s paradox, and the Liar, by
embracing negation inconsistency without succumbing to triviality.

According to such a theory TT\mathcal{T}, sentences λλ\lambda and
¬λ¬λ\lnot\lambda can be intersubstitutable, as long as both ⊢Tλ⊢Tλ\vdash
_{\mathcal{T}} \lambda and ⊢T¬λ⊢T¬λ\vdash _{\mathcal{T}} \lnot \lambda.
Such theories are “glutty”, in the sense that they affirm
some sentence together with its negation (see entry on
 dialetheism).
 Yet a number of prominent paraconsistent logics can’t serve as
the basis for Curry-complete theories on pain of triviality. Such
logics are sometimes said to fail to be “Curry
paraconsistent” (Slaney
 1989).[21]

5.1.2 Paracomplete Solutions Frustrated

Many of the non-classical logics that have been proposed to underwrite
responses to Russell’s paradox and the Liar paradox are
paracomplete logics, logics that reject the law of excluded
middle. These logics make possible “gappy” theories. In
particular, where λλ\lambda and ¬λ¬λ\lnot\lambda are
intersubstitutable according to such a theory TT\mathcal{T}, it will
fail to be the case that ⊢Tλ∨¬λ⊢Tλ∨¬λ\vdash _{\mathcal{T}} \lambda \lor \lnot
\lambda. Some of these paracomplete logics likewise meet conditions
(a) and (b).

One example is the logic Ł33_{3} based on the three-valued
truth-tables of Łukasiewicz (see, e.g.,
Priest 2008). Since it meets condition (a), Ł33_{3}
offers a possible response to Russell’s paradox and the
Liar—in particular, a gappy response. Yet consider the
iterated conditional α→(α→β)α→(α→β)\alpha {\rightarrow}(\alpha
{\rightarrow}\beta), which we abbreviate as α⇒βα⇒β\alpha \Rightarrow
\beta. Suppose that a Curry sentence for ππ\pi and an
Ł33_{3}-based theory TT\mathcal{T} is redefined to be any
sentence κκ\kappa intersubstitutable with κ⇒πκ⇒π\kappa \Rightarrow
\pi. Then TT\mathcal{T} will meet all the conditions of the
Curry-Paradox Lemma, as was first noted by Moh
(1954). Hence, as long as there is a κκ\kappa that is
intersubstitutable with κ⇒πκ⇒π\kappa \Rightarrow \pi according to
TT\mathcal{T}, then ⊢Tπ⊢Tπ\vdash _{\mathcal{T}} \pi. Consequently
Ł33_{3} won’t underwrite a response to Curry’s
 paradox.[22]


To summarize: Curry’s paradox stands in the way of some
otherwise available avenues for resolving semantic paradoxes by means
of glutty or gappy theories. As a result, the need to evade
Curry’s paradox has played a significant role in the development
of non-classical logics (e.g., Priest 2006;
Field 2008).
5.2 Pointing to a General Paradox Structure

The negation-free status of Curry’s paradox matters for a second
reason. Prior makes the following important point:


We can … say not only that Curry’s paradox does not
involve negation but that even Russell’s paradox presupposes
only those properties of negation which it shares with implication.
(Prior 1955:
 180)[23]



What he has in mind is that Russell’s paradox and Curry’s
paradox can be understood as resulting from the same general
structure, which can be instantiated either using negation or
using a
 conditional.[24]


The general structure can be made explicit by defining a type of unary
connective that gives rise to Curry’s paradox, and showing how
this type is exemplified both by negation and by a unary
connective defined in terms of a conditional.


Definition 3 (Curry connective)
 Let ππ\pi be a sentence in the language of
theory TT\mathcal{T}. The unary connective ⊙⊙\odot is a Curry
connective for ππ\pi and TT\mathcal{T} provided it satisfies two
principles:
If⊢Tα and ⊢T⊙α then ⊢Tπ.(P1)(P1)If⊢Tα and ⊢T⊙α then ⊢Tπ.\tag{P1}
\textrm{If} \vdash_{\mathcal{T}} \alpha \textrm{ and } \vdash_{\mathcal{T}} \odot\alpha \textrm{ then } \vdash_{\mathcal{T}} \pi.

If α⊢T⊙α then ⊢T⊙α.(P2)(P2)If α⊢T⊙α then ⊢T⊙α.\tag{P2}
\textrm{If } \alpha \vdash_{\mathcal{T}} \odot\alpha \textrm{ then } \vdash_{\mathcal{T}} \odot\alpha.




Generalized Curry-Paradox Lemma Suppose that
TT\mathcal{T} is such that Id holds and that for some pair of
sentences ππ\pi and μμ\mu, (i) μμ\mu and ⊙μ⊙μ\odot\mu are
intersubstitutable according to TT\mathcal{T} and (ii) ⊙⊙\odot is
a Curry connective for ππ\pi and TT\mathcal{T}. In that case
⊢Tπ⊢Tπ\vdash_{\mathcal{T}}
 \pi.[25]


Proof: 
12345μ⊢Tμμ⊢T⊙μ⊢T⊙μ⊢Tμ⊢TπId 1 Curry-intersubstitutivity 2 P2 3 Curry-intersubstitutivity 3, 4 P1 1μ⊢TμId 2μ⊢T⊙μ1 Curry-intersubstitutivity 3⊢T⊙μ2 P2 4⊢Tμ3 Curry-intersubstitutivity 5⊢Tπ3, 4 P1 
\begin{array}{rll}
1  &amp; \mu \vdash_{\mathcal{T}} \mu &amp;
  \textrm{Id }\\
2  &amp; \mu \vdash_{\mathcal{T}} \odot\mu &amp;
  \textrm{1 Curry-intersubstitutivity }\\
3  &amp; \vdash_{\mathcal{T}} \odot\mu &amp;
  \textrm{2 P2 }\\
4  &amp; \vdash_{\mathcal{T}} \mu &amp;
  \textrm{3 Curry-intersubstitutivity }\\
5  &amp; \vdash_{\mathcal{T}} \pi &amp;
  \textrm{3, 4 P1 }\\
\end{array}



The Generalized Curry-Paradox Lemma can now be instantiated in two
different ways, so as to yield either Curry’s paradox or a
negation paradox:



To obtain Curry’s paradox, let the unary connective ⊙⊙\odot be
such that ⊙α⊙α\odot\alpha is α→πα→π\alpha {\rightarrow}\pi, and let
μμ\mu be a sentence intersubstitutable with μ→πμ→π\mu
{\rightarrow}\pi according to TT\mathcal{T}. Then P1 amounts to
the instance of MP used in our derivation of the Curry-Paradox Lemma,
while P2 is nothing other than our rule Cont.
If ⊢Tα→β and ⊢Tα then ⊢Tβ(MP)(MP)If ⊢Tα→β and ⊢Tα then ⊢Tβ\tag{MP}
\textrm{If }\vdash_{\mathcal{T}} \alpha {\rightarrow}\beta\textrm{ and }\vdash_{\mathcal{T}} \alpha\textrm{ then }\vdash_{\mathcal{T}} \beta

If α⊢Tα→β then ⊢Tα→β(Cont)(Cont)If α⊢Tα→β then ⊢Tα→β\tag{Cont}
\textrm{If }\alpha \vdash_{\mathcal{T}} \alpha {\rightarrow}\beta\textrm{ then }\vdash_{\mathcal{T}} \alpha {\rightarrow}\beta




To obtain a negation paradox, let ⊙α⊙α\odot\alpha be ¬α¬α\lnot\alpha,
and let μμ\mu be a sentence intersubstitutable with ¬μ¬μ\lnot\mu
according to
 TT\mathcal{T}.[26]
 Then P1 amounts to an instance of ex contradictione
quodlibet (or “explosion”), while P2 is a
reductio principle.
If ⊢Tα and ⊢T¬α then ⊢Tβ(ECQ)(ECQ)If ⊢Tα and ⊢T¬α then ⊢Tβ\tag{ECQ}
\textrm{If }\vdash_{\mathcal{T}} \alpha\textrm{ and }\vdash_{\mathcal{T}} \lnot\alpha\textrm{ then }\vdash_{\mathcal{T}} \beta

If α⊢T¬α then ⊢T¬α(Red)(Red)If α⊢T¬α then ⊢T¬α\tag{Red}
\textrm{If }\alpha \vdash_{\mathcal{T}} \lnot\alpha\textrm{ then }\vdash_{\mathcal{T}} \lnot\alpha




Prior’s point is that the features of negation that are relevant
to Russell’s paradox or the Liar paradox are exhausted by
its status as a Curry connective. This makes clear why these
paradoxes do not depend on features of negation, such as excluded
middle or double negation elimination, that fail to hold in
nonclassical theories where negation remains a Curry connective (e.g.,
in intuitionistic theories, where ECQ and Red both
 hold).[27]


Moreover, a Curry connective need not be very negation-like at all. It
may fail to be even a minimal negation (see entry on
 negation),
 since it need not obey the law of double introduction:
α⊢T⊙⊙α.(DI)(DI)α⊢T⊙⊙α.\tag{DI}
\alpha \vdash _{\mathcal{T}} \odot\odot\alpha.


For example, suppose that ⊙α⊙α\odot\alpha is α→πα→π\alpha
{\rightarrow}\pi. Then in order for ⊙⊙\odot to obey DI, it would
have to be the case that α⊢T(α→π)→πα⊢T(α→π)→π\alpha \vdash _{\mathcal{T}} (\alpha
{\rightarrow}\pi) {\rightarrow}\pi. That principle is violated by a
number of non-classical theories for which ⊙⊙\odot, when defined
this way, does qualify as a Curry
 connective.[28]


To summarize: Curry’s paradox points to a general structure
instantiated by a wide range of paradoxes. This structure
doesn’t itself involve negation, but it is also displayed by
paradoxes that (unlike Curry’s paradox) do essentially involve
negation, such as Russell’s paradox and the Liar paradox.

The issue of which paradoxes display a common structure becomes
important in light of the “principle of uniform solution”
influentially advocated by Priest
(1994). According to this principle, paradoxes that belong to
the “same kind” should receive the “same kind of
solution”. Suppose that we delimit one kind of paradox as
follows:


Definition 4 (Generalized Curry paradox) We have a
generalized Curry paradox in any case where the assumptions stated in
the Generalized Curry-Paradox Lemma appear to hold.


Assuming one accepts the principle of uniform solution, the question
becomes what counts as proposing a uniform solution to all generalized
Curry paradoxes. In particular, does it suffice to show, for every
instance of the kind thus delimited, that what appears to be a Curry
connective in fact fails to be one? It would seem that this should
indeed be enough. It’s unclear why uniformity should
additionally require that all seeming Curry connectives fail to
qualify as such in virtue of violating the same
condition. For instance, suppose that negation and our unary
connective defined using →→{\rightarrow} both appear to satisfy the
generalized principle P2, in the former case because ¬¬{\lnot}
appears to obey Red and in the latter case because →→{\rightarrow}
appears to obey Cont. Unless these two appearances share a common
source (e.g., an implicit reliance on structural contraction, as
claimed by Zardini 2011), there need be nothing objectionably
non-uniform about taking one appearance at face value while dismissing
the other as deceptive. (For discussion of the philosophical issue
here, applied to a different class of paradoxes, see the exchange in
Smith 2000 and Priest 2000.)

If that is right, the desideratum that generalized Curry paradoxes be
resolved uniformly needn’t discriminate between the various
logically revisionary solutions that have been pursued. These include
the following three options:

One might hold that it is principle P1 alone that fails when
⊙α⊙α\odot\alpha is instantiated as ¬α¬α\lnot\alpha (to get a negation
paradox), whereas it is P2 alone that fails when ⊙α⊙α\odot\alpha is
instantiated as α→πα→π\alpha {\rightarrow}\pi (to get a Curry paradox).
On this approach, ECQ and Cont fail, while Red and MP hold (Priest
1994, 2006).
One might hold that P2 alone fails for both instantiations of
⊙⊙\odot. On this approach, Red and Cont fail, while ECQ and MP hold
(Field 2008; Zardini 2011).


One might hold that P1 alone fails for both instantiations of
⊙⊙\odot. On this approach, ECQ and MP fail, while Red and Cont hold
(Beall 2015; Ripley 2013).


Thus, for example, Priest’s own approach would count as
resolving Curry’s paradox and the Liar paradox uniformly qua
examples of generalized Curry paradox. This would be the case
despite the fact that Priest evaluates Liar sentences as both true and
false, whereas he rejects the claim that Curry sentences are true.

In any event, Curry’s paradox raises challenges in connection
with the issue of what type of uniformity should be required of
solutions to various paradoxes (see also Zardini 2015). Priest himself calls attention to a
kind of paradox narrower than the generalized Curry paradoxes, a kind
whose instances include the negation paradoxes but exclude
Curry’s paradox. This kind is picked out by Priest’s
“Inclosure Schema” (2002);
see the entry on
 self-reference.
 One ongoing dispute is about whether there might be a version of
Curry’s paradox that counts as an “inclosure
paradox”, though it resists Priest’s uniform dialetheic
solution to such paradoxes (see the exchange in Beall
2014b, Weber et
al. 2014, and Beall 2014a, as
well as Pleitz 2015).
6. Validity Curry

The last decade (as of the date of this version of this entry) has
witnessed a boom in attention to Curry paradoxes, and perhaps
especially to what have been called validity Curry or
v-Curry paradoxes (Whittle 2004;
Shapiro 2011; Beall & Murzi
 2013).[29]
 V-Curry involves Curry sentences that specifically invoke a
theory’s consequence or “validity” relation, by
using either a conditional or a predicate that purports to express
theory TT\mathcal{T}’s relation ⊢T⊢T\vdash_\mathcal{T} in the
language of TT\mathcal{T} itself.
6.1 Connective Form

For one form of v-Curry paradox, let the conditional mentioned in the
definition of a Curry sentence
 (Definition 1)
 be a consequence connective ⇒⇒{\Rightarrow}. A sentence
with ⇒⇒{\Rightarrow} as its major operator is to be interpreted
thus: “That ppp entails (according to TT\mathcal{T}) that
qqq”. 
We now immediately obtain property-theoretic, set-theoretic or
truth-theoretic versions of Curry’s paradox, provided only that
⇒⇒{\Rightarrow} meets the conditions MP and Cont of the
Curry-Paradox Lemma. 

What makes this instance of the Curry-Paradox
Lemma particularly troublesome is that it poses an obstacle to one
common response to Curry’s paradox, namely the weakly
contraction-free response discussed in
 section 4.2.1.
 That response depended on rejecting the rule CP of single-premise
conditional proof, one direction of the single-premise
“deduction theorem”. But this is a rule that has seemed
difficult to resist for a consequence connective (Shapiro
2011; Weber 2014; Zardini 2013). If
ββ\beta is a consequence of αα\alpha according to the consequence
relation of theory TT\mathcal{T}, where this theory has
⇒⇒{\Rightarrow} as its own consequence connective, then
TT\mathcal{T} must surely contain the consequence claim α⇒βα⇒β\alpha
{\Rightarrow}\beta. Likewise, this variety of Curry paradox poses an
obstacle for detachment-free responses, which
require rejecting the rule MP. If a theory with its own consequence
connective contains both αα\alpha and the consequence conditional
α⇒βα⇒β\alpha {\Rightarrow}\beta, then it must surely contain ββ\beta
as well. Or so, at least, it has seemed. Admittedly, the proponent of a weakly detachment-free response will argue that MP for ⇒⇒{\Rightarrow} illicitly builds in transitivity (see section 4.2.2).
Still, what seems inescapable is the converse of CP, the rule CCP that is the other direction of the single-premise deduction theorem. If a theory contains the consequence conditional α⇒βα⇒β\alpha {\Rightarrow}\beta, then surely ββ\beta follows from αα\alpha according to the theory. That would still rule out a strongly detachment-free response.
6.2 Predicate Form

A second form of v-Curry paradox arises for a theory TVTV\mathcal{T}_V
whose subject-matter includes the single-premise consequence relation
⊢TV⊢TV\vdash_{\mathcal{T}_{V}} that obtains, according to that very
theory, between sentences in its
 language.[30]
 Let this relation be expressed by the predicate Val(x,y)Val(x,y)Val(x,y), and
assume further that there is a sentence χχ\chi that is either
Val(⟨χ⟩,⟨π⟩)Val(⟨χ⟩,⟨π⟩)Val(\langle\chi\rangle, \langle\pi\rangle), or is at least intersubstitutable with the latter according to TVTV\mathcal{T}_V. One form of v-Curry
paradox employs two principles governing ValValVal, which we call
“validity detachment” and “validity proof”
following Beall & Murzi (2013).
If γ⊢TVVal(⟨α⟩,⟨β⟩) and γ⊢TVα then γ⊢TVβ(VD)(VD)If γ⊢TVVal(⟨α⟩,⟨β⟩) and γ⊢TVα then γ⊢TVβ\tag{VD}
\textrm{If }\gamma \vdash_{\mathcal{T}_{V}} Val(\langle\alpha\rangle, \langle\beta\rangle)\textrm{ and }\gamma \vdash_{\mathcal{T}_{V}} \alpha\textrm{ then }\gamma \vdash_{\mathcal{T}_{V}} \beta

If α⊢TVβ then ⊢TVVal(⟨α⟩,⟨β⟩)(VP)(VP)If α⊢TVβ then ⊢TVVal(⟨α⟩,⟨β⟩)\tag{VP}
\textrm{If }\alpha \vdash_{\mathcal{T}_{V}} \beta\textrm{ then }\vdash_{\mathcal{T}_{V}} Val(\langle\alpha\rangle, \langle\beta\rangle)


Using these principles, we get the following quick argument for
⊢TVπ⊢TVπ\vdash_{\mathcal{T}_{V}} \pi.

  \textrm{4 Curry-intersubstitutivity }\\
6  &amp; \vdash_{\mathcal{T}_{V}} \pi &amp;
  \textrm{4, 5 VD }\\
\end{array}


As applied to this predicate form of v-Curry, a weakly
contraction-free response would resist the “contraction”
from step 2 to step 4 by rejecting the rule VP, and a
detachment-free response would reject VD, even in the zero-premise form used at step 6. Again, though, both
VP and zero-premise VD have seemed inescapable in view of the intended
interpretation of the predicate ValValVal (Beall
& Murzi 2013; Murzi 2014; Murzi & Shapiro 2015; Priest 2015;
Zardini 2014).[31] 
 Finally, even if VD is rejected as illicitly involving transitivity, what seems inescapable is the converse of VP. If so, that would at least rule out a strongly detachment-free response.

An arguably more powerful version of v-Curry reasoning is presented by
Shapiro (2013) and Field
(2017: 7). This reasoning can take either
connective or predicate form, but it doesn’t depend on CP or VP.
Here we give the predicate form using ValValVal. As above, we first
derive that χ⊢TVπχ⊢TVπ\chi \vdash_{\mathcal{T}_{V}} \pi using VD. In view of the
meaning of ValValVal, the conclusion that χ⊢TVπχ⊢TVπ\chi \vdash_{\mathcal{T}_{V}}
\pi shows that Val(⟨χ⟩,⟨π⟩)Val(⟨χ⟩,⟨π⟩)Val(\langle\chi\rangle, \langle\pi\rangle) is
true, i.e., that χχ\chi is true. But if χχ\chi is true and χ⊢TVπχ⊢TVπ\chi \vdash_{\mathcal{T}_{V}}
\pi, then it would seem
ππ\pi must also be true. Since weakly detachment-free
(nontransitive) responses to v-Curry do allow the derivation of χ⊢TVπχ⊢TVπ\chi
\vdash_{\mathcal{T}_{V}} \pi, this reasoning poses an objection to
such responses as well.
6.3 Significance

If, in fact, v-Curry paradoxes aren’t amenable to weakly
contraction-free or strongly detachment-free responses, then (assuming the rule Id is retained) the
space of Curry-complete responses is restricted to strongly
contraction-free and weakly detachment-free responses.
The former responses, as explained in
 section 4.2.1,
 are typically presented by reformulating modus ponens (or detachment for the validity predicate) in a substructural deduction system and rejecting the structural contraction rule sCont. The
latter responses, as explained in
 section 4.2.2,
 reject the structural principle of transitivity. For this reason,
v-Curry paradoxes have sometimes been taken to motivate
substructural consequence relations (e.g.,
Barrio et al. forthcoming; Beall & Murzi
2013; Ripley 2015a; Shapiro 2011, 2015).[32]

The lively and wide-ranging debate on v-Curry paradoxes has resulted
in genuine progress in our understanding of Curry paradoxes. In the
end, what has become clear is that while v-Curry paradoxes may invite
different resolutions from non-v-Curry paradoxes, they remain within
the same mold as generalized Curry paradoxes. In particular, in the
general template of
 section 5.2
 one may take ⊙⊙\odot to express (either as a predicate or as a
connective) consequence in light of ⊢T⊢T\vdash_\mathcal{T} itself.
This is the heart of v-Curry. Inasmuch as there are (many) different
(formal) consequence relations definable over our language (e.g.,
logical consequence in virtue of logical vocabulary, epistemic
consequence in virtue of logical-plus-epistemic vocabulary, and so on)
there are thereby many different v-Curry paradoxes that may arise.
Still, the space of solutions to these paradoxes is the space of
solutions to the generalized Curry paradoxes canvassed in this
entry.

There remain, however, at least two reasons v-Curry paradoxes merit
separate attention.  First, as noted above, two categories of
Curry-complete solutions — the weakly contraction-free and
strongly detachment-free options — have appeared especially
problematic in the case of v-Curry paradoxes. Second, suppose that one
treats an ordinary Curry paradox (property-theoretic, set-theoretic or
semantic) in a Curry-complete fashion. There may still be reason to
treat the corresponding (connective or predicate) v-Curry paradox in a
Curry-incomplete fashion, perhaps in virtue of seeing a theory’s
consequence relation as essentially beyond capture by any connective
or predicate in the language of the theory (see, e.g., Myhill 1975;
Whittle 2004). Thus, a “non-uniform” solution to ordinary
Curry paradoxes and their v-Curry counterparts may — once
again — be a motivated
non-uniformity.[33]
