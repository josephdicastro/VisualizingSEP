In the logic of belief revision (belief change), a belief state (or
database) is represented by a set of sentences. The major operations
of change are those consisting in the introduction or removal of a
belief-representing sentence. In both cases, changes affecting other
sentences may be needed (for instance in order to retain consistency).
Rationality postulates for such operations have been proposed, and
representation theorems have been obtained that characterize specific
types of operations in terms of these postulates.

In the dominant theory of belief revision, the so-called AGM model,
the set representing the belief state is assumed to be a logically
closed set of sentences (a belief set). One of most debated
topics in belief revision theory is the recovery postulate, according
to which all the original beliefs are regained if one of them is first
removed and then reinserted. The recovery postulate holds in the AGM
model but not in closely related models employing belief bases.
Another much discussed topic is how repeated changes can be adequately
represented. Several alternative models have been proposed that are
intended to provide a more realistic account of belief change than
that offered by the AGM model. 
 
1. Introduction
1.1 History

Belief revision (belief change, belief dynamics) is a young field of
research that has been recognized as a subject of its own since the
middle of the 1980s. The new subject grew out of two converging
research traditions.

One of these emerged in computer science. Since the beginning of
computing, programmers have developed procedures by which databases
can be updated. The development of Artificial Intelligence inspired
computer scientists to construct more sophisticated models of database
updating. The truth maintenance systems developed by Jon Doyle (1979)
were important in this development. One of the most significant
theoretical contributions was a 1983 paper by Ronald Fagin, Jeffrey
Ullman and Moshe Vardi, in which they introduced the notion of
database priorities. 

The second of these two research traditions is philosophical. In a
wide sense, belief change has been a subject of philosophical
reflection since antiquity. In the twentieth century, philosophers
have discussed the mechanisms by which scientific theories develop,
and they have proposed criteria of rationality for revisions of
probability assignments. Beginning in the 1970s, a more focused
discussion has taken place on the requirements of rational belief
change. Two milestones can be pointed out. The first was a series of
studies conducted by Isaac Levi in the 1970s (Levi 1977, 1980). Levi
posed many of the problems that have since then been major concerns in
this field of research. He also provided much of the basic formal
framework. William Harper’s (1977) work from the same period has
also had a lasting influence. 

The next milestone was the AGM model, so called after its three
originators, Carlos Alchourrón, Peter Gärdenfors, and
David Makinson (1985). Alchourrón and Makinson had previously
cooperated in studies of changes in legal codes (Alchourrón and
Makinson 1981, 1982). Gärdenfors’s early work was concerned
with the connections between belief change and conditional sentences
(Gärdenfors 1978, 1981). With combined forces the three wrote a
paper that provided a new, much more general and versatile formal
framework for studies of belief change. (On the history of their joint
work, see Makinson 2003 and Gärdenfors 2011.) Since the paper was
published in the Journal of Symbolic Logic in 1985, its major
concepts and constructions have been the subject of significant
elaboration and development. The AGM model and developments that have
grown out of it still form the core of belief revision theory.
1.2 The representation of beliefs and changes

In the AGM model and most other models of belief change, beliefs are
represented by sentences in some formal language. Sentences do not
capture all aspects of belief, but they are the best general-purpose
representation that is presently available.

The beliefs held by an agent are represented by a set of such
belief-representing sentences. It is usually assumed that this set is
closed under logical consequence, i.e., every sentence that follows
logically from this set is already in the set. This is clearly an
unrealistic idealization, since it means that the agent is taken to be
“logically omniscient.” However, it is a useful
idealization since it simplifies the logical treatment; indeed, it
seems difficult to obtain an interesting formal treatment without it.
In logic, logically closed sets are called “theories”. In
formal epistemology they are also called “corpora”,
“knowledge sets”, or (more commonly) “belief
sets”.

Isaac Levi (1991) has clarified the nature of this idealization by
pointing out that a belief set consists of the sentences that someone
is committed to believe, not those that she actually
believes in. According to Levi, we are doxastically committed to
believe in all the logical consequences of our beliefs, but typically
our performance does not live up to this commitment. The belief set is
the set of the agent’s epistemic commitments, and therefore
larger than the set of her actually held belief.

In the AGM framework, there are three types of belief change. In
contraction, a specified sentence ppp is removed,
i.e., a belief set KKK is superseded by another belief set
K÷pK÷pK\div p that is a subset of KKK not
containing ppp. In expansion a sentence ppp is
added to KKK, and nothing is removed, i.e. KKK is
replaced by a set K+pK+pK+p that is the smallest logically
closed set that contains both KKK and ppp. In
revision a sentence ppp is added to KKK, and at
the same time other sentences are removed if this is needed to ensure
that the resulting belief set K∗pK∗pK* p is
consistent.

It is important to note the specific character of these models. They
are input-assimilating. This means that the object of change,
the belief set, is exposed to an input, and is changed as a result of
this. No explicit representation of time is included. Instead, the
characteristic mathematical constituent is a function that, to each
pair of a belief set and an input, assigns a new belief set.
1.3 Formal preliminaries

The belief-representing sentences form a language. (As is usual in
logic, the language is identified with the set of all sentences it
contains.) Sentences, i.e. elements of this language, will be
represented by lowercase letters (p,q…)(p,q…)(p, q\ldots) and sets of
sentences by capital letters. This language contains the usual
truth-functional connectives: negation (¬)(¬)(\neg), conjunction
(&)(&)(\amp), disjunction (∨)(∨)(\vee), implication (→)(→)(\rightarrow), and
equivalence (↔↔\leftrightarrow).  ⊥⊥\smbot denotes an arbitrary
contradiction (“falsum”), and ⊤⊤\smtop an arbitrary
tautology.

To express the logic, a Tarskian consequence operator will be
used. Intuitively speaking, for any set AAA of sentences,
Cn(A)Cn(A)\Cn(A) is the set of logical consequences of AAA. More
formally, a consequence operation on a given language is a function CnCn\Cn
from sets of sentences to sets of sentences. It satisfies the
following three conditions:

Inclusion:
A⊆Cn(A)A⊆Cn(A)A\subseteq \Cn(A)

Monotony: 
If A⊆BA⊆BA\subseteq B, then Cn(A)⊆Cn(B)Cn(A)⊆Cn(B)\Cn(A) \subseteq \Cn(B)

Iteration:
Cn(A)=Cn(Cn(A))Cn(A)=Cn(Cn(A))\Cn(A) = \Cn(\Cn(A))

CnCn\Cn is assumed to be supraclassical, i.e. if ppp can be derived
from AAA by classical truth-functional logic, then p∈Cn(A)p∈Cn(A)p \in
\Cn(A). AAA is a belief set if and only if A=Cn(A)A=Cn(A)A = \Cn(A). In what
follows, KKK will denote a belief set. X⊢pX⊢pX \vdash p is an
alternative notation for p∈Cn(X)p∈Cn(X)p \in \Cn(X), and X⊬pX⊬pX \not\vdash p
for p∉Cn(X)p∉Cn(X)p \not\in \Cn(X). Cn(∅)Cn(∅)\Cn(\varnothing) is the set of
tautologies.

The expansion of KKK by a sentence ppp, i.e. the
operation that just adds ppp and removes nothing, is denoted
K+pK+pK+p and defined as follows: K+p=Cn(K∪{p})K+p=Cn(K∪{p})K+p = \Cn(K\cup \{p\}).
2. Contraction
2.1 Partial meet contraction

The outcome of contracting KKK by ppp should be a subset
of KKK that does not imply ppp, but from which no
elements of KKK have been unnecessarily removed. Therefore, it
is of interest to consider the inclusion-maximal subsets of KKK
that do not imply ppp.

For any set AAA and sentence ppp the remainder
set A⊥pA⊥pA\bot p (“AAA remainder
ppp”) is the set of inclusion-maximal subsets of
AAA that do not imply ppp. In other words, a set
BBB is an element of A⊥pA⊥pA\bot p if and only if
it it is a subset of AAA that does not imply ppp, and
there is no set B′B′B' not implying ppp such that
B⊂B′⊆AB⊂B′⊆AB\subset B'\subseteq A. The elements of
A⊥pA⊥pA\bot p are called “remainders”.

If the operation of contraction uncompromisingly minimizes information
loss, then K÷pK÷pK\div p will be one of the remainders.
However, this construction can be shown to have implausible
properties. A more reasonable recipe for contraction is to let
K÷pK÷pK\div p be the intersection of some of the
remainders. This is partial meet contraction, the major
innovation in the classic 1985 paper by Carlos Alchourrón,
Peter Gärdenfors and David Makinson. An operation of partial meet
contraction employs a selection function that selects the
“best” elements of K⊥pK⊥pK\bot p. More
precisely, a selection function for KKK is a function γγ\gamma
such that if K⊥pK⊥pK\bot p is non-empty, then
γ(K⊥p)γ(K⊥p)\gamma(K\bot p) is a non-empty subset of
K⊥pK⊥pK\bot p. In the limiting case when
K⊥pK⊥pK\bot p is empty, then
γ(K⊥p)γ(K⊥p)\gamma(K\bot p) is defined to be equal to
{K}{K}\{K\}.

The outcome of the partial meet contraction is equal to the
intersection of the set of selected elements of
K⊥pK⊥pK\bot p, i.e. K÷p=⋂γ(K⊥p)K÷p=⋂γ(K⊥p)K\div p = \bigcap \gamma(K\bot p).

The limiting case when for all sentences ppp,
γ(K⊥p)γ(K⊥p)\gamma(K\bot p) has exactly one element is called
maxichoice contraction. The other limiting case in which
γ(K⊥p)=K⊥pγ(K⊥p)=K⊥p\gamma(K\bot p) = K\bot p
whenever K⊥pK⊥pK\bot p is non-empty is called full
meet contraction. Both limiting cases are technically useful, but
they also both have highly unrealistic properties.

Partial meet contraction of a belief set satisfies six postulates that
are called the basic Gärdenfors postulates (or basic AGM
postulates). To begin with, when a belief set KKK is contracted
by a sentence ppp, the outcome should be logically closed.

Closure:
K÷p=Cn(K÷p)K÷p=Cn(K÷p)K\div p = \Cn(K\div p)


Contraction should be successful, i.e., K÷pK÷pK\div p
should not imply ppp (or not contain ppp, which is the
same thing if Closure is satisfied). However, it would be too much to
require that p∉Cn(K÷p)p∉Cn(K÷p)p \not\in \Cn(K\div p) for
all sentences ppp, since it cannot hold if ppp is a
tautology. The success postulate has to be conditional on ppp
not being logically true.

Success:
 If p∉Cn(∅)p∉Cn(∅)p \not\in \Cn(\varnothing), then p∉Cn(K÷p)p∉Cn(K÷p)p \not\in \Cn(K\div p).


The Success postulate has been put in doubt since there may be
sentences other than tautologies that an epistemic agent may refuse to
withdraw. (On operations that do not satisfy Success, see Section
6.5.)

The contracted set is assumed to be a subset of the original one:

Inclusion:
K÷p⊆KK÷p⊆KK\div p \subseteq K


Inclusion is usually considered to be a constitutive property of
contraction. However, it has also been questioned with the argument
that when the epistemic agent ceases to believe in ppp, then
this is usually because she receives some new information that
contradicts ppp. Arguably, that information should be included
in K÷pK÷pK\div p. 

If the sentence to be contracted is not included in the original
belief set, then contraction by that sentence involves no change at
all. Such contractions are idle (vacuous) operations, and they should
leave the original set unchanged.

Vacuity:
 If p∉Cn(K)p∉Cn(K)p \not\in \Cn(K), then K÷p=KK÷p=KK\div p = K.


Logically equivalent sentences should be treated alike in
contraction:

Extensionality:
 If p↔q∈Cn(∅)p↔q∈Cn(∅)p\leftrightarrow q \in \Cn(\varnothing), then K÷p=K÷qK÷p=K÷qK\div p = K\div q.


Extensionality guarantees that the logic of contraction is extensional
in the sense of allowing logically equivalent sentences to be freely
substituted for each other.

Belief contraction should not only be successful, it should also be
minimal in the sense of leading to the loss of as few
previous beliefs as possible. The epistemic agent should give up
beliefs only when forced to do so, and should then give up as few of
them as possible. This is ensured by the following postulate:

Recovery:
K⊆(K÷p)+pK⊆(K÷p)+pK \subseteq (K\div p)+p


According to Recovery, so much is retained after ppp has been
removed that everything will be recovered by reinclusion (through
expansion) of ppp.

One of the central results about the AGM model is a representation
theorem for partial meet contraction. According to this theorem, an
operation ÷÷\div is a partial meet contraction for a belief set
KKK if and only if it satisfies the six above-mentioned
postulates, namely Closure, Success, Inclusion, Vacuity,
Extensionality, and Recovery.

A selection function for a belief set KKK should, for all
sentences ppp, select those elements of
K⊥pK⊥pK\bot p that are “best”, or most worth
retaining. However, the definition of a selection function is very
general, and allows for quite disorderly selection patterns. An
orderly selection function should always choose the best element(s) of
the remainder set according to some well-behaved preference relation.
A selection function γγ\gamma for a belief set KKK is
relational if and only if there is a binary relation
RR\mathbf{R} such that for all sentences ppp, if
K⊥pK⊥pK\bot p is non-empty, then
γ(K⊥p)={B∈K⊥p∣CRBγ(K⊥p)={B∈K⊥p∣CRB\gamma(K\bot p) = \{B \in K\bot p \mid C\mathbf{R}B
for all C∈K⊥p}C∈K⊥p}C \in K\bot p\}. Furthermore, if
RR\mathbf{R} is transitive (i.e., it satisfies: If
ARBARBA\mathbf{R}B and
BRCBRCB\mathbf{R}C, then
ARC)ARC)A\mathbf{R}C), then γγ\gamma and the partial
meet contraction that it gives rise to are transitively
relational.

In order to characterize transitively relational partial meet
contraction, postulates are needed that refer to contraction by
conjunctions.

In order to give up a conjunction p&qp&qp \amp q, the agent
must relinquish either her belief in ppp or her belief in
qqq (or both). Suppose that contracting by
p&qp&qp \amp q leads to loss of the belief in ppp,
i.e., that p∉K÷(p&q)p∉K÷(p&q)p \not\in K\div(p \amp q). It can be expected that
in this case contraction by p&qp&qp \amp q should lead to
the loss of all beliefs that would have been lost in order to contract
by ppp. Another way to express this is that everything that is
retained in K÷(p&q)K÷(p&q)K\div(p \amp q) is also
retained in K÷pK÷pK\div p:

Conjunctive inclusion:
 If p∉K÷(p&q)p∉K÷(p&q)p \not\in K\div(p \amp q), then K÷(p&q)⊆K÷pK÷(p&q)⊆K÷pK\div(p \amp q) \subseteq K\div p.


Another fairly reasonable principle for contraction by conjunctions is
that whatever can withstand both contraction by ppp and
contraction by qqq can also withstand contraction by
p&qp&qp \amp q. In other words, whatever is an element of
both K÷pK÷pK\div p and K÷qK÷qK\div q is
also an element of K÷(p&q)K÷(p&q)K\div(p \amp q).

Conjunctive overlap:
(K÷p)∩(K÷q)⊆K÷(p&q)(K÷p)∩(K÷q)⊆K÷(p&q)(K\div p) \cap (K\div q) \subseteq K\div(p \amp q)


Conjunctive overlap and Conjunctive inclusion are commonly called
Gärdenfors’s supplementary postulates for belief
contraction. An operation ÷÷\div for KKK is a transitively
relational partial meet contraction if and only if it satisfies the
six basic postulates and in addition both Conjunctive overlap and
Conjunctive inclusion.
2.2 Entrenchment-based contraction

When forced to give up previous beliefs, the epistemic agent should
give up beliefs that have as little explanatory power and overall
informational value as possible. As an example of this, in the choice
between giving up beliefs in natural laws and beliefs in single
factual statements, beliefs in the natural laws, that have much higher
explanatory power, should in general be retained. This was the basic
idea behind Peter Gärdenfors’s proposal that contraction of
beliefs should be ruled by a binary relation, epistemic
entrenchment. (Gärdenfors 1988, Gärdenfors and Makinson
1988) To say of two elements ppp and qqq of the belief
set that “qqq is more entrenched than ppp”
means that qqq is more useful in inquiry or deliberation, or
has more “epistemic value” than ppp. In belief
contraction, the beliefs with the lowest entrenchment should be the
ones that are most readily given up.

The following symbols will be used for epistemic entrenchment:

 p≤q:pp≤q:pp\le q : p is at most as entrenched as qqq.

p<q:pp<q:pp\lt q : p is less entrenched than qqq. ((p≤q)&¬(q≤p)))((p≤q)&¬(q≤p)))((p\le q) \amp \neg(q\le p)))

p≡q:pp≡q:pp\equiv q : p and qqq are equally entrenched. ((p≤q)&(q≤p))((p≤q)&(q≤p))((p\le q) \amp(q\le p))


Gärdenfors has proposed the following five postulates for
epistemic entrenchment. They are often referred to as the standard
postulates for entrenchment:


Transitivity:
 If p≤qp≤qp\le q and q≤rq≤rq\le r, then p≤rp≤rp\le r.

Dominance:
 If p⊢qp⊢qp \vdash q, then p≤qp≤qp\le q.

Conjunctiveness:
 Either p≤(p&q)p≤(p&q)p\le(p \amp q) or q≤(p&q)q≤(p&q)q\le(p \amp q).

Minimality:
 If the belief set KKK is consistent, then p∉Kp∉Kp \not\in K if and only if p≤qp≤qp\le q for all qqq.

Maximality:
 If q≤pq≤pq\le p for all qqq, then p∈Cn(∅)p∈Cn(∅)p \in \Cn(\varnothing).


It follows from the first three of these postulates that an
entrenchment relation satisfies connectivity (completeness), i.e. it
holds for all ppp and qqq that either p≤qp≤qp\le q or 
q≤pq≤pq\le p.

An entrenchment relation ≤≤\le gives rise to an operation ÷÷\div of
entrenchment-based contraction according to the following
definition:

q∈K÷pq∈K÷pq \in K\div p if and only if
q∈Kq∈Kq \in K and either p<(p∨q)p<(p∨q)p \lt(p \vee q) or p∈Cn(∅)p∈Cn(∅)p \in \Cn(\varnothing).


Entrenchment-based contraction has been shown to coincide exactly with
transitively relational partial meet contraction. For a thorough
discussion and more results on entrenchment relations, see Rott
2001.
2.3 Recovery and its avoidance

Recovery is the most debated postulate of belief change. It is easy to
find examples that seem to validate Recovery. A person who first loses
and then regains her belief that she has a dollar in her pocket seems
to return to her previous state of belief. However, other examples can
also be presented, in which Recovery yields implausible results. The
following are two of the examples that have been offered to show that
Recovery does not hold in general:



I have read in a book about Cleopatra that she had both a son and a
daughter. My set of beliefs therefore contains both ppp and
qqq, where ppp denotes that Cleopatra had a son and
qqq that she had a daughter. I then learn from a knowledgeable
friend that the book is in fact a historical novel. After that I
contract p∨qp∨qp\vee q from my set of beliefs, i.e., I do
not any longer believe that Cleopatra had a child. Soon after that,
however, I learn from a reliable source that Cleopatra had a child. It
seems perfectly reasonable for me to then add p∨qp∨qp\vee q
to my set of beliefs without also reintroducing either ppp or
qqq. This contradicts Recovery.


I previously entertained the two beliefs “George is a
criminal” (p)(p)(p) and “George is a mass
murderer” (q)(q)(q). When I received information that induced
me to give up the first of these beliefs (p)(p)(p), the second
(q)(q)(q) had to go as well (since ppp would otherwise
follow from q)q)q).

I then received new information that made me accept the belief
“George is a shoplifter” (r)(r)(r). The resulting new belief
set is the expansion of K÷pK÷pK\div p by rrr, (K÷p)+r.(K÷p)+r.(K\div p)+r. Since
ppp follows from rrr, (K÷p)+p(K÷p)+p(K\div p)+p is a subset of (K÷p)+r(K÷p)+r(K\div
p)+r. By recovery, (K÷p)+p(K÷p)+p(K\div p)+p includes qqq, from which
follows that (K÷p)+r(K÷p)+r(K\div p)+r includes qqq.

Thus, since I previously believed George to be a mass murderer, it
follows from Recovery that I cannot after that believe him to be a
shoplifter without believing him to be a mass murderer.


Due to the problematic nature of this postulate, it should be
interesting to find intuitively less controversial postulates that
prevent unnecessary losses in contraction. The following is an attempt
to do that:

Core-retainment:
If q∈Kq∈Kq \in K and q∉K÷pq∉K÷pq \not\in K\div p, then there is a belief set
K′K′K' such that K′⊆KK′⊆KK' \subseteq K and that p∉K′p∉K′p \not\in K' but p∈K′+qp∈K′+qp
\in K'+q.


Core-retainment requires of an excluded sentence qqq that it in
some way contributes to the fact that KKK implies ppp.
It gives the impression of being weaker and more plausible than
Recovery. However, it has been shown that if an operator ÷÷\div for
a belief set KKK satisfies Core-retainment, then it satisfies
Recovery.

Attempts have been made to construct operations of contraction on
belief sets that do not satisfy Recovery. Arguably, the most plausible
of these constructions is the operation of severe withdrawal
that has been thoroughly investigated by Hans Rott and Maurice
Pagnucco (2000). It can be constructed from an operation of epistemic
entrenchment by modifying the definition as follows:

q∈K÷pq∈K÷pq \in K\div p if and only if
q∈Kq∈Kq \in K and either p<qp<qp \lt q or
p∈Cn(∅)p∈Cn(∅)p \in \Cn(\varnothing).


Severe withdrawal has interesting features, but it also has the
following property:

Expulsiveness:
If p∉Cn(∅)p∉Cn(∅)p \not\in \Cn(\varnothing) and q∉Cn(∅)q∉Cn(∅)q \not\in \Cn(\varnothing)
then either p∉K÷qp∉K÷qp \not\in K\div q or q∉K÷pq∉K÷pq \not\in K\div p.


This is a highly implausible property of belief contraction, since it
does not allow unrelated beliefs to be undisturbed by each
other’s contraction. Consider a scholar who believes that her
car is parked in front of the house. She also believes that
Shakespeare wrote the Tempest. It should be possible for her to give
up the first of these beliefs while retaining the second. She should
also be able to give up the second without giving up the first.
Expulsiveness does not allow this. The construction of a plausible
operation of contraction for belief sets that does not satisfy
Recovery is still an open issue.
3. Revision

The two major tasks of an operation ∗∗* of revision are (1) to
add the new belief ppp to the belief set KKK, and (2) to
ensure that the resulting belief set K∗pK∗pK* p is
consistent (unless ppp is inconsistent). The first task can be
accomplished by expansion by ppp. The second can be
accomplished by prior contraction by its negation ¬p¬p\neg p. If
a belief set does not imply ¬p¬p\neg p, then ppp can be
added to it without loss of consistency. This composition of
suboperations gives rise to the following definition of revision
(Gärdenfors 1981, Levi 1977):

Levi identity:
K∗p=(K÷¬p)+pK∗p=(K÷¬p)+pK* p = (K\div \neg p)+p.


If ÷÷\div is a partial meet contraction, then the operation ∗∗*
that is defined in this way is a partial meet revision. This
is the standard construction of revision in the AGM model.

Partial meet revision has been axiomatically characterized. An
operation ∗∗* is a partial meet revision if and only if it
satisfies the following six postulates:


Closure:
K∗p=Cn(K∗p)K∗p=Cn(K∗p)K* p = \Cn(K* p)

Success:
p∈K∗pp∈K∗pp \in K* p

Inclusion:
K∗p⊆K+pK∗p⊆K+pK* p \subseteq K+p

Vacuity:
 If ¬p∉¬p∉\neg p \not\in K, then
K∗p=K+pK∗p=K+pK* p = K+p.

Consistency:
K∗pK∗pK* p is consistent if
ppp is consistent.

Extensionality:
 If (p↔q)∈Cn(∅)(p↔q)∈Cn(∅)(p \leftrightarrow q) \in \Cn(\varnothing), then K∗p=K∗qK∗p=K∗qK* p = K* q.


These six postulates are commonly called the basic Gärdenfors
postulates for revision. In addition, two supplementary
postulates are parts of the standard repertoire:


Superexpansion:
K∗(p&q)⊆(K∗p)+qK∗(p&q)⊆(K∗p)+qK* (p \amp q) \subseteq(K* p)+q

Subexpansion:
 If ¬q∉Cn(K∗p)¬q∉Cn(K∗p)\neg q \not\in \Cn(K* p), then (K∗p)+q⊆K∗(p&q)(K∗p)+q⊆K∗(p&q)(K* p)+q \subseteq K* (p \amp q).


These postulates are closely related to the supplementary postulates
for contraction. Let ∗∗* be the partial meet revision defined
from the partial meet contraction ÷÷\div via the Levi identity. Then
∗∗* satisfies superexpansion if and only if ÷÷\div satisfies
conjunctive overlap. Furthermore, ∗∗* satisfies subexpansion if
and only if ÷÷\div satisfies conjunctive inclusion.
4. Possible world modelling

Alternative models of belief states can be constructed out of sets of
possible worlds (Grove 1988). In logical parlance, by a possible
world is meant a maximal consistent subset of the language. By a
proposition is meant a set of possible worlds. There is a
one-to-one correspondence between propositions and belief sets. Each
belief set can be represented by the proposition (set of possible
worlds) that consists of those possible worlds that contain the belief
set in question.

For any set AAA of sentences, let [A][A][A] denote the set of possible
worlds that contain AAA as a subset, and similarly for any sentence
ppp let [p][p][p] be the set of possible worlds that contain ppp as
an element. If AAA is inconsistent, then [A]=∅[A]=∅[A] =
\varnothing. Otherwise, [A][A][A] is a non-empty set of possible
worlds. (It is assumed that ⋂∅⋂∅\bigcap \varnothing is equal to the
whole language.) If KKK is a belief set, then ⋂[K]=K⋂[K]=K\bigcap[K] =
K.

The propositional account provides an intuitively clear picture of
some aspects of belief change. It is convenient to use a geometrical
surface to represent the set of possible worlds. In Diagram
1, every point on the rectangle’s surface represents a
possible world. The circle marked [K][K][K] represents those
possible worlds in which all sentences in KKK are true, i.e.,
the set [K][K][K] of possible worlds. The area marked [p][p][p]
represents those possible worlds in which the sentence ppp is
true.


Diagram 1. Revision of KKK by ppp.


In Diagram 1, [K][K][K] and [p][p][p] have a non-empty
intersection, which means that KKK is compatible with
ppp. The revision of KKK by ppp is therefore not
belief-contravening. Its outcome is obtained by giving up those
elements of [K][K][K] that are incompatible with ppp. In
other words, the result of revising [K][K][K] by [p][p][p]
should be equal to [K]∩[p][K]∩[p][K]\cap[p].

If [K][K][K] and [p][p][p] do not intersect, then the outcome of
the revision must be sought outside of [K][K][K], but it should
nevertheless be a subset of [p][p][p]. In general:


The outcome of revising [K][K][K] by [p][p][p] is a subset of
[p][p][p] that is

non-empty if [p][p][p] is non-empty
equal to [K]∩[p][K]∩[p][K]\cap[p] if [K]∩[p][K]∩[p][K]\cap[p] is non-empty



This simple rule for revision can be shown to correspond exactly
to partial meet revision.

The revised belief state should not differ more from the original
belief state [K][K][K] than what is motivated by [p][p][p]. This
can be achieved by requiring that the outcome of revising [K][K][K]
by [p][p][p] consists of those elements of [p][p][p] that are as
close as possible to [K][K][K]. For that purpose, [K][K][K] can
be thought of as surrounded by a system of concentric spheres (just as
in David Lewis’s account of counterfactual conditionals). Each
sphere represents a degree of closeness or similarity to
[K][K][K].

In this model, the outcome of revising [K][K][K] by [p][p][p]
should be the intersection of [p][p][p] with the narrowest sphere
around [K][K][K] that has a non-empty intersection with
[p][p][p], as in Diagram 2. This construction was invented
by Adam Grove (1988), who also proved that such sphere-based revision
corresponds exactly to transitively relational partial meet
revision. It follows that it also corresponds exactly to
entrenchment-based revision.

Sphere-based revision of KKK by ppp.


Possible world models can also be used for contraction. In
contraction, a restriction on what worlds are “possible”
(compatible with the agent’s beliefs) is removed. Thus, the set
of possibilities is enlarged, so that the contraction of [K][K][K]
by [p][p][p] will result in a superset of [K][K][K].
Furthermore, the new possibilities should be worlds in which
ppp does not hold, i.e., they should be worlds in which
¬p¬p\neg p holds. In the limiting case when [K][K][K] and
[¬p][¬p][\neg p] have a non-empty intersection, no enlargement of
[K][K][K] is necessary to make ¬p¬p\neg p possible, and the
original belief state will therefore be unchanged. In summary,
contraction should be performed according to the following rule:


The outcome of contracting [K][K][K] by [p][p][p] is the union
of [K][K][K] and a subset of [¬p][¬p][\neg p] that is

non-empty if [¬p][¬p][\neg p] is non-empty
equal to [K]∩[¬p][K]∩[¬p][K]\cap[\neg p] if [K]∩[¬p][K]∩[¬p][K]\cap[\neg p] is non-empty



Belief-contravening contraction is illustrated in Diagram 3.
Contraction performed according to this rule can be shown to
correspond exactly to partial meet contraction. Furthermore,
the special case when the whole of [¬p][¬p][\neg p] is added to
[K][K][K] corresponds exactly to full meet contraction.
The other extreme case, when only one element of [¬p][¬p][\neg p] (a
“point” on the surface) is added to [K][K][K]
corresponds exactly to maxichoice contraction. Thus, in
maxichoice contraction by ppp only one possible way in which
ppp can be false (¬p(¬p(\neg p can be true) is added.


Diagram 3.
Contraction of KKK by ppp.


Grove’s sphere systems can also be used for contraction. In
sphere-based contraction by ppp, those elements of
[¬p][¬p][\neg p] are added that belong to the closest sphere around
[K][K][K] that has a non-empty intersection with [¬p][¬p][\neg p].
The procedure is shown in Diagram 4. Sphere-based contraction
corresponds exactly to transitively relational partial meet
contraction.

5. Belief bases
5.1 Increased expressive power

In the approaches discussed above, all beliefs in the belief set are
treated equally in the sense that they are all taken seriously as
beliefs in their own right. However, due to logical closure the belief
set contains many elements that are not really worth to be taken
seriously. Hence, suppose that the belief set contains the sentence
ppp, “Shakespeare wrote Hamlet”. Due to logical
closure it then also contains the sentence p∨qp∨qp \vee q,
“Either Shakespeare wrote Hamlet or Charles Dickens wrote
Hamlet”. The latter sentence is a “mere logical
consequence” that should have no standing of its own.

Belief bases have been introduced to capture this feature of the
structure of human beliefs. A belief base is a set of sentences that
is not (except as a limiting case) closed under logical consequence.
Its elements represent beliefs that are held independently of any
other belief or set of beliefs. Those elements of the belief set that
are not in the belief base are “merely derived”, i.e.,
they have no independent standing.

Changes are performed on the belief base. The underlying intuition is
that the merely derived beliefs are not worth retaining for their own
sake. If one of them loses the support that it had in basic beliefs,
then it will be automatically discarded.

For every belief base AAA, there is a belief set Cn(A)Cn(A)\Cn(A)
that represents the beliefs held according to AAA. On the other
hand, one and the same belief set can be represented by different
belief bases. In this sense, belief bases have more expressive power
than belief sets. As an example, the two belief bases {p,q}{p,q}\{p,
q\} and {p,p↔q}{p,p↔q}\{p, p \leftrightarrow q\} have the
same logical closure. They are therefore statically
equivalent, in the sense of representing the same beliefs. On the
other hand, the following example shows that they are not
dynamically equivalent in the sense of behaving in the same
way under operations of change. They can be taken to represent
different ways of holding the same beliefs.


Let ppp denote that the Liberal Party will support the proposal
to subsidize the steel industry, and let qqq denote that Ms.
Smith, who is a liberal MP, will vote in favour of that proposal.

Abe has the basic beliefs ppp and qqq, whereas Bob has
the basic beliefs ppp and p↔q.p↔q.p \leftrightarrow q. Thus,
their beliefs (on the belief set level) with respect to ppp and
qqq are the same.

Both Abe and Bob receive and accept the information that ppp is
wrong, and they both revise their belief states to include the new
belief that ¬p¬p\neg p. After that, Abe has the basic beliefs
¬p¬p\neg p and qqq, whereas Bob has the basic beliefs
¬p¬p\neg p and p↔qp↔qp \leftrightarrow q. Now, their belief
sets are no longer the same. Abe believes that qqq whereas Bob
believes that ¬q¬q\neg q.


(In belief set models, cases like these are taken care of by assuming
that although Abe’s and Bob’s belief states are
represented by the same belief set, this belief set is associated with
different selection mechanisms in the two cases. Abe has a selection
mechanism that gives priority to qqq over p↔qp↔qp \leftrightarrow q, whereas Bob’s selection mechanism has the opposite
priorities.)

There is only one inconsistent belief set (logically closed
inconsistent set), namely the whole language. On the other hand there
are, in any non-trivial logic, many different inconsistent belief
bases. Therefore, belief bases make it possible to distinguish between
different inconsistent belief states.

In belief revision theory it has mostly been taken for granted that
belief sets correspond to a coherentist epistemology, whereas belief
bases represent foundationalism. However, the logical relationships
among the elements of a logically closed set do not adequately
represent epistemic coherence. Although coherentists typically claim
that all beliefs contribute to the justification of other
beliefs, they hardly mean this to apply to merely derived beliefs such
as “either Paris or Rome is the capital of France”, that
one believes only because one believes Paris to be the capital of
France. Therefore, the distinction between operations on belief bases
and operations on belief sets should not be equated with that between
foundationalism and coherentism.
5.2 Belief base contraction

Partial meet contraction, as defined in Section 2.1, is equally
applicable to belief bases. Note that A⊥pA⊥pA\bot p is
the set of maximal subsets of AAA that do not imply ppp;
it is not sufficient that they do not contain ppp. Hence 
{p,p&q,p∨q,p↔q}⊥p={{p∨q},{p↔q}}.{p,p&q,p∨q,p↔q}⊥p={{p∨q},{p↔q}}.
\{p, p \amp q, p \vee q, p \leftrightarrow q\} \bot p = \{\{p \vee q\}, \{p \leftrightarrow q\}\}.


Most of the basic postulates for partial meet contraction on belief
sets hold for belief bases as well. However, Recovery does not hold
for partial meet contraction of belief bases. This can be seen from
the following example (that is adopted from Isaac Levi (2004) who used
it for other purposes:


Let the belief set KKK include both a belief that the coin was
tossed (c)(c)(c) and a belief that it landed heads (h)(h)(h).
The epistemic agent wishes to consider whether, on the supposition
that the coin had been tossed, it would have landed heads. In order to
do that, it would seem reasonable to remove ccc from the belief
set and then reinsert it, i.e. to perform the series of operations
K÷c+cK÷c+cK\div c+c.

(1) If partial meet contraction is performed directly on the belief
set, then it follows from Recovery that h∈K÷c+ch∈K÷c+ch \in K\div c+c,
i.e. hhh comes back with ccc. This is contrary to reasonable
intuitions.

(2) If partial meet contraction is instead performed on a belief base
for KKK, then recovery can be avoided. Let the belief base be
{p1,…,pn,c,h}{p1,…,pn,c,h}\{p_1 ,\ldots ,p_n, c, h\}, where the background beliefs p1,…,pnp1,…,pnp_1
,\ldots ,p_n are unrelated to ccc and hhh, whereas hhh
logically implies ccc. Then K=Cn({p1,…,pn,c,h})K=Cn({p1,…,pn,c,h})K = \Cn(\{p_1 ,\ldots ,p_n, c,
h\}). Since hhh implies ccc, it will have to go when ccc is
removed, so that K÷c=Cn({p1,…,pn})K÷c=Cn({p1,…,pn})K\div c = \Cn(\{p_1 ,\ldots ,p_n\}). When ccc
is reinserted, the outcome is (K÷c)+c=Cn({p1,…,pn,c})(K÷c)+c=Cn({p1,…,pn,c})(K\div c)+c = \Cn(\{p_1 ,\ldots ,p_n,
c\}) that does not contain hhh, as desired.


The following representation theorem has been obtained for partial
meet contraction on belief bases (Hansson 1999). An operation ÷÷\div
is a partial meet contraction for a set AAA if and only if it
satisfies the following four postulates:


Success:
 If p∉Cn(∅)p∉Cn(∅)p \not\in \Cn(\varnothing), then p∉Cn(A÷p)p∉Cn(A÷p)p \not\in \Cn(A\div p).

Inclusion:
A÷p⊆AA÷p⊆AA\div p \subseteq A

Relevance:
 If q∈Aq∈Aq \in A and q∉A÷pq∉A÷pq \not\in A\div p, then there is a set
A′A′A' such that A÷p⊆A′⊆AA÷p⊆A′⊆AA\div p \subseteq A' \subseteq A and that p∉Cn(A′)p∉Cn(A′)p \not\in \Cn(A') but 
p∈Cn(A′∪{q})p∈Cn(A′∪{q})p \in \Cn(A'\cup \{q\}).

Uniformity:
 If it holds for all subsets A′A′A' of AAA that p∈Cn(A′)p∈Cn(A′)p \in \Cn(A') if
and only if q∈Cn(A′)q∈Cn(A′)q \in \Cn(A'), then A÷p=A÷qA÷p=A÷qA\div p = A\div q.


The Relevance postulate has much the same function as Recovery has for
belief sets, namely to prevent unnecessary losses of beliefs.

An alternative approach to contraction of belief bases has been
proposed under the name kernel contraction. For any sentence
ppp, a ppp-kernel is a minimal ppp-implying set,
i.e. a set that implies ppp but has no proper subset that
implies ppp. A contraction operation ÷÷\div can be based on
the simple principle that no ppp-kernel should be included in
A÷pA÷pA\div p. This can be obtained with an incision
function, a function that selects at least one element from each
ppp-kernel for removal. An operation that removes exactly those
elements that are selected for removal by an incision function is
called a kernel contraction. It turns out that all partial meet
contractions on belief bases are kernel contractions, but some kernel
contractions are not partial meet contractions. In other words, kernel
contraction is a generalization of partial meet contraction.
5.3 Belief base revision

The operation of expansion for belief sets, K+p=Cn(K∪{p})K+p=Cn(K∪{p})K+p = \Cn(K\cup
\{p\}), was constructed to ensure that the outcome is logically
closed. This is not desirable for belief bases, and therefore
expansion on belief bases must be different from expansion on belief
sets. For any belief base AAA and sentence p,p,p, A+′pA+′pA +' p, the
(non-closing) expansion of AAA by ppp, is the
set A∪{p}A∪{p}A\cup \{p\}.

Just like the corresponding operations for belief sets, revision
operations for belief bases can be constructed out of two
suboperations: expansion by ppp and contraction by
¬p¬p\neg p. According to the Levi identity,
(A∗p=(A÷¬p)+′p)(A∗p=(A÷¬p)+′p)(A* p = (A\div \neg p)
+' p), the contractive suboperation should take place
first. Alternatively, the two suboperations may take place in reverse
order, A∗p=(A+′p)÷¬pA∗p=(A+′p)÷¬pA* p = (A+'p)
\div \neg p. This latter possibility does not exist for
belief sets. If K∪{p}K∪{p}K\cup \{p\} is inconsistent, then
K+pK+pK+p is always the same, namely identical to the
whole language, independently of the identity of KKK and of
ppp, so that all distinctions are lost. For belief bases, this
limitation is not present, and thus there are two distinct ways to
obtain revision from contraction and expansion:

Internal revision:
A∗p=(A÷¬p)+′pA∗p=(A÷¬p)+′pA * p = (A \div \neg p) +' p

External revision:
A∗p=(A+′p)÷¬pA∗p=(A+′p)÷¬pA * p = (A +' p) \div \neg p

Intuitively, external revision by ppp is revision with an
intermediate inconsistent state in which both ppp and
¬p¬p\neg p are believed, whereas internal revision has an
intermediate non-committed state in which neither ppp
nor ¬p¬p\neg p is believed. External and internal revision differ
in their logical properties, and neither of them can be subsumed under
the other.
5.4 Connections between belief bases and belief sets

A contraction on a belief base gives rise to a contraction on its
corresponding belief set. Let AAA be a belief base and
K=Cn(A)K=Cn(A)K = \Cn(A) its corresponding belief set. Furthermore,
let −−- be a contraction on AAA. It gives rise to an
operation ÷÷\div of base-generated contraction on
KKK, such that for all sentences p:K÷p=Cn(A−p)p:K÷p=Cn(A−p)p:
K\div p = \Cn(A-p).
Base-generated contraction has been axiomatically characterized. An
operation ÷÷\div on a consistent belief set KKK is generated
by an operation of partial meet contraction for some finite base for
KKK if and only if it satisfies the following eight
postulates:

Closure:
K÷p=Cn(K÷p)K÷p=Cn(K÷p)K\div p = \Cn(K\div p)

Success:
 If p∉Cn(∅)p∉Cn(∅)p \not\in \Cn(\varnothing), then p∉Cn(K÷p)p∉Cn(K÷p)p \not\in \Cn(K\div p).

Inclusion:
K÷p⊆KK÷p⊆KK\div p \subseteq K

Vacuity:
 If p∉Cn(K)p∉Cn(K)p \not\in \Cn(K), then K÷p=KK÷p=KK\div p = K.

Extensionality:
 If p↔q∈Cn(∅)p↔q∈Cn(∅)p\leftrightarrow q \in \Cn(\varnothing), then K÷p=K÷qK÷p=K÷qK\div p = K\div q.

Finitude:
 There is a finite set XXX such that for every sentence ppp, K÷p=Cn(X′)K÷p=Cn(X′)K\div p
= \Cn(X') for some X′⊆XX′⊆XX' \subseteq X.

Symmetry:
If it holds for all rrr that K÷r⊢pK÷r⊢pK\div r \vdash p if and only if
K÷r⊢qK÷r⊢qK\div r \vdash q, then K÷p=K÷qK÷p=K÷qK\div p = K\div q.

Conservativity:
If K÷qK÷qK\div q is not a subset of K÷pK÷pK\div p, then there is some
rrr such that K÷p⊆K÷r⊬pK÷p⊆K÷r⊬pK\div p \subseteq K\div r \not\vdash p and K÷r∪K÷q⊢pK÷r∪K÷q⊢pK\div
r \cup K\div q \vdash p.

Operations of revision on a belief set can be base-generated in the
same sense as operations of contraction.
6. Other operations

The AGM framework has been extended in many ways. Some of these
extensions have introduced new types of operations in addition to the
three standard types in AGM, namely contraction, expansion, and
revision.
6.1 Update

There are two types of reasons why the epistemic agent may wish to add
new information to the belief set. One is that she has received new
information about the world, the other that the world has changed. It
is common to reserve the term “revision” for the first of
these types, and use the term “updating” for the second.
The logic of updating differs from that of revision. This can be seen
from the following example:


To begin with, the agent knows that there is either a book on the
table (p)(p)(p) or a magazine on the table (q)(q)(q), but not
both.

Case 1: The agent is told that there is a book on the table. She
concludes that there is no magazine on the table. This is
revision.

Case 2: The agent is told that after the first information was given,
a book has been put on the table. In this case she should not conclude
that there is no magazine on the table. This is updating.


One useful approach to updating is to assign time indices to the
sentences, as proposed by Katsuno and Mendelzon (1992). Then the
belief set will not consist of sentences ppp but of pairs ⟨p,t1⟩⟨p,t1⟩\langle
p,t_1\rangle of a sentence ppp and a point in time t1t1t_1,
signifying that ppp holds at t1t1t_1. In the book-and-magazine
example, let t1t1t_1 denote the point in time that the first statement
refers to, and t2t2t_2 the moment when the second information was
given in Case 2. The original belief set contained the pair ⟨¬(p↔q),t1⟩⟨¬(p↔q),t1⟩\langle
\neg(p\leftrightarrow q),t_1\rangle. (¬(p↔q)¬(p↔q)\neg(p\leftrightarrow q)
is the exclusive disjunction of ppp and qqq.) Revision by ppp
can be represented by the incorporation of ⟨p,t1⟩⟨p,t1⟩\langle p,t_1\rangle, and
updating by ppp by the incorporation of ⟨p,t2⟩⟨p,t2⟩\langle p,t_2\rangle into the
belief set. It follows quite naturally that ⟨¬q,t1⟩⟨¬q,t1⟩\langle \neg q,t_1\rangle is
implied by the revised belief set but not by the updated belief
set.
6.2 Consolidation

If a belief base is inconsistent, then it can be made consistent by
removing enough of its more dispensable elements. This operation is
called consolidation. The consolidation of a belief base AAA is
denoted A!A!A!. A plausible way to perform consolidation is to
contract by falsum (contradiction), i.e. A!=A÷⊥A!=A÷⊥A! = A\div\smbot.

Unfortunately, this recipe for consolidation of inconsistent belief
bases does not have a plausible counterpart for inconsistent belief
sets. The reason is that since belief revision operates within
classical logic, there is only one inconsistent belief set. Once an
inconsistent belief set has been obtained, all distinctions have been
lost, and consolidation cannot restore them.
6.3 Semi-revision

By non-prioritized belief change is meant a process in which new
information is received, and weighed against old information, with no
special priority assigned to the new information due to its novelty. A
(modified) revision operation that operates in this way is called a
semi-revision. Semi-revision of KKK by a sentence ppp
can be denoted K?pK?pK?p. A sentence ppp that
contradicts previous beliefs is accepted only if it has more epistemic
value than the original beliefs that contradict it. In that case,
enough of the previous sentences are deleted to make the resulting set
consistent. Otherwise, the input is itself rejected.

One way to construct semi-revision on a belief base AAA is to
let it consist of two suboperations:

 Expand AAA by ppp.
 Restore consistency by giving up either ppp or some
original belief(s).


This amounts to defining semi-revision in terms of expansion and
consolidation:
A?p=(A+′p)!A?p=(A+′p)!
A?p = (A +' p)!


This identity cannot be used for belief sets. Since all inconsistent
belief sets are identical, an operation ? such that
K?p=(K+p)!K?p=(K+p)!K?p = (K+p)! will have the
extremely implausible property that if ¬p1∈K1¬p1∈K1\neg p_1 \in K_1 and ¬p2∈K2¬p2∈K2\neg p_2 \in K_2, then
K1?p1=K2?p2K1?p1=K2?p2K_1 ?p_1 = K_2 ?p_2. However, other ways to
perform semirevision on belief sets have been proposed, in particular,
the following two-step process:

Decide whether the input ppp should be accepted or rejected.
If ppp was accepted, revise by ppp.


A simple way to apply this recipe is David Makinson’s (1997)
screened revision, in which there is a set XXX of
potential core beliefs that are immune to revision. The belief set
KKK should be revised by the input sentence ppp if
ppp is consistent with the set X∩KX∩KX\cap K of
actual core beliefs, otherwise not. The second step of screened
revision is a revision of KKK by ppp, but with the
restriction that no element of X∩KX∩KX\cap K is allowed to
be removed.

Another variant of the same recipe is called credibility-limited
revision. It is based on the assumption that some inputs are
accepted, others not. Those that are accepted form the set C of
credible sentences. If p∈p∈p \in C, then K?p=K∗pK?p=K∗pK?p = K* p. Otherwise, K?p=KK?p=KK?p = K. This construction can be further specified by choosing an
operation of revision and assigning properties to the set C. A variety
of such constructions have been investigated (Hansson et al.
2001).
6.4 Selective revision

Selective revision is a generalization of semi-revision. In
semi-revision, the input information is either rejected or fully
accepted. In selective revision, it is possible for only a part of the
input information to be accepted. An operation ∘∘\circ of selective
revision can be constructed from a standard revision operation
∗∗* and a transformation function fff from and to
sentences:
K∘p=K∗f(p)K∘p=K∗f(p)
K \circ p = K * f(p)


In the intended cases, f(p)f(p)f(p) does not contain any
information that is not contained in ppp. This is ensured if
f(p)f(p)f(p) is a logical consequence of ppp. By
adding further conditions on fff, various additional properties
can be obtained for the operation of selective revision.
6.5 Shielded contraction

The Success postulate of contraction requires that all
non-tautological beliefs are retractable. This is not a fully
realistic requirement, since actual agents are known to have beliefs
of a non-logical nature that nothing can bring them to give up. In
shielded contraction, some non-tautological beliefs cannot be given
up; they are shielded from contraction. Shielded contraction can be
based on an ordinary contraction ÷÷\div and a set RRR of
retractable sentences. If p∈Rp∈Rp \in R, then
K−p=K÷pK−p=K÷pK-p = K\div p. Otherwise,
K−p=KK−p=KK-p = K.

This construction can be further specified by adding various
requirements on the structure of RRR. Close connections have
been shown to hold between shielded contraction and semi-revision.
(Fermé and Hansson 2001)
6.6 Replacement

By replacement is meant an operation that replaces one sentence by
another in a belief set. It is an operation with two variables, such
that [p/q][p/q][p/q] replaces ppp by qqq. Hence,
K[p/q]K[p/q]K[p/q] is a belief set that contains
qqq but not ppp.

Replacement aims both at the removal of a sentence ppp and the
addition of a sentence qqq. This amounts to two success
conditions, p∉K[p/q]p∉K[p/q]p \not\in K[p/q] and
q∈K[p/q]q∈K[p/q]q \in K[p/q]. However, these
two conditions cannot both be satisfied without exception. First, just
as for belief contraction, an exception must be made from the first of
them in the case when ppp is a tautology and so cannot be
removed. Secondly, the two conditions are not compatible in cases when
qqq logically implies ppp. This can be dealt with by
extending the exception that is provided for in the Success postulate
for contraction from cases when p∈Cn(∅)p∈Cn(∅)p \in \Cn(\varnothing) to cases
when p∈Cn({q})p∈Cn({q})p \in \Cn(\{q\}). This gives rise to the
following two success conditions:


Contractive success:
If p∉Cn({q})p∉Cn({q})p \not\in \Cn(\{q\}), then p∉Cn(K[p/q]p∉Cn(K[p/q]p \not\in \Cn(K[p/q]).

Revision success:
q∈K[p/q]q∈K[p/q]q \in K[p/q]


Replacement can be used as a kind of “Sheffer stroke” for
belief revision, i.e. as an operation in terms of which the other
operations can be defined. Contraction by ppp can be defined as
K[p/⊤]K[p/⊤]K[p/\smtop] and revision by ppp as K[⊥/p]K[⊥/p]K[\smbot/p], where ⊥⊥\smbot
is falsum and ⊤⊤\smtop is tautology. Provided that the unperformable
suboperation of removing the tautology ⊤⊤\smtop is treated as an empty
suboperation, expansion by ppp can be defined as
K[⊤/p]K[⊤/p]K[\smtop/p].
6.7 Merge

If the belief set KKK has a finite base, then it can be represented
by a single sentence, namely the conjunction kkk of all the elements
of its base. This means that the revision K∗pK∗pK* p of a belief set by
a sentence can be replaced by a revision k∗pk∗pk* p of a sentence by
another sentence. If this revision is non-prioritized, we may treat
kkk and ppp equally, so that k∗p=p∗kk∗p=p∗kk* p = p* k. Such an operation
can be described as the merging of two belief representations. It can
represent a process of conflict resolution through selective
combination of information from two agents or sources. This operation
can also be generalized to the merge of several elements, representing
efforts to combine information from several agents or sources
(Konieczny and Pino Pérez 2011).
6.8 Multiple contraction and revision

By multiple contraction is meant the simultaneous contraction of more
than one sentence. Similarly, multiple revision is revision by more
than one sentence.

There are two major types of multiple contraction. In package
contraction, all elements of the input set are retracted: they
have to go in a package. In choice contraction it suffices to
remove at least one of them. Hence, the success conditions for the two
types of multiple contraction are as follows:

Package success:
If B∩Cn(∅)=∅B∩Cn(∅)=∅B\cap \Cn(\varnothing) = \varnothing then B∩Cn(A÷B)=∅B∩Cn(A÷B)=∅B\cap \Cn(A\div B)
= \varnothing

Choice success:
If BBB is not a subset of Cn(∅)Cn(∅)\Cn(\varnothing), then BBB is not
either a subset of Cn(A÷B)Cn(A÷B)\Cn(A\div B).

Partial meet contraction and kernel contraction can both be
generalized fairly straight-forwardly to both package and choice
variants of multiple contraction.

The construction of package revision gives rise to an interesting
extension of the notion of negation. The reason why contraction by
¬p¬p\neg p is performed as a suboperation of revision by
ppp is that ppp can be consistently added to a set if
and only if it does not imply ¬p¬p\neg p. It turns out that (in a
logic satisfying compactness) a set BBB can be consistently
added to another set if and only if this other set does not contain
any element of the set ¬B¬B\neg B, that is defined as
follows:

Negation of a set:
p∈¬Bp∈¬Bp \in \neg B if and only if ppp is either a negation of an
element of B∪{⊤}B∪{⊤}B\cup \{\smtop\} or a disjunction of negations of
elements of B∪{⊤}B∪{⊤}B\cup \{\smtop\}.


Therefore multiple revision can be defined from (package) multiple
contraction and expansion via a generalized Levi identity:
K∗B=(K÷¬B)+BK∗B=(K÷¬B)+B
 K* B = (K\div \neg B)+B


Most of the major AGM-related contraction operations have been
generalized to multiple contraction: multiple partial meet contraction
(Hansson 1989, Fuhrmann and Hansson 1994, Li 1998), multiple kernel
contraction (Fermé et al. 2003), multiple specified
meet contraction (Hansson 2010), and a multiple version of
Grove’s sphere system (Reis and Fermé 2011, Fermé
and Reis 2011).
6.9 Indeterministic belief change

Most models of belief change are deterministic in the sense
that given a belief set and an input, the resulting belief set is
well-determined. There is no scope for chance in selecting the new
belief set. Clearly, this is not a realistic feature, but it makes the
models much simpler and easier to handle, not least from a
computational point of view. In indeterministic belief
change, the subjection of a specified belief set to a specified input
has more than one admissible outcome.

Indeterministic operations can be constructed as sets of deterministic
operations. Hence, given three revision operations ∗,∗′∗,∗′* ,
* ' and ∗′′∗″* '' the set {∗{∗\{*, ∗′∗′* ',
∗′′∗″* ''}}\}
can be used as an indeterministic
operation. The success condition is simply:
K{∗,∗′,∗′′}p∈{K∗p,K∗′p,K∗′′p}K{∗,∗′,∗″}p∈{K∗p,K∗′p,K∗″p}
K\{* , * ', * ''\}p \in \{K* p, K* 'p, K* ''p\}


Lindström and Rabinowicz (1991) constructed indeterministic
contraction by giving up the assumption that epistemic entrenchment
satisfies connectedness. This resulted in Grove’s sphere systems
with “fallbacks” that are not linearly ordered but still
all include the original belief set.
6.10 Operations for an extended language

Belief revision theory has been almost exclusively developed within
the framework of classical sentential (truth-functional) logic. The
inclusion of non-truthfunctional expressions into the language has
interesting and indeed drastic effects. In particular, this applies to
conditional sentences.

Many types of conditional sentences, such as counterfactual
conditionals, cannot be adequately expressed with truth-functional
implication (material implication). Several formal interpretations of
conditional sentences have been proposed. One of them, namely the
Ramsey test, is particularly well suited to the formal
framework of belief revision. It is based on a suggestion by F. P.
Ramsey that has been further developed by Robert Stalnaker and others
(Stalnaker 1968). The basic idea is that “if ppp then
qqq” is taken to be believed if and only if qqq
would be believed after revising the present belief state by
ppp. Let p⇒qp⇒qp\Rightarrow q denote “if ppp
then qqq”, or more precisely: “if ppp were
the case, then qqq would be the case”. In order to treat
conditional statements on par with statements about actual facts, they
will have to be included in the belief set, thus:

The Ramsey test:
(p⇒q)∈K(p⇒q)∈K(p\Rightarrow q) \in K if and only if q∈K∗pq∈K∗pq \in K* p.


However, inclusion in the belief set of conditionals that satisfy the
Ramsey test will require radical changes in the logic of belief
change. As one example of this, contraction cannot then satisfy the
inclusion postulate (K÷p⊆K)(K÷p⊆K)(K\div p \subseteq K).
The reason for this is that contraction typically provides support for
conditional sentences that were not supported by the original belief
state. This can be seen from the following example:

If I give up my belief that John is mentally retarded, then I gain
support for the conditional sentence “If John has lived 30 years
in London, then John understands the English language.”


A famous impossibility theorem by Peter Gärdenfors (1986, 1987)
shows that the Ramsey test is incompatible with a set of plausible
postulates for revision. Several solutions to the impossibility
theorem have been put forward. One option is to reject the Ramsey test
as a criterion for the validity of conditional sentences (Rott 1986).
Another, proposed by Isaac Levi, is to accept the test as a criterion
of validity but deny that such conditional sentences should be
included in the belief set when they are valid (Levi 1988.
Arló-Costa 1995. Arló-Costa and Levi 1996). Several
other proposals have been put forward. However, it is fair to say that
operations of AGM-style belief change have not yet been constructed
that are generally recognized as able to deal adequately with
conditional or modal sentences.
6.11 Changes in the strength of beliefs

An operation of change can raise or lower the position of a sentence
in the ordering without affecting the belief set (but affecting how
the belief state responds to new inputs). An operation of
improvement, as proposed by Konieczny and Pérez (2008)
increases the plausibility of a non-believed sentence ppp by
moving some of the ppp-worlds to a higher position in the
preference ordering of worlds. Even if such a change does not lead to
ppp becoming a belief, its acceptance in later, additional
operations can be facilitated. 

An operation of change can be so constructed that it adjusts the
position of the input sentence in an ordering to be the same as that
of a reference sentence. This means that two sentences have to be
specified in the input: the (input) sentence to be moved and the
(reference) sentence indicating its new position. Hans Rott (2007,
Other Internet Resources) called such operators two-dimensional. John
Cantwell (1997) classified them as raising or
lowering, depending on the direction of change. (See also
Fermé and Rott 2004 and Rott 2009.)
6.12 Changes in norms and preferences

There are close parallels between changes in norms and changes in
beliefs. In order to apply a norm system with conflicting norms to a
particular situation, some of the norms may have to be ignored. The
problem how to prioritize among conflicting norms is similar to the
selection of sentences for removal in belief contraction (Hansson and
Makinson 1997). The AGM model was in fact partly the outcome of
attempts to formalize changes in norms rather than beliefs
(Alchourrón and Makinson 1981). In spite of this, authors who
apply the AGM model to norms have found it in need of rather extensive
modifications to make it suitable for that purpose. Hence, in their
model of changes in legislation, Governatori and Rotolo (2010)
introduced an explicit representation of time in order to account for
phenomena such as retroactivity.

A model of changes in preferences can be obtained by replacing the
standard AGM language by sentences of the form p≥qp≥qp \ge q (“ppp is at least as good as
qqq”) and their truth-functional combinations. The
adoption of a new preference can then take the form of revision by
such a preference sentence. Partial meet contraction can be used, but
some modifications of the AGM model seem to be necessary in
applications to preferences (Hansson 1995, Lang and van der Torre
2008, Grüne-Yanoff and Hansson 2009).
7. Iterated change

The preceding sections have only dealt with changes of one and the
same belief set or belief base. This is clearly a severe limitation. A
realistic model of belief change should allow for repeated (iterated)
changes, such as
K÷p÷q∗r∗s÷t…K÷p÷q∗r∗s÷t…K\div p\div q* r* s\div t\ldots In other words, operations are needed that can
contract or revise any belief set (belief base) by any sentence. Such
operations are called global, in contrast to local
operations that are defined only for a single specified set.

An obvious way to obtain a global operation of partial meet
contraction would be to use the same selection function for all
sets to be contracted. However, with the standard way to obtain a
partial meet contraction from a selection function, this is not
possible, due to the way selection functions treat the empty set. The
way selection functions have been defined, if A⊥p=∅A⊥p=∅A\bot p =
\varnothing, then γ(A⊥p)={A}γ(A⊥p)={A}\gamma(A\bot p ) = \{A\}. As a consequence of
this, if γγ\gamma is a selection function for AAA, and A≠BA≠BA \ne
B, then γγ\gamma is not a selection function for BBB. For let
A⊥p=B⊥p=∅A⊥p=B⊥p=∅A\bot p = B\bot p = \varnothing. For γγ\gamma to be a function
it must be the case that γ(A⊥p)=γ(B⊥p)γ(A⊥p)=γ(B⊥p)\gamma(A\bot p) = \gamma(B\bot p).  For
γγ\gamma to be a selection function for AAA it must be case that
γ(A⊥p)={A}γ(A⊥p)={A}\gamma(A\bot p) = \{A\}, and in order for it to be a selection
function for BBB it must be the case that γ(B⊥p)={B}γ(B⊥p)={B}\gamma(B\bot p) =
\{B\}. Since A≠BA≠BA \ne B, this is impossible.

This can be solved if we rewrite the definition of partial meet
contraction as follows:


Alternative definition of partial meet contraction:

(1′)(1′)(1') γ(K⊥p)⊆K⊥pγ(K⊥p)⊆K⊥p\gamma(K\bot p) \subseteq K\bot p, and if K⊥p≠∅K⊥p≠∅K\bot p \ne \varnothing, then γ(K⊥p)≠∅γ(K⊥p)≠∅\gamma(K\bot p) \ne \varnothing.

(2′)(2′)(2') K÷p=⋂γ(K⊥p)K÷p=⋂γ(K⊥p)K\div p = \bigcap \gamma(K\bot p), unless
γ(K⊥p)=∅γ(K⊥p)=∅\gamma(K\bot p) = \varnothing, in which case
K÷p=KK÷p=KK\div p = K.


As applied to a single belief set KKK, this definition is
equivalent with the original definition. Notably, it yields the same
result as the original definition even in the limiting case when
ppp is a tautology, but it avoids using the selection function
in this limiting case. With this, slightly adjusted, definition, one
and the same selection function can be used for all belief sets, and
consequently we can construct iterated change using only one,
AGM-style, selection function. Since partial meet revision is
definable from partial meet contraction via the Levi identity, this
means that we have global operations for both contraction and
revision. This construction is so general that it does not impose any
new properties on contraction or revision, i.e. no properties in
addition to the usual AGM postulates (Hansson 2012). 

However, most of the discussion on iterated change has been based on
the assumption that such additional properties are plausible and
indeed desirable. The so-called Darwiche-Pearl postulates for revision
have had a central role in these discussions (Darwiche and Pearl
1997):


If q⊢pq⊢pq \vdash p, then (K∗p)∗q=K∗q(K∗p)∗q=K∗q(K * p) * q = K * q.
(DP1)

If q⊢¬pq⊢¬pq \vdash \neg p, then (K∗p)∗q=K∗q(K∗p)∗q=K∗q(K * p) * q = K * q.
(DP2)

If K∗q⊢pK∗q⊢pK * q \vdash p, then (K∗p)∗q⊢p(K∗p)∗q⊢p(K * p) * q \vdash p. (DP3)

If K∗qK∗qK * q ⊬ ¬p¬p\neg p, then
(K∗p)∗q(K∗p)∗q(K * p) * q ⊬ ¬p¬p\neg p (DP4) 


The Darwiche-Pearl postulates express an intuition about the epistemic
ordering of possible worlds, namely that when we revise by a sentence
ppp, then the ordering among ppp-worlds should be
unchanged, and so should the ordering among ¬p¬p\neg p-worlds.
The change takes the form of a shift of the relative positions of
these two parts of the original ordering of worlds. A large number of
proposals for such shifts have been put forward, but opinions differ
widely on the adequacy of these proposals.

Abhaya Nayak (1994) has proposed a model of iterated belief change in
which both the belief states and the inputs are binary relations that
satisfy the standard entrenchment postulates except Minimality. Inputs
of this type may be seen as “fragments” of belief states,
to be incorporated into the previous belief state. In the same vein,
Eduardo Fermé and Hans Rott (2004) have investigated belief
revision with inputs of the more general form: “accept
qqq with a degree of plausibility that at least equals that of
ppp”. They call this revision by comparison.
Belief states are represented by entrenchment orderings. Hence, from
an entrenchment ordering ≤≤\le and such a generalized input a new
entrenchment ordering ≤′≤′\le ' is obtained that contains the
information needed to construct the new belief set. 
8. Alternative accounts

In spite of the dominant position of the AGM model and its close
variants, several other formal models of belief changes have been
proposed.
8.1 Learning theory

In belief revision theory, the focus is on consistency rather than
truthfulness. In contrast, learning theory is devoted to induction and
the attainment of true beliefs. A research question is represented as
a partition of the set of possible worlds, i.e. a distribution of all
possible worlds into non-overlapping sets. The research question has
been fully answered when it is known which of these partitions
contains the actual world. Information received by the agent
successively narrows down the set of partitions that may contain it.
The central issue is how to construct an inductive strategy, i.e. a
strategy for which investigations to perform and in what order, and
how to interpret them (Kelly 1999). Although this problem has
connections with belief revision, it has been shown that operations
satisfying the standard AGM postulates do not provide a credible
account of the inductive processes studied in learning theory. (Genin
and Kelly forthcoming)
8.2 Dynamic logics of belief change

Dynamic doxastic logic (DDL) was introduced by Krister Segerberg to
represent an agent who has opinions about the external world and
changes these opinions upon receipt of new information. DDL makes use
of epistemic modal operators of the type introduced by Hintikka
(1962). The sentence BipBipB_i p denotes
that the individual iii believes that ppp. When only one
agent is under consideration, the subscript can be deleted, and the
operator BBB can be read “it is believed that” or
“the agent believes that” (Segerberg 1995, p. 536). 

The formula BpBpBp in DDL differs from the expression p∈Kp∈Kp \in K of AGM in being a sentence in the same language as
ppp. This makes it possible to express in the object language
that a sentence is believed. In this way, Segerberg attempted to
develop belief revision “as a generalization of ordinary
Hintikka type doxastic logic”, whereas in contrast “AGM is
not really logic; it is a theory about theories” (Segerberg
1999, p. 136). In the DDL framework it is possible to express beliefs
about beliefs. The sentence “iii believes that iii
does not believe that ppp” can be expressed as
Bi¬BipBi¬BipB_i \neg B_i p, whereas there is
no way to express it in the AGM framework. ((p∉Ki)∈Ki((p∉Ki)∈Ki((p \not\in K_i) \in K_i is not a
well-formed formula.)

In DDL, belief revision operations (expansion, revision, and
contraction) are expressed with dynamic modal operators, similar to
those used for program execution. (This element of DDL was present
also in previous publications by several authors. See Fuhrmann 1991;
de Rijke 1994; van Benthem 1989 and 1995.) Segerberg used the
following notation:


[÷p]q[÷p]q[\div p]q
(qqq holds after contraction by p)p)p)


[∗p]q[∗p]q[* p]q
(qqq holds after revision by p)p)p)


[+p]q[+p]q[+ p]q
(qqq holds after expansion by p)p)p)



The combination of these two elements, belief operators and dynamic
operators, results in a framework that differs from AGM in important
ways. (Leitgeb and Segerberg 2007, 169)

Largely similar systems have been developed under the name of Dynamic
Epistemic Logic, DEL (Plaza 1989; Baltag et al. 1998; van Ditmarsch et
al. 2007; see the entry on
 dynamic-epistemic logic).
 A major difference between DDL and DEL is that the latter has mostly
been studied in multiagent contexts. The most studied dynamics is that
of the public announcement of some sentence (van Ditmarsch et al.
2007). 
8.3 Descriptor revision

Descriptor revision (Hansson 2014, forthcoming) is based on two major
formal constructions. One of them is a metalinguistic belief predicate
BB\mathfrak{B} that is applied to sentences of the object language.
BpBp\mathfrak{B}p denotes that the sentence ppp is believed,
¬Bp¬Bp\neg \mathfrak{B}p that it is not believed, and
Bp∨BqBp∨Bq\mathfrak{B}p\vee \mathfrak{B}q that either ppp or
qqq is believed. Such sentences can be used to express the
success conditions of belief change operations. Thus
BpBp\mathfrak{B}p is the success condition of revision by
ppp, ¬Bp¬Bp\neg \mathfrak{B}p that of contraction by ppp
and {¬Bp,¬Bq}{¬Bp,¬Bq}\{\neg \mathfrak{B}p,\neg \mathfrak{B}q\} that of
multiple contraction by {p,q}{p,q}\{p,q\}. Due to the
versatility of descriptors we only need one operation, denoted
∘∘\circ. Hence, K∘BpK∘BpK\circ \mathfrak{B}p represents
revision by ppp and K∘¬BpK∘¬BpK \circ \neg \mathfrak{B}p
contraction by ppp. 

The other major formal construction is a choice function (selection
function) that operates directly on the set of potential outcomes of
an operation. Hence, the operation
K∘BpK∘BpK \circ \mathfrak{B}p is performed by choosing one
among the potential belief sets that contain ppp (presumably
that which is most choiceworthy, or closest at hand). Operations based
on these principles have been axiomatically characterized. Notably,
the recovery postulate that creates problems in the AGM framework does
not hold in the descriptor revision framework. The application of a
choice function to potential belief outcomes is arguably more
plausible than its application to possible worlds or remainders, since
the latter two entities are logically infinite (if the language is
so), and therefore cognitively inaccessible.
8.4 Bayesian models

The AGM model and other logical frameworks for belief revision are
based on a dichotomous approach to belief: either something is
believed or it is not, in either case without any gradations. Beliefs
can be be more or less easily given up, and non-beliefs can be more or
less easily turned into beliefs, but the very act of believing does
not admit of degrees. In contrast, probabilistic models of belief,
usually based on some form of subjective Bayesianism, admit all
degrees between the strongest belief and the strongest disbelief.
Dichotomous and probabilistic models represent different features of
belief systems. It has proved to be difficult to construct a
reasonably manageable model that covers both the logic-related and the
probabilistic properties of belief change. These difficulties are
closely connected with the lottery and preface paradoxes (Kyburg 1961;
Makinson 1965).

However, belief revision theory has turned out to be useful in dealing
with the problematic limiting case of conditional probabilities with a
condition that has probability zero. Insights from belief revision
theory have been used in the construction of non-standard models of
probabilities in which conditionalization can be performed also in
this limiting case (Makinson 2011).
