The subject of combinations of logics is still a young topic in
contemporary logic. Besides the pure philosophical interest offered by
the possibility of defining mixed logic systems in which distinct
operators obey logics of different nature, as for instance erotetic
logics (the logical analysis of questions) which require combining
epistemic and deontic logics, there also exist many pragmatical and
methodological reasons for considering combined logics. In fact, the
use of formal logic as a tool for knowledge representation in Computer
Science frequently requires the integration of several logic systems
into a homogeneous environment.

Important questions in the philosophy of logic such as: “why are
there so many logics instead of just one?” (or even, instead of
none), as for instance, raised in Epstein 1995, can be naturally
counterposed by several other questions: if there are indeed many
logics, are they excluding alternatives, or are they compatible? Is it
possible to combine different logics into coherent systems with the
purpose of using them in applications and to shed some light on the
properties of complex logics? Moreover, if we can compose
logics, why not decompose them? And, if a logic is
decomposed into elementary sublogics, is it possible to recover it by
combining such fragments? What kind of properties of logics can be
transferred to their combinations? Questions of this kind have been
only partially tackled in the literature, and reflect challenges to be
confronted in the evolution of this topic.
 
1. Philosophical and methodological motivations for combining logics

David Hume generated a popular controversy with his famous passages of
“A Treatise of Human Nature” (see Hume 2000: Book 3, Part
1, Section 1, paragraph 27) where he noted that sometimes people draw
conclusions involving prescriptive statements of the form ‘ought
to be’ on the basis of descriptive statements of the form
‘what is’. Hume thinks that logic used in this way
involves a dangerous change of subject matter. So, whether or not
‘ought’ can be derived from ‘is’ has become
one of the central questions of ethical theory, and the majority of
interpreters hold that, for Hume, such a derivation is impossible.

With our point of view concerning combinations of logics, it is
necessary to investigate the properties of combining deontic and
alethic logics: in order to perform such a jump from ‘is’
to ‘ought’ some authors propose (see e.g., Schurz 1997)
that what is necessary is an explicit “bridge principle”
which specifically connects ‘is’ and ‘ought’.
An axiom schema XXX, following Schurz (1991), is a bridge principle
iff XXX contains at least one schematic letter which has at least
one occurrence within the scope of an ◯◯\obcirc (the deontic
“obligation” operator) and at least one occurrence outside
the scope of any ◯◯\obcirc. Thus, for instance, 

p→◯pp→◯pp \rightarrow \obcirc p

 is a
bridge principle representing ‘is-ought’ that which would
appease Hume’s criticism. On the other hand, the much discussed
moral principle ‘ought-implies-can’ (controversially
attributed to I. Kant, see Baumgardt 1946) can be formalized through
another bridge principle: 

◯p→◊p,◯p→◊p,\obcirc p \rightarrow \lozenge p,

 where ◊◊\lozenge denotes the
alethic “possibility” operator.


Clearly, bridge principles do not solve any philosophical questions
such as the ‘is-ought problem’; nonetheless, they
contribute to clarify the problem and to uncover hidden assumptions.
The idea of combining logics lend clarification to questions of this
kind by making clear that, for instance, ‘is’ and
‘ought’ are indeed independent notions. This is elucidated
through a formal analysis of the composition of the logics involved
(in this case, alethic and deontic) or by decomposition of the complex
logic (in this case, bimodal) into simpler ones. In such
circumstances, combining logics can be perceived as a tool for
simplifying problems involving heterogeneous reasoning.

The fact that ‘ought’ is not conveyed as a predicate, but
as a modal operator ranging over actions or states of affairs, was
responsible for the delay of formal treatments of this centuries-old
question.

Such a treatment was only possible after the development of general
modal logic. Indeed, what we are dealing with here is a bimodal logic,
which is properly treated only after a deeper understanding of the
semantical subtleties of mixing alethic and deontic logics. Moreover,
according to some philosophers who have argued that it is not possible
to link ‘is’ and ‘ought’ (that is, who defend
Hume’s thesis that no non-trivial ‘is-ought’
deductions are possible), it is mandatory to use combinations of
first-order, alethic and deontic logics (see e.g., Stuhlmann-Laeisz
1983 and Schurz 1997).

A. Prior (1960), using the apparatus of contemporary modal logic,
tried to characterize the distinction between normative and
non-normative sentences in formal terms, which enabled him to
define senses of ‘descriptive content’ versus
‘normative content’. A problem, however, occurs with mixed
sentences, which have both descriptive and normative components, and
Prior comes up with a paradox: wherever we draw the distinction
between non-normative and normative sentences, unexpected inferences
from non-normative premises to normative conclusions may appear by a
mere use of laws of classical propositional logic. Consider, for
instance, the following two inferences:

 (1) “Tea-drinking
is common in England. Therefore:
Either tea-drinking is common in England or all New Zealanders ought
to be shot”, 


formalized as:

 (1′) d⊢d∨◯sd⊢d∨◯s\texttt{d}
\,\vdash\, \texttt{d} \vee \obcirc
\texttt{s} ,, 


and

 (2) “Tea-drinking
is common in England, or all New
Zealanders ought to be shot. Tea-drinking is not common in England.
Therefore, all New Zealanders ought to be shot”, 


formalized as:

 (2′) 
d∨◯s,¬d⊢◯sd∨◯s,¬d⊢◯s\texttt{d} \vee \obcirc \texttt{s},\, \neg \texttt{d} \,\vdash\,
\obcirc \texttt{s}. 


If the mixed sentence d∨◯sd∨◯s\texttt{d} \vee \obcirc \texttt{s} is
considered to be normative, then (1) is an example of an
‘is-ought’ inference, and if it is considered to be
non-normative, then (2) is an example of an ‘is-ought’
inference. So, one of them dichotomically represents a violation of
Hume’s thesis in Prior’s terms. Prior concluded from this
paradox that Hume’s ‘is-ought thesis’ is simply
false (see Prior 1960: 206): one can simply derive
conclusions which are ethical starting from premises which have no
ethical character.

Prior recognized however that the inferences involved in the paradox
are ethically irrelevant or trivial, but neither he nor later authors
could find a suitable definition of what it would mean by
“ethical irrelevance” or “ethical triviality”
attached to an inference.

Using the semantics of modal logics, objections against this
conclusion can be raised, as for example in Karmo 1988, in the sense
of separating statements between evaluative in some possible worlds
and descriptive in others (while keeping their meaning).

By using concepts of combinations of languages and combinations of
logics, G. Schurz (see Schurz 1991; see also Schurz 1997) was able to
state a generalized Hume’s thesis (GH); as
observed in
 subsection 4.1,
 this treatment is in fact a fusion of two modal logics. In
(GH) a mixed sentence φφ\varphi is derived from a set of
purely descriptive sentences (i.e., sentences free of ◯◯\obcirc)
only if φφ\varphi is completely ◯◯\obcirc-irrelevant (that is,
predicates in φφ\varphi within the scope of ◯◯\obcirc can be
replaced by other predicates salva valididate). Moreover, it
is proven that (GH) holds in an alethic-deontic first-order
logic LL\mathcal{L} if, and only if, LL\mathcal{L} can be
axiomatized without bridge principles.

The notion of bridge principle lies in the scope of combination of
languages. In general, many bridge principles can be made explicit
within modal logic, and will be relevant for analyzing relationships
among diverse modalities. For example, if we take necessity
◻□\square and possibility ◊◊\lozenge as primitive operators, then

◊p→¬◻¬p◊p→¬□¬p\lozenge p \to \neg\square\neg p

 is an intuitionistically acceptable bridge principle,
while the converse is not.


Besides Hume’s problem, another example of bimodal logic with
intrinsic philosophical interest where bridge principles intervene is
the logic of physical and alethic modalities. In this logic, the
language permits the expression of two different notions of necessity:
the logical necessity, symbolized by ◻□\square, and the physical
necessity, symbolized by ⊡⊡\boxdot.

The simplest connection between physical necessity and logical
necessity that comprises an acceptable philosophical meaning is given
by the following bridge axiom: 

◻p→⊡p□p→⊡p\quad\square p\to\boxdot p

 meaning that logical
necessity is stronger than physical necessity: anything that is
logically necessary is physically necessary.


The resulting logic KT⊡⊡^{\boxdot} is axiomatized
by the well-known axioms and rules of KT for both
modalities in addition to the bridge axiom above, and is semantically
characterized by Kripke frames with two accessibility relations,
requiring that the accessibility relation for physical necessity is
included in the other.

Not only bimodal, but multimodal (also called polymodal) logics, are
standard in the literature: a typical case is the logic of knowledge
(or epistemic logic), usually endowed with modal operators
K1,K2,…,KmK1,K2,…,KmK_{1},K_{2},\ldots,K_{m} representing the knowledge of mmm
agents (or “knowers”). The formula KiαKiαK_{i}\alpha means
“agent iii knows αα\alpha”, and the language is able
to express, for instance, “iii knows that jjj does not know
that iii knows ppp” by means of Ki¬KjKipKi¬KjKipK_{i}\neg K_{j}K_{i}p.
No additional mixing principles are mandatory for the combined logic
of many agents, but bridge axioms may, of course, be added.

The interest of studying combinations of logics may thus be seen as a
reflex of the pluralist view of contemporary logical research. Indeed,
this kind of bridge axioms can, in principle, connect completely
distinct logics. Van Benthem (2006) suggests that combining logics may
lead to the emergence of new phenomena, depending on the mode of
combination, and moreover, it may work as an inspiration (and perhaps
as a model) for the study of combining epistemic notions. He even
suggests that the compartmentalization of logic into subfields as
‘modal’, ‘temporal’, ‘epistemic’,
‘doxastic’, ‘erotetic’ or
‘deontic’ logic has been harmful to Philosophical
Logic.

Combinations of logics go in the opposite direction of such a
compartmentalization: considering that almost any conceptual task to
be analyzed involves immediate reasoning concerning necessity,
obligation, action, time, verbal tense, knowledge, belief, etc.; from
a philosophical point of view, logical combinations may be the right
way to look at philosophical issues within the theory of causation, of
action, and so on.

The idea of looking at logic as an entirety avoiding fragmentation is
not new, and philosophers and logicians from Ramón Lull to
Gottfried W. Leibniz have thought of building schemes where different
logics or logic-like mechanisms could interact and cooperate instead
of competing. In contemporary terms, the first methods for combining
logics were products of logics (introduced by K. Segerberg
(1973) and independently by V. Šehtman (1978)), fusion
(introduced by R. Thomason (1984)) and fibring (introduced by
D. Gabbay (1996a)), all of them dedicated to combining only modal
logics. It is worth noting that M. Fitting (1969) gave early examples
of fusion of modal logics, anticipating the notion of fusion.

Other combination mechanisms followed, such as parameterization and
temporalization, which were more on the side of software
specification.

Most of these methods have been encompassed in the algebraic
fibring introduced by A. Sernadas, C. Sernadas and C. Caleiro
(1999), which notoriously improved the versatility of these techniques
by means of (universal) categorial constructions, in this way making
it possible to combine wider classes of logics besides modal
logics.

On the other hand, making heavy use of the language of category
theory, J. Goguen and R. Burstall introduced the notion of
institutions as a kind of abstract model theory devoted to
applications in Computer Science (see Goguen and Burstall 1984, 1992).
Institutions are also used as a mechanism for combining logics.

However, combining logics does not only mean synthesizing or composing
logics, but can also yield interesting examples that go in the
opposite direction of decomposing logics (see
 section 2).
 A paradigmatic methodology for decomposition is the
possible-translations semantics, a notion proposed in
Carnielli 1990 designed to help solve the problem of assigning
semantic interpretations to non-classical logics. Examples of
possible-translations semantics illustrate how a complex logic can be
analyzed into less complex factors. Another closely related technique
is the nondeterministic semantics (see Avron and Lev 2001,
2005), whereas direct union of matrices and plain
fibring (see Coniglio and Fernández 2005) can be
considered to be methods for both composing and decomposing.

All of these methods open the way for a new subject in the realm of
combinations of logics: is it possible to decompose a given logic into
elementary ones? In other words, are there prime logics
which, combined in an appropriate way, may produce all (or part of)
the familiar logic systems?

Results on combinations of logics may quickly become too technical
when we turn to the combination of higher-order, modal, relevance
logics or non-truth-functional logics, and thus refinements of the
notion of algebraic fibring such as modulated fibring (see C.
Sernadas et al. 2002b) or cryptofibring (see Caleiro and
Ramos 2007) may be necessary to solve, for example, some collapsing
problems within combinations of logics (see
 section 5).
 This naturally leads to the use of category theory as a universal
language and as a tool to deal with such problems. But the fact is
that combinations of logics do not necessarily depend upon any highly
technical methodology, and even some relatively simple examples can be
really expressive. There is a recognized intersection and interaction
between Philosophy and theoretical Computer Science, and techniques
for combining logics are also revealed to be very apt tools for
handling and thus better understanding Kripke models. Having been
introduced in the domain of Philosophical Logic, Kripke models are
essential in Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence as semantic
structures for logics of belief, knowledge, temporal logics, logics
for actions, etc. Knowledge representation and reasoning may require
combining several reasoning formalisms, including combinations of
temporal reasoning, reasoning in description logic, reasoning about
space and distance, and so on. Logics, combining temporal and modal
dimensions, are also becoming a relevant tool in agent-oriented
programming languages. Other applications of combinations of logics
include software specification, knowledge representation,
architectures for intelligent computing and quantum computing,
security protocols and authentication, secure computation and
zero-knowledge proof systems, besides their connections to formal
ethics and game semantics.

The Belief-Desire-Intention model of agents (BDI) is concerned with
the formal representation of practical reasoning involving action,
intention, belief, will, deliberation, goal-driven modeling, etc. This
kind of reasoning is essential for planning (especially for artificial
agents). It is then just natural to think about combining simple modal
logics for knowledge, belief, obligation, capability, opportunity,
etc., so as to define more robust BDI logics. Governatori et al. 2002
investigates the relationships between BDI logics and a particular
case of Gabbay’s fibring semantics (see
 subsection 4.2)
 called dovetailing, showing that a (general) logical account
of BDI can be handled by means of dovetailing multimodal logics.

But combinations of logics also work from another perspective: instead
of directly combining logic systems and looking for the interpretation
of the resulting system, one can start from a purely mathematical
perspective. In van Benthem et al. 2006, for instance, the authors
introduce the notion of horizontal and vertical topologies on the
product of topological spaces, and show that the modal logic of
products of topological spaces with horizontal and vertical topologies
coincides with the fusion of S4 with itself. The resulting
completeness proof has deep connections with some topological
properties of the real and of the rational numbers.
2. Splitting logics versus splicing logics

It is reasonable to expect that a method for combining logics would
work in two opposite directions: on the one hand, a logic that one
wants to investigate could be decomposed into factors of lesser
complexity; for instance, a bimodal alethic-deontic logic could be
decomposed into its alethic and deontic fragments. In this case, it
would be relevant to see if the logic under investigation is the least
extension of its factors, or if additional bridge principles would
have to be added. This approach, in which a given logic is decomposed
into (possibly) simpler factors, is said to be a process of
splitting logics.

On the other hand, one might be interested in creating new logic
systems where different aspects are integrated, starting from given
logics. This demand typically occurs in software engineering and
security: knowledge representation, formal specification and
verification of algorithms and protocols have a marked need for
working with several logics. In a less pragmatical scenery, this would
be the case if one is interested, for instance, in adding a modal
dimension to an intuitionistic or a paraconsistent logic. Moreover, it
is interesting to characterize which properties of the factors can be
transferred to the combined logic. This direction is said to be a
process of splicing logics.

The essential distinctions between splicing (in the direction of
synthesis) and splitting (in the direction of analysis) take into
account the intentions one may have in mind, and consequently each
direction encompasses specifically designed techniques.

The paradigm of splicing logics assumes a bottom-up perspective: it
combines given logics, synthesizing them, and producing a new one. The
combined logic should be minimal in some sense: that is, if LL{{\cal
L}} is obtained from L1L1{{\cal L}}_1 and L2L2{{\cal L}}_2 by some
combination process, it should be expected that: 1) LL{{\cal L}}
extends both L1L1{{\cal L}}_1 and L2L2{{\cal L}}_2; and 2)
LL{{\cal L}} is a minimal extension of both L1L1{{\cal
L}}_1 and L2L2{{\cal L}}_2. For instance, some methods may require
LL{{\cal L}} to be the least conservative extension of both L1L1{{\cal
L}}_1 and L2L2{{\cal L}}_2. This point will be discussed in
 section 5.

On the other hand, splitting a logic LL{{\cal L}} assumes a top-down
perspective: logics are decomposed into (presumably simpler)
factors.

It should be stressed that most of the methods for combining logics
found in the literature are better understood from the splicing
perspective, placing prominence on the creation of a logic system from
familiar logics. However, some splicing methods such as fusion (see
 subsection 4.1)
 are more usefully regarded as a method of decomposition of logics
into simpler fragments, and in this way also work in the splitting
direction. Possible-translations semantics (see
 subsection 4.4),
 on the other hand, constitute a typical method within the splitting
perspective.
3. The importance of language and the presentation of logics

Suppose that two given logics L1L1{{\cal L}}_1 and L2L2{{\cal L}}_2
are to be combined using some technique. It should be obvious that any
method applied to combine L1L1{{\cal L}}_1 and L2L2{{\cal L}}_2 will
create a new logic LL{{\cal L}} which contains the
signature (logic symbols such as connectives, quantifiers,
propositional variables etc.) of both logics: LL{{\cal L}}
will be defined in a mixed language, which allows combinations of
symbols of the underlying languages. That is, a combination of logic
systems presupposes the previous combination of the respective
signatures. This is why the choice of the signature of the combined
system is as important as the logic itself. For instance, the
definition of the language of parameterization is fundamental in order
to obtain the intended combined logic (see
 subsection 4.5).
 Another example is found in Schurz 1991, where the formal treatment
of Hume’s ‘is-ought problem’ (recall
 section 1)
 presupposes careful handling of subtle combinations of languages.

Besides the definition of the appropriate language for the combined
logic, another important question that immediately arises is: should
the logics L1L1{{\cal L}}_1 and L2L2{{\cal L}}_2 (to be combined) be
presented in the same way? In other words: is it possible to combine
logics defined by different paradigms? For instance, how could one
combine a logic L1L1{{\cal L}}_1, defined by a sequent calculus, with
a logic L2L2{{\cal L}}_2, represented by a (Hilbert-style) axiomatic
system? How should the resulting logic LL{{\cal L}} be represented:
as a sequent calculus, as an axiomatic system or as a mixed proof
system? Consider now another (even worse) situation: the logic
L1L1{{\cal L}}_1 is described by semantical means (that is, through
semantic structures such as valuations or Kripke models) whereas the
logic L2L2{{\cal L}}_2 is presented through a syntactical proof
system, such as a natural deduction system, sequent calculus or a
Hilbert-style axiomatization. Could the resulting (combined) logic be
better presented semantically or syntactically?

This annoyance does not occur in the majority of cases, where the
logics being combined are complete with respect to some kind of
semantics and are syntactically presented in a homogeneous way.
However, it may happen that the logics are found in peculiar ways; for
instance, linear logic and other substructural logics have no usual
consequence relations because derivations are exclusively displayed by
using multisets or sequences of formulas. Combinations of such logics
with usual modal logics, for instance, are not so obvious, although
both are complete.

Still, there are logics which are only reasonably presented by
syntactical means, or exclusively by semantical means. Such is the
case, e.g., of the first-order theory of torsion groups, known to be
non-axiomatizable, and of incomplete modal logics which are only
presented in syntactical (proof-theoretical) terms.

A possible solution to the problem of combining heterogeneous logics,
which naturally leads us to the deeper question of “what is a
logic?”, is to consider a common component of the majority of
logics (but still excluding certain substructural logics): their
respective consequence relations. Thus, given L1L1{{\cal L}}_1 and
L2L2{{\cal L}}_2 presented in different ways, it is always possible to
extract the respective consequence relations and then combine them
(taking, for instance, their supremum in an appropriate lattice of
consequence relations). But in this way, the resulting logic LL{{\cal
L}} is presented in a very abstract way: the only information
available from LL{{\cal L}} is its consequence relation, and so the
characteristics and particularities of each logic component are
definitively lost.

Returning to the first example (combining a sequent calculus with an
axiomatic system), a better solution was proposed in Cruz-Filipe et
al. 2008: the idea is to define an abstract formalism for proof
systems, general enough as to encode the main proof mechanisms found
in the literature. Thus, after reformulating L1L1{{\cal L}}_1 and
L2L2{{\cal L}}_2 as abstract proof systems of this kind, the resulting
combined logic LL{{\cal L}} is an abstract proof system in which it
is possible to recognize the ‘genetic traces’ of the
original inference rules of each component within derivations in
LL{{\cal L}}. The latter question, namely, how to characterize
derivations in a fibred logic in terms of the derivations of the
components, was carefully analyzed by S. Marcelino et al. in
a series of papers Marcelino and Caleiro 2014 (Other Internet
Resources); Marcelino et al. 2015; and Marcelino and Caleiro 2015
(Other Internet Resources).  See subsection 4.3.

Despite the above mentioned results on combining heterogeneous logics,
it seems more reasonable to combine logics defined in a homogeneous
way, and, in fact, this is the case with most of the proposals in the
literature. For instance, the usual combinations of modal logics (as
fusion, product and fibring) are performed between systems presented
axiomatically, or between classes of Kripke models. It is frequent,
therefore, to define different categories of logic systems
(consequence relations, Hilbert calculi, algebraizable logics etc.)
with appropriate morphisms between them, in which the combination (or
decomposition) of logics appear as universal constructions. Algebraic
fibring, to be described in
 subsection 4.3,
 is a good example of this approach.
4. Methods for combining and decomposing logics
4.1 Fusion and Products

The method of fusion of normal modal logics was introduced by
R. Thomason (1984), and constitutes one of the first general methods
for combining logics. In the original formulation, it combines normal
modal logics presented syntactically and semantically (through
Hilbert-style axioms and Kripke semantics, respectively). The main
characteristics of the method are described in the following
paragraphs.

Consider Kripke models of the form 

⟨W,R,V⟩⟨W,R,V⟩\langle W,R,V\rangle

 such that WWW is a
non-empty set (the set of worlds), R⊆W×WR⊆W×WR\subseteq W\times W is a
binary relation (the accessibility relation) and V:P→℘WV:P→℘WV: \mathbb{P} \to
\wp W from the set of propositional variables into the power set of
WWW is a valuation map. Let L1L1{{\cal L}}_1 and L2L2{{\cal L}}_2 be
two propositional normal modal logics defined over the same classical
signature which contains the connectives ¬¬\neg (negation) and
→→\to (implication). Denote by ◻1□1\square_1 and ◻2□2\square_2 the
necessity operators of L1L1{{\cal L}}_1 and L2L2{{\cal L}}_2,
respectively. Let M1M1{{\cal M}}_1 and M2M2{{\cal M}}_2 be the classes
of Kripke models for L1L1{{\cal L}}_1 and L2L2{{\cal L}}_2,
respectively. Since both logics are normal, it is granted that both
modalities ◻1□1\square_1 and ◻2□2\square_2 satisfy the normality axiom
KKK and the necessitation rule. The fusion of L1L1{{\cal
L}}_1 and L2L2{{\cal L}}_2 is then defined to be the normal bimodal
logic LL{{\cal L}} with two independent boxes ◻1□1\square_1 and
◻2□2\square_2 together with the connectives ¬¬\neg (negation) and
→→\to (implication). The semantics of LL{{\cal L}} is given by the
class MM{{\cal M}} of Kripke structures of the form 

⟨W,R1,R2,V⟩⟨W,R1,R2,V⟩\langle W,R_1,R_2,V\rangle

 such
that ⟨W,R1,V⟩⟨W,R1,V⟩\langle W,R_1,V\rangle and ⟨W,R2,V⟩⟨W,R2,V⟩\langle W,R_2,V\rangle belong
to M1M1{{\cal M}}_1 and M2M2{{\cal M}}_2, respectively. In other
words, each structure of the fusion corresponds to a pair of models: a
model ⟨W,R1,V⟩⟨W,R1,V⟩\langle W,R_1,V\rangle for L1L1{{\cal L}}_1 and a model
⟨W,R2,V⟩⟨W,R2,V⟩\langle W,R_2,V\rangle for L2L2{{\cal L}}_2 sharing the same set
of worlds WWW. Technically speaking, each structure of the fusion
have, as a reduct, a model of L1L1{{\cal L}}_1 and a model of L2L2{{\cal
L}}_2.


Given a structure M=⟨W,R1,R2,V⟩M=⟨W,R1,R2,V⟩M=\langle W,R_1,R_2,V\rangle, the accessibility
relation R1R1R_1 is used to evaluate the box ◻1□1\square_1, whereas
R2R2R_2 is used to evaluate ◻2□2\square_2. Since the language of
LL{{\cal L}} is freely generated by the union of the signatures of
L1L1{{\cal L}}_1 and L2L2{{\cal L}}_2, it contains mixed formulas such
as φ=◻1(◻2p→p)φ=□1(□2p→p)\varphi = \square_1(\square_2 p \to p). Now, the structure
MMM satisfies φφ\varphi above at a world w∈Ww∈Ww \in W if and only
if, for every w1∈Ww1∈Ww_1 \in W such that wR1w1wR1w1w R_1 w_1, MMM satisfies
(◻2p→p)(□2p→p)(\square_2 p \to p) at w1w1w_1. But this means that, either there
exists w2w2w_2 such that w1R2w2w1R2w2w_1 R_2 w_2 and w2∉V(p)w2∉V(p)w_2 \not\in V(p), or
w1∈V(p)w1∈V(p)w_1 \in V(p).

As concerns axiomatics, a Hilbert calculus for LL{{\cal L}} is
obtained by joining up the (schema) axioms of both systems. Thus,
LL{{\cal L}} has, among others, two KKK axioms, two necessitation
rules and just one Modus Ponens (because implication →→\to
is shared). Considering that the language of LL{{\cal L}} has mixed
formulas (as φφ\varphi above), schema variables occurring in the
schema rules of the given logics can now be replaced in LL{{\cal L}}
by mixed formulas. For instance, φφ\varphi can be derived in
LL{{\cal L}} from the formula (◻2p→p)(□2p→p)(\square_2 p \to p) by an
application of the necessitation rule for the box ◻1□1\square_1.

An interesting example of fusion appears in Schurz 1991, when an
alethic-deontic logic is defined by fusing a pure alethic logic with a
pure deontic logic. This combination is used to analyze Hume’s
‘is-ought thesis’ (see
 section 1
 above) in formal terms. Other intuitively appealing examples of
fusion are given in the pioneering paper Fitting 1969 by M. Fitting,
where alethic and deontic modalities are fused (before the concept of
fusion had ever been introduced).

Since then fusion has been a much worked theme. Important results are
the applications of fusion to simulations and to the question of
transfer of properties among modal logics. Simulations make the
strength of normal monomodal logics explicit, as they can, in a sense,
simulate all modal logics (see Kracht and Wolter 1999). With respect
to transfers, the preservation of properties such as completeness,
finite modal property, decidability and interpolation by fusion of
modal logics was extensively studied in Fine and Schurz 1996. More
general and deeper results in the same spirit were obtained in Kracht
and Wolter 1991, and a survey of most of those results can be found in
Kracht and Wolter 1997. These results show the robustness of fusion as
a combination method within the scope of modal logics, for fulfilling
the requirement of preserving the properties of the logics being
combined.

The question of how completeness results (and other model-theoretical
properties) can be transferred from a propositional modal logic to its
quantificational counterpart, and from a monomodal quantified modal
logic to their multimodal combinations by means of fusion, is
investigated in Schurz 2011. The paper also deals with the question on
how completeness can be transferred from quantified modal logic with
rigid designators to the ones with non-rigid designators.

Rasga et al. 2010 defines a categorical approach of fusion for modal
logic systems labelled with truth values, and it is shown that the
preservation of completeness requires some careful assumptions, while
soundness is preserved without further provisos. A wide variety of
logics (besides modal logics) including several non-classical logics
can be treated in this way.

An interesting note is that there is a notable difference between
combining logics from the syntactical and from the semantical
perspective. For instance, the joining of two Hilbert calculi should
be intuitively obtained by simply putting together the axioms and
rules of both logics, while the semantical counterpart is not so
obviously determined. Regarding this, an alternative to fusion is the
fibred semantics (see
 subsection 4.2).

Fusion, even if it is a very natural method for combining modal
logics, however, is not obviously extendable to combinations of
non-normal modal logics with normal modal logics. Moreover, fusion is
specifically designed for combining modal logics, and cannot be
extended in an obvious way to logics of a different nature. Algebraic
fibring, described in
 subsection 4.3
 below, constitutes a generalization of fusion (at the propositional
level), and generally solves the question of combining logics.

Another early method for combining (modal) logics is the so-called
product of modal logics. This mechanism, independently
introduced in Segerberg 1973 and in Šehtman 1978, is
appropriate to represent time-space information. Given two modal
logics L1L1{{\cal L}}_1 and L2L2{{\cal L}}_2 as above, the product
L1×L2L1×L2{{\cal L}}_1 \times {{\cal L}}_2 is the bimodal logic over the
mixed signature (endowed with two boxes) characterized by the class of
Kripke structures of the form 

⟨W1×W2,S1,S2,V1×V2⟩⟨W1×W2,S1,S2,V1×V2⟩\langle W_1\times W_2,S_1,S_2,V_1 \times V_2 \rangle

 defined from Kripke models
⟨W1,R1,V1⟩⟨W1,R1,V1⟩\langle W_1,R_1,V_1\rangle and ⟨W2,R2,V2⟩⟨W2,R2,V2⟩\langle W_2,R_2,V_2\rangle for
L1L1{{\cal L}}_1 and L2L2{{\cal L}}_2, respectively. The accessibility
relations S1,S2⊆(W1×W2)×(W1×W2)S1,S2⊆(W1×W2)×(W1×W2)S_1,S_2\subseteq ( W_1 \times W_2) \times (W_1 \times
W_2) are defined as follows:




⟨u1,u2⟩S1⟨w1,w2⟩⟨u1,u2⟩S1⟨w1,w2⟩\langle u_1,u_2\rangle S_1 \langle w_1,w_2 \rangle iff u1R1w1u1R1w1u_1 R_1
w_1 and u2=w2u2=w2u_2=w_2; 


⟨u1,u2⟩S2⟨w1,w2⟩⟨u1,u2⟩S2⟨w1,w2⟩\langle u_1,u_2\rangle S_2 \langle w_1,w_2 \rangle iff u2R2w2u2R2w2u_2 R_2
w_2 and u1=w1u1=w1u_1=w_1; 


(V1×V2)(p)=V1(p)×V2(p)(V1×V2)(p)=V1(p)×V2(p)(V_1 \times V_2)(p)=V_1(p) \times V_2(p). 


A somewhat surprising feature of the product of modal logics is that
some new interactions between modalities arise. These new valid
formulas are a sort of bridge principles (recall
 section 1).
 Using the standard notation ◊1φ◊1φ\lozenge_1 \varphi for ¬◻1¬φ¬□1¬φ\neg
\square_1 \neg \varphi (and analogously for ◊2◊2\lozenge_2) for the
possibility operator, the following bridge principles are always valid
in the product logic:



(◊1◊2p→◊2◊1p)(◊1◊2p→◊2◊1p)(\lozenge_1\lozenge_2 p \to \lozenge_2\lozenge_1 p ) Commutativity
1; 


(◊2◊1p→◊1◊2p)(\lozenge_2\lozenge_1 p \to \lozenge_1\lozenge_2 p ) Commutativity
2; 


(◊1◻2p→◻2◊1p)(\lozenge_1\square_2 p \to \square_2\lozenge_1 p ) Church-Rosser
property 1; 


(◊2◻1p→◻1◊2p)(\lozenge_2\square_1 p \to \square_1\lozenge_2 p ) Church-Rosser
property 2. 


Due to such interactions it is not possible to directly obtain the
Hilbert calculus for the product of two modal logics, as in the case
of fusion. The bridge principles must be explicitly added to the union
of the original axiomatics in order to ensure completeness.

As in the case of fusion, this technique does not allow a direct
generalization to logics other than modal ones.
4.2 Fibring (or fibring by functions)

The fibred semantics of modal logics was originally proposed
by D. Gabbay in Gabbay 1996a and Gabbay 1996b (see also Gabbay 1999).
As in the case of fusion and products, the mechanism of fibring also
applies to modal logics only. Assume the same notation as in
 subsection 4.1.
 Thus, given L1{{\cal L}}_1 and L2{{\cal L}}_2, we start by
defining the fibred language (or the fibring of the languages), which
is the language generated by ◻1\square_1, ◻2\square_2, ¬\neg
and →\to from the propositional variables. The basic idea is to
consider Kripke models with distinguished (actual) worlds together
with two transfer mappings: h1h_1 from the set of worlds of the
class of models M1{{\cal M}}_1 of L1{{\cal L}}_1 into the class of
models M2{{\cal M}}_2 of L2{{\cal L}}_2, and h2h_2 from the set
of worlds of the class of models M2{{\cal M}}_2 of L2{{\cal L}}_2
into the class of models M1{{\cal M}}_1 of L1{{\cal L}}_1. When a
Kripke model of L1{{\cal L}}_1 has to evaluate a formula of the form
◻2φ\square_2 \varphi at the actual world w1w_1, the validity
checking is then transferred to the validity checking of ◻2φ\square_2
\varphi within the Kripke model h1(w1)h_1(w_1) at its actual world.
The evaluation of a formula of the form ◻1φ\square_1 \varphi within a
Kripke model of L2{{\cal L}}_2 at the actual world w2w_2 is
performed analogously, but now using the map h2h_2.

Thus, the fibring (or fibring by functions, as it is called
in Carnielli et al. 2008) of L1{{\cal L}}_1 and L2{{\cal L}}_2 is
a normal bimodal logic characterized semantically as follows: let

h1:⨄m∈M1Wm→⨄m∈M2{⟨m,w⟩ : w∈Wm}h_1:\biguplus_{m \in {{\cal M}}_1} W_m \to \biguplus_{m \in {{\cal M}}_2} \{\langle m, w\rangle \ : \ w \in W_m\}

 and 

h2:⨄m∈M2Wm→⨄m∈M1{⟨m,w⟩ : w∈Wm}h_2:\biguplus_{m \in {{\cal M}}_2} W_m \to \biguplus_{m \in {{\cal M}}_1} \{\langle m, w\rangle \ : \ w \in W_m\}

 be a pair of transfer mappings. For
simplicity, we assume that the sets of worlds WmW_m of m∈M1m\in {{\cal
M}}_1 are pairwise disjoints, and the same holds for M2{{\cal
M}}_2. Given m∈M1∪M2m\in {{\cal M}}_1 \cup {{\cal M}}_2, w∈Wmw\in W_m
and a formula φ\varphi in the fibred language, the satisfaction of
φ\varphi in ⟨h1,h2,m,w⟩\langle h_1,h_2,m,w\rangle, denoted by ⟨h1,h2,m,w⟩⊩φ\langle
h_1,h_2,m,w\rangle\Vdash \varphi, is defined recursively as usual
whenever the main connective of φ\varphi is Boolean (¬\neg or
→\to), or when φ\varphi is atomic. For the modalities,
satisfaction is defined as follows: suppose (without loss of
generality) that m∈M1m \in {{\cal M}}_1, and let h1(w)=⟨m2,w2⟩h_1(w)=\langle
m_2,w_2\rangle, with m=⟨Wm,Rm,Vm⟩m=\langle W_m,R_m,V_m\rangle and
m2=⟨Wm2,Rm2,Vm2⟩m_2=\langle W_{m_2},R_{m_2},V_{m_2}\rangle. Then:




⟨h1,h2,m,w⟩⊩◻1φ\langle h_1,h_2,m,w\rangle\Vdash \square_1\varphi

iff ⟨h1,h2,m,w1⟩⊩φ\langle h_1,h_2,m,w_1\rangle\Vdash \varphi, for every w1w_1
such that wRmw1w R_m w_1; 


⟨h1,h2,m,w⟩⊩◻2φ\langle h_1,h_2,m,w\rangle\Vdash \square_2\varphi

iff ⟨h1,h2,m2,w2⟩⊩◻2φ\langle h_1,h_2,m_2,w_2\rangle\Vdash \square_2\varphi

iff ⟨h1,h2,m2,w3⟩⊩φ\langle h_1,h_2,m_2,w_3\rangle\Vdash \varphi, for every
w3w_3 such that w2Rm2w3w_2 R_{m_2} w_3. 


The definition of ⟨h1,h2,m,w⟩⊩◻iφ\langle h_1,h_2,m,w\rangle\Vdash
\square_i\varphi for i=1,2i=1,2 and m∈M2m \in {{\cal M}}_2 is
analogous.

Then, ⟨h1,h2⟩\langle h_1,h_2\rangle satisfies φ\varphi, denoted by
⟨h1,h2⟩⊩φ\langle h_1,h_2\rangle \Vdash \varphi, if ⟨h1,h2,m,w⟩⊩φ\langle
h_1,h_2,m,w\rangle\Vdash \varphi for every m∈M1∪M2m\in {{\cal M}}_1 \cup
{{\cal M}}_2 and w∈Wmw\in W_m. Finally, φ\varphi is valid in the
fibred semantics whenever ⟨h1,h2⟩⊩φ\langle h_1,h_2\rangle \Vdash \varphi
for every pair ⟨h1,h2⟩\langle h_1,h_2\rangle as above.

For instance, given h1,h2h_1, h_2 as above, let ⟨W2,R2,V2⟩∈M2\langle
W_2,R_2,V_2\rangle \in {{\cal M}}_2 and w2∈W2w_2\in W_2 such that
h2(w2)=⟨⟨W1,R1,V1⟩,w1⟩h_2(w_2)= \langle \langle W_1,R_1,V_1\rangle,w_1\rangle. Then:



⟨h1,h2,⟨W2,R2,V2⟩,w2⟩⊩◻1◻2¬p\langle h_1,h_2,\langle W_2,R_2,V_2\rangle,w_2\rangle \Vdash
\square_1 \square_2 \neg p 


iff ⟨h1,h2,⟨W1,R1,V1⟩,w1⟩⊩◻1◻2¬p\langle h_1,h_2,\langle W_1,R_1,V_1\rangle,w_1\rangle \Vdash
\square_1 \square_2 \neg p 


iff ⟨h1,h2,⟨W1,R1,V1⟩,w′1⟩⊩◻2¬p\langle h_1,h_2,\langle W_1,R_1,V_1\rangle,w'_1\rangle \Vdash
\square_2 \neg p, for every w′1w'_1 such that w1R1w′1w_1 R_1 w'_1.



Suppose that h1(w′1)=⟨⟨W′2,R′2,V′2⟩,w′2⟩h_1(w'_1)= \langle \langle
W'_2,R'_2,V'_2\rangle,w'_2\rangle. Then, the latter is valid iff



⟨h1,h2,⟨W′2,R′2,V′2⟩,w′2⟩⊩◻2¬p\langle h_1,h_2,\langle W'_2,R'_2,V'_2\rangle,w'_2\rangle \Vdash
\square_2 \neg p, 


for every w′1w'_1 such that w1R1w′1w_1 R_1 w'_1; i.e., for every
w′1w'_1 such that w1R1w′1w_1 R_1 w'_1 and for every w″2w''_2 such that
w′2R′2w″2w'_2 R'_2 w''_2, ⟨h1,h2,⟨W′2,R′2,V′2⟩,w″2⟩⊩¬p\langle h_1,h_2,\langle
W'_2,R'_2,V'_2\rangle,w''_2\rangle \Vdash \neg p. This is equivalent
to saying that, for every w′1w'_1 such that w1R1w′1w_1 R_1 w'_1 and for
every w″2w''_2 such that w′2R′2w″2w'_2 R'_2 w''_2, w″2∉V′2(p)w''_2 \not\in
V'_2(p).

With respect to axiomatics, the logics obtained by fibring by
functions can, in some cases, be axiomatized by the union of the
(schema) axioms of the given logics. But some logics may require the
addition of some new bridge principles (mixing rules and axioms) in
order to ensure the preservation of completeness. This may explain
some discrepancy between the approaches of fusion and fibring; the
completeness of fibring as exposed in Gabbay 1999 does not work
exactly as a substitute for more technically intricate completeness
proofs as in Kracht and Wolter 1991 and in Fine and Schurz 1996. For
more on this discussion, see Kracht 2004.

The technique of fibring by functions is an interesting alternative to
fusion and products, but, as much as its competitors, it cannot be
extended to non-modal logics in any obvious way (see Coniglio and
Fernández 2005 for an adaptation of the method of fibring by
functions to matrix logics). One reason for the failure of fibring by
functions to what concerns generalizations is that it is not a
universal construction (in categorial terms). Moreover, the lack of a
systematic definition of the axiomatization for the logics obtained by
fibring is another negative aspect of this technique. The next
subsection describes a categorial generalization of fibring which
solves all the mentioned problems.
4.3 Categorial (or Algebraic) Fibring

In order to overcome the limitations of the original method of fibring
as exposed in the last subsection, A. Sernadas and collaborators
propose, in Sernadas et al. 1999, a general definition of fibring
using the conceptual tools of category theory. The central idea of the
generalization is simple: suppose that L1{{\cal L}}_1 and L2{{\cal
L}}_2 are two propositional logics which are to be combined.
Suppose, for simplicity, that no connectives are to be shared, that
is, the language of the logic L{{\cal L}} to be obtained is the
free combination of the connectives of both logics. In categorial
terms, the signature CC of L{{\cal L}} is the coproduct
(disjoint union) of the signatures C1C_1 of L1{{\cal L}}_1 and
C2C_2 of L2{{\cal L}}_2, in the underlying category of signatures.
Then L{{\cal L}}, which is the least logic defined over
CC which extends simultaneously L1{{\cal L}}_1 and L2{{\cal
L}}_2, is defined as the coproduct of L1{{\cal L}}_1 and L2{{\cal
L}}_2 in the underlying category of logics. The minimality of
L{{\cal L}} attends a criterion expressed in Gabbay 1999 (see also
 section 5)
 and also conforms to the ideal of fusing logics, see Kracht and
Wolter 1991. This combination process, called unconstrained
fibring, can be generalized, by allowing C1C_1 and C2C_2 to
share some connectives. Thus, the logic obtained by this second kind
of fibring is defined in a language such that some connectives of
L1{{\cal L}}_1 and L2{{\cal L}}_2 are identified. The logic
produced by this operation, called constrained fibring,
starts by considering two logics L1{{\cal L}}_1 and L2{{\cal L}}_2
over signatures C1C_1 and C2C_2, respectively, and a signature
C0C_0 contained in both C1C_1 and C2C_2. This signature contains
exactly the connectives of L1{{\cal L}}_1 and L2{{\cal L}}_2 which
are to be identified (or shared) throughout the combination process.
After computing the unconstrained fibring (that is, the coproduct)
L1⊕L2{{\cal L}}_1 \oplus {{\cal L}}_2 of L1{{\cal L}}_1 and L2{{\cal
L}}_2, which is defined over the signature C1⊕C2C_1 \oplus C_2 (the
coproduct of C1C_1 and C2C_2), a new logic L{{\cal L}} is
obtained. This logic, the fibring of L1{{\cal L}}_1 and L2{{\cal
L}}_2 by sharing (or constrained to) C0C_0, is
obtained from L1⊕L2{{\cal L}}_1 \oplus {{\cal L}}_2 by identifying two
connectives (of the same arity) iff both come from the same connective
in C0C_0. In terms of category theory, it is required that the
forgetful functor NN from the category of logics to the category of
signatures be a cofibration. Then, if ij:C0→Cji_j:{{\cal C}}_0\to C_j is
the inclusion morphism (for j=1,2j=1,2), hj:Cj→C1⊕C2h_j:C_j \to C_1 \oplus C_2
is the canonical injection of the coproduct (for j=1,2j=1,2) and
q:C1⊕C2→Cq:C_1 \oplus C_2 \to C is the coequalizer of h1∘i1h_1 \circ i_1 and
h2∘i2h_2 \circ i_2, then the constrained fibring L{{\cal L}} is the
codomain of the cocartesian lifting of qq by NN.

In order to exemplify the technique of categorial fibring (without
entering into technical details), suppose that L1{{\cal L}}_1 and
L2{{\cal L}}_2 are two modal logics defined through Hilbert calculi
over the same signatures C1C_1 and C2C_2 of subsections
 4.1
 and
 4.2,
 respectively, such that both logics contain the rules of Modus
Ponens and necessitation. Then C1⊕C2C_1 \oplus C_2 consists of two
negations ¬1\neg_1 and ¬2\neg_2, two implications →1\to_1 and
→2\to_2 and two boxes ◻1\square_1 and ◻2\square_2. The
unconstrained fibring L1⊕L2{{\cal L}}_1 \oplus {{\cal L}}_2 of L1{{\cal
L}}_1 and L2{{\cal L}}_2 is, therefore, the Hilbert calculus over
C1⊕C2C_1 \oplus C_2 defined by joining up the axiom schemas and
inference rules of both calculi. This logic has, among other axioms
and inference rules, two versions of Modus Ponens (one for
each implication) as well as two versions of the necessitation rule
(one for each box). It should be noted that, by using a fixed set of
schema variables for writing the axioms and rules of every calculus,
the calculi obtained by fibring are also formed by schematic axioms
and inference rules. Thus, for instance, in the rule of Modus
Ponens in L{{\cal L}}: 

ξ1(ξ1→1ξ2)ξ2\frac{\xi_1 \hspace{1cm} (\xi_1 \to_1 \xi_2)}{\xi_2}

 the schema variables
ξ1\xi_1 and ξ2\xi_2 can be replaced by mixed formulas. Instances
such as 

¬2p(¬2p→1◻2(q→2◻1r))◻2(q→2◻1r)\frac{\neg_2 p \hspace{1cm} (\neg_2 p \to_1 \square_2(q \to_2 \square_1 r))}{\square_2(q \to_2 \square_1 r)}

 are new, because the formulas ¬2p\neg_2 p and
◻2(q→2◻1r)\square_2(q \to_2 \square_1 r) do not belong to the language of
L1{{\cal L}}_1. Analogous replacements apply, of course, to other
inference rules and axioms of L1⊕L2{{\cal L}}_1 \oplus {{\cal
L}}_2.


Continuing with this example, suppose now that we want to share (or
identify) both negations, as well as both implications: this is a
reasonable move when, for instance, these connectives are classic. In
such case (φ→1¬2ψ)(\varphi \to_1 \neg_2 \psi) would represent the same
proposition as (φ→2¬1ψ)(\varphi \to_2 \neg_1 \psi).

In order to do this, the signature C0C_0 just containing ¬\neg
and →\to is taken into consideration, and so ¬1\neg_1 is
identified with ¬2\neg_2 in C1⊕C2C_1 \oplus C_2, as well as →1\to_1
is identified with →2\to_2. The resulting signature is CC, which
just contains the connectives ¬\neg, →\to, ◻1\square_1 and
◻2\square_2. In the resulting logic L{{\cal L}}, defined over
CC, there is now just one rule of Modus Ponens:

ξ1(ξ1→ξ2)ξ2\frac{\xi_1 \hspace{1cm} (\xi_1 \to \xi_2)}{\xi_2}

 However, there remain two necessitation rules, since
there are still two boxes in CC. The resulting L{{\cal L}} is
thus the fibring of L1{{\cal L}}_1 and L2{{\cal L}}_2 constrained
by C0C_0. This procedure precisely coincides with fusion of modal
logics. The novelty here is that this technique applies to a broad
class of logics, which are not necessarily restricted to (normal)
modal logics, as in the case of fusion.


Constrained and unconstrained fibring, being categorial, are universal
constructions, and so enjoy well-defined and theoretically predictable
formal properties. Profiting from universal constructions, in order to
handle algebraic fibring, it is enough to define appropriate
categories of signatures and logic systems. Indeed, the same
fibring construction (coproduct or cocartesian lifting) can be
performed in different categories of logic systems. This is a
remarkable advantage of the categorial perspective for fibring. There
are several proposals in the literature devoted to combining logics
presented in different ways by means of algebraic fibring:
propositional Hilbert calculi, sequent and hypersequent calculi,
first-order modal logics, higher-order modal logics,
non-truth-functional logics, logics semantically presented through
ordered algebras (encompassing generalized Kripke models) etc.

An important question connected to combination of logics (and, in
particular, to algebraic fibring) is the preservation of
metaproperties such as completeness, interpolation etc. For instance,
when L1{{\cal L}}_1 and L2{{\cal L}}_2 are complete logic systems
presented both semantically and syntactically, under which condition
is their fibring also complete? In this regard, Zanardo et al. 2001
and Sernadas et al. 2002a give a partial solution to this question.
The preservation of soundness and completeness with respect to the
technique of importing logics (see
 subsection 4.6) was proved in Rasga et
 al. 2013. Besides, in a series of papers (Marcelino and Caleiro 2014 (Other
Internet Resources),
 Marcelino et al. 2015 and Marcelino and Caleiro 2015 (Other Internet
Resources)),
 S. Marcelino et al. study the preservation of decidability by
 unconstrained fibring (that is, by algebraic fibring without sharing
 connectives). The key result is a general characterization of the
 derivations in the system obtained by fibring in terms of the
 derivations in each component. The complexity of the decision
 procedures was also analyzed in these papers. Thus, it was shown that
 the decision problem for the fibred logic can be reduced polynomially
 to the worst decision problem of the given logics. This means that,
 in particular, if the decision problems for two given logics L1{{\cal
 L}}_1 and L2{{\cal L}}_2 are both in a complexity class
 C\mathcal{C} then the decision problem for the unconstrained
 fibring L1⊕L2{{\cal L}}_1 \oplus {{\cal L}}_2 is also in
 C\mathcal{C}, provided that C\mathcal{C} contains the basic
 complexity class P (also known as PTIME) and is closed for
 composition with polynomials. Other examples of preservation of
 metaproperties are provided by the mechanism for combining logics
 known as meet combination of logics, introduced by Sernadas
 et al. 2012 (see
 subsection 4.6).
 Specifically, the preservation of soundness and completeness (see
Sernadas et al. 2012), Craig interpolation (see C. Sernadas et al.
2013 ) and admissibility of rules (see Rasga et al. 2015, in Other
Internet Resources) have been
obtained for this method. On the other hand, transfer results have
been extensively studied in the case of fusion of modal logics, as
already mentioned in
 subsection 4.1.

The relationship between fusion and algebraic fibring deserves some
comments. When restricted to modal propositional logics, fusion is a
particular case of algebraic fibring in the category of interpretation
systems, where logics are presented through ordered algebras: it is
enough to consider interpretation systems defined over power set
algebras induced by Kripke models. At the syntactical level, fusion is
also a particular case of algebraic fibring in the category of Hilbert
calculi, in the realm of propositional signatures. As much as
first-order modal logics are concerned, the approaches diverge, mainly
because there are different semantical accounts for treating
first-order modalities. For instance, the semantical approach to modal
first-order logics by Sernadas et al. 2002a in the context of
algebraic fibring differs from that of Kracht and Kutz (2002) in the
context of fusion.

The fact that algebraic fibring generalizes (at least at the
propositional level) the fusion of modal logics makes the former
method become very natural and useful. Moreover, the universality of
the construction allows one to define algebraic fibring in very
different logical contexts (categories of logics), such as
non-truth-functional logics, higher-order logics, sequent calculi etc.
As it will be shown in
 section 5,
 the different notions of morphisms between logics affect the strength
of the logics obtained by algebraic fibring in the different
categories of logic systems. For general accounts of algebraic fibring
see, for instance, Caleiro et al. 2005 and Carnielli et al. 2008.
4.4 Possible-Translations Semantics

The methods for combining logics described above adhere to the
splicing methodology: they are used to combine logics creating new
systems which extend the given logics.

As mentioned in
 section 2,
 there is a converse direction: the splitting methodology in which a
given logic system is decomposed into other systems. The
possible-translations semantics (in short, PTS),
introduced in Carnielli 1990 (see also Carnielli 2000), is one of the
few supporters of this viewpoint.

The notion of PTS was originally defined as an attempt to
endow certain logics with recursive and palatable semantic
interpretations. Actually, several paraconsistent logics which are not
characterizable by finite matrices can be characterized by suitable
combinations of many-valued logics. The idea of the decomposition is
quite natural: given a logic L{{\cal L}}, presented as a pair
L=⟨C,⊢L⟩{{\cal L}}=\langle C,\vdash_{{\cal L}}\rangle in which CC is a
signature and ⊢L\vdash_{{\cal L}} is a consequence relation, a
family of translations fi:L(C)→L(Ci)f_i:L(C) \to L(C_i) (for i∈Ii\in I) is
taken into consideration. Here, L(C)L(C) and L(Ci)L(C_i) denote the
algebra of formulas defined by the signature CC and CiC_i,
respectively. Recall that a translation from a logic L{{\cal L}}
into a logic L′{{\cal L}}' is a mapping ff between the respective
sets of formulas which preserve derivability, that is: Γ⊢Lφ\Gamma
\vdash_{{\cal L}}\varphi (in the source logic L{{\cal L}})
implies that f(Γ)⊢L′f(φ)f(\Gamma) \vdash_{{{\cal L}}'} f(\varphi) (in the
target logic L′{{\cal L}}').

A pair P=⟨{Li}i∈I,{fi}i∈I⟩P=\langle \{{{\cal L}}_i\}_{i\in I}, \{f_i\}_{i\in
I}\rangle as above is called a possible-translations frame
for L{{\cal L}}. We say that PP is a
possible-translations semantics for L{{\cal L}} if, for
every Γ∪{φ}⊆L(C)\Gamma\cup\{\varphi\}\subseteq L(C), 

Γ⊢Lφ  iff  fi(Γ)⊢Lifi(φ),  for every i∈I.\Gamma \vdash_{{\cal L}}\varphi \
\textrm{ iff } \ f_i(\Gamma) \vdash_{{{\cal L}}_i} f_i(\varphi), \
\textrm{ for every  } i \in I.

 This means
that checking derivability in L{{\cal L}} is equivalent to checking
derivability in every factor logic Li{{\cal L}}_i through the
translations. In many cases, the factor logics Li{{\cal L}}_i are
presented by finite matrices. Since the length of a formula is finite,
it is enough to test a finite number of translations in order to
determine if a formula of L{{\cal L}} is valid in L{{\cal L}}.
Thus, checking the validity of a formula of L{{\cal L}} is
equivalent to performing a finite number of finitary tests. This
decidability property is of real advantage when the original logic
L{{\cal L}} is not characterizable by finite matrices. For
instance, in Carnielli 2000 (see also Marcos 1999) the well-know
hierarchy {Cn}n∈N\{{{\cal C}}_n\}_{n\in{\mathbb{N}}} of paraconsistent
logics of N. da Costa, formed by logics which cannot be characterized
by finite matrices, is represented by means of a PTS whose
factors are presented through finite matrices; this grants a decision
procedure for each logic Cn{{\cal C}}_n.


In order to exemplify the concept of PTS as a splitting
methodology, consider the paraconsistent logic bC,
introduced in Carnielli and Marcos 2002. This logic is, in particular,
a logic of formal inconsistency, in the sense that there
exists a unary connective ∘\circ expressing the consistency of a
formula. Thus, from φ\varphi and ¬φ\neg\varphi does not follow,
in general, an arbitrary formula ψ\psi. However, {φ,¬φ,∘φ}\{\varphi,
\neg\varphi, \circ\varphi\} entails any formula ψ\psi. The
signature CC of bC consists of a paraconsistent
negation ¬\neg, a consistency operator ∘\circ, and classical
connectives ∧,∨,→\wedge,\vee,\to. It was proved in Carnielli et al.
2007 that bC, and many other logics of formal
inconsistency extending it, cannot be characterized by finite
matrices. Nonetheless, bC is decomposed into several
copies of a three-valued logic by means of possible-translations as
follows: consider the signature
C1={¬1,¬2,∘1,∘2,∘3,∧,∨,→}C_1=\{\neg_1,\neg_2,{\circ}_1,{\circ}_2, {\circ}_3,
\wedge,\vee,\to\} consisting of two negations, three consistency
operators, a conjunction, a disjunction and an implication. Let MM
be the matrix over C1C_1 with domain {T,t,F}\{T,t,F\} displayed below,
where {T,t}\{T,t\} is the set of designated values.

Let {fi}i∈I\{f_i\}_{i\in I} be the family of all the mappings f:L(C)→L(C1)f:L(C)\to
L(C_1) satisfying clauses (tr0)(tr0), (tr1)(tr1), (tr2)(tr2), (tr3)(tr3)
and (tr4)(tr4) below.

(tr0) f(p)=p  for p a propositional variable;f(p)= p \
\textrm{ for } p \textrm{ a propositional variable;} 
(tr1) f(¬φ)∈{¬1f(φ),¬2f(φ)}f(\neg\varphi)
\in \{\neg_1 f(\varphi), \neg_2 f(\varphi)\}; 
(tr2) f(φ#ψ)=(f(φ)#f(ψ)), for #∈{∧,∨,→}f(\varphi\#\psi)
= (f(\varphi)\#f(\psi)), \textrm{ for }
\# \in \{\land,\lor,\rightarrow\}; 
(tr3) f(∘φ)∈{∘1f(φ),∘2f(φ),∘3f(φ)}f({\circ}\varphi)
\in \{{\circ}_1 f(\varphi), {\circ}_2
f(\varphi), {\circ}_3 f(\varphi)\}; 
(tr4) if
f(¬φ)=¬2f(φ)f(\neg\varphi)=\neg_2 f(\varphi) then
f(∘φ)=∘1f(φ)f({\circ}\varphi)={\circ}_1 f(\varphi). 


The family of mappings {fi}i∈I\{f_i\}_{i\in I} can be shown to define a
PTS which characterizes bC in a decidable
way (see Carnielli et al. 2008). As an example, it can be easily
checked that φ∧¬φ→¬∘φ\varphi\wedge\neg\varphi\to\neg{\circ}\varphi is a
theorem of bC: just consider all its finitely many
translations and test that all of them are three-valued tautologies.
On the other hand, ¬(φ∧¬φ)→∘φ\neg(\varphi\wedge\neg\varphi)\to{\circ}\varphi
is not a theorem of bC, which can be promptly
verified by showing that at least one of its translations is not a
tautology using the three-valued tables above. For an alternative
PTS characterization of bC and related
logics see Marcos 2008.

This example shows that a non-truth functional connective, such as the
paraconsistent negation ¬\neg or the consistency operator ∘\circ
of bC, can be mimicked by interpreting it (via
translations) into different truth-functional connectives. This is the
idea behind A. Avron and I. Lev’s non-deterministic
matrices introduced in Avron and Lev 2001 (see also Avron and Lev
2005). This semantics generalizes logical matrices by considering
multivalued functions (rather than functions) interpreting the
connectives.

As a matter of fact, non-deterministic matrices can be simulated by
appropriate possible-translations semantics (see Carnielli and
Coniglio 2005). In particular, the familiar matrix semantics are a
particular case of possible-translations semantics, as well as the
historical examples of translations between logics found in the
literature. These facts evidence that possible-translations semantics
is a widely applicable conceptual tool for decomposing logics.
4.5 Temporalization, Parameterization and Institutions

Apart from the logical and philosophical import of combining logics,
there is a genuine interest in developing applications based on these
techniques. One of the main areas interested in the methods for
combining logics is software specification. Certain techniques for
combining logics were developed almost exclusively with the aim of
applying them to this area. In this section some of these methods will
be briefly mentioned: temporalization,
parameterization and institutions.

Temporalization was introduced in Finger and Gabbay 1992 (see also
Finger and Gabbay 1996), and generalized in Caleiro et al. 1999
towards the method called parameterization.

Parameterization, in rough terms, consists of replacing the atomic
part of a given logic L{{\cal L}} by another logic L′{{\cal L}}'.
Thus, the logic L{{\cal L}} is the parameterized logic;
the atomic part is the formal parameter and the logic
L′{{\cal L}}' is the parameter logic. Formally, a mixed
signature based on the signature of L{{\cal L}} is considered, to
which the formulas of L′{{\cal L}}' are added as constants. In the
particular case of temporalization, the parameter logic is a temporal
logic. In turn, it can be proven that parameterization is a particular
case of constrained fibring (recall
 subsection 4.3).

The method can be explained by means of a simple example taken from
Carnielli et al. 2008: consider a propositional modal logic L{{\cal
L}}, to be parameterized with first-order logic Lfol{{\cal L}}_{fol}
in order to describe the dynamics of data bases. The resulting logic
is defined in a language whose formulas are obtained by replacing
propositional constants in formulas of L{{\cal L}} by first-order
formulas. That is, modalities can be freely used, but quantifiers
cannot be applied to modal formulas (other propositional connectives
such as negation and implication are shared).

The semantic structures for the new logic are Kripke structures where
the valuation for propositional constants is replaced by a kind of
“zooming in” mapping (in the sense of Blackburn and de
Rijke 1997) associating a first-order semantic structure together with
a fixed assignment for individual variables to each state.

The deductive system for the new logic is formed by the rules of both
logics. The rules of L{{\cal L}} can be instantiated with formulas
of the parameterized language, but the rules of first-order logic can
only be applied to pure first-order formulas.

One important difference between parameterization (in particular,
temporalization) and constrained fibring is the degree of symmetry:
the parameterized language and inference rules are intrinsically
asymmetric, while this is not the case of constrained fibring.

Institutions were introduced by J. Goguen and R. Burstall (see Goguen
and Burstall 1984, 1992) as a kind of “abstract model
theory” for Computer Science, and are adequate for developing
concepts of specification languages such as structuring of
specifications and implementation.

The theory of institutions is mainly applicable to software
specification defined by multiple logical systems (see, for instance,
Diaconescu and Futatsugi 2002). Thus, under an abstract view of
software development, different components of the same program can be
specified using different formalism in an heterogeneous setting. This
is formalized by the use of institutions and morphisms between them
(see, for instance, Tarlecki 2000). A problem concerning institution
morphisms is that formulas involving connectives from different logics
being combined are not allowed. A solution to this problem was
proposed in Goguen and Burstall 1986 and Mossakowski 1996, by using
the so-called parchments and parchment
morphisms.
4.6 New perspectives on combining logics

Despite the fact that algebraic fibring is suitable for combining an
ample class of logic systems, some kinds of logics, namely
substructural logics such as linear logic, and logics equipped with a
nondeterministic semantics, lie outside the scope of this combination
method. Moreover, at the semantical level, algebraic fibring, by its
own nature, does not make possible to keep representatives of all the
models of the original logics (which leads to the collapsing
problem of fibring, see
 section 5).

With the aim of still enlarging the range of application of algebraic
fibring, so as to make it able to deal with substructural logics and
with logics endowed with nondeterministic semantics, as well as to
combine pointwise models of each logic, a formalism for representing
logics and their combinations based on the general notion of
multi-graphs (or, for short, m-graphs) was proposed by A. Sernadas and
his collaborators (see Sernadas et al. 2009a, 2009b). Multi-graphs are
graphs where the source of each edge is a finite sequence of nodes
(instead of a unique node). Concerning signatures, the nodes of the
m-graph are seen as sorts and the m-edges are seen as language
constructors. From the semantical viewpoint, nodes are truth-values
and m-edges are relations between truth-values. Finally, concerning
deductive systems, nodes are language expressions, and m-edges are
inference rules. The fibring of logics described by m-graphs (a.k.a.
graph-theoretic fibring) is defined by pointwise combining
models of each combined logic, in contrast to the usual notion of
semantic fibring in which entire classes of models are combined. This
allows one to avoid the collapsing problem (see the next section) in a
very natural way.

As an immediate application of this graph-theoretic setting, the
preservation of the finite-model property by graph-theoretic fibring
was proved in Coniglio et al. 2011. Since (under reasonable
conditions) the finite model property entails decidability, this
result is particularly useful.

Another application to the graph-theoretic account of logic is the
definition of an asymmetric combination technique called importing
logics (see Rasga et al. 2012). Temporalization, as well as its
generalization, modalization (see Fajardo and Finger 2003 and
Finger and Weiss 2002), are particular cases of importing logics.
Under this approach, the combined language is endowed with an explicit
constructor called importing connective which transforms
formulas of the imported logic into formulas of the importing logic.
This is the main difference between the technique of importing logics
and the related technique of parameterization (which also generalizes
temporalization, see
 subsection 4.5).
 Semantically, each model of the resulting logic obtained by the
method of importing logics is a pair composed of a model of the
importing logic and a model of the imported logic, plus the
interpretation of the importing connective. In Rasga et al. 2014 a new
formulation of algebraic fibring, called biporting, was
introduced, which turns out to be equivalent to the original one. From
this, it is possible to prove that some particular cases of importing,
like temporalization, modalization and globalization, are subsumed by
fibring.

A new mechanism for combining logics called meet combination of
logics was firstly presented in C. Sernadas et al. 2013 and
additionaly developed in Rasga et al. 2015 (Other Internet
Resources). This technique is based on the idea of melding or pairing
connectives (of the same arity) of two given logics being
combined. The melded connectives of the resulting logic inherit the
common properties enjoyed in both logics, instead of the union of
their properties, as it occurs in the case of the shared connectives
of constrained fibring. The idea of pairing connectives within a
single logic was already explored in Sernadas et al. 2011a and 2011b,
towards identifying common properties of any given pair of connectives
of the same arity.
5. Lack or excess of interaction: perplexities when combining logics

Up to this point, several techniques for composing logics have been
described and exemplified. Are these processes appropriate for
composing, without surprises, any pair of logics? In other words,
given a pair of logics (presented in a homogeneous way), are they
composable in a meaningful way? Does the composition make
philosophical sense? As pointed by Schurz 1991, it is conceivable that
some multimodal logics obtained as combination of modal logics by
adding arbitrarily chosen bridge principles could be meaningless.

From the technical point of view there is an important problem
concerning composition of logics known as collapsing problem,
firstly identified in Gabbay 1996b, and later formalized in del Cerro
and Herzig 1996. In the latter paper, it is shown that, by freely
combining classical propositional logic and intuitionistic
propositional logic at the semantical level (technically: by
constructing their unconstrained fibring in the category of
interpretation systems, recall
 subsection 4.3)
 the resulting logic collapses to classical logic. More precisely, the
resulting logic will consist of two twin copies of classical
propositional logic, having two negations, two implications and so on.
Clearly, the respective copies of each connectives will be proved to
be inter-derivable in the resulting logic: ¬1φ\neg_1 \varphi will be
equivalent to ¬2φ\neg_2\varphi, (φ→1ψ)(\varphi\to_1 \psi) will be
equivalent to (φ→2ψ)(\varphi\to_2 \psi) and so on. The collapse only
happens when considering the algebraic fibring at the semantical
level: in Caleiro and Ramos 2007 was shown that the collapse does not
occur when computing the algebraic fibring of the respective Hilbert
calculi.

Basically, the phenomenon arises because both implications collapse,
and then intuitionistic implication becomes classic. From the
semantical point of view, it happens that the models of the fibred
logic are Heyting algebras which are simultaneously Boolean algebras:
evidently the algebras collapse to the Boolean ones. From the point of
view of proof theory, the problem appears as a consequence of the
metaproperty called Deduction Metatheorem (DMT): let
→1\to_1 and →2\to_2 be the intuitionistic and the classical
implications, respectively. Then 

Γ,φ⊢ψ iff Γ⊢(φ→1ψ)Γ,φ⊢ψ iff Γ⊢(φ→2ψ)
\begin{array}{lll}
\Gamma,\varphi\vdash\psi  &amp; \textrm{ iff }&amp;  \Gamma\vdash(\varphi\to_1\psi)\\
\Gamma,\varphi\vdash\psi  &amp; \textrm{ iff }&amp;  \Gamma\vdash(\varphi\to_2\psi)\\
\end{array}


 Thus, the following
argument applies (see Gabbay 1996b): 

(φ→1ψ)⊢(φ→1ψ)(Axiom)(φ→1ψ),φ⊢ψ(DMT for →1)(φ→1ψ)⊢(φ→2ψ)(DMT for →2)\begin{array}{ll}
(\varphi\to_1\psi)\vdash(\varphi\to_1\psi) &amp;  \textrm{(Axiom)}\\
(\varphi\to_1\psi),\,\varphi\vdash\psi  &amp;  \textrm{(DMT for } \rightarrow_1) \\
(\varphi\to_1\psi)\vdash(\varphi\to_2\psi) &amp;  \textrm{(DMT for } \rightarrow_2) \\
\end{array}


 A similar argument
shows that (φ→2ψ)⊢(φ→1ψ)(\varphi\to_2\psi)\vdash(\varphi\to_1\psi). That is,
classical and intuitionistic implications collapse in the combined
logic.


It is worth noting that the previous arguments depart from a very
strong assumption: that the metaproperty DMT is preserved in the
combined logic. As we shall see below, this is not the case for
algebraic fibring, unless a stronger notion of morphism between logics
is adopted.

In C. Sernadas et al. 2002b other examples of collapse were presented,
and a solution to the problem was proposed by means of a controlled
notion of algebraic fibring called modulated fibring. An
apparently simpler solution to the collapsing problem appeared in
Caleiro and Ramos 2007, using a variant of the algebraic fibring
technique called cryptofibring. As mentioned in
 subsection 4.6,
 the graph-theoretic fibring leads to an additional solution to this
problem. Another solution to the collapsing problem was obtained by
means of the meet combination of logics (see
 subsection 4.6).
 Given that the combined connectives inherit the common properties
enjoyed in both logics, the interaction between the component logics
within the resulting logic is minimized, which allows to overcome the
collapsing problem.

Independently, in Beziau 2004 it was observed that by putting together
the sequent rules for classical conjunction and the rules for
classical disjunction, the resulting sequent calculus will
(unexpectedly) prove the distributivity between conjunction and
disjunction. The same phenomenon occurs if we join the (two-valued)
valuation clauses for classical conjunction with the valuation clauses
for classical disjunction. However, this is avoided by considering
algebraic fibring in the usual categories (Hilbert calculi or
consequence relations) with translations between logics as morphisms:
the logic obtained is the logic of lattices, which does not satisfy
distributivity (see Beziau and Coniglio 2005, 2011).

This situation, in which new interaction rules between the connectives
arise, is arguably undesirable. In fact, it contradicts a basic
criterion of fibring (and also of fusion), as expressed in Gabbay
1999: given logic systems L1{{\cal L}}_1 and L2{{\cal L}}_2, the
combination of L1{{\cal L}}_1 and L2{{\cal L}}_2 should be the
smallest logic system in the combined language which is a conservative
extension of both L1{{\cal L}}_1 and L2{{\cal L}}_2.

Indeed, the distributivity problem and the collapsing problem are two
instances of the same phenomenon of emergence of unexpected
interactions (such as bridge principles) between connectives caused by
combination processes. In the case of combination of conjunction with
disjunction, the distributive law emerges: this interaction is due to
the combination process and appears without any apparent reason. In
turn, the collapsing problem is a limit case of interactions: the
interderivability between classical and intuitionistic implication
(nothing else than two interaction laws between different connectives)
is also spontaneously created by the combination process.

It can be argued that the combined logics are excessively strong in
such cases, because they derive too many propositions in the new
combined language.

On the other hand, the opposite (or dual) situation may also be
problematic: suppose, to help intuition, that the logic of classical
negation is combined with the logic of classical disjunction. These
logics can be presented, for instance, axiomatically (through Hilbert
calculi) or semantically, say, through valuations over {0,1}\{0,1\}
(that is, by means of classical truth-tables). The semantical
presentation of the logic of classical negation consists of the set of
all valuations over {0,1}\{0,1\} satisfying the following clause:

v(¬φ)=0 iff v(φ)=1.v(\neg\varphi)=0 \textrm{ iff } v(\varphi)=1.

 On the other hand, the logic of classical disjunction can
be characterized by the set of all valuations over {0,1}\{0,1\} such
that: 

v(φ∨ψ)=0 iff v(φ)=0 and v(ψ)=0.v(\varphi \vee \psi)=0  \textrm{ iff } v(\varphi)=0 \textrm{ and  } v(\psi)=0.

As a consequence, the combined logic of negation and disjunction
(which can be defined as the logic over ¬\neg and ∨\vee
characterized by the valuations over {0,1}\{0,1\} satisfying both
clauses above) validates (φ∨¬φ)(\varphi \vee \neg \varphi), and so
classical logic is recovered. This is the result obtained by the
combination method called direct union of matrices,
introduced in Coniglio and Fernández 2005. However, if
algebraic fibring is considered in categories such as those of Hilbert
calculi or consequence relations, the combination between the logic of
negation and the logic of disjunction results in a logic defined over
¬\neg and ∨\vee which is weaker than classical logic: the
interaction law (φ∨¬φ)(\varphi \vee \neg \varphi) is no longer valid.
That is, an arguably desirable interaction between the connectives is
lost in the combination process, and classical logic expressed over
¬\neg and ∨\vee cannot be recovered from its fragments, as long
as algebraic fibring in these categories of logics is used.

Another example of the same kind is the following: the algebraic
fibring between the logic of classical negation ¬\neg and the logic
of classical implication →\to regarded in the categories above does
not recover classical logic expressed over ¬\neg and →\to.
Indeed, the resulting logic system, defined over ¬\neg and →\to,
cannot validate Ex Contradictione Sequitur Quodlibet when
presented as an axiom: 

⊬(φ→(¬φ→ψ)).\not\vdash(\varphi \to(\neg\varphi \to \psi)).

Interestingly enough, Ex Contradictione Sequitur Quodlibet,
presented as a derivation, holds in the fibred logic: 

φ,¬φ⊢ψ.\varphi, \neg\varphi \vdash \psi.

Observe that (φ→(¬φ→ψ))(\varphi \to(\neg\varphi \to \psi)) is an interaction
rule between the connectives of the logics being combined which cannot
be obtained by algebraic fibring in the categories under consideration
(however, this principle can be recovered, e.g., by direct union of
matrices). If one is interested in recovering a logic from its
fragments, this result is disappointing.

These examples, as well as other along the same lines, suggest a
problem dual to that of collapsing and distributivity between
conjunction and disjunction: some expected interaction laws fail to be
created by some combination processes.

In such cases, it could be said that the combined logics are too weak
because they are unable to derive certain intended propositions in the
new combined language.

What could be expected when combining logics? Strong logics
(guaranteeing, for instance, that a logic can be recovered from its
fragments) or weaker ones (in which undesirable interactions between
connectives are blocked)?

The examples above are evidence against and in favor of both
situations: in order to avoid the collapsing problem, a careful
splicing process should be expected (and so the interaction between
both implications would disappear). On the other hand, if one wants to
recover, say, classical logics from its fragments, a more liberal
splicing process would be more appropriate as some intended
interactions between connectives of both logics would be
recovered.

With respect to the distributivity problem when combining conjunction
and disjunction, the choice of method is also not determined:
distributivity could be a desired feature if we adopted the viewpoint
of recovering a logic from its fragments. In this case, a combination
method defining a stronger logic (such as the direct union of
matrices) would be more appropriate than, for instance, algebraic
fibring of Hilbert calculi. But if, as argued in Beziau 2004,
distributivity is regarded as an intruder, then a more cautious
process would be recommended: algebraic fibring of Hilbert calculi
would be more appropriate in this case. To sum up: the choice of the
most adequate combining process depends upon what one wants to
obtain.

At this point, it is convenient to notice that the question about
whether or not interactive principles are generated when combining
modal logics, is intrinsically related to Hume’s ‘is-ought
problem’ discussed in
 section 1.
 Indeed, as proven in Schurz 1991, it is possible to obtain nontrivial
‘is-ought’ deductions in the combination of alethic and
deontic logics provided that some bridge principles are allowed. The
validity of bridge principles as ◯φ→◊φ\obcirc \varphi \rightarrow
\lozenge \varphi is nothing else than interaction rules between
connectives of the logics being combined. Such principles enjoy a
similar conceptual status as the distributivity laws between
conjunction and disjunction, or as the collapsing example mentioned
above. Thus, in order to satisfy Hume’s thesis, a combination
process generating logics without interactions should be preferred. On
the other hand, a combination process allowing the creation of
interactions between the connectives could grant bridge principles
violating Hume’s thesis.

Finally, it is noteworthy to observe that algebraic fibring does not
intrinsically forbid the emergence of interactions between connectives
of the logics being combined. In fact, the notion of morphism in the
category of logic systems being employed is the key to creating or
blocking interactions. In order to exemplify this assertion, consider
the case of the failure to recover classical logic from its
{¬}\{\neg\}-fragment and {∨}\{\vee\}-fragment by algebraic fibring.
The key reason for this failure is that the rule 

Γ,φ⊢ψΔ,¬φ⊢ψΓ,Δ⊢ψ
\tag{* }
\frac{\Gamma, \varphi\vdash \psi \;\quad\; \Delta, \neg\varphi\vdash \psi}
{\Gamma, \Delta\vdash \psi}


 of the
logic of classical negation is not preserved by algebraic fibring in
categories of logic systems having translations between logics as
morphisms (recall
 subsection 4.4),
 such as the category of Hilbert calculi or consequence relations.


When considering algebraic fibring of classical implication with
classical negation in those categories, the missing rule is the
Deduction Metatheorem: 

Γ,φ⊢ψΓ⊢(φ→ψ).\tag{**} \frac{\Gamma,\varphi\vdash\psi}
{\Gamma\vdash(\varphi\to\psi)}.

Categories of logic systems having logic translations as morphisms are
such that the canonical injections of the coproduct are just inclusion
mappings. Then, given two logics L1{{\cal L}}_1 and L2{{\cal
L}}_2, the only rules of these logics which are preserved by
algebraic fibring are those of the form: 

Γ⊢φ.\Gamma \vdash \varphi.

On the other hand, suppose that we are dealing with a category of
logic systems in which the preservation of rules such as (∗)(*) or
(∗∗)(**) above is required by the very notion of morphism. Thus, if a
logic L{{\cal L}} is obtained as a combination of two other systems
L1{{\cal L}}_1 and L2{{\cal L}}_2 then the rules of L1{{\cal
L}}_1 and L2{{\cal L}}_2 would be faithfully transferred to
L{{\cal L}}. This is the proposal of Coniglio 2007, in which
algebraic fibring in categories of sequent calculi is investigated,
taking into account a notion of morphism which preserves logical rules
of the form 

If Γ1⊢φ1 and  …  and Γn⊢φn then Γ⊢φ.
\textit{If  }\;\; \Gamma_1\vdash\varphi_1 \;\;\textit{ and  …  and  }\;\; \Gamma_n\vdash\varphi_n \;\;\textit{  then }\;\;
\Gamma\vdash\varphi.


In such categories, when a logic system is embedded into a larger one
by algebraic fibring, any rule as above, which can be considered as a
meta-theorem of the logic, is preserved by the canonical injections.
This is why this process is called meta-fibring. From the
categorial point of view, the process is the same as for algebraic
fibring, the only difference being that the notion of morphism is
stronger.

In Coniglio and Figallo 2015, Coniglio and Figallo extended the idea
of meta-fibring (that is, algebraic fibring of formal sequent calculi)
to hypersequents, which allows preserving even stronger
meta-properties of the logics being combined. Hypersequents, which are
finite multisets of ordinary sequents, constitute a natural
generalization of the proof-method of sequents and turn out to be a
suitable tool for presenting cut-free Gentzen-type formulations for
several non-classical logics.

These examples illustrate the advantages of using category theory and
their tools for defining combination procedures as universal
constructions: the same construction (in this case, algebraic fibring)
can be performed in categories of logic systems with different
features obtaining, as a consequence of this, stronger or weaker logic
systems.
