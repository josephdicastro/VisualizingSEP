<h1>Epistemology</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Wed Dec 14, 2005</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>

Defined narrowly, epistemology is the study of knowledge and
justified belief. As the study of knowledge, epistemology is concerned
with the following questions: What are the necessary and sufficient
conditions of knowledge? What are its sources? What is its structure,
and what are its limits? As the study of justified belief, epistemology
aims to answer questions such as: How we are to understand the concept
of justification? What makes justified beliefs justified? Is
justification internal or external to one's own mind? Understood more
broadly, epistemology is about issues having to do with the
creation and dissemination of knowledge in particular areas of inquiry.
This article will provide a systematic overview of the problems that
the questions above raise and focus in some depth on issues relating to
the structure and the limits of knowledge and justification.</p>

<h2><a name="WIK">1. What is Knowledge?</a></h2>

<h3><a name="JTB">1.1 Knowledge as Justified True Belief</a></h3>

<p>

There are various kinds of knowledge: knowing how to do something
(for example, how to ride a bicycle), knowing someone in person, and
knowing a place or a city. Although such knowledge is of
epistemological interest as well, we shall focus on knowledge of
<em>propositions</em> and refer to such knowledge using the schema
‘<em>S</em> knows that <em>p</em>’, where
‘<em>S</em>’ stands for the subject who has knowledge and
‘<em>p</em>’ for the proposition that is
 known.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#1" name="note-1">1</a>]</sup>
 Our question
will be: What are the necessary and sufficient conditions for
<em>S</em> to know that <em>p</em>? We may distinguish, broadly,
between a traditional and a non-traditional approach to answering this
question. We shall refer to them as ‘TK’ and
‘NTK’.</p>

<p>

According to TK, knowledge that <em>p</em> is, at least
approximately, justified true belief (JTB). False propositions cannot
be known. Therefore, knowledge requires truth. A proposition <em>S</em>
doesn't even believe can't be a proposition that <em>S</em> knows.
Therefore, knowledge requires belief. Finally, <em>S</em>'s being
correct in believing that <em>p</em> might merely be a matter of
 luck.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#2" name="note-2">2</a>]</sup>
 Therefore, knowledge requires a third
element, traditionally identified as justification. Thus we arrive at a
tripartite analysis of knowledge as JTB: <em>S</em> knows that
<em>p</em> if and only if <em>p</em> is true and <em>S</em> is
justified in believing that <em>p</em>. According to this analysis, the
three conditions — truth, belief, and justification — are
individually necessary and jointly sufficient for
 knowledge.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#3" name="note-3">3</a>]</sup></p>

<p>

Initially, we may say that the role of justification is to ensure
that <em>S</em>'s belief is not true merely because of luck. On that,
TK and NTK are in agreement. They diverge, however, as soon as we
proceed to be more specific about exactly how justification is to
fulfill this role. According to TK, <em>S</em>'s belief that <em>p</em>
is true not merely because of luck when it is reasonable or rational,
from <em>S</em>'s own point of view, to take <em>p</em> to be true.
According to <em>evidentialism</em>, what makes a belief justified in
this sense is the possession of evidence. The basic idea is that a
belief is justified to the degree it fits <em>S</em>'s evidence. NTK,
on the other hand, conceives of the role of justification differently.
Its job is to ensure that <em>S</em>'s belief has a high objective
probability of truth and therefore, if true, is not true merely because
of luck. One prominent idea is that this is accomplished if, and only
if, a belief originates in reliable cognitive processes or faculties.
This view is known as
 <em>reliabilism</em>.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#4" name="note-4">4</a>]</sup></p>

<h3><a name="GET">1.2 The Gettier Problem</a></h3>

<p>

The tripartite analysis of knowledge as JTB has been shown to be
incomplete. There are cases of JTB that do not qualify as cases of
knowledge. JTB, therefore, is not <em>sufficient</em> for knowledge.
Cases like that — known as
 <em>Gettier-cases</em><sup>[<a href="notes.html#5" name="note-5">5</a>]</sup>
 —
arise because neither the possession of evidence nor origination in
reliable faculties is sufficient for ensuring that a belief is not true
merely because of luck. Consider the well-known case of barn-facades:
Henry drives through a rural area in which what appear to be barns are,
with the exception of just one, mere barn facades. From the road Henry
is driving on, these facades look exactly like real barns. Henry
happens to be looking at the one and only real barn in the area and
believes that there's a barn over there. Henry's belief is justified,
according to TK, because Henry's visual experience justifies his
belief. According to NTK, his belief is justified because Henry's
belief originates in a reliable cognitive process: vision. Yet Henry's
belief is plausibly viewed as being true merely because of luck. Had
Henry noticed one of the barn-facades instead, he would also have
believed that there's a barn over there. There is, therefore, broad
agreement among epistemologists that Henry's belief does not qualify as
 knowledge.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#6" name="note-6">6</a>]</sup></p>

<p>

To state conditions that are jointly sufficient for knowledge, what
further element must be added to JTB? This is known as the <em>Gettier
problem</em>. According to TK, solving the problem requires a fourth
condition. According to some NTK theorists, it calls for refining the
concept of reliability. For example, if reliability could suitably be
indexed to the subject's environment, reliabilists could say that
Henry's belief is not justified because in his environment, vision is
not reliable when it comes to discerning barns from
 barn-facades.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#7" name="note-7">7</a>]</sup></p>

<p>

Some NTK theorists bypass the justification condition altogether.
They would say that, if we conceive of knowledge as reliably produced
true belief, there is no need for justification. Reliabilism, then,
comes in two forms: as a theory of justification or as a theory of
knowledge. As the former, it views justification to be an important
ingredient of knowledge but, unlike TK, grounds justification solely in
reliability. As a theory of knowledge, reliabilism asserts that
justification is not necessary for knowledge; rather, reliably produced
true belief (provided the notion of reliability is suitably refined to
rule out Gettier cases) is sufficient for
 it.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#8" name="note-8">8</a>]</sup></p>

<h2><a name="WIJ">2. What is Justification?</a></h2>

<p>

When we discuss the nature of justification, we must distinguish
between two different issues: First, what do we <em>mean</em> when we
use the word ‘justification’? Second, what <em>makes</em>
beliefs justified? It is important to keep these issues apart because a
disagreement on how to answer the second question will be a mere verbal
dispute, if the disagreeing parties have different concepts of
justification in mind. So let us first consider what we might mean by
‘justification’ and then move on to the non-definitional
 issues.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#9" name="note-9">9</a>]</sup></p>

<h3><a name="DND">2.1 Deontological and Non-Deontological Justification</a></h3>

<p>

How is the term ‘justification’ used in ordinary
language? Here is an example: Tom asked Martha a question, and Martha
responded with a lie. Was she justified in lying? Jane thinks she was,
for Tom's question was an inappropriate one, the answer to which was
none of Tom's business. What might Jane mean when she thinks that
Martha was justified in responding with a lie? A natural answer is
this: She means that Martha was <em>under no obligation</em> to refrain
from lying. Due the inappropriateness of Tom's question, it wasn't
Martha's <em>duty</em> to tell the truth. This understanding of
justification, commonly labeled <em>deontological</em>, may be defined
as follows: <em>S</em> is justified in doing <em>x</em> if and only if
<em>S</em> is not obliged to refrain from doing
 <em>x</em>.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#10" name="note-10">10</a>]</sup></p>

<p>

Suppose, when we apply the word justification not to actions but
to beliefs, we mean something analogous. In that case, the term
‘justification’ as used in epistemology would have to be
defined this way:</p>

<blockquote><strong>Deontological Justification (DJ)</strong>
<br />
 <em>S</em> is justified in believing that <em>p</em> if and only if
<em>S</em> believes that <i>p</i> while it is not the case that <i>S</i> is obliged
to refrain from believing that
 <em>p</em>.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#11" name="note-11">11</a>]</sup></blockquote>

<p>

What kind of obligations are relevant when we wish to assess whether a
<em>belief</em>, rather than an action, is justified or unjustified?
Whereas when we evaluate an action, we are interested in assessing the
action from either a moral or a prudential point of view, when it comes
to beliefs, what matters is the pursuit of <em>truth</em>. The
relevant kinds of obligations, then, are those that arise when we aim
at having true beliefs. Exactly what, though, must we do in the
pursuit of this aim? According to one answer, the one favored by
evidentialists, we ought to believe in accord with our evidence. For
this answer to be helpful, we need an account of what our evidence
consists of. According to another answer, we ought to follow the
correct epistemic norms. If this answer is going to help us figure out
what obligations the truth-aim imposes on us, we need to be given an
account of what the correct epistemic norms
 are.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#12" name="note-12">12</a>]</sup></p>

<p>

The deontological understanding of the concept of justification is
common to the way philosophers such as Descartes, Locke, Moore and
Chisholm have thought about justification. Today, however, the dominant
view is that the deontological understanding of justification is
unsuitable for the purposes of epistemology. Two chief objections have
been raised against conceiving of justification deontologically. First,
it has been argued that DJ presupposes that we can have a sufficiently
high degree of control over our beliefs. But beliefs are akin not to
actions but rather things such as digestive processes, sneezes, or
involuntary blinkings of the eye. The idea is that beliefs simply arise
in or happen to us. Therefore, beliefs are not suitable for
deontological
 evaluation.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#13" name="note-13">13</a>]</sup>
 To this objection, some advocates of DJ
have replied that lack of control over our beliefs is no obstacle to
using the term ‘justification’ in its deontological
 sense.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#14" name="note-14">14</a>]</sup>
 Others have argued that it's a mistake to
think that we can control our beliefs any less than our
 actions.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#15" name="note-15">15</a>]</sup></p>

<p>

According to the second objection to DJ, deontological justification
does not tend to ‘epistemize’ true beliefs: it does not tend
to make them non-accidentally true. This claim is typically supported
by describing cases involving either a benighted, culturally isolated
society or subjects who are cognitively deficient. Such cases involve
beliefs that are claimed to be epistemically defective even though it
would not seem that the subjects in these cases are under any
obligation to refrain from believing as they do. What makes the beliefs
in question epistemically defective is that they are formed using
unreliable and intellectually faulty methods. The reason why the
subjects, from their own point of view, are not obliged to believe
otherwise is that they are either cognitively deficient or live in a
benighted and isolated community. DJ says that such beliefs are
justified. If they meet the remaining necessary conditions,
DJ-theorists would have to count them as knowledge. According to the
objection, however, the beliefs in question, even if true, could not
possibly qualify as knowledge, due to the epistemically defective way
they were formed. Consequently, DJ must be
 rejected.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#16" name="note-16">16</a>]</sup></p>

<p>

Those who reject DJ use the term ‘justification’ in a
technical sense that deviates from how the word is ordinarily used. The
technical sense is meant to make the term suitable for the needs of
 epistemology.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#17" name="note-17">17</a>]</sup>
 But how are we then to conceive of
justification? What does it mean for a belief to be justified in a
non-deontological sense? Recall that the role assigned to justification
is that of ensuring that a true belief isn't true merely by accident.
Let us say that this is accomplished when a true belief instantiates
the property of <em>proper probabilification</em>. We may, then, define
non-deontological justification as follows:</p>

<blockquote><strong>Non-Deontological Justification (NDJ)</strong>
<br />
 <em>S</em> is justified in believing that <em>p</em> if and only if
<em>S</em> believes that <i>p</i> on a basis that properly probabilifies
<em>S</em>'s belief that <em>p</em>.</blockquote>

<p>

If we wish to pin down exactly what probabilification amounts to, we
will have to deal with a variety of tricky
 issues.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#18" name="note-18">18</a>]</sup>
 For now, let us just
focus on the main point. Those who prefer NDJ to DJ would say that
probabilification and deontological justification can diverge: it's
possible for a belief to be deontologically justified without being
properly probabilified. This is just what cases involving benighted
cultures or cognitively deficient subjects are supposed to
 show.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#19" name="note-19">19</a>]</sup></p>

<h3><a name="EVR">2.2 Evidence vs. Reliability</a></h3>

<p>

What <em>makes</em> justified beliefs justified? According to
evidentialists, it is the possession of evidence. What is it, though,
to possess evidence for believing that <em>p</em>? Some evidentialists
would say it is to be in a mental state that represents <em>p</em> as
being true. For example, if the coffee in your cup tastes sweet to you,
then you have evidence for believing that the coffee is sweet. If you
feel a throbbing pain in your head, you have evidence for believing
that you have a headache. If you have a memory of having had cereal for
breakfast, then you have evidence for a belief about the past: a belief
about what you ate when you had breakfast. And when you clearly "see"
or "intuit" that the proposition "If Jack had more than four cups of
coffee, then Jack had more than three cups of coffee" is true, then you
have evidence for believing that proposition. In this view, evidence
consists of perceptual, introspective, memorial, and intuitional
experiences, and to possess evidence is to have an experience of that
kind. So according to this evidentialism, what makes you justified in
believing that <em>p</em> is your having an experience that represents
<em>p</em> as being true.</p>

<p>

Many reliabilists, too, would say that the experiences mentioned in
the previous paragraph matter. However, they would deny that
justification is solely a matter of having suitable experiences.
Rather, they hold that a belief is justified if, and only if, it
results from cognitive origin that is reliable: an origin that tends to
produce true beliefs and therefore properly probabilifies the belief.
Reliabilists, then, would agree that the beliefs mentioned in the
previous paragraph are justified. But according to a standard form of
reliabilism, what makes them justified is not the possession of
evidence, but the fact that the types of processes in which they
originate — perception, introspection, memory, and rational
intuition — are reliable.</p>

<h3><a name="IVE">2.3 Internal vs. External</a></h3>

<p>

In contemporary epistemology, there has been an extensive debate on
whether justification is internal or external. Internalists claim that
it is internal; externalists deny it. How are we to understand these
claims?</p>

<p>

To understand what the internal-external distinction amounts to, we
need to bear in mind that, when a belief is justified, there is
something that <em>makes</em> it justified. Likewise, if a belief is
unjustified, there is something that <em>makes</em> it unjustified.
Let's call the things that make a belief justified or unjustified
J-factors. The dispute over whether justification is internal or
external is a dispute about what the J-factors are.</p>

<p>

Among those who think that justification is internal, there is no
unanimity on how to understand the concept of internality. We can
distinguish between two approaches. According to the first,
justification is internal because we enjoy a special kind of access to
J-factors: they are <em>always</em> recognizable on
 reflection.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#20" name="note-20">20</a>]</sup>
 Hence,
assuming certain further premises (which will be mentioned
momentarily), justification itself is always recognizable on
 reflection.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#21" name="note-21">21</a>]</sup>
 According to the second approach,
justification is internal because J-factors are always mental
 states.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#22" name="note-22">22</a>]</sup>
 Let's call the former <em>accessibility
internalism</em> and the latter <em>mentalist internalism</em>.
Externalists deny that J-factors meet either one of these
conditions.</p>

<p>

Evidentialism is typically associated with internalism, and
reliabilism with
 externalism.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#23" name="note-23">23</a>]</sup>
 Let us see why. Evidentialism says, at a
minimum, two things:</p>

<blockquote>
<table>
 <tbody><tr>
<td valign="top">E1  </td> 
<td>Whether one is justified in believing <em>p</em> depends
on one's evidence regarding <em>p</em>.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td valign="top">E2  </td>
<td>One's evidence consists of one's mental states.</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</blockquote>

<p>

By virtue of E2, evidentialism is obviously an instance of mentalist
internalism.</p>

<p>

Whether evidentialism is also an instance of accessibility
internalism is a more complicated issue. The conjunction of E1 and E2
by itself implies nothing about the recognizability of justification.
Recall, however, that in Section 1.1 we distinguished between TK and
NTK: the traditional and the nontraditional approach to the analysis of
knowledge and justification. TK advocates, among which evidentialism
enjoys widespread sympathy, tend to endorse the following two
claims:</p>

<blockquote><strong>Luminosity</strong>
<br />
 One's own mind is cognitively luminous: Relying on introspection, one
can always recognize on reflection what mental states one is
 in.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#24" name="note-24">24</a>]</sup>
 
<p>

<strong>Necessity</strong>
<br />
 <em>a priori</em> recognizable, necessary principles say what is
evidence for
 what.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#25" name="note-25">25</a>]</sup>
 Relying on <em>a priori</em> insight, one
can therefore always recognize on reflection whether one's mental
states are evidence for
 <em>p</em>.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#26" name="note-26">26</a>]</sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>

Although E1 and E2 by themselves do not imply access internalism, it
is quite plausible to maintain that evidentialism, when embellished
with Luminosity and Necessity, becomes an instance of access
 internalism.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#27" name="note-27">27</a>]</sup></p>

<p>

Next, let us consider why reliabilism is an externalist theory.
Reliabilism says that the justification of one's beliefs is a function
of, not one's evidence, but the reliability of one's belief sources
such as memorial, perceptual and introspective states and processes.
Whereas the sources might qualify as mental, their reliability does
not. Therefore, reliabilists reject mentalist internalism. Moreover, if
the justification of one's beliefs is determined by the reliability of
one's belief sources, justification will not always be recognizable on
reflection. Hence reliabilists reject access internalism as
 well.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#28" name="note-28">28</a>]</sup></p>

<p>

Let's use an example of radical deception to illustrate the
difference between evidentialism as an internalist theory and
reliabilism as an externalist theory. If evidentialism is true, a
subject who is radically deceived will be mislead about what is
actually the case, but not about what he is justified in believing. If,
on the other hand, reliabilism is true, then such a subject will be
misled about both what is actually the case and what he is justified in
believing. Let us see why.</p>

<p>

Distinguish between Tim and Tim*: one and the same person whom we
imagine in two altogether different situations. Tim's situation is
normal, like yours or mine. Tim*, however, is a brain in a vat. Suppose
a mad scientist abducted and "envatted" Tim* by removing his brain from
his skull and putting it in a vat in which his brain is kept alive.
Next, the mad scientist connects the nerve endings of Tim*'s brain with
wires to a machine that, controlled by a powerful computer, starts
stimulating Tim*'s brain in such a way that Tim* does not notice what
actually happened to him. He is going to have perfectly ordinary
experiences, just like Tim. Indeed, let's assume that the mental states
of Tim and the mental states of Tim* are alike. But, since Tim* is a
brain in a vat, he is, unlike Tim, radically deceived about his actual
situation. For example, when Tim believes he has hands, he is right.
When Tim* believes he has hands, he is mistaken. (His hands were
discarded, along with the rest of his limbs and torso.) When Tim
believes he is drinking coffee, he is right. When Tim* believes he is
drinking coffee, he is mistaken. (Brains don't drink coffee.) Now
suppose Tim* asks himself whether he is justified in believing that he
has hands. Since Tim* is just like Tim, Tim* will say that his belief
is justified, just as Tim would if he were to ask himself whether he is
justified in believing that he has hands. Evidentialism implies that
Tim*'s answer is correct. For even though he is deceived about his
external situation, he is not deceived about his evidence: the way
things appear to him in his experiences. This illustrates the
internality of evidentialist justification. Reliabilism, on the other
hand, suggests that Tim*'s answer is incorrect. Tim*'s belief that he
has hands originates in cognitive processes — "seeing" and
"feeling" his (nonexisting) hands — that now yield virtually no
true beliefs. To the extent that this implies their unreliability, the
resulting beliefs are unjustified. Consequently, he is deceived not
only about his external situation (his not having hands), but also
about the justificational status of his belief that he has hands. This
illustrates the externality of reliabilist justification.</p>

<p>

The example of Tim and Tim* may serve as well to illustrate a
further way in which we may conceive of the difference between
internalism and externalism. Some internalists take the following
principle to be characteristic of the internalist point of view:</p>

<blockquote><strong>Mentalism</strong>
<br />
 If two subjects, <em>S</em> and <em>S</em>*, are alike mentally, then
the justificational status of their beliefs is alike as well: the same
beliefs are justified or unjustified for them to the same
 extent.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#29" name="note-29">29</a>]</sup>
 </blockquote>

<p>

When we apply this principle to the Tim/Tim* example, it tells us
that evidentialism is an internalist and reliabilism an externalist
theory. Even though there are significant physical differences between
Tim and Tim*, mentally they are alike. Evidentialism implies that,
since Tim and Tim* are mentally alike, they have the same evidence, and
thus are justificationally alike as well. For example, they are both
justified in believing that they have hands. This makes evidentialism
an internalist theory. Reliabilism, on the other hand, allows that,
even though Tim and Tim* are mentally alike, they differ
justificationally, since Tim's beliefs are (by and large) produced by
reliable cognitive faculties, whereas the faculties that produce Tim*'s
beliefs may count as unreliable. For example, some versions of
reliabilism imply that Tim is justified in believing that he has hands,
whereas Tim* is not. This makes reliabilism an externalist
 theory.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#30" name="note-30">30</a>]</sup></p>

<h3><a name="WIN">2.4 Why Internalism?</a></h3>

<p>

Why think that justification is internal? One argument for the
internality of justification goes as follows: "Justification is
deontological: it is a matter of duty-fulfillment. But duty-fulfillment
is internal. Therefore, justification is internal." Another argument
appeals to the brain-in-the-vat scenario we considered above: "Tim*'s
belief that he has hands is justified in the way that Tim's is
justifed. Tim* is internally the same as Tim and externally quite
different. Therefore, internal factors are what justify beliefs."
Finally, since justification resulting from the possession of evidence
is internal justification, internalism can be supported by way of
making a case for evidentialism. What, then, can be said in support of
evidentialism? Evidentialists would appeal to cases in which a belief
is reliably formed but not accompanied by any experiences that would
qualify as evidence. They would say that it's not plausible to claim
that, in cases like that, the subject's belief is justified. Hence such
cases show, according to evidentialists, that a belief can't be
justified unless it's supported by
 evidence.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#31" name="note-31">31</a>]</sup></p>

<h3><a name="WEX">2.5 Why Externalism?</a></h3>

<p>

Why think that justification is external? To begin with,
externalists about justification would point to the fact that animals
and small children have knowledge and thus have justified beliefs. But
their beliefs can't be justified in the way evidentialists conceive of
justification. Therefore, we must conclude that the justification their
beliefs enjoy is external: resulting not from the possession of
evidence but from origination in reliable processes. And second,
externalists would say that what we want from justification is the kind
of objective probability needed for knowledge, and only external
conditions on justification imply this probability. So justification
has external
 conditions.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#32" name="note-32">32</a>]</sup></p>

<h2><a name="STR">3. The Structure of Knowledge and Justification</a></h2>

<p>

The debate over the structure of knowledge and justification is
primarily one among those who hold that knowledge requires
justification. From this point of view, the structure of knowledge
derives from the structure of justification. We will, therefore, focus
on the latter. </p>

<h3><a name="FOU">3.1 Foundationalism</a></h3>

<p>

According to foundationalism, our justified beliefs are structured like
a building: they are divided into a foundation and a superstructure,
the latter resting upon the former. Beliefs belonging to the foundation
are <em>basic</em>. Beliefs belonging to the superstructure are
<em>nonbasic</em> and receive justification from the justified beliefs
in the
 foundation.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#33" name="note-33">33</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>

For a foundationalist account of justification to be plausible, it
must solve two problems. First, by virtue of exactly what are basic
beliefs justified? Second, how do basic beliefs justify nonbasic
beliefs? Before we address these questions, let us first consider the
question of what it is that makes a justified belief basic in the first
place. Once we have done that, we can then move on to discuss by virtue
of what a basic belief might be justified, and how such a belief might
justify a nonbasic belief.</p>

<p>

According to one approach, what makes a justified belief basic is
that it doesn't receive its justification from any other beliefs. The
following definition captures this thought:</p>

<blockquote><strong>Doxastic Basicality (DB)</strong>
<br />
 <em>S</em>'s justified belief that <em>p</em> is basic if and only if
<em>S</em>'s belief that <em>p</em> is justified without owing its
justification to any of <em>S</em>'s other beliefs.</blockquote>

<p>

Let's consider what would, according to DB, qualify as an example of
a basic belief. Suppose you notice (for whatever reason) someone's hat,
and you also notice that that hat looks blue to you. So you believe</p>

<blockquote>(B) It appears to me that that hat is blue.</blockquote>

<p>

Unless something very strange is going on, (B) is an example of a
justified belief. DB tells us that (B) is basic if and only if it does
not owe its justification to any other beliefs of yours. So if (B) is
indeed basic, there might be some item or other to which (B) owes its
justification, but that item would not be another belief of yours. We
call this kind of basicality ‘doxastic’ because it makes
basicality a function of how your doxastic system (your belief system)
is structured.</p>

<p>

Let us turn to the question of where the justification that attaches
to (B) might come from, if we think of basicality as defined by DB.
Note that DB merely tells us how (B) is <em>not</em> justified. It says
nothing about <em>how</em> (B) is justified. DB, therefore, does not
answer that question. What we need, in addition to DB, is an account of
<em>what it is</em> that justifies a belief such as (B). According to
one strand of foundationalist thought, (B) is justified because it
can't be false, doubted, or corrected by others. So (B) is justified
because (B) carries with it an <em>epistemic privilege</em> such as
infallibility, indubitability, or
 incorrigibility.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#34" name="note-34">34</a>]</sup>
 The idea is that (B)
is justified by virtue of its intrinsic nature, which makes it possess
some kind of an epistemic privilege.</p>

<p>

Note that (B) is not a belief about the hat. Rather, it's a belief
about how the hat <em>appears</em> to you. So (B) is an introspective
belief about a perceptual experience of yours. According to the thought
we are considering here, a subject's basic beliefs are made up of
introspective beliefs about the subject's own mental states, of which
perceptual experiences make up one subset. Other mental states about
which a subject can have basic beliefs include such things as having a
headache, being tired, feeling pleasure, or having a desire for a cup
of coffee. Beliefs about external objects do not and indeed cannot
qualify as basic, for it is impossible for such beliefs to own the kind
of epistemic privilege needed for the status of being basic.</p>

<p>

According to a different version of foundationalism, (B) is
justified not by virtue of possessing some kind of privileged status,
but by some further mental state of yours. That mental state, however,
is not a further <em>belief</em> of yours. Rather, it is the very
<em>perceptual experience</em> that (B) is about: the hat's looking
blue to you. Let ‘(E)’ represent that experience. According
to this alternative proposal, (B) and (E) are distinct mental states.
The idea is that what justifies (B) is (E). Since (E) is an experience,
not a belief of yours, (B) is, according to DB, basic.</p>

<p>

Let's call the two versions of foundationalism we have distinguished
<em>privilege foundationalism</em> and <em>experiential
foundationalism</em>. Privilege foundationalism restricts basic beliefs
to beliefs about one's own mental states. Experiential foundationalism
is less restrictive. According to it, beliefs about external objects
can be basic as well. Suppose instead of (B), you believe</p>

<blockquote>(H) That hat is blue.</blockquote>

<p>

Unlike (B), (H) is about the hat itself, and not the way the hat
appears to you. Such a belief is not one about which we are infallible
or otherwise epistemically privileged. Privilege foundationalism would,
therefore, classify (H) as nonbasic. It is, however, quite plausible to
think that (E) justifies not only (B) but (H) as well. If (E) is indeed
what justifies (H), and (H) does not receive any additional
justification from any further beliefs of yours, then (H) qualifies,
according to DB, as basic.</p>

<p>

Experiential Foundationalism, then, combines to two crucial ideas:
(i) when a justified belief is basic, its justification is not owed to
any other belief; (ii) what in fact justifies basic beliefs are
experiences.</p>

<p>

Under ordinary circumstances, perceptual beliefs such as (H) are not
based on any <em>further beliefs</em> about one's own perceptual
experiences. It is unclear, therefore, how privilege foundationalism
can account for the justification of ordinary perceptual beliefs like
(H). Experiential foundationalism, on the other hand, has no trouble at
all explaining how ordinary perceptual beliefs are justified: they are
justified by the perceptual experiences that give rise to them. This
could be viewed as a reason for preferring experiential foundationalism
to privilege foundationalism.</p>

<p>

Above, we noted that how to think of basicality is not
uncontroversial. DB defines just one kind of basicality. Here's an
alternative conception of it:</p>

<blockquote><strong>Epistemic Basicality (EB)</strong>
<br />
 <em>S</em>'s justified belief that <em>p</em> is basic if and only if
<em>S</em>'s justification for believing that <em>p</em> does not
depend on any justification <em>S</em> possesses for believing a
further proposition,
 <em>q</em>.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#35" name="note-35">35</a>]</sup></blockquote>

<p>

EB makes it more difficult for a belief to be basic than DB does. To
see why, we turn to the chief question (let's call it the
‘J-question’) that advocates of experiential
foundationalism face:</p>

<blockquote><strong>The J-Question</strong>
<br />
Why are perceptual experiences a source of justification?</blockquote>

<p>

One way of answering the J-question can be viewed as a
<em>compromise position</em>, since it is meant to be a compromise
between foundationalism and its competitor, coherentism. The compromise
position will be of interest to us because it illustrates how DB and EB
differ. For if we adopt the compromise position, beliefs such as (H)
will qualify as basic according to DB, but according to EB as nonbasic.
So let's see what the compromise position says.</p>

<p>

From a coherentist point of view, we might answer the J-question as
follows: Perceptual experiences are a source of justification because
we are justified in <em>believing</em> them to be reliable. As we will
see below, making perceptual justification dependent on the existence
of reliability-attributing beliefs is quite problematic. There is,
however, an alternative answer to the J-question that appeals to
reliability without making perceptual justification dependent upon
beliefs that attribute reliability to perceptual experiences. According
to this second answer to the J-question, perceptual experiences are a
source of justification because we have justification for taking them
to be reliable. That's the view we shall call the <em>compromise
 position</em>.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#36" name="note-36">36</a>]</sup></p>

<p>

Note that your having justification for believing that <em>p</em>
doesn't entail that you actually believe <em>p</em>. For example, if
you believe that the person next to you wears a blue hat, you have
justification for believing that the person next to you wears a blue
hat or a red hat. But of course you are unlikely to believe the latter
even though you have justification for it. Likewise, your having
justification for attributing reliability to your perceptual
experiences doesn't entail that you have given thought to the matter
and actually formed the belief that they are reliable. According to the
kind of coherentism we considered above, if your perceptual experiences
are a source of justification for you, it must be the case that you
have considered the matter and <em>believe</em> them to be reliable.
The compromise position says no such thing. It says merely that, if
your perceptual experiences are a source of justification for you, you
must have <em>justification</em> for believing them to be reliable.</p>

<p>

What might give us justification for thinking that our perceptual
experiences are reliable? That's a complicated issue. For our present
purposes, let's consider the following answer: We remember that they
have served us well in the past. We are supposing, then, that
justification for attributing reliability to your perceptual
experiences consists of memories of perceptual success. According to
the compromise position, it is never a perceptual experience (E) <em>by
itself</em> that justifies a perceptual belief, but only (E) in
conjunction with suitable track-record memories that give you
justification for considering (E) reliable. Let ‘(E)’ again
stand for the hat's looking blue to you, and ‘(H)’ for your
belief that that hat is blue. According to the compromise position, (E)
justifies (H) only if (E) is accompanied by track-record memories (M)
that give you justification for attributing reliability to your visual
experiences. So what, according to the compromise position as we have
described it, justifies (H) is the conjunction of (E) and (M).</p>

<p>

We can now see how DB and EB differ. According to the compromise
position, your having justification for (H) depends on your having
justification for believing something else in addition to (H), namely
that your visual experiences are reliable. As a result (H) is not basic
in the sense defined by EB. However, (H) might still be basic in the
sense defined by DB. As long as your justification for (H) is owed
solely to (E) and (M), neither of which includes any <em>beliefs</em>,
DB tells us that (H) is basic. It follows that an experiential
foundationalist who wishes to classify beliefs such as (H) as basic
cannot adopt the compromise position. Such a foundationalist would have
to say that (E) by itself is sufficient for making (H) a justified
belief.</p>

<p>

How do experiential foundationalists who prefer EB to DB answer the
J-question? Because of the way they conceive of basicality, they cannot
say that perceptual experiences are a source of justification for you
because you have a reason, <em>R</em>, for believing that they do. For
<em>R</em> would be justification for believing something else —
the very thing that, according to EB, is an obstacle to basicality. One
option for EB-foundationalists would be to endorse externalism. If they
do, they could say that perceptual experiences are a source of
justification if, and only if, they are of types that are reliably
associated with true resulting beliefs. On that view, it would be the
fact of reliability, not evidence of reliability, that makes perceptual
experiences a source of
 justification.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#37" name="note-37">37</a>]</sup>
 Another internalist
option would be to say that perceptual experiences are a source of
justification because it couldn't be otherwise: it's a <em>necessary
truth</em> that certain perceptual experiences can justify certain
perceptual beliefs. This would be an internalist answer to the
J-question because perceptual experiences would be a source of
justification whether or not they are
 reliable.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#38" name="note-38">38</a>]</sup></p>

<p>

To conclude this section, let us briefly consider how justification
is supposed to be transferred from basic to nonbasic beliefs. There are
two options: the justificatory relation between basic and nonbasic
beliefs could be deductive or non-deductive. If we take the relation to
be deductive, each of one's nonbasic beliefs would have to be such that
it can be deduced from one's basic beliefs. This seems excessively
demanding. If we consider a random selection of typical beliefs we
hold, it is not easy to see from which basic beliefs they could be
deduced. Foundationalists, therefore, typically conceive of the link
between the foundation and the superstructure in non-deductive terms.
They would say that, for a basic belief, B, to justify a nonbasic
belief, B*, it isn't necessary that B entails B*. Rather, it is
sufficient that, given B, it is likely that B* is true.</p>

<h3><a name="COH">3.2 Coherentism</a></h3>

<p>

Foundationalism says that knowledge and justification are structured
like a building, consisting of a superstructure that rests upon a
foundation. According to coherentism, this metaphor gets things wrong.
Knowledge and justification are structured like a <em>web</em> where
the strength of any given area depends on the strength of the
surrounding areas. Coherentists, then, deny that there are any basic
beliefs. As we saw in the previous section, there are two different
ways of conceiving of basicality. Consequently, there are two
corresponding ways of construing coherentism: as the denial of doxastic
basicality or as the denial of epistemic basicality. Consider first
coherentism as the denial of doxastic basicality:</p>

<blockquote><strong>Doxastic Coherentism</strong>
<br />
 Every justified belief receives its justification from other beliefs
in its epistemic neighborhood.</blockquote>

<p>

Let us apply this thought to the hat example we considered in
Section 3.1. Suppose again you notice someone's hat and believe</p>

<blockquote>(H) That hat is blue.</blockquote>

<p>

Let's agree that (H) is justified. According to coherentism, (H)
receives its justification from other beliefs in the epistemic vicinity
of (H). They constitute your evidence or your reasons for taking (H) to
be true. Which beliefs might make up this set of
justification-conferring neighborhood beliefs?</p>

<p>

We will consider two approaches to answering this question. The
first is known as <em>inference to the best explanation</em>. Such
inferences generate what is called <em>explanatory
 coherence</em>.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#39" name="note-39">39</a>]</sup>
 According to this approach, we must
suppose you form a belief about the way the hat appears to you in your
perceptual experiences, and a second belief to the effect that your
perceptual experience, the hat's looking blue to you, is best explained
by the assumption that (H) is true. So the relevant set of beliefs is
the following:</p>

<blockquote>(1) I am having a visual experience (E): the hat looks blue
to me. 

<p>

(2) My having (E) is best explained by assuming that (H) is
true.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>

There are of course alternative explanations of why you have (E).
Perhaps you are hallucinating that the hat is blue. Perhaps an evil
demon makes the hat look blue to you when in fact it is red. Perhaps
you are the sort of person to whom hats always look blue. An
explanatory coherentist would say that, compared with these, the hat's
actual blueness is a superior explanation. That's why you are
justified in believing (H). Note that an explanatory coherentist can
also explain the <em>lack</em> of justification. Suppose you remember
that you just took a hallucinatory drug that makes things look blue to
you. That would prevent you from being justified in believing (H). The
explanatory coherentist can account for this by pointing out that, in
the case we are considering now, the truth of (H) would not be the
<em>best</em> explanation of why you are having experience (E). Rather,
your having taken the hallucinatory drug would be an explanation at
least as good as the assumption as (H) is true. That's why, according
to the explanatory coherentist, in this variation of our original case
you wouldn't be justified in believing (H).</p>

<p>

One problem for explanatory coherentists is to make us understand,
in <em>nonepistemic</em> terms, why the favored explanation is really
better than the competing explanations. Let's use the evil demon
hypothesis to illustrate that difficulty. What we need is an
explanation of why you are having (E). According to the evil demon
hypothesis, you are having (E) because the evil demon is tricking you.
The explanatory coherentist would say that this is a bad explanation of
why you are having (E). But why would it be bad? What we need to answer
this question is a general and principled account of what makes one
explanation better than another. Suppose we appeal to the fact that you
are not <em>justified</em> in believing in the existence of evil
demons. The general idea would be this: If there are two competing
explanations, E1 and E2, and E1 consists of or includes a proposition
that you are not justified in believing whereas E2 does not, then E2 is
better than E1. The problem with this idea is that it puts the cart
before the horse. Explanatory coherentism is supposed to make us
understand where justification comes from. It doesn't do that if it
accounts for the difference between better and worse explanations by
making use of the difference between justified and unjustified belief.
If explanatory coherentism were to proceed in this way, it would be a
circular, and thus uninformative, account of justification. So the
challenge to which explanatory coherentism must rise is to give an
account, without using the concept of justification, of what makes one
explanation better than another.</p>

<p>

Let us move on to the second way in which the coherentist approach
might be carried out. Recall what a subject's justification for
believing <em>p</em> is all about: possessing a link between the belief
that <em>p</em> and <em>p</em>'s truth. Suppose the subject knows that
the origin of her belief that <em>p</em> is reliable. So she knows that
beliefs coming from this source tend to be true. Such knowledge would
give her an excellent link between the belief and its truth. So we
might say that the neighborhood beliefs which confer justification on
(H) are the following:</p>

<blockquote>(1) I am having a visual experience (E): the hat looks blue
to me. 

<p>

(3) Experiences like (E) are reliable.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>

Call coherentism of this kind <em>reliability coherentism</em>. If
you believe (1) and (3), you are in possession of a good reason for
thinking that the hat is indeed blue. So you are in possession of a
good reason for thinking that the belief in question, (H), is true.
That's why, according to reliability coherentism, you are justified in
believing (H).</p>

<p>

Like explanatory coherentism, this view faces a circularity problem.
If (H) receives its justification in part because you also believe (3),
(3) itself must be justified. But where would your justification for
(3) come from? One answer would be: from your memory of perceptual
success in the past. You remember that your visual experiences have had
a good track record. They have rarely led you astray. The problem is
that you can't justifiably attribute a good track record to your
perceptual faculties without using your perceptual faculties. So if
reliability coherentism is going to work, it would have to be
legitimate to use a faculty for the very purpose of establishing the
reliability of that faculty itself. Some epistemologists think that
would not be
 legitimate.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#40" name="note-40">40</a>]</sup></p>

<p>

We have seen that explanatory coherentism and reliability
coherentism each face its own distinctive circularity problem. Since
both are versions of <em>doxastic</em> coherentism, they both face a
further difficulty: Do people, under normal circumstances, really form
beliefs like (1), (2), and (3)? It would seem they do not. It could be
objected, therefore, that these two versions of coherentism make
excessive intellectual demands of ordinary subjects who are unlikely to
have the background beliefs that, according to these versions of
coherentism, are needed for justification. This objection could be
avoided by stripping coherentism of its doxastic element. The result
would be the following version of coherentism, which results from
rejecting EB (the epistemic conception of basicality):</p>

<blockquote><strong>Dependence Coherentism</strong>
<br />
Whenever one is justified in believing a proposition
<em>p</em><sub>1</sub>, one's justification for believing
<em>p</em><sub>1</sub> depends on justification one has for believing
some further propositions, <em>p</em><sub>1</sub>,
<em>p</em><sub>2</sub>, …
<em>p</em><sub><em>n</em></sub>.</blockquote>

<p>

An explanatory coherentist might say that, for you to be justified
in believing (H), it's not necessary that you actually <em>believe</em>
(1) and (2). However, it is necessary that you have
<em>justification</em> for believing (1) and (2). It is your having
justification for (1) and (2) that gives you justification for
believing (H). A reliability coherentist might make an analogous point.
She might say that, to be justified in believing (H), you need not
believe anything about the reliability of your belief's origin. You
must, however, have justification for believing that your belief's
origin is reliable; that is, you must have justification for (1) and
(3). Both versions of dependence coherentism, then, rest on the
supposition that it is possible to have justification for a proposition
without actually believing that proposition.</p>

<p>

Dependence coherentism is a significant departure from the way
coherentism has typically been construed by its advocates. According to
the typical construal of coherentism, the view says that a given belief
is justified, the subject must have certain further <em>beliefs</em>
that constitute reasons for the given belief. Dependence coherentism
rejects this. According to it, justification need not come in the form
of beliefs. It can come in the form of introspective and memorial
evidence that gives a subject justification for beliefs about either
reliability or explanatory coherence. In fact, dependence coherentism
allows for the possibility that a belief is justified, not by receiving
<em>any</em> of its justification from other beliefs, but solely by
suitable perceptual experiences and memory content. Above, we called
this view the "compromise position". The compromise position, then, may
be characterized as follows:</p>

<ol type="i">
<li>it allows for doxastic basicality;</li>

<li>it does not allow for epistemic basicality;</li>

<li>it is inconsistent with doxastic coherentism;</li>

<li>it qualifies as a version of coherentism, namely dependence
coherentism.</li>
</ol>

<p>

Note that (iii) follows from (i), and (iv) from (ii). An
uncompromising foundationalist would reject dependence coherentism. A
foundationalist of that kind views a basic belief that <em>p</em> as a
belief whose justification does not depend on having <em>any</em>
justification for believing another proposition <em>q</em>.
Foundationalism of this sort could be called <em>independence
foundationalism</em>, since it asserts that a basic belief's
justification is completely independent of having justification for any
other beliefs. The logic of the conflict between foundationalism and
coherentism seems to suggest that, ultimately, the conflict between the
two views boils down to that between dependence coherentism and
independence
 foundationalism.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#41" name="note-41">41</a>]</sup></p>

<p>

Next, let us examine the reasons for and against in the debate over
foundationalism and coherentism.</p>

<h3><a name="WFO">3.3 Why Foundationalism?</a></h3>

<p>

The main argument for foundationalism is called the <em>regress
argument</em>. It's an argument from elimination. With regard to every
justified belief, B<sub>1</sub>, the question arises of where
B<sub>1</sub>'s justification comes from. If B<sub>1</sub> is not
basic, it would have to come from another belief, B<sub>2</sub>. But
B<sub>2</sub> can justify B<sub>1</sub> only if B<sub>2</sub> is
justified itself. If B<sub>2</sub> is basic, the justificatory chain
would end with B<sub>2</sub>. But if B<sub>2</sub> is not basic, we
need a further belief, B<sub>3</sub>. If B<sub>3</sub> is not basic, we
need a fourth belief, and so forth. Unless the ensuing regress
terminates in a basic belief, we get two possibilities: the regress
will either <em>loop back</em> to B<sub>1</sub> or continue <em>ad
infinitum</em>. According to the regress argument, both of these
possibilities are unacceptable. Therefore, if there are justified
beliefs, there must be basic
 beliefs.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#42" name="note-42">42</a>]</sup></p>

<p>

This argument suffers from various weaknesses. First, we may wonder
whether the alternatives to foundationalism are really unacceptable. In
the recent literature on this subject, we actually find an elaborate
defense of the position that infinitism is the correct solution to the
regress
 problem.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#43" name="note-43">43</a>]</sup>
 Nor should circularity be dismissed too
quickly. The issue is not whether a simple argument of the form <em>p
therefore p</em> is acceptable. Of course it is not. Rather, the issue
is ultimately whether, in the attempt to show that trust in our
faculties is reasonable, we may make use of the input our faculties
deliver. Whether such circularity is as unacceptable as a
<em>p-therefore-p</em> inference is an open question. Moreover, the
avoidance of circularity does not come cheap. Experiential
foundationalists claim that perception is a source of justification.
Hence they need to answer the J-question: <em>Why</em> is perception a
source of justification? As we saw above, if we wish to answer this
question without committing ourselves to the kind of circularity
dependence coherentism involves, we must choose between externalism and
an appeal to brute necessity. Neither choice is unproblematic.</p>

<p>

The second weakness of the regress argument is that its conclusion
merely says this: If there are justified beliefs, there must be
justified beliefs that do not receive their justification from other
beliefs. Its conclusion does not say that, if there are justified
beliefs, there must be beliefs whose justification is independent of
any justification for further beliefs. So the regress argument, if it
were sound, would merely show that there must be <em>doxastic</em>
basicality. Dependence coherentism, however, allows for doxastic
basicality. So the regress argument merely defends experiential
foundationalism against doxastic coherentism. It does not tell us why
we should prefer independence foundationalism to dependence
coherentism.</p>

<p>

Experiential foundationalism can be supported by citing cases like
the blue hat example. Such examples make it plausible to assume that
perceptual experiences are a source of justification. But they do not
arbitrate between dependence coherentism and independence
foundationalism, since either one of these views appeals to perceptual
experiences to explain why perceptual beliefs are justified.</p>

<p>

Finally, foundationalism can be supported by advancing objections to
coherentism. One prominent objection is that coherentism somehow fails
to ensure that a justified belief system is in contact with reality.
This objection derives its force from the fact that fiction can be
perfectly coherent. Why think, therefore, that a belief system's
coherence is a reason for thinking that the belief in that system tend
to be true? Coherentists could respond to this objection by saying
that, if a belief system contains beliefs such as "Many of my beliefs
have their origin in perceptual experiences" and "My perceptual
experiences are reliable", it is reasonable for the subject to think
that her belief system brings her into contact with external reality.
This looks like an effective response to the no-contact-with-reality
objection. Moreover, it is not easy to see why foundationalism itself
should be better positioned than coherentism when contact with reality
is the issue. What is meant by "ensuring" contact with reality? If
foundationalists expect a <em>logical guarantee</em> of such contact,
basic beliefs must be infallible. That would make contact with reality
a rather expensive commodity. Given its price, foundationalists might
want to lower their expectations. According to an alternative
construal, we expect merely the <em>likelihood</em> of contact with
reality. But if coherentists account for the importance of perception
in one way or another, they can meet that expectation as well as
foundationalists.</p>

<p>

Since coherentism can be construed in different ways, it is unlikely
that there is one single objection that succeeds in refuting all
possible versions of coherentism. Doxastic coherentism, however, seems
particularly vulnerable to criticism coming from the foundationalist
camp. One of these we considered already: It would seem that doxastic
coherentism makes excessive intellectual demands on believers. When
dealing with the mundane tasks of everyday life, we don't normally
bother to form beliefs about the explanatory coherence of our beliefs
or the reliability of our belief sources. According to a second
objection, doxastic coherentism fails by being insensitive to the
epistemic relevance of perceptual experiences. Foundationalists could
argue as follows. Suppose Kim is observing a chameleon that rapidly
changes its colors. A moment ago it was blue, now it's purple. Kim
still believes it's blue. Her belief is now unjustified because she
believes the chameleon is blue even though it <em>looks</em> purple to
her. Then the chameleon changes its color back to blue. Now Kim's
belief that the chameleon is blue is justified again because the
chameleon once again <em>looks</em> blue to her. The point would be
that what's responsible for the changing justificatory status of Kim's
belief is solely the way the chameleon looks to her. Since doxastic
coherentism does not attribute epistemic relevance to perceptual
experiences by themselves, it cannot explain why Kim's belief is first
justified, then unjustified, and eventually justified
 again.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#44" name="note-44">44</a>]</sup></p>

<h3><a name="WCO">3.4 Why Coherentism?</a></h3>

<p>

Coherentism is typically defended by attacking foundationalism as a
viable alternative. To argue against privilege foundationalism,
coherentists pick an epistemic privilege they think is essential to
foundationalism, and then argue that either no beliefs, or too few
beliefs, enjoy such a privilege. Against experiential foundationalism,
different objections have been advanced. One line of criticism is that
perceptual experiences don't have propositional content. Therefore, the
relation between a perceptual belief and the perceptual experience that
gives rise to it can only be causal. Consider again, however, the hat
example from above. When you see the hat and it looks blue to you,
doesn't your visual experience — its looking blue to you —
have the propositional content <em>that the hat is blue</em>? It would
seem it does. If it does, there seems to be no reason to deny that your
perceptual experience can play a justificatory
 role.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#45" name="note-45">45</a>]</sup></p>

<p>

Another line of thought is that, if perceptual experiences have
propositional content, they cannot stop the justificatory regress
because they would then be in need of justification themselves. That,
however, appears to be a strange thought. In our actual epistemic
practice, we never demand of others to justify the way things appear to
them in their perceptual experiences. Indeed, such a demand would seem
absurd. Suppose I ask you: "Why do you think that the hat is blue?" You
answer: "Because it looks blue to me." There are sensible further
questions I might ask at that point. For instance, I might ask: "Why do
you think its looking blue to you gives you a reason for thinking it is
blue?" Or I might ask: "Couldn't you be mistaken in believing it looks
blue to you?" The latter question might irritate you, but it would not
be illegitimate. After all, we can reasonably doubt that introspective
beliefs about how things appear to us are infallible. But now suppose I
ask you: "Why do you suppose the perceptual experience in which the hat
looks blue to you is justified?" In response to that question, you
should accuse me of misusing the word ‘justification’. I
might as well ask you what it is that justifies your headache when you
have one, or what justifies the itch in your nose when you have one.
The latter questions, you should reply, would be as absurd as my
request for stating a justifying reason for your perceptual
 experience.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#46" name="note-46">46</a>]</sup></p>

<p>

Experiential foundationalism, then, is not easily dislodged. On what
grounds could coherentists object to it? To raise problems for
experiential foundationalism, coherentists could press the J-question:
Why are perceptual experiences a source of justification? If
foundationalists answer the J-question appealing to evidence that
warrants the attribution of reliability to perceptual experiences,
experiential foundationalism morphs into dependence coherentism, or, as
we have called it, the compromise position. To avoid this outcome,
foundationalists would have to give an alternative answer. One way of
doing this would be to advocate independence foundationalism, which
adopts the epistemic conception of basicality and views it as a matter
of brute necessity that perception is a source of justification. So
ultimately, the task of defending coherentism might come down to the
task of showing that dependence coherentism as a compromise position is
preferable to independence foundationalism. To back up such a
preference, it might be argued that dependence coherentism gives us a
more satisfying answer to the J-question than independence
foundationalism does. But is that really so?</p>

<p>

Suppose we ask "Why is the sum of two and two four?" Isn't the
answer "It couldn't be any other way" perfectly satisfactory? So
sometimes, at least, a request for explaining the truth of <em>p</em>
is met in a satisfying way by pointing out that <em>p</em> is
<em>necessarily</em> true. Why, then, should we not be satisfied when
independence foundationalists answer the J-question by saying that
perceptual experiences are <em>necessarily</em> a source of
justification? To find out whether we should be satisfied, we might
employ thought experiments. We might try to describe a possible world
in which, to use our example again, someone sees an object that looks
blue to her, but the object's looking blue to her does not give her any
justification at all for believing that the object is actually blue. If
we can conceive of such a possible world, then we have reason to think
that independence foundationalists are mistaken when they say that
perceptual experience is necessarily a source of justification.</p>

<h2><a name="SOU">4. Sources of Knowledge and Justification</a></h2>

<p>

Beliefs arise in people for a wide variety of causes. Among them, we
must list psychological factors such as desires, emotional needs,
prejudice, and biases of various kinds. Obviously, when beliefs
originate in sources like these, they don't qualify as knowledge even
if true. For true beliefs to count as knowledge, it is necessary that
they originate in sources we have good reason to consider reliable.
These are perception, introspection, memory, reason, and testimony. Let
us briefly consider each of these.</p>

<h3><a name="PER">4.1 Perception</a></h3>

<p>

Our perceptual faculties are our five senses: sight, touch, hearing,
smelling, and tasting. We must distinguish between an experience that
can be classified as <em>perceiving</em> that <em>p</em> (for example,
seeing that there is coffee in the cup and tasting that it is sweet),
which entails that <em>p</em> is true, and a perceptual experience in
which it seems to us as though <em>p</em>, but where <em>p</em> might
be false. Let us refer to this latter kind of experience as
<em>perceptual seemings</em>. The reason for making this distinction
lies in the fact that perceptual experience is fallible. The world is
not always as it appears to us in our perceptual experiences. We need,
therefore, a way of referring to perceptual experiences in which
<em>p</em> seems to be the case that allows for the possibility of
<em>p</em> being false. That's the role assigned to perceptual
seemings. So some perceptual seemings that <em>p</em> are cases of
perceiving that <em>p</em>, others are not. When it looks to you as
though there is a cup of coffee on the table and in fact there is, the
two states coincide. If, however, you hallucinate that there is a cup
on the table, you have perceptual seeming that <em>p</em> without
perceiving that <em>p</em>.</p>

<p>

One family of epistemological issues about perception arises when we
concern ourselves with the psychological nature of the perceptual
processes through which we acquire knowledge of external objects.
According to <em>direct realism</em>, we can acquire such knowledge
because we can directly perceive such objects. For example, when you
see a tomato on the table, <em>what you perceive</em> is the tomato
itself. According to <em>indirect realism</em>, we acquire knowledge of
external objects by virtue of perceiving something else, namely
appearances or sense-data. An indirect realist would say that, when you
see and thus know that there is a tomato on the table, what you really
see is not the tomato itself but a tomato-like sense-datum or some such
entity.</p>

<p>

Direct and indirect realists hold different views about the
structure of perceptual knowledge. Indirect realists would say that we
acquire perceptual knowledge of external objects by virtue of
perceiving sense data that represent external objects. Sense data, a
species of mental states, enjoy a special status: we know directly what
they are like. So indirect realists think that, when perceptual
knowledge is foundational, it is knowledge of sense data and other
mental states. Knowledge of external objects is indirect: derived from
our knowledge of sense data. The basic idea is that we have indirect
knowledge of the external world because we can have foundational
knowledge of our own mind. Direct realists can be more liberal about
the foundation of our knowledge of external objects. Since they hold
that perceptual experiences get you in direct contact with external
objects, they can say that such experiences can give you foundational
knowledge of external objects.</p>

<p>

We take our perceptual faculties to be reliable. But how can we know
that they are reliable? For externalists, this might not be much of a
challenge. If the use of reliable faculties is sufficient for
knowledge, and if by using reliable faculties we acquire the belief
that our faculties are reliable, then we come to know that our
faculties are reliable. But even externalists might wonder how they
can, via argument, <em>show</em> that our perceptual faculties are
reliable. The problem is this. It would seem the only way of acquiring
knowledge about the reliability of our perceptual faculties is through
memory, through remembering whether they served us well in the past.
But should I trust my memory, and should I think that the episodes of
perceptual success that I seem to recall were in fact episodes of
perceptual success? If I am entitled to answer these questions with
‘yes', then I need to have, to begin with, reason to view my
memory and my perceptual experiences as reliable. It would seem,
therefore, that there is no non-circular way of arguing for the
reliability of one's perceptual
 faculties.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#47" name="note-47">47</a>]</sup></p>

<h3><a name="INT">4.2 Introspection</a></h3>

<p>

Introspection is the capacity to inspect the, metaphorically
speaking, "inside" of one's mind. Through introspection, one knows what
mental states one is in: whether one is thirsty, tired, excited, or
depressed. Compared with perception, introspection appears to have a
special status. It is easy to see how a perceptual seeming can go
wrong: what looks like a cup of coffee on the table might be just be a
clever hologram that's visually indistinguishable from an actual cup of
coffee. But could it be possible that it introspectively seems to me
that I have a headache when in fact I do not? It is not easy to see how
it could be. Thus we come to think that introspection has a special
status. Compared with perception, introspection seems to be privileged
by virtue of being less error prone. How can we account for the special
status of introspection?</p>

<p>

First, it could be argued that, when it comes to introspection,
there is no difference between appearance and reality; therefore,
introspective seemings are necessarily successful introspections.
According to this approach, introspection is infallible. Alternatively,
one could view introspection as a source of certainty. Here the idea is
that an introspective experience of <em>p</em> eliminates all possible
doubt as to whether <em>p</em> is true. Finally, one could attempt to
explain the specialness of introspection by examining the way we
respond to first-person reports: typically, we attribute a special
authority to such reports. According to this approach, introspection is
incorrigible. Others are not, or at least not typically, in a position
to correct first-person reports of one's own mental states.</p>

<p>

Introspection reveals how the world appears to us in our perceptual
experiences. For that reason, introspection has been of special
interest to foundationalists. Perception is not immune to error. If
certainty consists in the absence of all possible doubt, perception
fails to yield certainty. Hence beliefs based on perceptual experiences
cannot be foundational. Introspection, however, might deliver what we
need to find a firm foundation for our beliefs about external objects:
at best outright immunity to error or all possible doubt, or perhaps
more modestly, an epistemic kind of directness that cannot be found in
perception.</p>

<p>

Is it really true, however, that, compared with perception,
introspection is in some way special? Critics of foundationalism have
argued that introspection is certainly not infallible. Might one not
confuse an unpleasant itch for a pain? Might I not think that the shape
before me appears circular to me when in fact it appears slightly
elliptical to me? If it is indeed possible for introspection to
mislead, then it is hard to see why introspection should eliminate all
possible doubt. Yet it isn't easy to see either how, if one clearly and
distinctly feels a throbbing headache, one could be mistaken about
that. Introspection, then, turns out to be a mysterious faculty. On the
one hand, it does not seem to be in general an infallible faculty; on
the other hand, when looking at appropriately described specific cases,
error does seem
 impossible.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#48" name="note-48">48</a>]</sup></p>

<h3><a name="MEM">4.3 Memory</a></h3>

<p>

Memory is the capacity to retain knowledge acquired in the past. What
one remembers, though, need not be a past event. It may be a present
fact, such as one's telephone number, or a future event, such as the
date of the next elections. Memory is, of course, fallible. Not every
instance of taking oneself to remember that <em>p</em> is an instance
of actually remembering that <em>p</em>. We should distinguish,
therefore, between remembering that <em>p</em> (which entails the truth
of <em>p</em>) and <em>seeming</em> to remember that <em>p</em> (which
does not entail the truth of <em>p</em>). </p>

<p>

One issue about memory concerns the question of what distinguishes
memorial seemings from perceptual seemings or mere imagination. Some
philosophers have thought that having an image in one's mind is
essential to memory, but that would appear to be mistaken. When one
remembers one's telephone number, one is unlikely to have an image of
one's number in one's mind. The distinctively epistemological questions
about memory are these: First, what makes memorial seemings a source of
justification? Is it a necessary truth that, if one has a memorial
seeming that <em>p</em>, one has thereby prima facie justification for
<em>p</em>? Or is memory a source of justification only if, as
coherentists might say, one has reason to think that one's memory is
reliable? Or is memory a source of justification only if, as
externalists would say, it is in fact reliable? Second, how can we
respond to skepticism about knowledge of the past? Memorial seemings of
the past do not guarantee that the past is what we take it to be. We
think that we are a bit older than just five minutes, but it is
logically possible that the world sprang into existence just five
minutes ago, complete with our dispositions to have memorial seemings
of a more distant past and items such as apparent fossils that suggest
a past going back millions of years. Our seeming to remember that the
world is older than a mere five minutes does not entail, therefore,
that it really is. Why, then, should we think that memory is a source
of knowledge about the
 past?<sup>[<a href="notes.html#49" name="note-49">49</a>]</sup></p>

<h3><a name="REA">4.4 Reason</a></h3>

<p>

Some beliefs would appear to be justified solely by the use of
reason. Justification of that kind is said to be <em><em>a
priori</em></em>: prior to any kind of experience. A standard way of
defining <em>a priori</em> justification goes as follows:</p>

<blockquote><strong><em>A Priori</em> Justification</strong>
<br />
<em>S</em> is justified <em>a priori</em> in believing that <em>p</em>
if and only if <em>S</em>'s justification for believing that <em>p</em>
does not depend on any experience.</blockquote>

<p>

Beliefs that are true and justified in this way (and not somehow
"gettiered") would count as instances of <em>a priori</em>
 knowledge.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#50" name="note-50">50</a>]</sup></p>

<p>

What exactly counts as experience? If by ‘experience’ we
mean just <em>perceptual</em> experiences, justification deriving from
introspective or memorial experiences would count as <em>a priori</em>.
For example, I could then know <em>a priori</em> that I'm thirsty, or
what I ate for breakfast this morning. While the term ‘<em>a
priori</em>’ is sometimes used in this way, the strict use of the
term restricts <em>a priori</em> justification to justification derived
<em>solely</em> from the use of reason. According to this usage, the
word ‘experiences' in the definition above includes perceptual,
introspective, and memorial experiences alike. On this narrower
understanding, paradigm examples of what I can know on the basis of
<em>a priori</em> justification are conceptual truths (such as "All
bachelors are unmarried"), and truths of mathematics, geometry and
logic.</p>

<p>

Justification and knowledge that is not <em>a priori</em> is called
‘a posteriori’ or ‘empirical’. For example, in
the narrow sense of ‘<em>a priori</em>’, whether I'm
thirsty or not is something I know empirically (on the basis of
introspective experiences), whereas I know <em>a priori</em> that 12
divided by 3 is 4.</p>

<p>

Several important issues arise about <em>a priori</em> knowledge.
First, does it exist at all? Skeptics about apriority deny its
existence. They don't mean to say that we have no knowledge of
mathematics, geometry, logic, and conceptual truths. Rather, what they
claim is that all such knowledge is empirical.</p>

<p>

Second, if <em>a priori</em> justification is possible, exactly how
does it come about? What <em>makes</em> a belief such as "All bachelors
are unmarried" justified solely on the basis of reason? Is it an
unmediated grasp of the truth of this proposition? Or does it consist
of grasping that the proposition is <em>necessarily</em> true? Or is it
the purely intellectual experience of "seeing" (with they "eye of
reason") or "intuiting" that this proposition is true (or necessarily
true)? Or is it, as externalists would suggest, the reliability of the
cognitive process by which we come to recognize the truth of such a
proposition?</p>

<p>

Third, if <em>a priori</em> knowledge exists, what is its extent?
<em>Empiricists</em> have argued that <em>a priori</em> knowledge is
limited to the realm of the <em>analytic</em>, consisting of
propositions of a somehow inferior status because they are not really
"about the world". Propositions of a superior status, which convey
genuine information about world, are labeled <em>synthetic</em>. <em>a
priori</em> knowledge of synthetic propositions, empiricists would say,
is not possible. <em>Rationalists</em> deny this. They would say that a
proposition such as "If a ball is green all over, then it doesn't have
black spots" is synthetic and knowable <em>a priori</em>.</p>

<p>

A fourth question about the nature of <em>a priori</em> knowledge
concerns the distinction between necessary and contingent truths. The
received view is that whatever is known <em>a priori</em> is
necessarily true, but there are epistemologists who disagree with
 that.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#51" name="note-51">51</a>]</sup></p>

<h3><a name="TES">4.5 Testimony</a></h3>

<p>

Testimony differs from the sources we considered above because it
isn't distinguished by having its own cognitive faculty. Rather, to
acquire knowledge of <em>p</em> through testimony is to come to know
that <em>p</em> on the basis of someone's saying that <em>p</em>.
"Saying that <em>p</em>" must be understood broadly, as including
ordinary utterances in daily life, postings by bloggers on their
web-logs, articles by journalists, delivery of information on
television, radio, tapes, books, and other media. So, when you ask the
person next to you what time it is, and she tells you, and you thereby
come to know what time it is, that's an example of coming to know
something on the basis of testimony. And when you learn by reading the
<em>Washington Post</em> that the terrorist attack in Sharm el-Sheikh
of July 22, 2005 killed at least 88 people, that, too, is an example of
acquiring knowledge on the basis of testimony.</p>

<p>

The epistemological puzzle testimony raises is this: Why is
testimony a source of knowledge? An externalist might say that
testimony is a source of knowledge if and only if it comes from a
reliable source. But here, even more so than in the case of our
faculties, internalists will not find that answer satisfactory. Suppose
you hear someone saying ‘<em>p</em>’. Suppose further that
person is in fact utterly reliable with regard to the question of
whether <em>p</em> is the case or not. Finally, suppose you have no
evidential clue whatever as to that person's reliability. Wouldn't it
be plausible to conclude that, since that person's reliability is
unknown to you, that person's saying ‘<em>p</em>’ does not
put you in a position to know that <em>p</em>? But if the reliability
of a testimonial source is not sufficient for making it a source of
knowledge, what else is needed? Thomas Reid suggested that, by our very
nature, we accept testimonial sources as reliable and tend to attribute
credibility to them unless we encounter special contrary reasons. But
that's merely a statement of the attitude we in fact take toward
testimony. What is it that makes that attitude reasonable? It could be
argued that, in one's own personal experiences with testimonial
sources, one has accumulated a long track record that can be taken as a
sign of reliability. However, when we think of the sheer breadth of the
knowledge we derive from testimony, one wonders whether one's personal
experiences constitute an evidence base rich enough to justify the
attribution of reliability to the totality of the testimonial sources
one tends to trust. An alternative to the track record approach would
be to declare it a necessary truth that trust in testimonial sources is
justified. This suggestion, alas, encounters the same difficulty as the
externalist approach to testimony: it does not seem we can acquire
knowledge from sources the reliability of which is utterly unknown to
 us.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#52" name="note-52">52</a>]</sup></p>

<h2><a name="LIM">5. The Limits of Knowledge and Justification</a></h2>

<h3><a name="SKE">5.1 The Case for Skepticism</a></h3>

<p>

According to skeptics, the limits of what you know are narrower than
you would like to think. There are many things that you think you know
but actually fail to know. For example, you think you know that you
have hands, but in fact you don't. How can the skeptics expect you to
take such a strange conclusion seriously? Here's how. As a first step,
the skeptics will focus on another proposition, about which you are
likely to agree that you don't know it. As a second step, they will get
you to agree that, since you don't know that second proposition, you
don't know the first one either: the proposition that you have hands. </p>

<p>

When the skeptics get their argument started with some other
proposition about which you are likely to agree you don't know it, what
do they have in mind? They direct your attention to what is called a
<em>skeptical hypothesis</em>. According to a skeptical hypothesis,
things are radically different from what you take them to be. Here are
several examples:</p>

<ul>
<li>I'm lying in my bed dreaming.</li>

<li>I'm deceived by an evil demon.</li>

<li>I'm a mere brain-in-a-vat (a BIV).</li>

<li>I'm in the matrix world.</li>
</ul>

<p>

What the skeptics will point out, and what they think you will
easily agree with, is this: For any particular hypothesis on the list,
you don't know that it is false. This works better for some than for
others. It works really well for the BIV hypothesis, which we discussed
already in section 2.2. The idea is that, if you are a BIV, you are
reduced to a mere brain which is stimulated in such a way that the
delusion of a normal life results. So the experiences you have as a BIV
and the experiences you have as a normal person are perfectly alike,
indistinguishable, so to speak, "from the inside." It doesn't
<em>look</em> to you as though you are a BIV. After all, you can see
that you have a body, and you can freely move about in your
environment. The problem is that it looks that way to a BIV, too. As a
result, the evidence you have as a normal person and the evidence you
have as a BIV do not relevantly differ. Consequently, your evidence
can't settle the question of whether or not you are a BIV. Based on
this thought, the skeptics claim you <em>don't know</em> that you are
not a BIV. That's the first step of the case for skepticism.</p>

<p>

Let us now focus on the second step. The basic thought is that, if
you don't know you're not a BIV, you don't know you have hands. That
thought is extremely plausible. After all, if you are a BIV, you don't
have any hands. So if you can't distinguish between being and not being
a BIV, you can't distinguish either between having and not having
hands. But if you can't distinguish between having and not having
hands, surely you don't know that you have hands. Putting the two steps
of the skeptic's reasoning together, we get the following argument:</p>

<blockquote>
<strong>The BIV Argument</strong> <br />
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td valign="top">(1)  </td>
<td valign="top">I don't know that I'm not a BIV.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td valign="top">(2)  </td>
<td valign="top">If I don't know that I'm not a BIV, then I don't know that I have
hands.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td colspan="2">    Therefore:</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td valign="top">(3)  </td>
<td valign="top">I don't know that I have hands.</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</blockquote>

<p>

As we have just seen, (1) and (2) are very plausible premises. It
would seem, therefore, that the BIV Argument is sound. If it is, we
must conclude we don't know we have hands. But surely that conclusion
can't be right. So we are confronted with a difficult challenge: On
what grounds can we reject the conclusion of this seemingly sound
 argument?<sup>[<a href="notes.html#53" name="note-53">53</a>]</sup></p>

<h3><a name="CLO">5.2 Skepticism and Closure</a></h3>

<p>

The second premise is closely connected to the principle that
knowledge is closed under known entailment, for short, the <em>closure
principle</em>. Setting complications aside, it says the following:</p>

<blockquote><strong>The Closure Principle</strong>
<br />
 If I know that <em>p</em>, and I know that <em>p</em> entails
<em>q</em>, then I know that
 <em>q</em>.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#54" name="note-54">54</a>]</sup></blockquote>

<p>

This principle is exceedingly plausible. Here's an example to
illustrate it. Suppose you had exactly two beers. Your having had
exactly two beers entails that you had less than three beers. If you
know both of these things, then you know that you had less than three
beers. This much, certainly, seems beyond dispute.</p>

<p>

How is the closure principle related to the skeptical argument? The
connection can be seen when you replace ‘<em>p</em>’ and
‘<em>q</em>’ with the relevant propositions:</p>

<blockquote><em>p</em>: I have hands.
<br />
 <em>q</em>: I'm not a BIV.</blockquote>

<p>

Making these replacements, we get the following application of the
closure principle to the BIV argument:</p>

<blockquote><strong>BIV Closure</strong>
<br />
 If I know that I have hands, and I know that my having hands entails
my not being a BIV, then I know that I'm not a BIV.</blockquote>

<p>

According to the skeptical argument, you can't know that you are not
a BIV. So the consequent of BIV closure is false. Therefore, the
antecedent of BIV closure must be false. The antecedent of BIV closure
is a conjunction. The second conjunct can't be argued with. If you
understand what is meant by the BIV hypothesis, then you know that you
don't have hands if you are a BIV. If follows that the antecedent of
BIV Closure is false because its <em>first</em> conjunct is false. So
starting out with the closure principle, we arrive at the skeptical
conclusion: You don't know that you have
 hands.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#55" name="note-55">55</a>]</sup></p>

<h3><a name="RAL">5.3 Relevant Alternatives and Closure Denial</a></h3>

<p>

Next, we will examine various responses to the BIV argument.
According to the first, we should distinguish between relevant and
irrelevant alternatives. An alternative to a state of affairs or
proposition <em>p</em> is any state of affairs or proposition that is
incompatible with <em>p</em>. Your having hands and your being a BIV
are alternatives: if the former is true, the latter is false, and vice
versa. According to the thought that motivates the second premise of
the BIV argument, you know that you have hands only if you can
discriminate between your actually having hands and the alternative of
being a (handless) BIV. But you can't discriminate between these two
states of affairs. That's why you don't know that you have hands. In
response to such reasoning, a relevant alternatives theorist would say
that your inability to discriminate between these two states of affairs
is not an obstacle to your knowing that you have hands because your
being a BIV is <em>not</em> a <em>relevant</em> alternative to your
having hands. What would be a relevant alternative? This, for example:
your arms ending in stumps rather than hands, or your having hooks
instead of hands, or your having prosthetic hands. But these
alternatives don't prevent you from knowing that you have hands —
not because they are irrelevant, but rather because you can
discriminate between these alternatives and your having hands. The
relevant alternative theorist holds, therefore, that you do know that
you have hands.</p>

<p>

The BIV argument is valid. Relevant alternative theorists must
therefore deny one of its premises. Since they agree that you don't
know that your are not a BIV, they accept the first premise.
Consequently, they reject the second premise. You know that you have
hands even though you don't know that you are not a BIV. This means, in
effect, that relevant alternative theorists deny the closure principle.
Let's consider the details of this point. Relevant alternative
theorists say:</p>

<ol type="i">
<li>You know you have hands.</li>

<li>You know that your having hands entails your not being a BIV.</li>

<li>You don't know that you are not a BIV.</li>
</ol>

<p>

Relevant alternative theorists, then, assert the antecedent and deny
the consequent of BIV closure, as stated in the previous section. They
are, therefore, committed to the claim that the closure principle is
 false.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#56" name="note-56">56</a>]</sup></p>

<p>

There are two chief problems for this approach. The first is that
denouncing the BIV alternative as irrelevant is <em>ad hoc</em> unless
it is supplemented with a principled account of what makes one
alternative relevant and another irrelevant. The second is that the
closure principle enjoys a high degree of intrinsic plausibility.
Denying it generates so-called abominable conjunctions. Here is
one:</p>

<blockquote><strong>An Abominable Conjunction</strong>
<br />
 I know that I have hands but I do not know that I am not a (handless)
BIV.</blockquote>

<p>

Many epistemologists would agree that this conjunction is indeed
abominable because it blatantly violates the basic and extremely
plausible intuition that you can't know you have hands without knowing
that you are not a
 BIV.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#57" name="note-57">57</a>]</sup></p>

<h3><a name="MRE">5.4 The Moorean Response</a></h3>

<p>

Next, let us consider a response to the BIV argument according to
which it's not the second but the first premise that must be rejected.
G. E. Moore has pointed out that an argument succeeds only to the
extent that its premises are more plausible than the conclusion. So if
we encounter an argument whose conclusion we don't like, and notice
that the denial of the conclusion is actually quite plausible, in fact
more plausible than the assertion of the premises, then we can turn the
argument on its head. According to this approach, we can respond to the
BIV argument as follows:</p>

<blockquote><strong>Counter BIV</strong>
<br />
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td valign="top">(1) </td>
<td valign="top">I know that I have hands.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td valign="top">(2) </td>
<td valign="top">If I don't know that I'm not a BIV, then I don't know that I have
hands.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td colspan="2">    Therefore:</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td valign="top">(3) </td>
<td valign="top">I know that I am not a BIV.</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</blockquote>

<p>

Unless we are skeptics or opponents of closure, we would have to
concede that this argument is sound. It is valid, and its premises are
true. Yet few philosophers would agree that Counter BIV amounts to a
satisfying response to the BIV argument. What needs to be accomplished
is more than a mere assertion of (3), based on knowledge of one's
hands. What we need to have explained to us is <em>how</em> one can
know that one is not a BIV. The observation that the premises of the
BIV argument are less plausible than the denial of its conclusion
doesn't help us understand how such knowledge is possible. That's why
the Moorean response falls short of being a successful rebuttal of the
skeptical
 argument.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#58" name="note-58">58</a>]</sup></p>

<h3><a name="CRE">5.5 The Contextualist Response</a></h3>

<p>

We have looked at two responses to the BIV argument. The relevant
alternatives response denies the second premise. Because of the
plausibility of the second premise, this might strike us as a
desperation move. The Moorean response denies the first premise. The
problem with that move is this: Unless we are provided with a
convincing explanation of <em>how</em> one can know that one isn't a
BIV, it's not more than just digging in one's non-skeptical heels.
According to contextualism, it's possible to articulate a more
satisfying reply to the BIV argument. The trick is to focus on how we
actually use the word ‘know’. If we do that, we'll notice
that our use of that word varies from one situation — from one
context — to another. What so varies is what we <em>mean</em> by
that word.</p>

<p>

Three questions arise immediately. First, what are these various
meanings of the word ‘know’? Second, why and how does what
we mean by ‘know’ change from one context to another?
Third, how does the <em>context-sensitivity</em> of ‘know’
help us respond to the BIV argument? Let us consider each question in
turn.</p>

<p>

First, when what we mean by ‘know’ changes from one
context to another, what changes is the standards that we think must be
met if someone is to have knowledge of something. For the sake of
keeping things simple, let's distinguish between just two sets of
standards: very high and not so high. Let's refer to them as
‘high’ and ‘low’ standards. In some contexts,
when we use the word ‘know’, we have low standards of
knowledge in mind: standards that are easy to meet. We will then
ascribe knowledge liberally. In other contexts, our use of the word
‘know’ is guided by more demanding high standards. Meeting
these is very difficult. In such contexts, we will ascribe knowledge
only reluctantly. Second, what effects such changes in what we mean by
‘know’? According to some contextualists, it is the
salience of error-possibilities. In an ordinary, low-standard context,
you don't worry about being a BIV. It's an error possibility you
ignore. As a result, your standards of knowledge remain low. In such a
context, all it takes for you to know you have hands is that you can
discriminate between having hands and having stumps, hooks, or
prosthetic hands. That's a condition you easily meet. Hence you will
not be reluctant at all to ascribe to yourself knowledge of your hands.
But suppose you start thinking about the problem of skepticism. You're
wondering how you could know that you are not a BIV. You come to note
that it's very difficult to know that one isn't a BIV. The BIV
alternative is now salient to you. This makes your standards of
knowledge rise. Bearing in mind that BIVs don't have hands, you now
think that, for you to know that you have hands, you must be able to
eliminate the error possibility of being a BIV. Since you realize you
can't eliminate that possibility, you are no longer willing to ascribe
to yourself knowledge of your hands.</p>

<p>

Third, how does all of that help us find a reply to the BIV
argument? Contextualists view the BIV argument as presenting us with a
paradox. We think it's crazy to deny knowledge of our hands. At the
same time, we don't think one can know that one isn't a BIV. How can
the conflict between these thoughts be resolved? Contextualists propose
to resolve it by saying this: In low standard contexts (when skeptical
hypotheses are not salient), the first premise and the conclusion of
the BIV argument are both false. In such contexts, a speaker who says
"You don't know that you have hands" or "You don't know that you are
not a BIV" is mistaken. The speaker is mistaken because we do in fact
meet <em>low</em> standards of knowledge. So relative to what we mean
by ‘know’ in such contexts, we know that we have hands and
that we are not BIVs. However, in high standard contexts (when an error
possibility such as being a BIV is salient), the first premise and the
conclusion of the BIV argument are both true. Now, when speakers say
"You don't know that you have hands" or "You don't know that you are
not a BIV", they are correct, for with regard to having hands and being
or not being a BIV, our epistemic position is not strong enough for us
to meet high standards of knowledge. Therefore, relative to what we
mean by ‘know’ when we are confronted with a salient error
possibility such as being a BIV, we know neither that we have hands nor
that we are not BIVs.</p>

<p>

Contextualism is intended as a <em>closure preserving</em> response
to skepticism. The closure principle is true even relative to
"knowledge" attributions that are subject to high standards. Hence,
according to contextualism, things fall into place as follows:</p>

<ol type="i">
<li>we know the closure principle whether the meaning of
‘know’ is fixed by high or low standards;</li>

<li>when the meaning of ‘know’ is fixed by low standards,
we know both that we have hands and that we are not BIVs;</li>

<li>when the meaning of ‘know’ is fixed by high standards,
we know neither that we have hands nor that we are not BIVs.</li>
</ol>

<p>

As a result, closure is preserved. Contextualism is also meant to be
an improvement over the Moorean response. According to that response,
the first premise of the BIV argument is false. This conflicts with our
intuition that we cannot know that we are not BIVs. Contextualism
resolves this conflict by saying that the first premise is false only
in low standards contexts. In high standards contexts, that premise is
true.</p>

<p>

Naturally, contextualism has elicited many objections. According to
one, what's wrong with contextualism is that it replaces our interest
in knowledge itself with focus on the word ‘know’. This
objection (let us call it the <em>replacement objection</em>) is based
on a misunderstanding of contextualism. In the next section, we will
see why.</p>

<p>

According to another objection, contextualism overemphasizes the
importance of the context sensitivity of the word ‘know’.
Let us distinguish between two elements of contextualism. The first is
<em>semantic ascent</em>. If we endorse the semantic ascent element, we
think that a satisfactory response to skepticism in general and the BIV
argument in particular requires of us to distinguish between a
high-standards and a low-standards meaning of "knowledge." The semantic
ascent thesis remains squarely within the limits of traditional
epistemology. Indeed, in any area of philosophy, it's always going to
be a good idea to remain aware of the possibility that the problems in
which one finds oneself entangled might, at least to some extent, be
due to subtle (and sometimes not so subtle) shifts in meaning. The
other element of contextualism could be called <em>strict</em>
context-sensitivity, as opposed to <em>loose</em> context sensitivity.
Consider the thesis that the meaning of the word ‘know’
varies with context. There is an innocuous interpretation of this
thesis: people do not always mean the same when they use the word
‘know’. Sometimes they mean one thing by
‘know’, at other times they mean another thing by
‘know’. This is loose context sensitivity. It's hard to see
on what grounds such a weak claim might be disputed. Contextualists,
however, make a stronger claim. They assert that what one means by
‘know’ is determined, in a way that's very difficult to
resist, by the salience or non-salience of error possibilities. That's
strict context sensitivity. If we endorse strict context sensitivity,
there's something important that drops out: how one <em>intends</em> to
use the word ‘know’. An alternative semantics of the word
‘know’ will de-emphasize the importance of the salience or
non-salience of error possibilities and ascribe a much higher degree
of semantic independence to the subjects who use the word
‘know’. Next, let's consider a response to the BIV argument
that retains the semantic ascent element of contextualism, but rejects
strong context
 sensitivity.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#59" name="note-59">59</a>]</sup></p>

<h3><a name="ARE">5.6 The Ambiguity Response</a></h3>

<p>

What <em>proposition</em> a "knowledge"-attributing sentence
expresses depends on what <em>concept</em> of knowledge the person who
uses that sentence (in spoken or written form) has in mind when using
the word ‘know’. Let's distinguish between two concepts: a
high-standards and a low-standards concept. There are various ways of
cashing out this distinction. We will understand it in terms of
fallible and infallible evidence. High-standards or infallible
knowledge of <em>p</em> requires <em>p</em>-entailing evidence.
Low-standards of fallible knowledge of <em>p</em> requires adequate
evidence for <em>p</em>, where evidence for <em>p</em> can be adequate
without entailing <em>p</em>.</p>

<p>

According to the ambiguity response, a "knowledge"-attributing
sentence is ambiguous unless we can tell whether the word
‘know’, as it occurs in that sentence, refers to fallible
or infallible knowledge. Suppose we think that fallible knowledge of
one's hands is possible, whereas infallible knowledge of one's hands is
not. Suppose further we hear Jane say ‘Carl knows that he has
hands.’ Finally, suppose we have no idea whether Jane uses the
word ‘know’ in the fallible or infallible sense. In that
case, we would have to say that Jane's utterance is true if interpreted
as a claim about fallible knowledge, but false if interpreted as a
claim about infallible knowledge. Now, with regard to the BIV argument,
we are in a similar situation. We have not been instructed on whether
the word ‘know’ in its premises and its conclusion is to be
understood in the fallible or infallible sense. Consequently, when
assessing the merits of the BIV argument, we must consider three
versions of it:</p>

<blockquote><strong>The Mixed Version</strong>
<br />
 In the premises, the word ‘know’ refers to infallible
knowledge, whereas in the conclusion, it refers to fallible knowledge. 

<p>

<strong>The High-Standards Version</strong>
<br />
 The word ‘know’ refers to infallible knowledge in both the
premises and the conclusion.</p>

<p>

<strong>The Low-Standards Version</strong>
<br />
 The word ‘know’ refers to fallible knowledge in both the
premises and the conclusion.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>

Distinguishing between these three versions, proponents of the
ambiguity response can reply to the BIV argument as follows:</p>

<ol type="i">
<li>The mixed version is an instance of equivocation and thus
invalid.</li>

<li>The high-standards version is sound but uninteresting. Its
conclusion asserts that we don't have infallible knowledge of our
hands. That's nothing to worry about. What really matters to us is
whether we have fallible knowledge of our hands. But that question
simply isn't addressed by the high-standards version.</li>

<li>The low-standards version is interesting but unsound. Its
conclusion — we do not even have fallible knowledge of our hands
— is indeed disturbing. If this conclusion were true, then we
would be in a radical way mistaken about what we think we know.
However, we don't have to accept this conclusion because the argument's
first premise is false. According to that premise, one cannot even have
fallible knowledge of one's not being a BIV. That's false. There is,
after all, good evidence for thinking that one's is not a BIV. This
evidence is good enough for knowing that one isn't a BIV even though it
does not entail that one isn't a BIV.</li>
</ol>

<p>

Suppose an opponent of the ambiguity response were to employ the
replacement objection, claiming that the response focuses on the word
‘know’ instead of knowledge itself. This objection would be
misguided. The ambiguity response mentions the word ‘know’
only at the initial stage, and then immediately shifts its focus to
non-linguistic entities such as concepts and propositions. So advocates
of the ambiguity response would point out that, when we distinguish
between versions (i) through (iii), we are concerned with which
<em>propositions</em> the premises and the conclusion of the BIV
argument express, and thus are ultimately concerned with knowledge
itself. The upshot of their reply, then, is to distinguish between the
following two propositions:</p>

<blockquote>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td valign="top">(K<sub><em>if</em></sub>)</td>
<td valign="top">I know<sub><em>if</em></sub> that I have hands.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td valign="top">(K<sub><em>f</em></sub>)</td>
<td valign="top">I know<sub><em>f</em></sub> that I have hands.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p>

where the term ‘know<sub><em>if</em></sub>’ in
(K<sub><em>if</em></sub>) refers to infallible knowledge, whereas the
term ‘know<sub><em>f</em></sub>’ in K<sub><em>f</em></sub>
refers to fallible knowledge. Both of these proposition are about
knowledge itself, or, more precisely, about different <em>kinds</em> of
knowledge. The ambiguity response, therefore, is not vulnerable to the
replacement objection. Neither is contextualism. For according to
contextualism, what context determines is precisely which proposition
the conclusion of the BIV argument expresses: (K<sub><em>if</em></sub>)
or
 (K<sub><em>f</em></sub>).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#60" name="note-60">60</a>]</sup>
 Hence contextualism, is, notwithstanding
initial appearance, just as much about knowledge itself as is the
ambiguity response.</p>

<p>

How, then, do contextualism and the ambiguity response differ? Both
share the semantic ascent element. A satisfactory response to
skepticism requires of us to distinguish between various meanings of
the word ‘know’. Beyond that, they proceed in different
directions. Whereas according to contextualism, whether we reject or
endorse the conclusion of the BIV argument is a function of which
context we are in, the ambiguity response makes context irrelevant. It
makes context irrelevant because, no matter which context we are in, we
can always disambiguate. So, when we are thinking about or discussing
the BIV argument and are thus confronted with a salient error
possibility, we need not adopt a high-standards meaning of
‘know’. Rather, we can respond to the argument by saying
that, if it is about infallible knowledge its conclusion is true but
unremarkable, whereas if it is about fallible knowledge its conclusion
is remarkable but
 false.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#61" name="note-61">61</a>]</sup></p>

<h3><a name="NOT">5.6 Knowing One Isn't a BIV</a></h3>

<p>

Contextualism and the ambiguity response, as discussed in the previous
two sections, leave out one important detail. Contextualists say that,
relative to the standards of knowledge operational in low-standards
contexts, one can know that one isn't a BIV. Ambiguity theorists say
that, in the fallibilist sense of ‘know’, one can know that
one isn't a BIV. It might be objected that this is a bit optimistic.
Let us look at the issue from the evidentialist point of view. An
evidentialist who employs the ambiguity response would have to say that
one's evidence for thinking one isn't a BIV is good enough for
knowledge. But when the BIV hypothesis was introduced, we noted that
part of the hypothesis is the following point: whether you are a normal
person or a BIV makes no difference with regard to your evidence: it's
the same in either case. Call this the <em>identical evidence
thesis</em>. This thesis is simply part of the hypothesis in question
and must therefore be granted. How, then, could one possibly know, even
in the fallibilist sense of ‘know’, that one isn't a BIV? </p>

<p>

It would be a mistake to think the identical evidence thesis entails
that, as a normal person, one doesn't have good evidence for thinking
that one isn't a BIV. Nor does it entail that, as a BIV, one doesn't
have good evidence for thinking that one isn't a BIV. What it entails
is merely this: Whatever evidence one has, as a normal person regarding the
question of whether one is a BIV, one would have that very same
evidence if one were a BIV. This leaves open the possibility that in
either case, as a BIV or as a normal person, one has excellent evidence
for thinking that one is not a BIV.</p>

<p>

What might evidence for thinking that one isn't a BIV consist of?
For reasons of space, we will merely hint, by way of analogy, at how
this question might be answered. Note that the BIV hypothesis entails
various rather problematic propositions:</p>

<blockquote>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td valign="top">(a)</td>
<td valign="top">At least one BIV exists.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td valign="top">(b)</td>
<td valign="top">The know-how needed for envatting people exists.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td valign="top">(c)</td>
<td valign="top">The technology needed for envatting people
exists.</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</blockquote>

<p>

Compare:</p>

<blockquote>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td valign="top">(d)</td>
<td valign="top">At least one spaceship exists that can be used for
traveling to another galaxy and coming back within a couple of
months.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td valign="top">(e)</td>
<td valign="top">The know-how needed for building such a spaceship
exists.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td valign="top">(f)</td>
<td valign="top">The technology needed for building such a spaceship
exists.</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</blockquote>

<p>

According to the evidentialist anti-skepticism under consideration
here, you know, on the basis of your knowledge of how the world works,
that (d)–(f) are all
 false.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#62" name="note-62">62</a>]</sup>
 In the very least,
you can <em>come</em> to know this by consulting suitable experts. But
what about (a) through (c)? Well, if you know or can come to know that
(d)–(f) are all false, isn't it plausible to claim that you also
know or can come to know that (a)–(c) are all false? If a skeptic
were to argue that you know that (d)–(f) are all false, while you
do not know that any proposition in (a)–(c) is false, that
skeptic would incur the burden of having to dislodge the analogy, of
having to explain why, whereas knowledge that (d)–(f) are all
false is easily obtainable, knowledge of the falsehood of each
(a)–(c) is beyond our reach. This might not be easily
accomplished.</p>

<p>

Suppose you do know that (a)–(c) are all false. Then you know
that any proposition that <em>entails</em> (a)–(c) is false. The

<h3><a name="VEP">6.1 Virtue Epistemology</a></h3>

<p>

Epistemology, as commonly practiced, focuses on the subject's
beliefs. Are they justified? Are they instances of knowledge? When it
comes to assessing how the subject herself is doing with regard to the
pursuit of truth and the seeking of knowledge, this assessment is
carried out by looking at the epistemic quality of her beliefs.
According to virtue epistemology, the order of analysis ought to be
reversed. We need to begin with the subject herself and assess her
epistemic virtues and vices: her "good" and her "bad" ways of forming
beliefs. Careful and attentive reasoning would be an example of an
epistemic virtue; jumping to conclusions would be an example of an
epistemic vice. It is only <em>after</em> we have determined which ways
of forming beliefs count as epistemic virtues that we can, as a second
step, determine the epistemic quality of particular beliefs. Its
proponents construe virtue epistemology more or less stringently.
According to pure virtue epistemology, epistemic virtues and vices are
<em>sui generis</em>. They cannot be analyzed in terms of more
fundamental epistemic or nonepistemic concepts. Proponents of a less
stringent approach disagree with this; they would say that epistemic
virtues and vices can fruitfully be analyzed by employing other
concepts. Indeed, according to an externalist strand of virtue
epistemology, it is the very notion of reliability that we should
employ to capture the difference between epistemic virtues and vices.
Stable ways of forming beliefs are epistemic virtues if and only if
they tend to result in true beliefs, epistemic vices if and only if
they tend to result in false beliefs. Virtue epistemology, thus
conceived, is a form of
 reliabilism.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#64" name="note-64">64</a>]</sup></p>

<h3><a name="NEP">6.2 Naturalistic Epistemology</a></h3>

<p>

According to an extreme version of naturalistic epistemology, the
project of traditional epistemology, pursued in an <em>a priori</em>
fashion from the philosopher's armchair, is completely misguided. The
"fruits" of such activity are demonstrably false theories such as
foundationalism, as well as endless and arcane debates in the attempt
to tackle questions to which there are no answers. To bring epistemology on
the right path, it must be made a part of the natural sciences and
become cognitive psychology. The aim of naturalistic epistemology thus
understood is to <em>replace</em> traditional epistemology with an
altogether new and redefined project. According to a moderate version
of naturalistic epistemology, one primary task of epistemology is to
identify how knowledge and justification are anchored in the natural
world, just as it is the purpose of physics to explain phenomena like heat
and cold, or thunder and lightning in terms of properties of the
natural world. The pursuit of this task does not require of its
proponents to replace traditional epistemology. Rather, this moderate
approach accepts the need for <em>cooperation</em> between traditional
conceptual analysis and empirical methods. The former is needed for the
purpose of establishing a conceptual link between knowledge and
reliability, the latter for figuring out which cognitive processes are
reliable and which are
 not.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#65" name="note-65">65</a>]</sup></p>

<h3><a name="REP">6.3 Religious Epistemology</a></h3>

<p>

In the history of philosophy, there are several famous arguments for
the existence of God: the ontological argument, the cosmological
argument, and the argument from design. From an epistemological point
of view, the question is whether such arguments can constitute a
rational foundation of faith, or even give us knowledge of God. A
further question is whether, if God exists, knowledge of God might not
also be possible in other ways, for example, on the basis of perception
or perhaps mystical experiences. There is also a famous problem casting
doubt on the existence of God: Why, if God is an omniscient,
omnipotent, and benevolent being, is there evil in the world? Here, the
epistemological question is whether, based on this problem, we can know
that God (thus conceived) does not exist. Another, central issue for
religious epistemology is raised by evidentialism. According to
evidentialism, knowledge requires adequate evidence. However, there
does not seem to be any adequate evidence of God's existence. Is it
possible, then, for theists to endorse
 evidentialism?<sup>[<a href="notes.html#66" name="note-66">66</a>]</sup></p>

<h3><a name="MEP">6.4 Moral Epistemology</a></h3>

<p>

The basic moral categories are those of right and wrong action. When
we do theoretical ethics, we wish to find out what it is that makes a
right action right and a wrong action wrong. When we do practical or
applied ethics, we attempt to find out which actions are right and
which are wrong. The epistemological question these areas of philosophy
raise is this: How can we <em>know</em> any of that? Traditionally,
philosophers have attempted to answer the questions of ethics via
intuition, <em>a priori</em> reasoning, and the consideration of
hypothetical cases. Some philosophers who belong to the naturalistic
camp consider this approach misguided because they think that it is
unreliable and liable to produce results that merely reflect our own
cultural and social biases. Among those who think that moral knowledge
can be acquired via intuition and <em>a priori</em> reasoning, a
primary question is whether the kind of justification such methods can
generate is coherentist or foundationalist. Finally, a further
important question is whether moral knowledge is at all possible.
Knowledge requires truth and thus objective reality. According to
anti-realists, there is no objective reality of, and thus no truth
about, moral matters. Since what is known must be true, it is not easy
to see how, if anti-realism were correct, there could be knowledge of
moral
 matters.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#67" name="note-67">67</a>]</sup></p>

<h3><a name="SEP">6.5 Social Epistemology</a></h3>

<p>

When we conceive of epistemology as including knowledge and
justified belief as they are positioned within a particular social and
historical context, epistemology becomes social epistemology. How to
pursue social epistemology is a matter of controversy. According to
some, it is an extension and reorientation of traditional epistemology
with the aim of correcting its overly individualistic orientation.
According to others, social epistemology ought to amount to a radical
departure from traditional epistemology, which they see, like the
advocates of radical naturalization, as a futile endeavor. Those who
favor the former approach retain the thought that knowledge and
justified belief are essentially linked to truth as the goal of our
cognitive practices. They hold that there are objective norms of
rationality that social epistemologists should aspire to articulate.
Those who prefer the more radical approach would reject the existence
of objective norms of rationality. Moreover, since many view scientific
facts as social constructions, they would deny that the goal of our
intellectual and scientific activities is to find facts. Such
constructivism, if weak, asserts the epistemological claim that
scientific theories are laden with social, cultural, and historical
presuppositions and biases; if strong, it asserts the metaphysical
claim that truth and reality are themselves socially
 constructed.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#68" name="note-68">68</a>]</sup></p>

<h3><a name="FEP">6.5 Feminist Epistemology</a></h3>

<p>

When construed in a non-controversial way, the subject matter of
feminist epistemology consists of issues having to do with fair and
equal access of women to, and their participation in, the institutions
and processes through which knowledge is generated and transmitted.
Viewed this way, feminist epistemology can be seen as a branch of
social epistemology. When we move beyond this initial characterization,
what feminist epistemology is will become a matter of controversy.
According to some, it includes the project of studying and legitimizing
special ways in which only women can acquire knowledge. According to
others, feminist epistemology should be understood as aiming at the
political goal of opposing and rectifying oppression in general and the
oppression of women in particular. At the extreme end, feminist
epistemology is closely associated with postmodernism and its radical
attack on truth and the notion of objective
 reality.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#69" name="note-69">69</a>]</sup></p>
