<h1>Law and Language</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Thu Dec 5, 2002; substantive revision Fri Apr 15, 2016</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
The use of language is crucial to any legal system, not only in the
same way that it is crucial to politics in general, but also in two
special respects. Lawmakers characteristically use language to make
law, and law must provide for the authoritative resolution of disputes
over the effects of that use of language. Political philosophers are
not generally preoccupied with questions in the philosophy of
language. But legal philosophers are political philosophers with a
specialization that gives language (and philosophy of language) a
special
 importance.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-1" id="ref-1">1</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
Philosophy of law can gain from a good philosophical account of the
meaning and use of language, and from a good philosophical account of
the institutionalized resolution of disputes over language. Philosophy
of language can gain from studying the stress-testing of language in
legal regulation and dispute resolution. And philosophers of language
can gain from the reminder that their task is not only to account for
what people share in virtue of the mastery of a language; they also
need to account for the possibility of disagreements over the meaning
and use of language, and for the possibility that there might be good
reason for resolving those disagreements in one way rather than
another.</p>

<p>
In addition to their interest in the use of language in law,
philosophers of law have developed a second, interrelated interest in
using insights from the philosophy of language to address problems of
the nature of law. This article outlines some problems in each of
these two areas, after a brief historical note on the linguistic
preoccupations of legal philosophers.</p>

<h2 id="HistIntr">1. Historical introduction</h2>

<p>
Systematic efforts to use philosophical insights about language to
solve problems in philosophy of law are relatively recent. Jeremy
Bentham was perhaps the first to make a deliberate attempt at it. He
developed a radically empiricist theory of the meaning of words, which
supported his utilitarianism and his legal theory.</p>

<p>
Bentham wanted to abandon what he considered to be a nonsensical
mythology of natural rights and duties—that is, moral rights
and duties that people have regardless of whether anyone is prepared
to enforce them. He looked for ‘sensible’ phenomena by
which to explain the nature of law. Linguistic acts struck him as
respectably empirical phenomena, and he made them an essential element
of his theory of law. He based his
 ‘<a href="../legal-positivism/">legal positivism</a>’
 on his claims about the meaning and use of words. </p>

<p>
Language had not been especially important to the
 <a href="../natural-law-theories/">natural law</a>
 theorists whose views Bentham despised. They accounted for a law as a
certain sort of reason. From that perspective, philosophy of language
has no special role in explaining the nature of law. Philosophy of
language cannot explain the nature of reasons; it has the ancillary
role of explaining the possibility of communicating reasons and the
possibility of creating reasons by the use of language (so that
natural law theorists have the same reason as others to seek a good
account of the legal effects of the use of language, and of the role
of courts in resolving disputes over it). Bentham, by contrast, tried
to use the ‘sensible’ phenomenon of a perceptible,
intelligible linguistic act for his purpose of expounding the nature
of law by reference to empirical phenomena.</p>

<p>
Bentham seems to have thought of the meaning of a word in causal
terms, as its capacity to act on a subject by raising an image of
perceptible substances or emotions for which, he said, the word was a
name. ‘By these general terms or names, things and persons,
acts, and so forth are brought to view…’ (Bentham 1782,
82; see also Bentham 1776, 28, 108n). Words that do not bring to view
such perceptible things have no meaning, on his theory, except insofar
as they can be expounded by ‘paraphrasis’—Bentham’s 
method of translating whole sentences in which those words
are used into sentences that do raise images of perceptible
things.</p>

<p>
To many legal theorists that approach appeared, as H.L.A. Hart put it,
‘as a revelation, bringing down to earth an elusive notion and
restating it in the same clear, hard, empirical terms as are used in
science’ (Hart 2012, 84). The theory supported not only
Bentham’s empiricism, but also his utilitarianism, because it
privileged what he viewed as the ultimate sensible (and therefore
intelligible) ‘affections’: the pain and pleasure that
utilitarianism treats as the basis for a theory of value and of
morality.</p>

<p>
In his legal theory, this view of language became the basis of an
innovative account of law as the expression of the will of a sovereign
in a political community. Bentham stated it as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
A law may be defined as an assemblage of signs declarative of a
volition conceived or adopted by the <em>sovereign</em> in a state,
concerning the conduct to be observed in a certain <em>case</em> by a
certain person or class of persons, who in the case in question are or
are supposed to be subject to his power… (Bentham 1782, 1)
</blockquote>

<p>
He went on to explain that the signification of volition by such an
assemblage of signs must be backed by ‘motives’ of pain or
pleasure offered by the sovereign.</p>

<p>
Two features of this theory tie the philosophy of law to the
philosophy of language. One feature is methodological, and the other
is substantive. First, Bentham proposes his theory as a definition of
the term <i>a law</i> (see section 3.1 below, on ‘Definition as
a methodology in philosophy of law’). Secondly, he defines a law
as a particular kind of assemblage of signs (see section 2.1 below, on
‘Law and Signs’). In Bentham’s view, a law is an
assemblage of signs, and legal philosophy is a form of philosophy of
language. The legal theorist has a linguistic task of defining the
terms (especially <em>law</em>, but others as well) of legal
discourse.</p>

<p>
That, in brief, is the apogee of the use of philosophy of language in
philosophy of law. Bentham was ahead of his time. His theory of the
meaning and use of words anticipated various trends in
twentieth-century philosophy of language (including Frege’s and
Wittgenstein’s ‘context principle’, some views of logical
positivists, and the development of speech act theory). It was
H.L.A.Hart who, in the 1950s and 1960s, made a concerted effort to use
twentieth-century developments in philosophy of language to
‘elucidate’ the nature of law. He did so with an
enthusiasm for the work of Wittgenstein, and also of the Oxford
philosophers J.L.Austin and Paul Grice. So Hart had some advantages
over Bentham. Wittgenstein’s <em>Philosophical Investigations</em> had
been directed against the view that a word’s meaning is the thing for
which it stands as a name. That was one of the misconceptions that
distorted Bentham’s theory of the meaning of words: he thought that a
word like ‘right’ had to be a name for an entity, and that
since no such entity could be sensed, the word was a name for a
‘fictitious entity’—(Bentham 1782, 251). And
J.L.Austin took an attitude to ordinary discourse that was quite
opposed to that of Bentham, who thought that philosophy must tear away
the ‘veil of mystery’ that ordinary language throws over
every object of study (Bentham 1782, 251). Wittgenstein’s attitude was
more complex: he thought both that philosophers create philosophical
problems by bewitching themselves with language, and also that a clear
understanding of the use of language could provide healthy therapy for
people suffering from philosophical problems. Taking advantage of the
insights of Wittgenstein and J.L.Austin, Hart aimed to put philosophy
of language to work in addressing problems of legal philosophy,
without making what he regarded as Bentham’s extravagant mistakes.</p>

<p>
In 1961, Hart’s book <em>The Concept of Law</em> raised issues that
have occupied legal philosophers ever since. He borrowed J.L. Austin’s
method of ‘using a sharpened awareness of words to sharpen our
perception of the phenomena’ (Hart 2012, v, 14). Hart’s
observations about the use of language in law were elements in an
innovative approach to explaining the normativity of law—that
is, the fact that law presents itself as conferring rights and powers
and as imposing obligations and liabilities. Hart argued that we can
understand that feature of law more clearly, if we understand where
Bentham and his nineteenth-century disciple
 <a href="../austin-john/">John Austin</a>
 (not to be confused with J.L.Austin) went wrong in explaining the
meaning and use of normative language. Hart’s new approach to the
issue has been a starting point for discussions of the normativity of
law since the 1960s [see section 3.2 below].</p>

<p>
Ronald Dworkin argued that Hart’s focus on language had a toxic effect
on his whole approach to legal philosophy. He wrote that Hart suffered
from a ‘semantic sting’, because he wrongly thought
‘that lawyers all follow certain linguistic criteria for judging
propositions of law’ (Dworkin 1986, 45; see section 2.4 below).
That argument in the philosophy of language has set an agenda for much
debate in philosophy of law (see, for example, the essays in Coleman,
2001).</p>

<p>
Because of the allure of philosophy of language, and partly as a
result of the influence of Hart, the use of philosophy of language in
philosophy of law became the focus of much jurisprudential thought and
debate in the 20th century. One notable example is the work of Jerzy
Wróblewski, a Polish legal theorist who developed a
‘semantic conception of a legal norm’ (Wróblewski
1983), and offered a theory of legal language as a sub-type of natural
language with multiple ‘fuzzy’ characteristics
(Wróblewski 1985). In Italian analytical legal philosophy, the
influential theorist Norberto Bobbio began in the 1950s ‘to
consider law as a language and legal science as a meta-language’
(Pintore and Jori 1997, 3), in service of a theory of law based on a
non-cognitivist moral theory. Two succeeding generations of Italian
legal theorists have engaged in ‘dispute on semiotic ground,
rather than directly by arguments of general legal philosophical
positions’ (Pintore and Jori, 17).</p>

<p>
That development was one instance of the widespread use of views about
language in debunking conventional views about law in the 20th
century. Perhaps this development resulted not so much from the
influence of Bentham’s own writings, as from pursuit of the same
search that he undertook, for ways of identifying the elements of law
that suit empiricist philosophical sensibilities. The energetic
20th-century school of ‘Scandinavian legal realism’ viewed
legal terms like ‘right’ as ‘lacking semantic
reference’ and ‘denoting nothing’. So they
considered statements asserting the existence of rights, duties, and
other legal relations to be incapable of being true or false
(Olivecrona 1971, 246, 255, 261). They variously explained the use of
such statements as attempts to perform magical incantations, or as
tools for taking advantage of the psychological conditioning that
leads officials and citizens to act in one way or another when they
hear such statements (see the outline of Scandinavian realism in
Olivecrona 1971, 174–182, and see Ross 1956; see also section 5
of the entry on
 <a href="../lawphil-naturalism/">Naturalism in Legal Philosophy</a>).</p>
 
<p>
Similarly, various strands in the influential American legal academic
enterprise of ‘economic analysis of law’ share Bentham’s
debunking attitude toward central legal terms such as
‘right’ and ‘obligation’. Like Bentham, some
economic analysts oscillate (or equivocate) between (1) a moral theory
that reduces those normative terms to terms describing maximization of
human satisfactions, and (2) a theory that does not engage in moral
argument, but only claims to describe human motivation, accounting for
terms such as ‘right’ and ‘obligation’ as
rhetorical epithets that agents use to pursue what they will [see the
entry on
 <a href="../legal-econanalysis/">The Economic Analysis of Law</a>,
 section 2.2].</p>

<p>
Not all legal sceptics have been driven by the empiricism of Bentham
and the Scandinavians. Many other forms of scepticism about law have
also sought support in scepticism about the meaning of language.
Attacks on the coherence of the idea of the rule of law, and on the
meaningfulness of legal discourse, have used ideas in the philosophy
of language as diverse as Saul Kripke’s interpretation of
Wittgenstein’s remarks on rule following (see entry on
 <a href="../legal-reas-interpret/">Interpretation and Coherence in Legal Reasoning</a>),
 and deconstruction (see Endicott 2000, chapter 1).</p>

<h2 id="UseLangLaw">2. The use of language in law</h2>

<h3 id="LawSign">2.1 Law and signs</h3>

<p>
There are insurmountable objections to Bentham’s idea that a law is an
assemblage of signs. Law (in the sense that is relevant here) is the
systematic regulation of the life of a community by standards treated
as binding the members of the community and its institutions. A law is
a standard that is part of such a systematic form of regulation. Many
such standards have no canonical linguistic formulation (that is, no
form of words which, according to law, determines the content of the
standard). Lawyers in common law systems are familiar with such norms:
murder may be a criminal offence (or slander may be a tort, or certain
agreements may be enforceable as contracts…), not because of
the expression by any person or institution of a rule that it should
be so, but because the institutions of the legal system customarily
treat murder as an offence (or slander as a tort...). Moreover, common
law systems cannot be distinguished from legal systems consisting only
of linguistic acts, because no legal system consists only of
linguistic acts. A civil law system with a civil code and a criminal
code may make murder an offence (and slander a tort…) by a
written act, and it may be a written constitution that gives legal
force to the civil code and to the criminal code. But the validity of
the written constitution will depend on a norm which is not created by
the use of signs: the rule that <em>that</em> text is to be treated as
setting out the
 constitution.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-2" id="ref-2">2</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
Bentham and John Austin knew that there are rules of law that were not
laid down in language. Preserving their view of law as signification
of volition, they accounted for such laws as <em>tacit</em> commands
of the sovereign. That convoluted device cannot provide the resources
needed to explain the existence of a norm. In the right circumstances,
it is certainly possible to communicate without using signs (and in
particular, it is possible to convey a volition, backed by a threat of
force, just by saying or writing nothing). But silence can only be a
means of communication when the circumstances give it a meaning. We
can say that a tacit command has been issued only if it is possible to
identify features of the situation that distinguish the tacit
communication from mere inaction communicating nothing [see Hart 2012,
45–48]. Those features do not generally accompany customary
rules (in fact, they generally do not accompany customary rules). </p>

<p>
There is another conclusive objection to the idea that a law is an
assemblage of signs. When a lawmaking authority does use language to
make a law (as when a legislature uses a lawful process to pass an
enactment that is within its powers), the resulting law is not an
assemblage of signs. When I write you an email message to make a
request, the message is an assemblage of signs, but the request is not
an assemblage of signs; it is something I use the assemblage of signs
to make. The law that results from the use of language in an enactment
is a standard (or standards) whose existence and content are
determined by the legal effect that the law ascribes to that use of an
assemblage of signs.</p>

<p>
A law, therefore, is not an assemblage of signs, and law is not
necessarily made by the use of language, and every legal system has
norms that were not made by the use of language. Laws are not
linguistic acts. Laws, you may say, are standards of behaviour that
can be communicated (and some of which are made) by using language.
But even this is controversial among writers on legal
interpretation.</p>

<h3 id="LangLegaInte">2.2 Language and legal interpretation</h3>

<p>
What is the relationship between the language that is used to make
legal standards, and the law itself? If the law provides that a form
of words determines the content of a standard (such as a term of a
contract, or a criminal offence, or a duty of the executor of a will),
what is the effect of the use of the words? The question seems to
demand general theories of the meaning of language and of the
interpretation of communicative acts. If there are no general theories
to be had, then there is no general answer to the question. A theory
of meaning and interpretation of legal language would not be very much
less general than a theory of meaning and interpretation of
language.</p>

<p>
Legal theorists have tried to construct theories of the meaning of
legal language, and theories of legal interpretation, based on
specific features of law, of legal systems, and of the use of language
in making law. The entries on

 address theories of legal interpretation. Here I will address
features of language that raise challenges for philosophy of law and
for philosophy of language. Any good account of the meaning and
interpretation of the language used in making law needs to deal with
ways in which its legal effect depends on the context of its use
(addressed in this section). ‘Pragmatic’ effects of language
use, such as context-dependence, have long been the matter of
jurisprudential debate, and recently the use of Gricean and
post-Gricean
 <a href="../pragmatics/">pragmatics</a>
 has become a major field of debate among philosophers of language and
philosophers of law (section 2.3). These pragmatic features of
communication raise insuperable difficulties for any attempt to give a
true account of legal interpretation that is well enough organised to
deserve to be called a ‘theory’. Debates over the
pragmatics of legal language are often premised on the view that the
effect of a lawmaking use of language is that the content of the
linguistic communication in question determines the content of the
law. But even this premise is controversial, and has been denied by
theorists who account for the law as being determined by moral reasons
for conclusions as to what rights, duties, powers, and liabilities
people have, given the facts of legal practice and history (section
2.4). </p>

<p>
As an instance of controversy over the effect of the use of language
in law, consider the case of <em>Garner v Burr</em> [1951] 1 KB 31.
The legislature had made it an offence to use a ‘vehicle’
on a road without pneumatic tires. Lawrence Burr fitted iron wheels to
his chicken coop, and pulled it down the road behind his tractor. Burr
was prosecuted under the statute. The magistrates acquitted him,
apparently on the ground that a chicken coop is not a
‘vehicle’. The appeal court reversed that decision. The
Lord Chief Justice wrote,</p>

<blockquote>
The regulations are designed for a variety of reasons, among them the
protection of road surfaces; and, as this vehicle had ordinary iron
tyres, not pneumatic tyres, it was liable to damage the roads. [The
magistrates] have put what is in my opinion too narrow an
interpretation on the word ‘vehicle’ for the purposes of
this Act. It is true that, according to the dictionary definition, a
‘vehicle’ is primarily to be regarded as a means of
conveyance provided with wheels or runners and used for the carriage
of persons or goods. It is true that the [magistrates] do not find
that anything was carried in the vehicle at the time; but I think that
the Act is clearly aimed at anything which will run on wheels which is
being drawn by a tractor or another motor vehicle. Accordingly, an
offence was committed here. It follows that [the magistrates] ought to
have found that this poultry shed was a vehicle within the meaning of
s. 1 of the Road Traffic Act of 1930. ([1951] 1 KB 31 at 33)
</blockquote>

<p>
The magistrates and the appeal court seem to have disagreed over the
effect of two principles: a principle that statutes should only be
read as imposing criminal liability if they do so unequivocally, and a
principle that the purposes for which Parliament passed the statute
should be pursued. Assume that those principles are <em>legal</em>
principles, in the sense that a decision in accordance with the law
must respect them. The apparent tension between the principles might
be resolved in one of the following two ways. We do not have the
magistrates’ reasons, but let’s presume that they resolved the tension
in the first way; the appeal court resolved it in the second way:</p>

<blockquote>
1. by concluding that Parliament’s purposes can be respected
appropriately while still construing the prohibition strictly (so that
it is no offence to pull a chicken coop down the road on iron wheels,
because the chicken coop is not undeniably a vehicle), or

<p>
2. by concluding that Parliament’s purpose is sufficiently clear that
it can be pursued by convicting Mr.Burr, without jeopardising the
principle that criminal liabilities ought to be clearly spelled out,
even if someone might reasonably claim that a chicken coop on wheels
is not a ‘vehicle’.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
It may seem that this common sort of disagreement tells us nothing
about language, except perhaps that language is of no particular
importance in law. It may seem that the two courts did not disagree
over any question of language (after all, everyone involved was
competent in English), but only over whether they ought to give effect
to Parliament’s evident purpose of protecting roads by convicting
Mr.Burr, or whether that would be unfair to him.</p>

<p>
One explanation of the decision would be that the appeal court ignored
the word ‘vehicle’, and treated the pneumatic tires rule
as if it applied to anything that moves on wheels (instead of applying
to vehicles, which is what the legislation said). But the Lord Chief
Justice did not explain his decision that way. He did not hold that,
because Parliament aimed to protect roads from iron wheels, Burr
should be convicted regardless of the meaning of the word
‘vehicle’. He held that the magistrates ought to have
found that the chicken coop <em>was</em> a vehicle, ‘for the
purposes’ of the Road Traffic Act. Presumably the magistrates,
too, considered themselves to be giving effect to the language of the
Act, rather than ignoring (in the interests of fairness) what
Parliament had enacted.</p>

<p>
No doubt, legal decisionmakers sometimes depart from the language of
valid enactments (or wills, or contracts...). They may do so
corruptly, or in the exercise of an equitable jurisdiction to depart
from the law, or because they consider that justice demands it even if
the law accords them no power to depart from the language. But the
magistrates and the appeal judges evidently saw themselves as giving
effect to the language of the Road Traffic Act in <em>Garner v
Burr</em>. And the sort of disagreement that arose in that case
(disagreement over the legal effect of the use of a word) is so common
that we seem to find a paradox: competent speakers of the English
language share a knowledge of the meaning of the word
‘vehicle’, yet they disagree—apparently 
sincerely—over the effect of legislation using the word.</p>

<p>
To resolve the apparent paradox, we can say that what speakers of the
English language share, in virtue of their grasp of the meaning of a
word like ‘vehicle’, is an ability to use the word in a
way that depends on the context. The question of whether a chicken
coop on wheels counts as a ‘vehicle’ would be a different
question (and might have a different answer), if another statute or
regulation imposed a tax on ‘vehicles’. The relevant
considerations might be different again if a statute or regulation
required ‘vehicles’ to keep to the left-hand side of the
road. The Lord Chief Justice was right that a dictionary definition of
‘vehicle’ could not conclude the question of whether the
chicken coop was a vehicle in <em>Garner v Burr</em>, because the
purpose of a dictionary definition is to point the reader to features
of the use of the word that can be more-or-less important in a variety
of more-or-less analogical ways in various contexts. A definition of
‘vehicle’ as a mode of conveyance offers the reader one
central strand in the use of that word, but does not tell the reader
whether a more-or-less analogical extension of the word to a chicken
coop on wheels is warranted or unwarranted by the meaning of the word.
Another way of stating this resolution of the apparent paradox is by
distinguishing between the meaning of a word (which the magistrates
and the appeal judges all knew) and the way in which a communicative
act using the word ought to be understood (over which they disagreed).
What the judges and magistrates in <em>Garner v Burr</em> shared was a
knowledge of the meaning of the word ‘vehicle’, and what
they disagreed over was the effect of the legislature’s use of the
word.</p>

<h3 id="PragLegaLang">2.3 The pragmatics of legal language</h3>

<p>
The dependence of the effect of legal language on context is an
instance of a general feature of communication, which some
philosophers of language have approached by distinguishing semantics
from pragmatics. The distinction is, roughly, between the meaning of a
word or phrase or other linguistic expression, and the effect that is
to be ascribed to the use of the expression in a particular way, by a
particular user of the language, in a particular context. The
pragmatics of legal language is a vast field, because the term
‘pragmatics’ could be used as a heading for much of what
modern legal scholars and theorists have described as grounds for
interpretation (and also as a heading for much that they have
described as the theory of interpretation -since
‘pragmatics’ is a term not only for effects of
communication, but also for the study of those effects). For example,
the work of the judges in <em>Garner v Burr</em> can be described as
an exercise in pragmatic inference. The technical sound of the word
‘pragmatics’ may suggest that it is a term for the
theoretical study of its object; in fact, the field of study is what
might be inferred from the fact that someone said what they said in
the context in which they said it. No object of study is less apt for
theorising. </p>

<p>
This vast field has been much studied over millennia by lawyers and
philosophers, but only recently through the use of resources that may
be borrowed from the 20th-century development of
‘pragmatics’ as a discipline in linguistics and the
philosophy of language. Much recent work in the pragmatics of legal
language has focused on Gricean and post-Gricean pragmatics, as a
source of insights into the theory of legal interpretation (see e.g.
Marmor 2008, 2014, Soames 2008, Ekins 2012 (see pp 205-211), Carston
2013, Solum 2013; on Gricean and post-Gricean pragmatics, see
 <a href="../pragmatics/">Pragmatics</a>).</p>
 
<p>
It is controversial whether legal pragmatics is simply a part of the
pragmatics of language use in general (see Dascal and Wróblewski
1988). It stands to reason that if the pragmatics of language use
depends on the context of an utterance, the legal context of a
lawmaking use of language will have implications for the meaning
conveyed and, therefore, for the law that is made. Scott Soames has
argued that the question of the relation between the content of the
law, and authoritative sources such as statutes, is ‘an instance
of the more general question of what determines the contents of
ordinary linguistic texts’ (Soames 2008). It is a popular idea
that when a legislature enacts a statute, ‘The content of the
statute is what the lawmakers asserted and committed themselves to, in
adopting the statutory language’ (Soames 2008). Speakers can
commit themselves to something that they have not asserted, and can
make assertions in contexts that make it clear that they are not
committed to what they have asserted.</p>

<p>
But Andrei Marmor has argued that the pragmatics of legal language is
unique in crucial respects (Marmor 2008), with pragmatic
considerations playing some very significantly lesser role in law,
than in other contexts: ‘In ordinary conversations, pragmatic
enrichment is the norm, not the exception; in statutory law, it is the
exception’ (Marmor 2014, 34). In his view, the Gricean maxims of
conversation, derived from a general principle of cooperation, do not
straightforwardly apply in legislative communication, because
legislative communication is ‘strategic’ rather than
cooperative (Marmor 2014, 45-57). Likewise, Francesca Poggi has argued
that Grice’s theory does not apply to legislation, because of
the ‘conflictual behaviour’ of those addressed by
legislation (Poggi 2011, 35). As Marmor points out, speakers and
listeners in strategic communication take advantage of uncertainties
in the
 <a href="../implicature/">implicatures</a>
 to be derived from pragmatic norms of communication. For present
purposes, we can think of an implicature as a proposition that a
person is to be understood to have conveyed by using language in a
particular way, although it is not expressed by what the person said
(see Grice 1975, 43-4). Speakers may exploit implicatures in order to
avoid asserting what they prefer to implicate, and listeners may
exploit uncertainties concerning implicatures in order to bend the
effect of a communication to their liking. Yet these aspects of
communication are not distinctive to law making. And they depend on
cooperation among participants in the ‘conversation’ in
question: some degree of cooperation is necessary in order for it to
make any sense for a speaker to take advantage of an implicature, or
for a listener to treat an uncertain implicature as a genuine
implicature.</p>

<p>
What has been called ‘near-side’ pragmatics is a matter of
determining what is said by an utterance; in informal conversation it
involves the use of indexicals and pronominal figures that are avoided
in legislation, and involves the implications of context for an
understanding of the uses of terms. And ‘far-side’
pragmatics (determining what is implicated rather than said, and
determining what speech acts are carried out by means of an utterance)
can involve figurative uses of language, sarcasm, innuendos, and other
techniques that lawmakers avoid (for Korta and Perry’s
distinction between ‘near-side’ and ‘far-side’
pragmatics, see
 <a href="../pragmatics/">Pragmatics</a>).
 There is some force in Marmor’s claim that pragmatics is different in
law. Legislation systematically avoids many communicative devices that
can be very useful in other contexts of communication. But those
devices are also avoided in a very wide range of other formalized and
technical uses of language—for example, in most wedding
invitations, in Wikipedia, and in well-written instruction guides for
applying for bank account or a university programme or for operating a
rice cooker.</p>

<p>
Yet the pragmatic effects of communication are essential in all those
contexts of language use, and are essential to the legislative use of
language. This is true both of ‘near-side’ and
‘far-side’ pragmatics. The discussion of the decision in
<em>Garner v Burr</em>, above, provides an illustration of the ways in
which the context of a legislative enactment can determine the
reference of terms such as ‘vehicle’, and this
determination of meaning is an aspect of near-side pragmatics. The
dispute over the requirement of pneumatic tires on
‘vehicles’ in <em>Garner v Burr</em> can be understood as
a dispute over the effect of the context on the content of the
regulatory provision; another way of making the same point is to
describe it as a dispute over the implicatures to be drawn from the
fact of the enactment of that provision. This aspect of the pragmatics
of legal language is simply an instance of the pragmatics of the use
of language in general (it would be very easy to formulate a version
of the apparent paradox from <em>Garner v Burr</em>, discussed in
section 2.2 above, in a non-legal context).</p>

<p>
The role of far-side pragmatics is illustrated by the master
implicature of every legislative act: it is never said in legislation,
but there is always an implicature, that the rights and duties and
powers established by the legislation are to be <em>legal</em> rights
and duties and powers, under the law of the jurisdiction for which the
enactment is made (see Endicott 2014, 55). Very many other more
particular lawyers’ presumptions serve as maxims of the pragmatics of
lawmaking (such as the presumption that a new enactment overrides a
contrary previous enactment).</p>

<p>
It is worth noting, as well, that the diversity of contexts of
communication (even the diversity of conversations that the same two
people may have, let alone all the diversity of exchanges that might
be called ‘conversations’ by more or less remote analogy)
is so great, that the variations among pragmatic aspects of ordinary
conversations are much wider and deeper, than any general distinction
that can be drawn between legislative communication as a class, and
ordinary conversations as a class. The use of language in making law
is so closely interwoven with the use of language to exercise
authority in other contexts, and with the use of language in games, in
talk of what is right and wrong, and generally in communication in
families and in organisations of every kind, that the pragmatics of
legal language is best seen as a deeply integral part of the
pragmatics of the use of language in general.</p>

<p>
It may seem otherwise, because the persons to whom laws are addressed
can be extraordinarily creative in finding ways in which they can fit
the laws to their own interests, and persons in a dispute over the law
tend to disagree deeply over the effect of the language that has been
used to make law (so that it is not at all unusual for each side to
end up with a deeply-felt conviction that the law is so clearly on his
or her own side, that no reasonable person could think otherwise). So
it seems, as Marmor argues, that the use of language to make law is
not part of a cooperative exchange between lawmakers and the persons
to whom their communications are addressed. For this very reason, of
course, every legal system has tribunals for the resolution of
disputes; they are always an integral part of the system of governance
in a state that is ruled by law, although they very often have various
forms of independence from other institutions of the system. The
tribunals or courts typically have authority to interpret the language
of the law, and to determine its effect in particular cases. Unlike
the parties to a dispute, courts are characteristically involved with
the lawmakers in the enterprise of governance (even where the courts
are independent), and often have their own lawmaking capacities. Their
role in the system is the substratum for a cooperative principle that
has even deeper significance (and somewhat simpler implications) in
the operation of a legal system, than Grice’s cooperative principle
has in ordinary conversation. And, of course, that cooperative role of
a court in the legal system constrains the arguments of parties to a
dispute: however strongly they are inclined to twist the language of
the law (and however strongly they may feel that the other side is
twisting the language of the law), they need an argument that will
persuade an institution that is committed, at least in principle, to
cooperative interpretation of lawmaking acts.</p>

<p>
The problem faced in cases like <em>Garner v Burr</em> is an
especially vivid reminder of a problem that philosophers of language
have long been more or less aware of (see Aristotle’s discussion of
the notion of ‘friendship’ in Eudemian Ethics VII, 2,
1236a 33). The context-dependence of the meaning of utterances
requires an account of linguistic competence that relates it to other
human capacities—capacities to judge the importance of context
and to draw analogies. It would be a mistake in the philosophy of
language to account for language in a way that divorces its mastery
from other aspects of reason. That connection between the use of
language and reason is also illustrated by the contentious nature of
the use of language in law. Much work on pragmatics by philosophers of
language has concerned the conditions for understanding an utterance;
judicial disputes over language are a reminder that those 
conditions—even though they are conditions of intelligibility of
communication—lend themselves to disagreement and to reasoned
dispute over how an utterance is to be understood (see Carston 2013,
for discussion of controversies over the applications of
conversational maxims). The special feature that distinguishes the
legal use of language from ordinary conversation is not that
participants in a legal system act strategically while participants in
an ordinary conversation act cooperatively; the special feature is
that legal systems need institutions and processes for resolution of
the disputes about the application of language that arise as a result
of its context-dependence, and as a result of other pragmatic aspects
of communication.</p>

<h3 id="SemaStin">2.4 The Semantic Sting</h3>

<p>
Discussions of the pragmatics of legal language are expressly or
implicitly premised on a view of the relation between a law-making use
of language, and the law that is made. It is the view that if a body
or person is authorised to make law, it makes the law that it
communicates by its use of
 language.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-3" id="ref-3">3</a>]</sup>
 I will call that ‘the communication model’. It must be
qualified in at least four ways, because the law itself regulates the
making of law:</p>

<ol>

<li>the law that is made will be limited by any limit on the power of
the law maker (as to the substance of the law that it can make, or as
to the process by which it can lawfully make law), and</li>

<li>rules of law may qualify the law that is made, in a variety of
ways that are not susceptible of any general
 characterisation<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-4" id="ref-4">4</a>]</sup>
 (see Solum 2013 for an extensive discussion of ways in which the law
that is made by a communicative act may be qualified), and</li>

<li>courts may resolve indeterminacies in the effect of an act of law
making, and where they do so, their decisions may have conclusive
legal effect, and</li>

<li>if a court departs from what the law maker communicated (for good
reasons or bad), the decision of the court may have conclusive legal
effect (for the parties, and also for the future if the decision is
treated as a precedent). </li>
</ol>

<p>
Even with those qualifications, some theorists reject the
communication model. They argue that the identification of legal
rights and duties cannot be based merely on facts, such as the fact
that an authority has communicated such-and-such. Mark Greenberg has
argued against the communication model (Greenberg 2011, 221). In his
view,</p>

<blockquote>
Trying to understand legislation on the model of communication is
misguided because legislation and legislative systems have purposes
that have no parallel in the case of communication and that may be
better served if a statute’s contribution to the content of the law is
not constituted by what is communicated by the legislature. (Ibid; for
an argument against Greenberg’s claim, see Marmor 2014, 15-22)
</blockquote>

<p>
The most influential theory to have denied the communication model is
that of Ronald Dworkin, as it emerged in his argument against the idea
that the law of a country is a system of rules. H.L.A.Hart had tried
to explain the nature of a legal system on the basis of social rules
for identifying the law of a community (‘rules of recognition’), 
which provide shared tests of validity for rules of the system. Hart treated
it as obvious that such rules of recognition commonly identify the
acts of law-making authorities as sources of law, conferring power on
those authorities to make law, and that (subject to qualifications on
the communication model such as those listed above) the law becomes
what a lawmaker conveys that it is to be, in the communicative act by
which it exercises such a power.</p>

<p>
On that view, the content of the law of a community depends on a
conventional way of recognizing legal rules. But if members of the
community share a way of recognizing their law, how can they engage in
the deep disputes about the law that we are all so familiar with?
Dworkin made that question into a focus of jurisprudential debate. And
he framed the question as an objection to a misguided view of
language, and of the relation between law and language. He began his
book <em>Law’s Empire</em> (Dworkin 1986b) by contending that legal
theorists like Hart cannot explain theoretical disagreement in legal
practice, because they think that lawyers share uncontroversial tests
(tests which Dworkin termed ‘criteria’) for the truth of
propositions of law. The ‘semantic sting’ involves the
misconception that the language of the law can be meaningful only if
lawyers share such criteria. It is fatal to a legal theory, because it
leads the theorist to think that people cannot have any deep (or
‘substantive’ or ‘genuine’) disagreement about
the law. They can only disagree (1) about empirical questions such as
what words were used in a statute, or (2) about how to resolve
penumbral cases, or (3) about whether the law should be changed. If
you suffer from the semantic sting, you will conclude that disagreeing
about the criteria for application of the language of the law would be
like using the same words with different meanings. People who disagree
in that way are only talking past each other. Here is how Dworkin sets
out the views of theorists who suffer from the semantic sting:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
We follow shared rules, they say, in using any word: these rules set
out criteria that supply the word’s meaning. Our rules for using
‘law’ tie law to plain historical fact. It does not follow
that all lawyers are aware of these rules in the sense of being able
to state them in some crisp and comprehensive form. For we all follow
rules given by our common language of which we are not fully aware.
…We all use the same factual criteria in framing, accepting,
and rejecting statements about what the law is, but we are ignorant of
what these criteria are. Philosophers of law must elucidate them for
us by a sensitive study of how we speak. They may disagree among
themselves, but that alone casts no doubt on their common assumption,
which is that we do share some set of standards about how
‘law’ is to be used. (Dworkin, 1986b, 31)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Dworkin argued that legal philosophy needs to make a fresh start, in
order to face the challenge of explaining disagreement about the law.
Any theory of law, he claimed, needs to be a ‘constructive
interpretation’ of legal practice. A constructive interpretation
is one that simultaneously fits the facts of the object of
interpretation (in the case of legal interpretation, the object is not
some particular communicative act by a lawmaker, but the entire
practice of the community) <em>and</em> portrays it as an object that
achieves its purpose. On this view a theory that does not present law
as an exercise in constructive interpretation cannot even compete as a
theory of law, because it suffers from the semantic sting. And the
communication model is incompatible with the idea that law is an
exercise in constructive interpretation.</p>

<p>
The semantic sting really does seem a gruesome fate for a lawyer,
because those who suffer from it would have to say that no one really
disagrees with anyone about the law: whenever people think they
disagree about how to identify the law on any point, that fact in
itself would demonstrate that there is nothing to disagree about:
there <em>is no</em> law on the point at issue, if the agreed ways of
identifying the law do not decide the point. So if you suffer from the
semantic sting, you will conclude that sincere, competent lawyers will
never disagree with each other. When an apparent disagreement arises,
they will throw up their hands and say that there is no law on the
point. If you suffer from the semantic sting, you will think that at
least one party to any dispute over the content of the law is both
legally inept and philosophically misguided, or is just a liar.</p>

<p>
If you think that law is made by the communicative acts of lawmaking
authorities, and if everyone understands the language in question,
then it may seem that you are doomed to conclude that competent
lawyers cannot disagree in good faith as to what law has been made. To
meet Dworkin’s challenge, it is necessary to explain how it can be
reasonable to disagree over the application of rules made by
communicative acts. How can competent and (let’s presume) sincere and
reasonable adjudicators differ (as the Lord Chief Justice and the
magistrates differed in <em>Garner v Burr</em>) on the question of
what the law allows or prohibits?</p>

<p>
The potential for such a reasonable disagreement (even among people
who understand the language of the lawmaker equally well) is very
readily to be found in the complex pragmatic considerations discussed
in section 2.3 above, concerning the effect of a lawmaking
communicative act. If we accept the communication model, we will
conclude that participants in legal practice typically share an
understanding of the meaning of the language of legislation; yet it is
still clear that there are bound to be deep disagreements as to the
implications of those law-making acts in some cases. Disagreement
about the content of the law will arise if the persons subject to the
law must apply a test that, like the legislation in <em>Garner v
Burr</em>, can be controversial in its application in some unusual
case. Likewise, disagreement will arise if the legislative act
delegates authority to a court (as legislatures often do), or if the
legislature communicates unclearly. The persons subject to the law
must decide (and may dispute) how to interpret the acts of the
legislature. And it may also be unclear (and controversial) in some
cases whether the legislature has the power that it claims to have
exercised, or whether a court has power to depart (and if so, whether
it would be right for it to depart) from a decision of the
legislature.</p>

<p>
Does the recent outpouring of work on the pragmatics of legal language
provide a successful defence of the communication model against
Dworkin’s semantic sting argument? Dworkin would presumably have
extended his ‘semantic sting’ argument into an argument that the
communication model suffers from a ‘semantic-and-pragmatic
sting’—unless, that is, it evolves into a theory of
‘constructive interpretation’, holding that the
‘pragmatic’ aspects of the lawmaking use of language require the
interpreter to construct the theory of rights and duties that best
fits and justifies the whole pattern of legal practice. But Dworkin’s
semantic sting argument cannot in itself undermine the communication
model, because his argument was based on an impoverished view of the
controversy that can result from communication. </p>

<h3 id="EvalConsNatuLaw">2.5 Evaluative considerations and the nature of law</h3>

<p>
The importance of the context of the word’s use requires anyone
addressing the problem in <em>Garner v Burr</em> to make evaluative
judgments, just to apply the putatively descriptive term
‘vehicle’. The context of use is a criminal prohibition
imposed for a presumably good public purpose of protecting road
surfaces. To determine in that context whether the word
‘vehicle’ extends to a chicken coop on wheels, you need to
address (and to resolve any tension between) the two principles
mentioned above: that the purposes for which Parliament passed the
statute should be pursued, and that criminal liability should not be
extended to conduct that has not been unequivocally prohibited.
Because of that context, the question of the meaning and application
of the language of the statute cannot be answered without making
judgments on normative questions of how those principles are to be
respected. The role of evaluative considerations in the application of
ordinary descriptive terms like ‘vehicle’ raises a
challenge for any thorough-going scepticism about value: the challenge
is to decide whether to adopt a thorough-going scepticism about the
meaning and application of descriptive language, which seems to follow
from general scepticism concerning value. </p>

<p>
For philosophy of law, the dependence of descriptive language on
evaluative considerations raises special problems. If you cannot tell
whether to describe an object as a ‘vehicle’ without
evaluative reasoning, then you cannot tell what law the Road Traffic
Act makes merely by pointing out physical facts (such as that there
were wheels on the chicken coop) and social facts (such as that
Parliament used the word ‘vehicle’ in the Act, or the
complex social fact of the whole pattern of uses that have been made
of the word ‘vehicle’). You cannot identify the law (that
is, you cannot tell what legal rights and duties people have) without
evaluative reasoning. That conclusion, if it is sound, seems to have
important implications for the long-running debates in theory of law
over the relation between fact and value in law, and over relations
between law and morality. The conclusion seems to contradict one of
the most provocative and controversial claims in the theory of 
law—the ‘sources thesis’, which Joseph Raz has stated
as follows: </p>

<blockquote>
All law is source-based. A law is source-based if its existence and
content can be identified by reference to social facts alone, without
resort to any evaluative argument. (Raz (1994), 194–5; see entry
 <a href="../lawphil-nature/">The Nature of Law</a>)
 </blockquote>

<p>
We can only decide whether the chicken coop was a
‘vehicle’ for the purpose of the Road Traffic Act by
understanding the Act as pursuing something that the legislature
decided was worth pursuing, and by making an evaluative judgment as to
whether due respect for the pursuit of that value through the
enactment, and due respect for the requirement of certainty in
criminal liability, support the conclusion that the chicken coop is a
‘vehicle’ in the relevant sense. So we cannot apply the
law without resort to evaluative reasoning. </p>

<p>
It may seem that judges need to make such evaluative judgments only in
borderline cases for the application of legal language—and
that they have discretion in those cases (that is, the judge must make
a decision that is not determined by law). But a clear case of a
vehicle counts as a ‘vehicle’ for the purpose of the Road
Traffic Act just because the evaluative considerations that justify
the use of the word ‘vehicle’ in that context clearly
support its application. The sources thesis seems to be contradicted
even in the clearest cases of the application of a law stated in
descriptive language, if the content of such laws can only be
identified on the basis of an evaluative judgment as to how the
purposes of the law ought to be conceived. That form of evaluation,
you may say, can only be carried out by engaging in the very same form
of reasoning that, in Raz’s theory, law excludes. </p>

<p>
It is true that, in order to decide what the sources have directed
(and thereby, in Raz’s terms, to identify the existence and content of
a law), you need to understand the sense in which a word like
‘vehicle’ is used. But the existence and content of the
offence can still be identified without first judging whether it ought
to be an offence to do what Mr.Burr did, or whether there ought to be
any offence at all of driving without pneumatic tires. The sources
thesis articulates this important insight: in English law, there was
no offence of driving without pneumatic tires (whether or not it would
be a good idea for that to be an offence), until Parliament acted to
create it. And then, it became an offence because Parliament had done
so (whether or not it was a good idea to do so). Moreover, if the
institutions of the law had not been prepared to treat the chicken
coop as a vehicle, then because of that social fact, it would have
been false (after a decision with precedential effect) to say that it
was an offence to pull a chicken coop on iron wheels on the road.
Because law is systematic (in the sense that the law gives legal
institutions authority to identify the law), the courts’ decisions
determine legal rights and obligations. So, we might say, a law is
source-based if its existence and content can be identified by
reference to social facts alone, without resort to any evaluative
argument, other than whatever evaluative argument may be needed to
determine the social facts, or to work out their implications for the
case at hand. </p>

<p>
Raz’s explanation of the nature of law is not undermined by the fact
that evaluative judgments are necessary in order to identify the
implications of the social fact that Parliament prohibited vehicles
from being driven without pneumatic tires. It is still possible for
legal directives to have the exclusionary force that, in his theory of
authority, they claim. The court in <em>Garner v Burr</em> can decide
whether it is an offence to pull a chicken coop on wheels without
pneumatic tires, without answering the question, ‘should it be
an offence to drag a chicken coop down a road on iron wheels?’,
or the question, ‘should it be an offence to use a vehicle
without pneumatic tires?’ But the court needs to ask the related
question: ‘what is the relevant sense of “vehicle”
for the purposes of this Act?’ It is what Parliament did that
determines Lawrence Burr’s liability; it may take evaluative reasoning
to answer the question of social fact, ‘what did Parliament
prohibit, when it prohibited vehicles from being driven without
pneumatic tires?’</p>

<h3 id="VaguLangLaw">2.6 Vagueness in language and in law</h3>

<p>
A speed limit on a highway is a fairly precise law: in most cases it
is clear whether a driver has conformed to the standard. But highway
traffic regulation also needs (and typically uses) rules against
careless or dangerous driving. Such abstract standards are designed to
control a variety of behaviour that lacks the uniform, measurable
feature (speed) that allows the precision of a speed limit.</p>

<p>
Vague laws, such as a rule against careless driving, pose problems for
philosophy of law that are related to problems that philosophers of
language and of logic have addressed in arguments about the
<em>paradox of the heap</em> (see the entry on the
 <a href="../sorites-paradox/">Sorites Paradox</a>).
 Suppose that, according to law, it counts as careless driving to
drive with bald tires. If the law gives a precise definition of the
thickness of tire tread that counts as bald, then in this regard the
law is (more or less) precise, and for the purposes of the law,
virtually every tire is either clearly bald or clearly not bald. But
if there is no such precise standard, then there are ‘borderline
cases’ in which it is neither clearly true that a tire is bald,
nor clearly false. And we can construct a <em>sorites</em> series, and
a sorites paradox for the application of the law:</p>

<ol>

<li>A new tire is not
 bald.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-5" id="ref-5">5</a>]</sup></li>
 
<li>If a tire is not bald, it does not become bald by losing one
molecule of rubber from its tread.</li>

<li>So a tire that has lost one molecule of rubber is not bald.</li>

<li>Reiterate 2.</li>

<li>So a tire that has lost two molecules of rubber is not bald.</li>

<li>Reiterate 2.</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>

<p>
…</p>

<p>
N. So a tire never goes bald.</p>

<p>
N+1. So no one can ever break the rule against careless driving by
driving with bald tires.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The false conclusions N and N+1 arise by apparently valid reasoning
from apparently true premises. Philosophical approaches to the paradox
seem to have implications for legal theory: arguments that vague terms
are <em>incoherent</em>, and that reasoning with them is impossible,
would support arguments that vague laws are incoherent. Since vague
laws are an important part of every legal system [Endicott 2001], the
implications seem to be far-reaching.</p>

<p>
‘<em>Epistemic</em>’ arguments that the only way to solve
the paradox is to deny the truth of step 2 (so that vagueness is a
problem of ignorance as to where the sharp boundary is between tires
that are and are not bald) imply that there is always a single right
answer to the application of a law stated in vague language. Arguments
that the application of a vague expression is indeterminate in
borderline cases (or in some borderline cases) imply that the
application of a law that can be expressed in vague language is
indeterminate in some cases. But it is even controversial whether such
theories matter to legal philosophy [Schiffer, 2001 and Greenawalt,
2001].</p>

<p>
Philosophers of law have not been especially concerned with the
question of how to solve (or to resolve) the paradox, but they have
debated the nature of borderline cases, and its implications for the
role of judges in a community, and for the possibility of the rule of
law. If the application of vague laws is indeterminate in some cases,
then in those cases a judge (or other official) responsible for
applying the law cannot decide the matter by applying the law, since
the law does not determine the matter (and in fact, no one can use the
law to guide their conduct).</p>

<p>
Some legal philosophers have responded to this problem by claiming
that judges never (or virtually never) have such a choice, and that
there is virtually always a right answer to a question of legal rights
[Dworkin, 1986a, 1991]. Others have responded to the problem by
claiming that the law gives judges discretion, in all or some
borderline cases, to decide issues that the law does not determine
[Hart, 2012, chapter VII.1]. That is, the standards of the system
leave a choice to judges as to how to decide the issue. Then judges
must treat the parties to litigation as having liabilities or
obligations or entitlements that were not determinately theirs at the
time when the dispute arose. That power of judges appears to some to
run contrary to the principle of the rule of law, that laws (or at
least, that legal burdens) should not be imposed retroactively.</p>

<p>
As a result, vagueness raises an extraordinarily important set of
problems for the philosophy of law. It may seem to be a different set
of problems from those raised by vague language in general, because of
three ways in which the legal use of vague language is distinctive.
First, legal systems need to regulate the effects of the vagueness of
language, providing for authoritative resolution of disputes as to the
effect of vague language (where in some other domains of the use of
language, we can get by without any such resolution).</p>

<p>
Secondly, vagueness in legal language is distinctive because lawmakers
avoid ordinary vague expressions like ‘driving very fast’
and prefer precise speed limits (or blood alcohol limits, or tire
tread measurements). When the law uses vague language, it uses
<em>abstract</em> evaluative expressions. Lawmakers typically do not
prohibit driving with ‘bald’ tires; they either impose
precise measures, or address the problem as part of an abstract,
general prohibition on, e.g., ‘careless’ driving. An
abstract standard calls upon its subjects to construct a view of the
care that, in their law, a driver owes to another person—(and
not merely to ask the seemingly pointless question, how bald is a bald
tire?). Such standards are a very common and a very important part of
lawmaking technique. A negligence standard may require
‘reasonable care’; a constitution may define a procedural
right as a right to ‘due process’, or a contract may
require the delivery of goods in ‘satisfactory condition’.
Those abstract terms are very different from the vague descriptive
terms that philosophers of logic use to illustrate their arguments
about the sorites paradox (‘heap’, ‘thin’,
‘bald’, ‘red’…). It misses the point,
you might think, to say that abstract standards do not draw sharp
lines, because they are not designed to draw lines at all. By using an
abstract standard, the lawmaker requires the people who must apply the
law to construct a theory of the standard (of care, or of process, or
of condition), which will draw any line that is needed. Ronald Dworkin
has claimed that abstract expressions are not vague at all—that 
they have a different semantics from that of vague words like
‘heap’ (Dworkin, 1986b, 17).</p>

<p>
Thirdly, the legal context of an expression may be very different from
other contexts of its use. Principles of legal interpretation (for
example, a legal requirement that vague criminal enactments are to be
interpreted as applying only in clear cases) may make the legal effect
of the use of a word more precise than its ordinary effect. The
interpretation of a legal prohibition on careless driving demands an
understanding of what counts as careless <em>for the purposes of the
law</em>.</p>

<p>
Given these distinctive features of law, it may seem that logicians’
discussions of heaps and baldness are beside the point, and that legal
reasoning is exempt from any implications that the paradox may have
for logic or for semantics. That would be a mistake. Statements of law
that use abstract expressions certainly are vague in the philosophers’
sense: that is, they appear to be susceptible to sorites reasoning.
‘Careless driving’ in its legal sense is a much more
complex concept than ‘driving with bald tires’, and
driving with bald tires is an instance of careless driving only in
virtue of the evaluative and contextual considerations that must be
understood if the law of careless driving is to be understood. Yet
‘careless driving’ is susceptible to sorites reasoning
precisely because those evaluative and contextual considerations give
reason to conclude that it is careless to drive with bald tires. For
all their complexity (and their relation to deep questions of the
rights of the citizen and the responsibilities and the liabilities
that a community can justifiably impose on the citizen), those
considerations do not determine a standard that is <em>more
precise</em> than a standard that could be expressed using such an
ordinary vague expression as ‘bald’. That is, those
considerations do not provide a way of distinguishing between one tire
in the sorites series and the next. Similarly, it is possible to
construct sorites series for the application of even more abstract
legal standards such as the right to due process, or the United States
constitutional prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment. These
evaluative tests have special legal meanings that can only be
understood in the context of a legal system, and in the more
particular context of a specific area of law, and by reference to
their elaboration and development in a common law system of precedent.
Even with a mastery of all those aspects of the context, however, the
best theory of the effect of such standards will not provide a way of
distinguishing between one tire in the sorites series and the next. A
theory of careless driving in some particular legal system at a
particular time would be a defective theory, if it yielded the
conclusion that the loss of one molecule of rubber from a tire can
make the difference between driving that is careless and driving that
is not careless according to law. </p>

<p>
Consider again the case of <em>Garner v Burr</em> (above, section
2.2). The term ‘vehicle’, as properly understood for the
purposes of the Road Traffic Act, is vague if there are borderline
cases for its application (cases in which it is unclear whether the
term applies to some object). It may seem that nothing is more
patently a borderline case of a ‘vehicle’ than a chicken
coop on wheels. But we should bear in mind that (if the discussion in
section 2.2 above is sound) the correct application of the term
depends on legal principles relating to the purposes of the
legislation and to the need for clarity in criminal liabilities. So
the chicken coop on wheels is a borderline case if it is unclear
whether those principles required the provision to be applied to it.
And the application of the term was indeterminate in the case, if
those principles did not require a decision one way or the other. Of
course, the appeal court held that a conviction was 
required—which we might say amounts to a 
decision that the term applied to the
chicken coop on wheels. The magistrates and the appeal court disagreed
about it, but that disagreement in itself does not mean either that
the application of the term was determinate or that it was
indeterminate. And the fact that the appeal judges seem to have
thought that the term clearly applied to the chicken coop cannot tell
us that the application of the term was determinate.</p>

<p>
The magistrates’ approach put a special emphasis on the principle of
certainty in criminal liability, and the appeal court’s approach put a
special emphasis on the effective accomplishment of the purpose the
legislation was designed to pursue. Each approach would take the law
in a different direction. The application of the term was
indeterminate (before the decision of the appeal court set a
precedent) if neither approach was demanded by the complex resources
of legal reasoning that the courts (as a matter of legal obligation)
had to act upon. If that was the case, then the appeal court’s
decision was not contrary to the law. But a decision upholding the
acquittal would not have been contrary to the law, either. The law as
it was at the time of the decision allowed the courts to move it in
either direction.</p>

<p>
That account of a case like <em>Garner v Burr</em> would support the
controversial claim that judges have widespread discretion in
resolving legal disputes. Legal philosophers have debated whether that
claim undermines the ideal of the rule of law, or reflects a basic
requirement of the rule of law: that a legal system needs techniques
for the resolution of legal issues that are not determined by the law
(see Endicott 2000, chapter 9).</p>

<h2 id="UsePhilLangLaw">3. The use of philosophy of language in philosophy of law</h2>

<h3 id="IntrDefiMethLaw">3.1 Introduction: Definition as a methodology in philosophy of law</h3>

<p>
Bentham presented his theory as a definition. In focusing their
attention on the meaning of the main terms of legal discourse, Bentham
and John Austin were ahead of their time. But it has come to be a
commonplace view in legal theory (though still controversial) that
they were misguided in attempting to define those terms. So, for
example, Hart in the 1960s rejected definition as useful in philosophy
of law (Hart 2012, 14–17). Dworkin in the 1980s accused Hart of
only repackaging the same approach as the ‘more candidly
definitional’ method of John Austin (Dworkin 1986, 32–33).
And Richard Posner in the 1990s accused both Hart and Dworkin of
pointlessly “trying to define ‘law’” (Posner
1996, vii).</p>

<p>
There is no reason to describe the work of Hart or Dworkin as defining
the word ‘law’. And defining that word would not solve any
of the problems of jurisprudence (as Hart pointed out). The
fundamental reason is that a definition is useful only to someone who
needs to learn the meaning of a word, and legal philosophers know the
meaning of the word ‘law’. Their problems and their
disputes would not be resolved by a statement that would help someone
who did not know what the word meant. Philosophers of law cannot solve
their problems by giving a definition of the word ‘law’,
any more than philosophers of language can solve their problems by
giving a definition of the word ‘language’ (for discussion
of the implications for legal philosophy of the semantics and
metasemantics of the word ‘law’, see Coleman and Simchen
2003).</p>

<p>
A further reason is that, as John Finnis and Ronald Dworkin have both
explained in different ways, the word ‘law’ can be used in
a variety of senses: the law of the jungle, the law of gravity, laws
of thought, Murphy’s law, etc. (Finnis 1980, 6; Dworkin 1986, 104). A
definition would have to allow for those senses. It might be an
intriguing (and arduous) study in culture and human thought to explain
the analogies among those senses, but it is a study that holds out no
special promise for understanding the law of a community.</p>

<h3 id="LangNormLaw">3.2 Language and the normativity of law</h3>

<p>
Legal philosophers have tried to explain <em>the normativity of
law</em>—the fact that the law of a community is, or presents
itself as, a guide to the conduct of members of a community. One easy
way to express this abstract feature of law is by pointing out that
the law can be stated by making normative statements (i.e. statements
that use expressions like ‘obligation’,
‘right’, ‘must’, ‘may’). And one
attractive way of trying to explain the normativity of law is by
explaining the meaning and use of the normative language that is often
used in stating the law. That is, the problem of explaining the nature
of legal norms (obligations, rights, etc.) can be addressed by
explaining the meaning or the use of the normative words that are used
in law (‘obligation’, ‘right’,…).
Joseph Raz has put it that ‘The problem of the normativity of
law is the problem of explaining the use of normative language in
describing the law or legal situations.’ (1990, 170)</p>

<p>
We saw that Bentham’s theory of normative language in general was
that, because there is no perceptible substance or emotion for which
they stand as a name, words such as ‘right’ must be
‘expounded’ by paraphrasing sentences containing them. The
paraphrase would use sentences that contain only words that can be
defined as referring to substances and perceptions. When no such
paraphrase is available, he considered that normative language is
meaningless. So he held that the phrase ‘natural rights’
is “simple nonsense: natural and imprescriptible rights,
rhetorical nonsense; nonsense upon stilts” (Bentham 1843,
Art.II). While the language is meaningless, he thought, we can explain
its use—as a way of doing something. Using such nonsensical
expressions is a way in which the speaker expresses his
preferences.</p>

<p>
Although Bentham and John Austin thought that the notion of a
<em>natural</em> right was nonsense, they did not at all think the
same about the notion of <em>legal</em> rights. In their command
theory they found a way of paraphrasing normative expressions in their
legal use. They explained the meaning of the word 
‘duty’—and thereby the normativity of 
law—by reference to the
pain and pleasure that a superior offered as motivation for compliance
with the superior’s will:</p>

<blockquote>
That is my <em>duty</em> to do, which I am liable to be
<em>punished</em>, according to law, if I do not do: this is the
original, ordinary, and proper sense of the word <em>duty</em>.
(Bentham 1776, 109; cf. John Austin 1832, 14).
</blockquote>

<p>
Hart used the resources of twentieth-century philosophy to challenge
that approach to normative language. He drew on the work of J.L.
Austin, a philosopher of language who thought that problems in many
areas of philosophy could be dissolved by pointing out the things that
people do with words. J.L. Austin once suggested that “a
statement of ‘the law’” is a performative statement,
rather than “a statement of fact” (Austin 1962, 4 n.2).
The suggestion is that to state the law is to perform an act (an act
other than the making of an assertion that could be true or false).
J.L. Austin’s claim offered to account for the normativity of law by
reference to the things that people do with words. That hint attracted
Hart (Hart, 1954), whose theory of law is based on a ‘practice
theory of rules’. He articulated the theory by pointing out what
people do with the normative language they use in stating rules.</p>

<p>
Hart started by arguing that Bentham and Austin had explained the
meaning and use of normative language in a way that failed to account
for its role in ordinary discourse. He pointed out that their account
of the meaning of the word ‘duty’ left them unable to draw
a distinction that people ordinarily draw in their use of language,
between the command of a gunman (which no one would say imposes a
‘duty’ or an ‘obligation’), and a legal
prescription:</p>

<blockquote>
The plausibility of the claim that the gunman situation displays the
meaning of obligation lies in the fact that it is certainly one in
which we would say that <em>B</em>, if he obeyed, was
‘obliged’ to hand over his money. It is, however, equally
certain that we should misdescribe the situation if we said, on these
facts, that <em>B</em> ‘had an obligation’ or a
‘duty’ to hand over the money. So from the start it is
evident that we need something else for an understanding of the idea
of obligation. There is a difference, yet to be explained, between the
assertion that someone <em>was obliged</em> to do something and the
assertion that he <em>had an obligation</em> to do it. (Hart 2012, 82)
</blockquote>

<p>
Bentham and Austin would have had a ready response: that people
ordinarily misuse the word ‘obligation’. They fail to give
it a meaning that can be expounded by reference to sensible objects.
Bentham and Austin were linguistic philosophers, but (unlike J.L.
Austin) not ordinary language philosophers. They sought a way of using
language that would back up their empiricism and utilitarianism, and
they were actually pleased if that technique called for a
reorganisation of ordinary language: it showed that they were
disclosing what had been obscured by prejudice and cant.</p>

<p>
Hart’s approach to language was different. It may seem that he did not
need to talk about language, and that his point could have been made
without mentioning types of assertions, or what ‘we would
say’. His argument, you might think, simply puts into the
linguistic mode an argument that could be made with no mention of
language: an argument that you can have an obligation without being
liable to sanction. And yet, the linguistic form of the argument was
important to Hart. He wanted to avoid explaining the difference
between obligation and coercion in the way a natural law theorist
might (by saying that an obligation is a kind of reason). So his focus
on the use of the <em>word</em> ‘obligation’ is no
accident. He did not point out the way we use that word as an oblique
way of appealing to our shared wisdom as to what obligation
<em>is</em>. It was actually important to him to point out how we
<em>use</em> the word. His explanation of the normativity of law
relies on the use of such words to display an attitude.</p>

<p>
Hart claimed that a legal system is a system of power-conferring and
duty-imposing rules, which are validated by a ‘rule of
recognition’. That rule is not made valid by another rule; it is
a ‘social rule’. It is in Hart’s explanation of that
crucial notion of a social rule, that he turned to the use of words to
explain the normativity of law. He claimed that a social rule is a
regular pattern of conduct accompanied by a ‘distinctive
normative attitude’, which ‘consists in the standing
disposition of individuals to take such patterns of conduct both as
guides to their own future conduct and as standards of
criticism’ (Hart, 2012, 255). In accounting for that
disposition, or ‘internal attitude’, Hart’s emphasis was
on speech acts—on the use that participants in the practice
make of normative language. </p>

<blockquote>
What is necessary [for a social rule to exist] is that there should be
a critical reflective attitude to certain patterns of behaviour as a
common standard, and that this should display itself in criticism
(including self-criticism), demands for conformity, and in
acknowledgments that such criticism and demands are justified, all of
which find their characteristic expression in the normative
terminology of ‘ought’, ‘must’, and
‘should’, ‘right’ and ‘wrong’
(Hart, 2012, 57).
</blockquote>

<p>
Hart’s interest in normative language was focused not on its meaning,
but on the attitude that people display when they use it. His
explanation of the difference between non-normative and normative
assertions (between, as he put it, ‘the assertion that someone
<em>was obliged</em> to do something and the assertion that he <em>had
an obligation</em> to do it’) was merely that the latter sort of
assertion is used to display a distinctive sort of attitude.</p>

<p>
Just as Bentham’s approach to normative language was allied to his
empiricism and his utilitarianism, Hart’s approach to normative
language was allied to his philosophical methodology, and to his views
on the relation between law and morality. His methodological purpose
was to describe human practices, and he wanted to defend a conceptual
separation between law and morality—a distinction in kind
between legal obligation and moral obligation (see Hart 2012,
239–240). The practice theory of rules attracted him as a tool
for those purposes, because it offered a way of accounting for the
normativity of law by pointing to forms of behaviour which could be
described, and which did not (in his view) carry any moral baggage. In
saying that people use normative language to display an attitude to
regularities of behaviour, the theorist did not need to do moral
philosophy, and did not need to make any moral evaluations of the
practice being described. The theorist did not even need to ascribe
any moral evaluations to the participants in the practice, since the
fact that people use normative language to display an attitude is,
Hart considered, consistent with their having various moral views or
none at all.</p>

<p>
How much simpler it would be to say that normative language means the
same in its moral uses and in its legal uses. While a person who says
that you must stop at a red light may display various attitudes, what
he or she <em>asserts</em> is a necessity that implies a
(presumptively) conclusive reason to stop. If the statement is a
statement of law, the necessity is a legal necessity; if the statement
is a moral statement, the necessity is a moral statement.</p>

<p>
That approach is not only simpler; it closes the gap that Hart left in
his theory. According to Hart, the meaning of normative language
differs in morality and in law. But in fact, Hart had nothing to say
about the <em>meaning</em> of normative expressions such as
‘ought’ and ‘must’ or ‘obligation’
or ‘right’ (except that their meaning differs in law and
in morality). He only pointed out that people display an attitude when
they use such language.</p>

<p>
Joseph Raz rejected Hart’s claim that normative terms have a
distinctive meaning in statements of law. In Raz’s view, to make a
normative statement such as ‘you must stop at a red light’
is to imply that you have a certain sort of reason for action. If it
is a statement applying the law, it implies that you have reason to
stop from the point of view of the law. Raz’s theory of law, unlike
Hart’s, is part of a theory of practical reason in general, and his
account of normative statements treats them as having the same meaning
in law and in morality. Hart initially thought that that approach
would necessarily lead to an extreme sort of natural law theory, in
which every true statement of law is necessarily a true moral
statement, and every valid legal obligation is necessarily a moral
obligation. But Raz resolved that concern of Hart’s, by pointing out
that normative statements can be made in a detached way. People can
make them without endorsing the point of view from which the reasons
they are stating are valid (see Raz 1990, 175–177). Still, Hart
did not accept Raz’s approach, which he felt created a certain sort of
conceptual connection between law and morality. In responding to Raz,
he insisted that ‘statements of the subject’s legal duties need
have nothing directly to do with the subject’s reasons for
action’ (Hart 1982, 267). And in an interview with the Spanish
journal <em>Doxa</em> near the end of his career he maintained
‘that legal and moral obligation are conceptually
different’ in the sense that a statement of obligation has a
different meaning in law and in morality (De Paramo 1988). He never
explained the difference in meaning; its necessity only follows from a
methodological preconception.</p>
