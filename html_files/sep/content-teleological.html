<h1>Teleological Theories of Mental Content</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Fri Jun 18, 2004; substantive revision Tue Jan 3, 2012</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>

Teleological theories of mental content try to explain the contents
of mental representations by appealing to a teleological notion of
function. Take, for example, the thought that blossoms are forming. On
a representational theory of thought, this thought involves a
representation of blossoms forming.  A theory of content aims among
other things to tell us why this representation has that content; it
aims to say why it is a thought about blossoms forming rather than
about the sun shining or pigs flying or nothing at all. In general, a
theory of content tries to say why a mental representation counts as
representing what it represents.</p>

<p>

According to teleological theories of content, what a representation
represents depends on the functions of the systems that produce or use
the representation. The relevant notion of function is said to be the
one that is used in biology and neurobiology in attributing functions
to components of organisms (as in “the function of the pineal
gland is secreting melatonin” and “the function of brain
area MT is processing information about motion”).  Proponents of
teleological theories of content generally understand such functions
to be what the thing with the function was selected for, either by
ordinary natural selection or by some other natural process of
selection.</p>

<h2><a name="1">1. Broad Aims</a></h2>

<p>

Many (perhaps all) mental states are about things or are directed on
to things in the way that a belief that spring is coming is about
spring coming or in the way that a desire for chocolate is directed on
to chocolate. The philosopher Franz Brentano (1838–1917) spoke of such
mental states as involving presentations of the objects of our
thoughts. The idea was that we couldn't desire chocolate unless
chocolate was in some way presented to our minds. Nowadays, we would
say that chocolate must be represented in our minds if it is chocolate
that we desire. Teleological theories of content, like other theories
of mental content, attempt to solve what is often referred to as
Brentano's problem: the problem of explaining intentionality,
explaining how mental states can be about things or be directed on to
things in this way.</p>

<p>

One version of the problem, often attributed to Brentano but perhaps
more correctly attributed to Roderick Chisholm (1957), concerns
thoughts about non-existent objects. Chisholm argued that the aboutness
(or intentionality) of mental states can not be a physical relation
between a mental state and what it is about (its object) because in a
physical relation each of the <em>relata</em> must exist whereas the objects of
mental states might not exist. If Andrew kisses Kate both Andrew and
Kate must exist and if the sun shines on a garden both the sun and the
garden must exist too. In contrast, Billy can love Santa and
search for unicorns even if Santa does not exist and there are no
unicorns.</p>

<p>

Chisholm concluded that it is hard to see how intentionality can be a
physical phenomenon, but those who offer teleological theories almost
always adopt a physicalist framework to try to explain how
intentionality is possible. They aim at what is often called a
“naturalistic theory”: “naturalistic” because
the aim is to give a theory that is consistent with the claim that the
fundamental furniture of the universe is nothing but what the natural
sciences describe.  Within that framework, it is a working hypothesis
that intentionality is not ontologically fundamental, so most
teleological theories try to show that intentionality is part of the
natural world by showing how it can be understood in terms of other
natural things. In effect, those who propose teleological theories of
mental content try to say why a mental representation, <em>R</em>,
represents what it represents, <em>C</em>, by filling in the blank in,
“<em>R</em> has the content <em>C</em> because (in virtue of)
_______”, without making ineliminable use of intentional
terms.  </p>

<p>

It also needs to account for the normative nature of mental
representation. Content is said to be normative because it legitimates
certain evaluations. We evaluate beliefs as true or false, memories as
accurate or inaccurate, perceptions as veridical or illusory and so
on. We also evaluate desires as satisfied or not satisfied and motor
instructions as correctly or incorrectly executed. Content that is
normative is sometimes described as truth-evaluable. Representational
states count as true or false (etc.) by virtue of their content as
well as the state of the world. For example, the truth of my belief
that today is sunny depends on whether it is sunny but it also depends
on its being a belief that today is sunny. If the content of the
belief were different (e.g., if it were the belief that today is hot)
its truth value might be different. The normative nature of content
poses a problem for naturalistic theories but those who propose
teleological theories of mental content think that this problem is
tractable.</p>

<p>

Much attention is paid to the possibility of misrepresentation. This
is because the distinction between correct and incorrect
representation is often regarded as a central normative distinction
and because a capacity to misrepresent is often thought to be
essential for representing: no possibility of misrepresentation, no
representing. Consider a mental representation of a cat. If it is to
have the content <em>cat</em>, so that all and only cats are in its
extension, it must be that if it were used to label a non-cat (e.g., a
dog) it would count as misrepresenting it. However, there may be
exceptions to the general rule that all representations can
misrepresent (e.g., a representation that has the
content <em>something or nothing</em>). Misrepresentation is also not
possible in every kind of mental context (e.g., in dreaming and,
perhaps, desiring).</p>

<p>

The possibility of misrepresentation also connects with Chisholm's
concern with non-existent objects because a capacity to misrepresent
amounts to a basic capacity to represent non-existent objects. Imagine
a simple detection device that normally goes into a RED-state in
response to red. If the RED-state has the content <em>there is
red</em> then, if RED could be tokened sometimes when nothing red is
present, a token RED could represent a non-existent instantiation of
red. There is more to explaining our capacity to represent
non-existent objects than explaining how misrepresentation is possible
but explaining how misrepresentation is possible is a start.</p>

<p>

Misrepresentation makes it clear that representing is often a
three-place relation. Suppose, for example, that I see some crumpled
newspaper blown by the wind as a cat slinking down the street. There
are at least three things involved. First, there is the representation
(or representational vehicle) that has the content. In us, it is
presumably some sort of neurological state or event.  Here, such
mental representations are denoted by capitalized English expressions
(e.g., CAT). Second, there is the thing that the representation is
aimed at representing, in this case this is the newspaper. Cummins
(1996) calls this the <em>target</em> of the representation. And
third, there is the content of the representation. Since I represent
the newspaper as a cat, the content of the representation in this case
is <em>cat</em>. Misrepresentation has occurred in this case because
the target of the representation is not in the extension of the
representation; the newspaper is not a cat.</p>

<p>

We can ask questions about each of these three places in the
representation relation. First is the question of representational
status: Why does CAT count as a representation? Or, more generally,
what is the difference between natural states that are representational
states and natural states that are not? Second is the question of
target determination: What makes it the case that this token of CAT has
the newspaper as its target? Or, more generally, what makes anything
the target of any given representation? Third is the question of
content determination: What makes it the case that CAT has the content
<em>cat</em>? Or, more generally, in virtue of what does any
representation have the content that it has? Teleological theories of
mental content are primarily concerned with content determination, but
a complete solution to Brentano's problem will need to give answers to
all three.</p>

<p>

A distinction is sometimes made
between representation <em>of</em> and representation <em>as</em>.
Whether or not teleological theories of content are concerned with
representation <em>as</em> or <em>of</em> depends on how
those locutions are used. In one sense, referring back to the
previous example, my CAT-representation represents the newspaper
<em>as</em> a cat, although it is a representation <em>of</em> the
newspaper. On this way of speaking, teleological theories of content
are theories of representation <em>as</em>. However, the words
“as” and “of” are not always diagnostic of the
contents/targets distinction. For example, we can also say that I used
a representation <em>of</em> a cat to represent the newspaper.</p>

<p>

The teleological theories that are currently on offer are generally
theories of referential content (not theories of cognitive content or
mode of presentation). Many philosophers would agree that referential
content, which is normative in the aforementioned sense, is not narrow
content. By definition, two individuals who are physical replicas at
time <em>t</em> “from the skin in” must have the same
narrow-content states at
<em>t</em>. Proponents of teleological theories do not believe that
referential content is narrow. This view is also shared by other
philosophers who think that referential content supervenes (in part)
on things that are external to individual thinkers, such as on
features of their social and physical environment and/or their history
(for the kinds of reasons raised by Putnam (1975) and Burge (1979,
1986)). In general, the proponents of teleological theories of content
have shown little interest in the notion of narrow content, since they
tend to reject the claim that cognitive science should restrict itself
to using narrow notions. Still, a teleological theory of mental
content could be combined with the view that cognitive science needs a
narrow notion of content. A teleological theory of content tries to
explain the nature of psycho-semantic norms (i.e., semantic norms
insofar as they apply to mental representations). It is to some extent
a separate question whether such norms play a role in cognitive
science and whether a narrow notion is needed instead or in
addition.</p>

<p>

A further point about broad aims is that teleological
theories of mental content are not usually intended as theories about
how we grasp meanings or are conscious of them. To grasp a meaning is
plausibly a sophisticated intentional state that involves
representations of meanings and not just representations with meanings.
To understand how we grasp meanings, we might turn to psychological
theories of concept possession and introspective access to conceptual
structures. Such theories presuppose that there are representations
with content, whereas teleological theories of mental content try to
explain the nature of intentionality at its most fundamental; they aim
to say how we can, to begin with, have any representations with content.</p>

<p>

A final point about broad aims is that teleological theories of mental
content are usually intended as real nature theories. These theories
do not try to describe the criteria that we use in everyday life to
identify the beliefs and desires of people, the criteria used in folk
psychological intentional ascriptions (though Price (2001) is an
exception). Those who offer real nature theories of mental content
think that our everyday ability to recognize intentional states does
not make us experts on the fundamental nature of intentional states,
any more than our everyday ability to recognize water makes us experts
on the fundamental nature of water. The idea is that we can recognize
instances of a kind on the basis of the superficial appearances of
things of the kind, while remaining ignorant of their essential
nature.  So, most teleological theories of mental content do not
entail that, if Bill thinks that Mavis knows that today is Tuesday
then Bill must be thinking about the teleological functions of Mavis's
representation producing or using systems.</p>

<h2><a name="2">2. Teleological Functions</a></h2>

<p>

As noted in the previous section, a crucial feature of content is that
it legitimates semantic evaluations. While teleological theories of
mental content come in a variety of forms, they all share the idea
that the norms that underwrite these evaluations depend, in part at
least, on functions. The next section explains various ideas about the
nature of this dependence. This section describes the notion of
function that is employed. It is generally thought to be in some sense
teleological and normative but both “teleological” and
“normative” need qualifying.  Let's take the first term
first.</p>

<p>

Talk of biological functions often has a teleological flavor. For
example, when we say that it is the function of the heart to pump
blood this seems equivalent to saying that hearts are <em>for</em>
pumping blood or that hearts are there <em>in order to</em> pump
blood. There is a closely related concept of an artifact's function
that is purposive: for example, when we say that moving the cursor is
the function of the computer's mouse or trackpad we seem to mean that
this is what it is for, that it is there in order to do this, that
this is what its designers designed it to do. Along analogous lines,
when biologists say that pumping blood is the heart's function, they
seem to mean that hearts were selected for, adapted for and in that
sense designed for pumping blood. In the latter case, however, the
selection is “natural” or, better, it is a non-intentional
process.</p>

<p>

Some who favor teleological theories of mental content claim that
Mother Nature is intentional or purposive.  In the case of Millikan
(2002), it is unclear whether there is a genuine as opposed to
terminological disagreement with the substance of the preceding
paragraph. The transition from metaphor to dead metaphor to literal
use of such terms as “design” and “purpose” is
a matter of degree and Millikan seems to use “function”
and “biological purpose” as synonyms.  However, Dennett's
(1988) claim is that there is no mind-independent determinate fact of
the matter about meanings or functions and that the functions of
artifacts, the functions of biological systems and the contents of the
thoughts of people are all dependent on interpretation, on our
adopting either the design stance or the intentional stance toward
them.  In Dennett's view, nature leaves functions and meanings
similarly indeterminate.  </p>

<p>

There are some who would prefer to reserve the term
“teleological” for genuinely purposive contexts in the
most literal sense of “purposive” and to refer to
biological functions as “teleonomic.” But, on a broader
construal of what it means for a concept to be teleological, a concept
might be counted as teleological if it concerns what something
is <em>for</em>, and the notion of what something was
selected <em>for</em> counts as teleological in that sense. This is
the sense of the term “teleological” used in this
entry.</p>

<p>

Intuitively, the relevant concept of function seems to be normative as
well, for biologists routinely talk about systems functioning normally
or properly, as well as about malfunctioning, dysfunction, functional
impairment and so on. Those who offer teleological theories of mental
content agree that the relevant notion of function permits the
possibility of malfunction; it allows that a token trait could have a
function to do <em>Z</em> even if it lacks the disposition to
do <em>Z</em>.  For example, Joe's pineal gland could have the
function to secrete melatonin even if it cannot secrete melatonin
because it is malfunctioning.  Whether it is appropriate to describe
this as “normative” is more controversial but the
disagreement is more terminological than substantial among those
offering teleological theories of mental content, since all that is
usually meant by saying that the notion is normative, by those of them
who say this, is that it permits the possibility of malfunction.</p>

<p>

Some prefer to reserve the term “normative” for
prescriptive contexts. On that way of speaking, a statement would
count as normative only if it entails an ought-claim without the
addition of further premises. Proponents of teleological theories of
mental content can agree that no ought-claim follows from a function
ascription without the addition of further premises (for discussion,
see Jacob (2001)) and that functions are not prescriptive. Different
practices dominate different discourses but talk of purely descriptive
“norms” is well established in some contexts (e.g., in
talk of statistical norms). If either psycho-semantic or functional
norms were prescriptive, the attempt to naturalize them would seem to
ignore Hume's warning to beware trying to
derive <em>ought</em>-statements from
<em>is</em>-statements, but those who offer teleological theories of
mental content claim that the norms of both functions and content fall
on the <em>is</em> side of any is/ought divide.</p>

<p>

Those who favor teleological theories of content usually favor an
etiological theory of functions, according to which an item's function
is determined by its history of selection or by past selection of
things of that type. Roughly, on an etiological theory of functions,
an items function is what it was selected for, or what thing of the
type were selected for.</p>

<p>

Wright (1973, 1976) offered the first developed defense of an
etiological theory of functions by a philosopher but earlier
expressions of the idea can be found in the writings of some
biologists (e.g., Ayala 1970). Wright's (1976, p.81) proposed analysis
is as follows.</p>

<blockquote>The function of <em>X</em> is <em>Z</em> if and only if, 

<ol>
<li><em>Z</em> is a consequence (result) of <em>X</em>s being
there,</li>

<li><em>X</em> is there because it does (results in) <em>Z</em>.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>

Wright intended this formula to work for a wide variety of function
ascriptions; for artifacts as well as the parts of organisms, and for
function ascriptions in Creationist as well as Evolutionary
biology. For this reason, he intended the “does” of the
second requirement to be tenseless. Thus the second requirement is
intended to be read as requiring that <em>X</em> be there because it
does, did or will do <em>Z</em>.  The precise tense would depend on
the nature of the relevant consequence etiology, the causal history
that explains <em>X</em> being there because of its
effect, <em>Z</em>. </p>

<p>

The details of this formula are often regarded as problematic.  For
instance, it is unclear how it renders malfunction possible, given the
first requirement.  The second requirement is also too loose to
capture only function-conferring consequence etiologies. As Wright
(2010) concedes, if a man's gripping a pole were to cause electricity
to run through him and this prevented him from letting go of the pole,
then his original analysis entails that the function of the man's
holding on to the pole is to allow electricity to run through him. In
light of this problem, Wright has amended his analysis by proposing
that what is needed is a particular kind of consequence etiology, a
“virtue etiology” in which the consequence implicated in
the etiology must be a “virtue”.  In the case of functions
derived from natural selection, he views a “virtuous”
consequence as an adaptive consequence. </p>

<p>

Others who offer etiological theories of function drop Wright's first
requirement and speak more specifically of selection as the background
process that is responsible for the consequence etiology. On this
view, a/the function of an item is (roughly) what it (or items of the
type) were selected for.  Millikan (1989a) and Neander (1983, 1991)
argue that the functions of biology can be precisified by background
theory and that their analysis need not be an ordinary language
analysis. Neander (1991, p. 74) gives the following definition for
functions in physiology in particular, for instance:</p>

<blockquote>It is a/the proper function of an item (<em>X</em>) of an
organism (<em>O</em>) to do that which items of <em>X</em>'s type did
to contribute to the inclusive fitness of <em>O</em>'s ancestors, and
which caused the genotype, of which <em>X</em> is the phenotypic
expression, to be selected by natural selection.

</blockquote>

  

<p>

Etiological theories of biological function need to allow for the fact
that ancestral traits might have been selected for something other
than the present function of descendent traits.  For example, a
penguin's flippers and an emu's vestigial wings no longer have the
function of flight, even though ancestral forelimbs were selected for
flight.  Griffiths (1993) and Godfrey-Smith (1994) offer “modern
history” versions of the etiological theory, according to which
functions are determined by recent selection.  Note that selection
does not cease when traits “go to fixation” if on-going
maintenance selection is still weeding out fresh harmful mutations as
they arise.  However, selection does require some variation and
Schwartz (1999) suggests that a continuing usefulness supplement is
needed, which kicks in if variation is absent for a time.  In the
absence of any variation, the trait retains its function if it is
still adaptive.</p>

<p>
A further issue is whether the etiological theory is circular (see
e.g., Nanay (2011)).  The worry is that, if a trait token is typed by
its function and if a trait's function depends on the selection
history that pertains to the relevant type, the analysis is circular.
Neander and Rosenberg (forthcoming) respond that the function of a
trait and its function-specific type co-supervene on the history of
selection and that there is only a superficial appearance of
circularity. To figure out if token trait <em>X</em> has the function
to <em>Z</em>, they say, first identify the lineage of traits to
which <em>X</em> belongs; a lineage of traits connects ancestral and
descendent traits by the mechanisms responsible for inheritance. Then
segment the lineage at those places where selection for <em>Z</em>
stops and starts.  <em>X</em> has the function to <em>Z</em> only if
there was selection for <em>X</em>-ing in <em>X</em>'s segment of the
lineage. This procedure does not presuppose prior knowledge
of <em>X</em>'s function or prior knowledge of <em>X</em>'s membership
in a function-specific classification of traits. This is also an
alternative proposal for handling vestigiality. </p>

<p>

To play a role in a naturalistic account of mental content, the
relevant selection process must be non-intentional but it need not be
natural selection operating over an evolutionary span of
time. Millikan (1984) offers an etiological theory of functions on
which functions can also result from meme selection. Papineau (1984)
speaks of learning and Dretske (1986) invokes functions that depend on
recruitment by conditioning. Garson (2011) argues that the notion of
selection should be loosened so that differential retention without
differential replication could count as selection, in which case
neural selection could count as a form of selection that could
underwrite the functions that underwrite content.  While the contents
of sensory-perceptual representations might be determined by the
functions that derive from natural selection operating over an
evolutionary span of time, the role of learning in concept acquisition
suggests that other kinds of functions that derive from other kinds of
selection might be needed for the contents of learned concepts. There
is, though, no established agreement about how best to more broadly
define the relevant class of functions. </p>

<p>

While etiological theories dominate the discussion of normative
functions in philosophy of biology, the etiological theory is not
uncontroversial. Some question whether teleology can be naturalized
(e.g., Bedau (1991)). Others support other theories for other reasons.
Perhaps the systemic theory is the most popular alternative (see
esp. Cummins (1975)).  Systemic theories of function emphasize the
role of function ascriptions in functional analyses of systems.
Functional analyses of systems conceptually decompose complex
activities of whole systems into the activities of their contributing
parts.  The function of a part is its contribution to the complex
activity of the system that is under analysis.  Proponents of the
etiological theory have no objection to the idea that biologists give
functional analyses of systems but contend that the systemic analysis,
on its own, fails to naturalize the normativity of functions or to do
so successfully.  Some who support a systemic theory argue that
biology has no need for a naturalistic notion of malfunction (e.g.,
Davies, 2001), while others argue that abnormal functioning is
statistically atypical (Boorse (2002), Craver (2001), Lewens
(2004)). (Readers who would like to read more on this and other
theories of function could turn to several volumes of readings that
have appeared: see esp. Allen, Bekoff &amp; Lauder (1998), Buller
(1999) and Ariew, Cummins &amp; Perlman (2002).)</p>

<p>

It is usual to note that etiological (teleological) functions are
distinct from the causal-role functions involved in what is usually
called “functionalism” in philosophy of mind. Causal-role
functions are often defined as a select subset of a trait's actual
causal dispositions, and functionalism is often defined as the view
that mental states are individuated or classified into types on the
basis of such dispositions (see, e.g., Block (1984)). If causal-role
functions are a subset of dispositions actually possessed by token
traits then they do not permit the possibility of malfunction because
a trait cannot have the causal-role function to <em>Z</em> and at the
same time lack the disposition to
<em>Z</em>.</p>

<p>

That said, the distinction between functionalism and what might be
termed “teleo-functionalism” is less stark than might be
thought. One reason is that formulations of classical functionalism
often spoke of the <em>characteristic</em> or <em>normal</em> causal
roles of mental states.  Sometimes this was explicitly to allow for
pathology (see, e.g., Lewis 1980).  Another reason is that, although
teleological functions are often said to be selected effects or
effects for which traits were selected, such functions can also be
described as selected dispositions or dispositions for which traits
were selected. Both forms of functionalism also permit multiple
physical realizability of traits that perform the same functions.</p>

<h2><a name="3">3. Teleosemantic Theories</a></h2>

<p>

What all teleological (or “teleosemantic”) theories of
mental content have in common is the idea that psycho-semantic norms
are ultimately derivable from functional norms. Beyond saying this, it
is hard to give a neat definition of the group of theories that
qualify.</p>

<p>

Consider, for instance, some theories that are clearly intended as
alternatives to teleosemantics, such as Fodor's (1990b) asymmetric
dependency theory or theories that appeal to convergence under ideal
epistemic conditions (see Rey 1997 for an outline).  Elaboration of
these theories is beyond the scope of this entry but we can note that
they both seem to need a notion of <em>normal</em> or <em>proper</em>
functioning.  Fodor's theory adverts to the “intact”
perceiver and thinker. Presumably this is someone whose perceptual and
cognitive systems are functioning properly (this is covered under
the <em>ceterus paribus</em> part of the laws to which Fodor's theory
refers). The idea of convergence under ideal epistemic conditions also
involves a notion of normal functioning, for epistemic conditions are
not ideal if perceivers and thinkers are abnormal in certain respects,
such as if they are blind or psychotic. If normal or proper
functioning is analyzed in terms of an etiological theory, which says
that a system functions normally or properly only if all of its parts
possess the dispositions for which they were selected, then these
theories would qualify as teleological theories of mental content
under the characterization provided in the first paragraph of this
section.  Those who propose these theories might reject an etiological
theory of functions, but they need some analysis of them. There could
anyway be etiological or teleological versions of theories of this
sort.</p>

<p>

An appeal to teleological functions can also be combined with a
variety of other ideas about how content is determined. For example,
there can be both isomorphic and informational versions of
teleosemantics.  In the former case, the proposal might be that the
relevant isomorphism is one that cognitive systems were adapted to
exploit.  An alternative idea is that the isomorphism does not need to
be specified given that the targets of representations are determined
by teleological functions.  This appears to be the view of Cummins
(1996, see esp. p.120) although Cummins is generally critical of
teleological functions in biology. A teleological version of an
informational theory is given when content is said to depend on
information carrying, storing or processing functions of
mechanisms. The relevant notion of information is variously defined
but (roughly speaking) a type of state (event, etc.) is said to carry
natural information about some other state (event, etc.) when it is
caused by it or corresponds to it.  </p>

<p>

It is sometimes said that the role of functions in a teleological
theory of content is to explain how error is possible, rather than to
explain how content is determined, but the two go hand in hand. To see
this, it helps to start with the crude causal theory of content and to
see how the problem of error arises for it. According to the crude
causal theory, a mental representation represents whatever causes
representations of the type; <em>R</em>s represent <em>C</em>s if and
only if <em>C</em>s cause <em>R</em>s. One problem with this simple
proposal is its failure to provide for the possibility of
misrepresentation, as Fodor (1987, 101–104) points out. To see the
problem, recall the occasion on which crumpled paper is seen as a
cat. The crude causal theory does not permit this characterization of
the event because, if crumpled paper caused a tokening of CAT then
crumpled paper <em>is</em> in the extension of CAT, according to the
crude causal theory. Since cats also sometimes cause CATs, cats are in
the extension too. However, the problem is that crumpled paper is
included in the extension as soon as it causes a CAT to be tokened and
so, on this theory, there is no logical space for the possibility of
error since candidate errors are transformed into non-errors by their
very occurrence. Note that the problem is simultaneously one of ruling
in the right causes without also ruling in the wrong ones. CAT cannot
have the content <em>cat</em> unless non-cats (including crumpled
paper) are excluded from its content. So explaining how content is
determined and how the possibility of error are accommodated are not
separate tasks.</p>

<p>

The error problem is an aspect of what (after Fodor) is often called
“the disjunction problem.” With respect to the crude
causal theory, the name applies because the theory entails disjunctive
contents when it should not.  For example, it entails that CATs have
the content <em>cats or crumpled paper</em> in the case just
considered. The disjunction problem is larger than the problem of
error, however, because it is not only in cases of error that mental
representations are caused by things that are not in their extensions
(Fodor, 1990c). Suppose, for example, that Mick's talking about his
childhood pet dog reminds Scott of his childhood pet cat. In this case
no misrepresentation is involved but the crude causal theory again
entails inappropriate disjunctive contents. Now it entails that
Scott's CATs has a content along the lines of <em>cats or talk of pet
dogs</em>. This last aspect of the disjunction problem might be called
the problem of representation <em>in absentia</em>: how do we explain
our capacity to think about absent things? How do mental
representations retain or obtain their contents outside of perceptual
contexts? </p>

<p>

Asking how to alter the crude causal theory to allow for error is one
place to begin looking for a more adequate proposal. One approach
would be to try to describe certain situations in which only the right
causes can produce the representation in question and to maintain that
the content of the representation is whatever can cause the
representation in such situations. This is sometimes referred to as a
“type 1 theory.” A type 1 theory distinguishes between two
types of situations, ones in which only the right causes can cause a
representation and ones in which other things can too.  A type-1
theory says that the first type of situation is content-determining. A
type 1 teleological theory might state, for example, that the content
of a perceptual representation is whatever can cause it when the
perceptual system is performing its proper function, or when
conditions are optimal for the proper performance of its function. The
content of representations in abstract thought might then, it might be
proposed, be derived from their role in perception. Not all
teleological theories of content are type 1 theories, however. The
theory described in the next section is arguably a variant of a type 1
theory but some of the theories described in later sections are
not. </p>

<p>

The following sub-sections describe some key differences among
teleological theories. It is not possible to describe all extant
theories but some different approaches are sketched, along with a
brief review of some of their strengths and weaknesses. General
objections to teleological theories are discussed later, in
 <a href="#4">section 4</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="3.1">3.1 Indicator Semantics</a></h3>

<p>

Stampe (1977) was one of the first philosophers in modern times to
suggest a theory of content according to which content is a matter of
reliable causes. Dretske's book, <em>Knowledge and the Flow of
Information</em> (1981) has also been very influential.  The theory
Dretske develops in that book is not a teleological theory of mental
content but Dretske (1986, 1988, 1991) later offers a teleo-functional
version of indicator-semantics. He begins with a notion of
information-carrying, which he calls “indicating”, and
suggests that a representation's content is what it has the function
to indicate.</p>

<p>

Dretske (1981) provides the most careful analysis of the indication
relation and he often refers back to this in his later work.  However,
it adverts to background knowledge and, since knowledge is
intentional, this aspect of it is omitted in his theory of content, at
least as it applies to the simplest kinds of mental representations.
The analysis of indication on which his theory of content relies is as
follows: an event of type <em>R</em> indicates that a state of affairs
of type <em>C</em> is the case if and only if the probability
of <em>C</em>, given that <em>R</em> is instanced, is one (assuming
that certain background or “channel conditions”
obtain). </p>
<p>

Although indication is often be underwritten by a causal regularity
such that <em>C</em>s cause <em>R</em>s, Dretske tell us that it is
not a requirement that <em>C</em>s cause <em>R</em>s. <em>C</em>s and
<em>R</em>s might have a common cause, for instance. He also tells us
that it need not be a law that if <em>R</em> then <em>C</em>, though
it cannot be merely coincidental. For local reasons, it could be that
if there is an <em>R</em> then there is always a <em>C</em>. One of
his examples is of doorbell ringings: if there is someone ringing the
doorbell whenever the doorbell rings in his neighborhood, its ringing
indicates that someone is at the door. But if squirrels start to ring
doorbells because people start making them out of nuts, a ringing
doorbell will no longer indicate that someone is at the door.</p>

<p>

Dretske points out that representation is not equivalent to
indication.  “<em>R</em> indicates <em>C</em>” entails
“if <em>R</em> then <em>C</em>.” But, since
misrepresentation is possible, it must be the case that
“<em>R</em> represents <em>C</em>” does not entail
“if <em>R</em> then
<em>C</em>.” (At any rate, “<em>R</em>
indicates <em>C</em>” entails “if <em>R</em>
then <em>C</em>” if the relevant channel conditions obtain.)  So
Dretske (1986) suggests that perceptual representations
<em>have the function</em> of indicating. The starting idea is this:
if something has the function of indicating something else then it is
supposed to indicate it but, since items don't always perform their
functions, room for error has been made.  Dretske appears to rely on
an etiological analysis of functions (see e.g., Dretske 1995,
p. 7). He speaks of states acquiring a function to indicate by being
selected or recruited for indicating.  Roughly, Dretske suggests
that <em>R</em>s represent <em>C</em>s iff <em>R</em>s were recruited
for indicating <em>C</em>s and for causing a bodily
movement, <em>M</em>.</p>

<p>

Dretske (1995, p. 2) says, “[t]he fundamental idea is that a
system, <em>S</em>, represents a property, <em>F</em>, if and only if
<em>S</em> has the function of indicating (providing information about)
the <em>F</em> of a certain domain of objects. The way <em>S</em>
performs its function (when it performs it) is by occupying different
states <em>s1</em>, <em>s2</em>, … <em>sn</em> corresponding to
the different determinate values <em>f1</em>, <em>f2</em> …
<em>fn</em>, of <em>F</em>.” For example, part of the visual system
might represent the orientation of lines in a region of the visual
field. If so, it does so because it has the function of carrying
information about the orientation of lines in that region and it
performs this function (when it performs it) by entering into different
states when different orientations of lines are present in that
region. </p>

<p>

This account of representation seems to make room for error, because
it implies that representations need only indicate their contents
during recruitment or in the environment and given the channel
conditions in which recruitment took place; error being possible after
that time or in other environments or circumstances. However, Dretske
(1986) sees a problem with this suggestion. He illustrates the problem
with the case of ocean-dwelling anaerobic bacteria that have tiny
magnets (magnetesomes) that are attracted to magnetic north, which
serve to direct the bacteria downwards into the relatively oxygen-free
sediment on the ocean floor . Plausibly, the function of the
magnetesomes is to direct the bacteria to anaerobic conditions. If we
“fool” the bacteria by holding a bar magnet nearby and
lead the bacteria upward to their death, this looks like a case of
natural misrepresentation. We were, in Dretske's words, looking for
“nature's way of making a mistake” and we seem to have
found it. The problem, says Dretske, is that it is indeterminate how
we should describe the function of the magnetesomes. We can plausibly
say that they have the function of indicating the oxygen-free
sediment. But we can also plausibly say that they have the function of
indicating geo-magnetic or even local magnetic north. If we say the
latter, no misrepresentation has occurred.  So Dretske's interim
conclusion is that we cannot count this as an unambiguous case of
error, on his theory as outlined so far.</p>

<p>

A number of distinct problems go under the name of “the
functional indeterminacy problem” (<a href="#4.1">section
4.1</a>) and the magnetesome example can be used to illustrate several
of them. However, Dretske's response to the indeterminacy problem that
he raised suggests that his main concern was with what is known as the
problem of distal content. His problem, then, is this.  Suppose that
we have a simple system that has just one way of detecting the
presence of some feature of the environment. We have just seen a case
of this for the anaerobic bacteria have just one way of detecting
anaerobic conditions (via the local magnetic field). In such a case,
if an inner state indicates the distal feature (anaerobic conditions)
it will also indicate the more proximal feature (local magnetic
north). Moreover, if there was selection for indicating the distal
feature, there will also have been selection for indicating the more
proximal feature (since it is by indicating the latter that it
indicates the former). Dretske further points out that, even if a
creature has several routes by which it can detect a given distal
feature (e.g., even if the bacteria can detect anaerobic conditions by
means of light sensors as well) there would still be a disjunction of
more proximal features that the representation could count as
representing, since it could still count as having the function of
indicating the disjunction of more proximal features (i.e., local
magnetic north or reduced light).</p>

<p>

While we might be perfectly willing to allow that the magnetesomes in
anaerobic bacteria do not represent or misrepresent, the problem of
distal content generalizes. When you see a chair across the room as a
chair across the room, you represent it as a solid 3D object at a
distance from you and not as a stream of light reflected from it or as
a pattern of firings in your retinas.  Otherwise you would not try to
walk to the chair and sit on it. An informational theory of content
must therefore explain how mental representations represent distal
features of the world, as opposed to the more proximal items that
carry information about those distal features to the representations
that represent them. </p>

<p>

Dretske (1986) therefore modifies his proposal and maintains that a
creature that is capable of representing determinate content must be
capable of learning any number of new epistemic routes to the same
distal feature. In that case, he says, there is no closed disjunction
of more proximal stimuli that the representation could count as
representing. He speaks of conditioning in this context. The relevant
representation is recruited by conditioning to indicate the distal
feature rather than the disjunction of more proximal features, because
there is no finite time-invariant disjunction of more proximal stimuli
that it has the function of indicating. Loewer (1987) points out that
conditioning ends at death, at which point no further epistemic routes
can be acquired. So, at the death of a creature, there will be a
closed disjunction of proximal features that each of the creature's
representations was recruited to indicate. (Loewer comments that
Dretske might appeal to epistemic routes that could <em>possibly</em>
be acquired by a creature but is unsure if this succeeds.)</p>

<p>

The claim that misrepresentation is impossible without learning anyway
seems problematic, since it seems to preclude representations produced
by innate input systems, such as innate sensory-perceptual
systems. Some psychologists also claim that some core concepts are
innate (e.g., see Carey 2009). Later, Dretske (1988) drops his
conditioning requirement insofar as it is a requirement on content
possession but he keeps it as a requirement for the kind of content
that can explain behavior.  (For discussion of Dretske's account of
the causal efficacy of content, see the essays in McLaughlin (1991).)
This re-raises the question of how representations produced by innate
input analyzers have distal content.</p>

<p>

Dretske's strict characterization of indication is thought by some to
be troublesome.  One reason is that there can be no non-intentional
process of selection for something to do <em>Z</em> unless that thing,
or things of that type at least, did do <em>Z</em>.  Hearts cannot be
selected for pumping blood by natural selection unless some hearts
pump blood. Similarly, no mechanism can be selected for
producing <em>R</em>s because they indicate <em>C</em>s unless
some <em>R</em>s indicate <em>C</em>s. However, <em>all R</em>s must
indicate <em>C</em>s in a region of space-time if any are to do so,
given the strict characterization of indication (for if <em>R</em>s
indicate <em>C</em>s in that region, then in that region it must be
the case that <em>C</em> being the case, given an <em>R</em>-tokening,
has a probability of one). Hence, where and while recruitment
continues, <em>R</em>s cannot occur without <em>C</em>s.  Fodor
(1990b) questions whether this requirement would be met or met often
enough, given that misrepresentation can occur later. Perhaps
Dretske's appeal to channel conditions can help him out of this
apparent difficulty.  However, specifying channel conditions without
being <em>ad hoc</em> or circular or adverting to intentional
phenomena (such as that a perceiver is not distracted) could prove
difficult. </p>

<p>

There are some hints in Dretske's writings of a willingness to use a
less strict notion of indication for he sometimes speaks of the
content of a representation as the “maximally indicated
state.” This suggests that there are more minimally indicated
states, which would be an oxymoron on the strict
interpretation. However, this looser interpretation is not developed
in Dretske's writings and his (1981) offers several arguments against
loosening the requirement.</p>

<p>

A further argument against indicator-semantics involves the claim that
something qualifies as a representation only if it is <em>used</em> as
a representation. Millikan (1989, pp. 84–90) argues that a
representation's content must therefore be determined by its use or
else something could count as a representation without representing
anything, which would be nonsense. The thought seems to be this: if
representational status and representational content are determined
separately, they could come apart and, if they could came apart,
something could count as a representation by satisfying the
requirement for representational status, without representing anything
in particular by at the same time failing to satisfy the requirement
for representational content.</p>
<p>

However, there are ways to block this conclusion. Suppose that Dretske
is right that something is a representation only if, (a) the
mechanisms that produce it were in part recruited for producing it
because it indicates something and also because (b) it plays a certain
role (e.g.) in causing bodily movements.  Note that (a) concerns
production and is also most directly relevant to content determination
on Dretske's theory.  Note as well that (b) concerns use.  Whether
these two requirements are adequate to characterize representational
status is debatable.  But the point here is that even if Millikan is
right that representational status is determined by use (as it is, in
part, on Dretske's proposal) it does not follow that the the
production of representations is irrelevant to determining their
content (as it is not on Dretske's proposal). On Dretske's proposal,
the production of a representation determines its content but
something does not count as a representation unless it also has a
use-related function. </p>

<p>
Millikan (2004, ch.6) also argues that no system can have the function
to produce states that carry correlational information, even if the
correlation need not be one hundred percent reliable. On Millikan's
view, although representation producing systems do produce
representations that carry a form of natural information when they
function properly, they do not have the function to do so. (Recall
that, while hearts produce thumping sounds when they are functioning
properly, they do not have the function to produce thumping sounds; it
is a side effect of their proper functioning.) She points out that it
cannot be the function of her visual system to ensure a general
correlation between representations of a certain type (e.g., all REDs
produced by human visual systems) and contents of a certain type
(e.g., all red instantiations). Her visual system, for instance,
cannot have the function to ensure that your visual system produces
REDs only in the presence of red.  If this objection succeeds, it
still leaves open the possibility that an alternative notion of
natural information, such as a causal notion, could be used (as
discussed in <a href="#3.5">section 3.5</a>).  </p>

<p>

Despite some problems with the detailed articulation of Dretske's
indicator semantics, his central insight seems important and
appealing. It is plausible that sensory-perceptual systems have the
function to produce representations that carry information and that
this bears on their content. An alternative attempt to elaborate this
insight is sketched later.</p>

<h3><a name="3.2">3.2 Consumer and Benefit-Based Theories</a></h3>

<p>
Millikan (1984) and Papineau (1984) were the first to offer
non-informational, “benefit-based” or
“consumer-based,” versions of teleological theories of
mental content.  Millikan's theory is described in this section and
Papineau's in the next.  Millikan's view is richly elaborated in her
(1984), her (1989) provides a compressed version, while her (2004,
part IV) is somewhere between the two in terms of detail.  </p>

<p>
At least in her earlier work, Millikan's theory of content focussed
heavily on the “consumers” of representations, where the
consumers of representations are the systems that have historically
used the mapping between the representations and their contents to
perform their (the consumers') proper functions. In her (1989)
Millikan maintains that the production of mental representations is
irrelevant to their contents.  She has claimed that attention to the
consumers is crucial for solving a certain functional indeterminacy
problem, a claim to be discussed in <a href="#4.1">section
4.1</a>. </p>

<p>

On Millikan's theory, when the relevant representation is used to
communicate between creatures, the producer and the consumer of the
representation are different creatures. One of Millikan's examples is
of a beaver splash: the beaver that splashes its tail is the producer
of the representation and the consumers are the nearby beavers that
dive for cover, having been warned of danger. In the case of internal
representations, it is less clear what counts as the producer and
consumer. Millikan sometimes speaks as if they are different
sub-systems and sometimes as if they are different time-slices of the
same system, before and after the representation is tokened. In either
case, a consumer is a system that Normally exploits the mapping
between a representation and its represented in the performance of its
proper function, where 'Normally' is understood in a teleological and
not a statistical sense.

</p>

<p> 

Consumers might or might not be cognitive systems; Millikan does not
seem to require them to be cognitive systems. Consider the often
mentioned case of the frog, which responds to anything appropriately
small, dark and moving past its retinas by darting out its tongue. In
this case, one relevant consumer of the frog's sensory-perceptual
representation might be the frog's digestive system. The performance
of its function of feeding the frog depends on and in that sense
exploits the mapping between the frog's sensory-perceptual
representation and its content, which is (Millikan says) frog
food.  </p>

<p>

To find out the content of a representation, says Millikan, we look at
the functions of its consumers, which are co-adapted with the
producing systems.  If a consumer system has a function then past
systems of the type did something adaptive that contributed to the
preservation or proliferation of such systems in the population.
Ancestral frogs had ancestral digestive systems, for example, and
these did things that contributed to the preservation and
proliferation of such digestive systems in frogs. It is the
explanation of this selection of the consumer system that most nearly
concerns the content of the representation, says Millikan. To
determine the content of a representation, we consider those past
occasions on which consumer systems of the type contributed to
selection of that type of system and we ask what mapping between the
representation and the world was required for this
contribution. According to Millikan, the frog's visual representation
represents frog food, since it was only when there was frog food where
the frog snapped that the frog was fed and so it was only then that
the frog's digestive system contributed to the selection of systems of
that type through the use of the representation. Millikan calls that
which must have mapped on to the representation in this way the Normal
condition for the performance of the proper function of the consumer
(in the Normal way).  The Normal condition is the content of the
representation.</p>

<p>

An issue worth considering is whether a multiplicity of consumers
(e.g., the frog's motor control system employed in orienting toward
the stimulus, the digestive system that digests the food, the
circulatory system that circulates the digested nutrients and so on)
for a given representation will lead to inappropriate content
ambiguity. This will depend on whether different consumers have
different Normal conditions for the use of the same representation. If
the Normal conditions for the functions of various systems that
consume a representation in an individual routinely coincide one might
wonder if the Normal conditions for the functions of producing systems
will also coincide and, if so, why we need to focus on consumers in
particular. This might be one reason why, in later writings, Millikan
does not emphasize the consumer's functions over the producer's to the
same extent.  </p>

<p>

Some argue that Millikan's theory has advantages in comparison with
Dretske's indicator semantics (see e.g., Godfrey-Smith 1989 and
Millikan 2004). On Millikan's theory, a representation, <em>R</em>,
can represent some environmental feature,
<em>C</em>, even if it was never entirely reliable that if there was
an <em>R</em> then there was a <em>C</em>. It is enough, on her
theory, that <em>R</em>s mapped on to <em>C</em>s often enough for the
representation's consumers to have (so to speak) benefited from that
mapping. There is no need to provide independently specifiable channel
conditions or to distinguish between recruitment and post-recruitment
environments.  </p>

<p>

It can also be argued that Millikan has solved the problem of distal
content for innate as well as learned concepts. Neither retinal images
nor light reflected from prey feed a frog. So it can be argued that
the Normal condition for the performance of the proper function of the
consumer of the frog's perceptual representation is frog food, not
light reflected from the prey or retinal images. However, whether
Millikan's solution to the problem of distal content survives closer
scrutiny is not clear. A solution must exclude inappropriately
proximal items, as well as include appropriately distal items. Food is
included in the content of the frog's perceptual representation, on
Millikan's theory, but the issue is whether the proximal items that
carry information about the food to the frog are excluded. Frog food
is of no use to a frog if the frog cannot detect it and a frog can
only Normally detect its prey if light is reflected from it and an
appropriate retinal image results.  So a worry is whether the Normal
condition includes the more proximal links in the causal chain as
well. </p>

<p>

Millikan considers a related objection to do with omnipresent
beneficial background conditions, the <em>prima facie</em> worry being
whether her theory excludes them. To stay with the same example,
consider that other things besides frog food were required for a
contribution to fitness on past occasions when the frog's perceptual
representation was used (e.g., oxygen and gravity). Does her theory
entail that the frog's perceptual representation means, not
<em>frog food</em>, but something more like <em>frog food in the
presence of oxygen and gravity</em>. Millikan excludes such background
conditions on the grounds that they do not <em>explain</em> the
success of the systems that consume the representation. </p>

<p>

This entry refers to Millikan's theory as a
“benefit-based” theory, since it links content to the
benefit to the creatures (or to the consuming systems) that accrues
from the use of a representation. That to which a representation
refers is not necessarily beneficial; it might instead be its
avoidance that is beneficial (e.g., the avoidance of danger, in the
case of the beaver splash).  While gravity is beneficial, being tied
to Earth by gravity is not a benefit that accrues to frogs due to the
use of their prey-representations. The ingestion of nutritional
substances, on the other hand, is something that results from the use
of the prey-representations. Benefit-based theories need not be
consumer-based theories, however, since we could speak of benefits to
producing systems or (when the relevant selection is natural selection
operating over an evolutionary span of time) to the inclusive fitness
of the creature as a whole.</p>

<p>
One objection to Millikan's Normal conditions is that they are overly
specific for plausible contents. Consider the fact that all sorts of
circumstances could prevent a contribution to fitness: for example, an
infected fly or a crow standing nearby could spell disease or death
instead of nutrition for the frog (Hall, 1990). It has been argued
that Millikan's theory has the unintended consequence that the frog's
representation has the content
<em>food that is not infected, when no crow is standing by …
etc.</em>.</p>

<p>

Pietroski (1992) also argues that Millikan's theory provides
implausible intentional explanations. His tale of the kimu is intended
to press the point.  The kimu are color-blind creatures, until a
mutation arises which results in a mechanism that produces a brain
state, <em>B</em>, in response to red. Those who inherit this
mechanism enjoy the sensation, which leads them to climb to the top of
the nearest hill every morning (to see the rising sun or some
flowers). The result is that they avoid the dawn-marauding predators,
the snorf, who hunt in the valley below and, solely as a result of
this, there is selection for the mutation.  As Pietroski wants to
describe the case, <em>B</em>s have the content <em>red</em>
(or <em>there is some red</em>) and the kimu enjoy the sight or red
and seek out the sight of red things. The point of the story is that
Millikan's theory does not allow the story to be told this way. On her
theory, the kimu do not see a visual target as red or desire the sight
of red, given that it was not the mapping between <em>B</em>s and red
but between <em>B</em>s and snorf-free-space that was crucial for the
fitness of the kimu (and so for the selection of any relevant
consumers of the representation). On Millikan's theory, <em>B</em>s
mean <em>snorf-free-space</em> and there is no representation of red
in a kimu's brain.</p>

<p>

Pietroski argues that biting the bullet is radically revisionist in
this case. Behavioral tests, he says, could support his claim.  Plant
a red flag among a crowd of snorf and the kimu will eagerly join
them. It is consistent with his story that contemporary kimu might
never have seen a snorf and might be unable to recognise one were it
stood smack in front of their faces. Intuitively, we want to say that
they might know nothing of snorf, he says. Pietroski suggests that
this might be a problem for all teleological theories of
content. However, it is more specifically an objection to a
benefit-based version (some other teleological theories of content
imply that the kimu represent red, see
 <a href="#3.5">section 3.5</a>).</p>

<p>

Millikan (2000, p. 149) agrees that her theory entails that the kimu's
B-states represent <em>fewer snorf this way</em>. She argues that we
need to distinguish between the properties represented and the
properties that cause representations. How else, she asks, could a
tortoise think <em>chow this way</em>, given that being nutritious is
an invisible property and so could not cause a sensory-perceptual
representation? Setting aside what a tortoise really thinks, the worry
is how a causal theory of content can allow for the representation of
that which lies behind the surface features of objects, or how a
causal theory of content can account for natural kind concepts that
have hidden or unknown “essences” (e.g., a concept of
water, which is necessarily composed of H<sub>2</sub>O).</p>

<p>
Price (2001) offers a detailed teleological theory that is similar to
Millikan's.  She defends Millikan's interpretation of the mind of the
kimu on the ground that it better explains their behavior. She
endorses the idea that the point of making content ascriptions is to
rationalize behavior and her claim is that a desire to avoid snorf is
a better reason to climb to the top of the hill than a desire to watch
the sun rise or see red flowers. Several responses are possible. One
is that a desire to watch a sunrise is reason enough to climb a
hill. Another is that we are left without a rational explanation of
why a kimu would be eager to enter snorf-infested space when the snorf
are near red, other than that they are psychologically incapable of
correctly representing the presence of snorf when snorf are near
red. A further possible response is to question whether it is the role
of content ascriptions to rationalize behavior (as famously claimed by
Davidson (1985) and Dennett (1996)).</p>

<p>

In relation to this last point, one can ask if some content
ascriptions are suitable for some theoretical purposes and others for
others. One might agree that folk psychological ascriptions of
intentional mental states are meant to rationalize behavior but
question whether this is their role in cognitive science. In the
latter case, the aim is to explain the psychological capacities of
humans and (in the case of cognitive neuroethology) other creatures.
Thus a question to ask is what content ascriptions would serve the
explanatory purposes of the mind and brain sciences, rather than our
folk psychological intuitions.  Neander (2006) and Schulte
(forthcoming) argue that benefit-based theories generate the wrong
contents for mainstream (information-processing) theories of
perception in relation to the simple system cases discussed in the
philosophy literature.  A principle of such mainstream theories is is
that, in vision, the invisible properties of objects are only
represented after the visible surface features of objects are first
represented (see, e.g., Palmer 1999).  The worry is that
benefit-based theories can entail that it is only the invisible but
beneficial property that are represented in perception. </p>

<p>
Further afield, Shapiro (1992) discusses the role of
content ascriptions in foraging theory, which raises a different set of
theoretical considerations.</p>

<p>

Millikan occasionally makes it clear that her theory is intended as a
version of an isomorphism theory. According to an isomorphism theory,
representation is a matter of mirroring the relations among the
elements in the represented domain in the relations among elements in
the representing domain.  Since the relevant resemblances are
relational, there is no requirement that representations share
properties other than abstract relational properties with their
representeds. This makes isomorphism theories more plausible than
crude resemblance theories. However, this aspect of Millikan's theory
is not much developed. (See Shea 2012 for discussion of the role of
isomorphism in her theory.)  </p>

<p>
To a large extent, Millikan's theory has been responsible for the
great interest, both positive and negative, that philosophers have
shown in this general class of theories. Her writings on the topic are
extensive and this section has only touched on the basics of her
view. </p>

       

<h3><a name="3.3">3.3 Non-combinatorial Theories</a></h3>

<p>

A further way in which teleological theories of content can differ is
with respect to the contents that they aim to explain. David
Papineau's theory, developed at the same time as Millikan's, will help
illustrate this point. Papineau (1984, 1987, 1990 and 1993) develops a
theory that is top-down, or non-combinatorial, insofar as the
representational states to which his theory most directly applies are
whole propositional attitudes (e.g., beliefs and desires). In early
writings, Millikan sometimes seems to hold a similar view and some
objections initially raised against her theory are based on this
interpretation of her view (see, e.g., Fodor 1990b, 64–69, where
he raises some of the following points).</p>

<p>

In Papineau's theory, the contents of desires are primary and those of
beliefs are secondary in terms of their derivation. According to
Papineau, a desire's “real satisfaction condition” is
“… that effect which it is the desire's biological
purpose to produce” (1993, 58–59), by which he means that
“[s]ome past selection mechanism has favored that desire —
or, more precisely, the ability to form that type of desire — in
virtue of that desire producing that effect” (1993, 59). So
desires have the function of causing us, in collaboration with our
beliefs, to bring about certain conditions, conditions that enhanced
the fitness of people in the past who had these desires. Desires, in
general, were selected for causing us to bring about conditions that
contributed to our fitness, and particular desires were selected for
causing us to bring about particular conditions. These conditions are
referred to as their satisfaction conditions and they are the contents
of desires.</p>

<p>

The “real truth condition” of a belief, Papineau tells us,
is the condition that must obtain if the desire with which it
collaborates in producing an action is to be satisfied by the
condition brought about by that action. A desire that has the function
of bringing it about that we have food has the content that we have
food, since it was selected for bringing it about that we have food,
and if this desire collaborates with a belief to cause us to go to the
fridge, the content of the belief is that there is food in the fridge
if our desire for food would only be satisfied by our doing so if it
is true that there is food in the fridge (Papineau's example).</p>

<p>

This seems to reject the Language of Thought hypothesis, according to
which thought employs a combinatorial semantics. Language is
combinatorial to the extent that the meaning of a sentence is a
function of the meanings of the words in the sentence and their
syntactic relations. “Rover attacked Fluff” has a
combinatorial meaning if its meaning is a function of the meaning of
“Rover”, the meaning of “attacked” and the
meaning of “Fluff”, along with their syntactic relations
(so that “Rover attacked Fluff” differs in meaning from
“Fluff attacked Rover”). According to some philosophers
(see esp. Fodor 1975) the content of propositional attitudes is
combinatorial in an analogous sense. That is, for instance, the
content of a belief is a function of the contents of the component
concepts employed in the proposition believed, along with their
syntactic relations. A teleological theory of content can be
combinatorial, for it can maintain that the content of a
representation that expresses a proposition is determined by the
separate histories of the representations for the conceptual
constituents of the proposition (and, perhaps, by the selection
history of the syntactic rules that apply to their syntactic
relations). Papineau's theory is not combinatorial, at least for some
propositional attitudes.  Instead, the proposal is that the contents
of concepts are a function of their role in the beliefs and desires in
which they participate.</p>

<p>

Papineau's theory is a benefit-based theory, and some issues discussed
in the previous sub-section are relevant to an assessment of it. For
instance, it is unclear that what we desire is always what is
beneficial to fitness. One might want sex, not babies or bonding, and
yet it might be the babies and the bonding that are crucial for
fitness. However, this section will not attempt an overview of the
strengths and weaknesses of this theory but will focus on issues
peculiar to non-combinatorial accounts.</p>

<p>

Any non-combinatorial theory must face certain general objections to
non-combinatorial theories, such as the objection that it cannot
account for the productivity and systematicity of thought (Fodor 1981,
1987). This entry will not rehearse that argument (see the entry on
 <a href="../language-thought/">the language of thought hypothesis</a>) 
 but special problems for a teleological
version of a non-combinatorial theory need to be mentioned. Consider,
for example, the desire to dance around a magnolia tree when the stars
are bright, while wearing two carrots for horns and two half cabbages
for breasts. Probably no-one has wanted to do this. But now suppose
that someone does develop this desire (to prove Papineau wrong, say)
so that it is desired for the first time. We cannot characterize the
situation in this way, according to a non-combinatorial teleological
theory.  Since it has never been desired before, it has no history of
selection and so no content on its first occurrence, on that style of
theory. It is also a problem for this kind of theory that some desires
do not or cannot contribute to their own satisfaction (e.g., the
desire for rain tomorrow or the desire to be immortal) and that some
desires that do contribute to their own satisfaction will not be
selected for doing so (e.g., the desire to smoke or to kill one's
children). In contrast, teleological theories that are combinatorial
have no special problem with novel desires, desires that cannot
contribute to bringing about their own satisfaction conditions or
desires that have satisfaction conditions that do not enhance fitness,
as long as their constitutive concepts have appropriate selection
histories or are somehow built up from simpler concepts that have
appropriate selection histories.</p>

<p>

Papineau can respond by agreeing that some concessions to a
combinatorial semantics have to be made.  Once some desires and
beliefs have content, the concepts involved acquire content from their
role in these and they can be used to produce further novel, or
self-destructive or causally impotent desires. However, it needs to be
shown that such a concession is not <em>ad hoc</em>. The problem is to
justify the claim that the desire to blow up a plane with a shoe
explosive is combinatorial, whereas the belief that there is food in
the fridge is not.</p>

<h3><a name="3.4">3.4 More or Less Modest Combinatorial Theories</a></h3>

<p>

In contrast to Papineau's theory, some teleological theories are
combinatorial theories. According to these theories, a teleological
theory directly accounts for the contents of just the representational
simples and combinatorial processes are in addition involved in
determining the content of more complex representations. </p>

<p>
There are two kinds of possible combinatorial processes that might be
involved. One operates at the level of a proposition, or at the level
of entire map-like or pictorial representations. This type of
combinatorial process is thought to play a role that is roughly
analogous to the role of a grammar in a spoken language, or a role
that is roughly analogous to the principles of map-formation in
cartography or pictorial composition in picturing.  For example, it
might allow us to combine the concepts CAT, ON and MAT to produce the
thought (belief, desire, etc.) that the cat is on the mat. </p>

<p>
A second kind of combinatorial process that might be involved operates
at the level of single concepts and their associated conceptions.
Some think that simpler concepts could be combined in conceptions to
formulate more sophisticated concepts or to fix the reference of more
sophisticated concepts that remain at roughly the grain of the lexemes
of a language. Most simply, the concepts MALE, ADULT and NOT MARRIED
might be combined to form the concept BACHELOR by means of a
definitional conception. Or there might be other types of conceptions
involved, such as Wittgensteinian family resemblance conceptions or
prototype-style conceptions. </p>

<p>
Teleological theories can be more or less modest in their scope. A
modest theory only aims to directly account for the contents of
representational simples.  Dretske (1986), expresses a
“modest” view when he gives voice to the hope that more
sophisticated representations can be built out of the simple
sensory-perceptual representations his theory accommodates. However,
there is as yet no clear agreement among philosophers or psychologists
as to which the representational simples are.</p>

<p>

One modest view is that a teleological theory should directly apply to
sensory-perceptual and motor representations and to innate concepts
only (i.e., those that can be produced without learning). However,
even this needs qualifying, since it is controversial which of our
concepts are innate. On a radical nativist view, such as that of Fodor
(1981), all or almost all of the concepts expressed by the lexical
morphemes (the smallest meaningful components) of a language are
innate (not learned, only triggered). If that were really so, a theory
that aimed to account for the contents of all innate concepts would
need to be quite ambitious.  Those who propose genuinely modest
teleological theories of content do not hold this view, for they claim
that some mental representations that correspond to lexical morphemes
are sophisticated, in the sense that they are somehow composed out of
or acquired through the use of other representations.</p>

<p>

Sterelny (1990) describes his teleological theory as
“modest” because it only attempts to give an account of
innate representations and he assumes these to be a relatively small
subset of the complete set of our mental representations.  As for
giving an account of the human propositional attitudes, Sterelny
maintains that a teleological theory of content will face
“appalling difficulties.” He believes that a teleological
theory for the representational simples will be part of the complete
psycho-semantic theory but not the whole of it. This contrasts with
Papineau's theory, which most directly applies to propositional
attitudes.  It also contrasts with Millikan's (1984) highly ambitious
attempt to directly account, not only for the contents of all mental
representations, but also for the meanings of all linguistic
utterances
<em>via</em> a teleological theory.</p>

<p>

A modest teleological theory might claim some advantages. Most
obviously, unless some concepts can be derived from other concepts,
teleological theories would seem to have trouble accounting for empty
concepts. For example, no unicorns were ever indicated by UNICORNs,
the presence of a unicorn was never a Normal condition for the
performance of the proper function of a consumer of UNICORNs, and the
desire to find a unicorn has never been satisfied so that the
conditions involved in the satisfaction of this desire could not have
contributed to selection of the mechanisms that produce desires of the
type.  This problem is avoided by a teleological theory that aims to
directly account for the contents of just the representational
simples, on the assumption that no representational simple expresses
an empty concept. (Rey (2010) questions that assumption.)  </p>

<p>
It is sometimes argued that the lack of unicorns as (e.g.) Normal
conditions is unproblematic since UNICORN does not refer (to anything
actual). Arguably, non-modest theories deliver the correct referential
content.  It is a question whether a theory of referential content
needs to determine the extension of a concept in all possible
worlds. (If the reader's view is that there are no unicorns in any
possible worlds because unicorns are essentially fictional, the reader
should here substitute another example of an actually empty but
possibly non-empty concept, such as a concept of phlogiston or of
entelechies.) Some theories of referential content do and some do not
take on this task. </p>

<p>
The greatest challenge to those offering modest theories will be to
explain how complex concepts can be composed out of or derived from
simpler concepts. It might fairly be said that it is not the task of a
fundamental theory of mental content <em>per se</em> to explain how
complex concepts can be composed out of simpler ones, but it is a
problem for modest theories if no such explanation is available.
Moreover, providing such an explanation is generally thought to be
problematic. Some say that “modest” theories have some
seriously immodest consequences. One is alleged to be that there must
be a principled analytic/synthetic distinction.  See, for instance,
Fodor and Lepore (1992), who argue that we must choose between three
options: defending a principled analytic/synthetic distinction,
accepting meaning holism or accepting that virtually no concepts of
roughly the grain of the lexemes of a language are composed out of
simpler concepts. They further argue that the first two options are
not viable.  However, some psychologists maintain that we must somehow
“bootstrap” up from simple to sophisticated concepts (see
e.g., Carey (2009)). And some philosophers are anyway unconvinced by
Fodor and Lepore's arguments.  (Readers who would like to read more on
concepts and conceptions might start with the introduction to and
readings in Margolis and Laurence (1999) and the entries in this
encyclopedia on concepts and on the analytic-synthetic
distinction.)  </p>

<h3><a name="3.5">3.5 Causal-Informational Theories</a></h3>

<p>

To round out this survey of views, we return to informational
theories, to look at some more recent work that is broadly in the
tradition of Stampe and Dretske. These theories take seriously the
idea that mental representations have informational functions.  </p>

<p>
First, a response is offered to an argument that is intended to block
all informational versions of teleosemantics.  This argument is that,
because functions are selected <em>effects</em>, any appeal to
representational functions must be an appeal to the effects of
representations and not their causes (Millikan (1989b, 85), Papineau
(1998, 3)). One response is to accept this argument's conclusion but
to maintains that an additional informational requirement can
nonetheless be added to an appeal to functions; teleological theories
of mental content can appeal to other things besides functions (Shea,
2007).</p>

<p>
An alternative response rejects the argument. Neander (2012) claims
that sensory-perceptual systems have what she calls “response
functions,” where to respond to something is to be caused by it
to do something else. For example, a visual system might be caused by
a red instantiation to change into a RED state, and it might have been
selected (in part) for being disposed to change into a RED state in
response to red and have the function to do so. </p>

<p>
On Neander's view, these state changes represent the causes to which
the system is supposed to respond by producing the representation in
question.  They are, so to speak, the Normal causes of the producer of
the representation, rather than the Normal conditions for the
performance of the proper function of the representation's consumer.
On this view, RED has the content <em>red</em> if the visual system
that produces it has the function to produce it in response to red, or
more specifically in response to red being instanced in the receptive
field of the perceptual processing pathways responsible for the RED's
production. This is the basic idea though further complications are
added.  One is intended to solve the problem of distal content as
follows: </p>

<blockquote>
 A sensory-perceptual representation, <em>R</em>, in a
sensory-perceptual system <em>S</em>, has the descriptive
content <em>C</em> and not <em>Prox-C</em> if:

<ol>
<li> <em>S</em> was selected for producing
<em>R</em>s in response to <em>C</em>s and, </li>

<li> if <em>S</em> was selected for producing <em>R</em>s in response
to both <em>C</em>s and <em>Prox-C</em>s, it was selected for
producing <em>R</em>s in response to <em>Prox-C</em>s because this was
a means to its producing <em>R</em>s in response to <em>C</em>s and
not <em>vice-versa</em>.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>

The second requirement is intended to determine appropriately distal
content and is to be applied only after the first requirement is
applied. The first requirement on its own does not determine suitably
distal content because there is a causal chain leading from <em>C</em>
to <em>R</em> and, if the system had been selected for responding
to <em>C</em>s by producing <em>R</em>s, it must also have been
selected for responding to the proximal items in the causal chain
(such as the light reflected from <em>C</em>s toward the retina of the
eye, in the case of visual perception). These more proximal items in
the causal chain carry information about <em>C</em> to the system and
through the system to the <em>R</em>.  There is, however, an
asymmetry, to which the second requirement appeals.  The system was
selected for its disposition to respond to the proximal items because
by that means it responded to the more distal items, but the system
was not selected for responding to the more distal item because by
that means it responded to the more proximal items. (It does not
respond to the more proximal items by means of its responding to the
more distal items; that is not how the means-end analysis pans
out).</p>

<p>

On this causal theory, a sensory-perceptual system need not have
produced <em>R</em>s only in the presence of <em>C</em>s during
selection of the system.  There is no need to specify channel
conditions or conditions in which representation is reliable. This is
not a type-1 teleological theory of content. The idea that
representations are reliably caused by or correlated with their
contents in some conditions does not figure in the proposal.  </p>

<p>

The first requirement ensures different content ascriptions to those
generated by benefit-based teleological theories. For example,
consider again the kimu (see <a href="#3.2">section 3.2</a>).  As
stipulated by Pietrosky, it is the presence of red and not the absence
of snorf that causes the relevant mechanism in a kimu to produce
a <em>B</em>-state. Mechanisms of the type were not selected for a
disposition to be caused by an absence of snorf to
produce <em>B</em>-states.  They had no such disposition, so they
could not have been selected for it. The relevant mechanisms in the
kimu were selected for a disposition to be caused by red to produce
a <em>B</em>-state, as well as for further causing certain movements
(hill climbing of a morning) thereby. They were selected for this
because red correlated well enough with snorflessness in the kimu's
habitat. However, on this proposal, that further fact becomes a
background evolutionary fact that is not content constitutive. The
candidate content <em>fewer snorf this way</em> fails to pass the
first requirement. </p>

<p>
Consider too the notorious case of the frog. Plausibly, the relevant
visual pathways in the frog's brain were selected for their
disposition to be caused by a certain configuration of visible
features (roughly, something's being small, dark and moving) to
produce the sensory-perceptual representation in question, as well as
for their disposition to initiate orienting and so on thereby.  They
were plausibly selected for this preferential response to the
configuration of visible features because things with these features
were often enough nutritious for the frog. The visual pathways in the
frog were not selected for a disposition to respond to the nutritional
value of a stimulus, however. For the normal frog's visual system has
no causal sensitivity to the nutritional value of the stimulus and
cannot have been selected for a causal sensitivity it did not have.
So, on this proposal, the visual content of the representation
is <em>something small, dark, moving</em> (or something along these
lines) rather than <em>frog food</em>. According to Neander (2006) the
configuration of visible features is the right style of visual content
to ascribe for the purpose of mainstream scientific explanations of an
anuran's visual capacities.</p>

<p>
Nor does this proposal seem to generate overly specific contents of
the kind mentioned earlier in relation to benefit-based theories.  On
this informational theory, the frog does not represent the stimulus as
not carrying an infectious disease, even if only those small, dark and
moving things that were not carrying an infectious disease contributed
to frog fitness when the frog was fed. Sensory-perceptual systems can
only have been selected for causal dispositions which past systems of
the type possessed. Since past systems had no disposition to respond
preferentially to the absence of an infectious disease in visual
stimuli that were small, dark and moving, the fact that contributions
to fitness were made only on those occasions when an infectious
disease was absent is, again, a background evolutionary fact that is
not content-constitutive on this proposal.  </p>

<p>
One possible concern is whether sufficient room for
misrepresentation has been made. Some early discussions of
teleological theories of content assumed that the content of the
frog's representation must be <em>frog food</em> or <em>fly</em> or
else misrepresentation would be impossible.  The frog would not be in
error when it snapped at something small, dark and moving that was not
frog food, or not a fly.  However, misrepresentation is possible on
this proposal.  A representation that is supposed to be produced in
response to something that is small, dark and moving and is instead
produced in response to something large and looming would count as
misrepresenting and a neurologically damaged frog (e.g., one with a
damaged thalamus) will indeed attempt to catch all sorts of
inappropriate things (e.g., an experimenter's hand or even the frog's
own limbs). This informational theory also entails that a
kimu's <em>B</em>-state will misrepresent if it is tokened in response
to anything that is not red. More importantly, perhaps, it seems to
entail that human REDs will misrepresent if tokened at something
not-red, as could happen in red-green color blindness, in color
contrast illusions or in unusual viewing conditions.  </p>

<p>
As Millikan (2012) and others have pointed out, there are
representations that cannot be caused by their contents, such as
TOMORROW. No tomorrow has ever caused a thought about
tomorrow. However, TOMORROW is not a sensory-perceptual representation
and so this is not an objection to this proposal per se.  As with
other modest theories, however, the challenge is explaining how to
link this modest theory for some mental contents to a more
comprehensive theory that accounts for all of the contents of all of
our concepts (see section <a href="#3.4">section 3.4</a>).  </p>

<h2><a name="4">4. Problems for Teleosemantics</a></h2>

<p>

The preceding survey of teleological theories of content does not
mention all of the extant teleological theories but it illustrates
some of the commonalities and differences among them. Now we turn to
some objections that have been raised against the general idea of
teleosemantics. This section looks at the objections that have been
most influential. Some have already been touched on in previous
sections.</p>

<h3><a name="4.1">4.1 Functional Indeterminacy </a></h3>

<p>

There are several potential indeterminacy problems. Aside from the
problem of distal content, which has already been discussed above in
relation to the different theories that treat it in different ways,
there are two other indeterminacy problems.  One concerns the fact
that natural selection is extensional (Fodor, 1990b) and the other
concerns the fact that natural selection selects traits for complex
causal roles (Neander, 1995).  Both problems can perhaps be attributed
to Dretske (1986), though Dretske did not distinguish them from the
problem of distal content, the problem he seems primarily to have been
interested in solving.  </p>

<p>

Fodor once devised a teleological theory of mental content
(published years later, as Fodor 1990a). However, he quickly repudiated
the idea and has since been one of the most vigorous critics of
the general idea. His main objection was initially that teleological
theories leave content indeterminate because functions are
indeterminate. Functional indeterminacy, according
to Fodor (1990b), stems from the fact that natural selection is
extensional in the following sense: if it is adaptive for an organism,
<em>O</em>, to do something, <em>M</em>, in the presence of
environmental feature, <em>F</em>, and <em>F</em> is reliably
co-extensive with another feature, <em>G</em>, then it is equally
adaptive for <em>O</em> to do <em>M</em> in the presence of <em>G</em>.
Fodor argues that teleological theories therefore cannot distinguish
between candidate contents that are co-extensional in the environment
in which a creature evolved.</p>

<p>

Fodor's example is the frog that snaps at anything that is suitably
small, dark and moving and thereby feeds itself. According to Fodor,
if it was adaptive for the frog to snap at flies then it was equally
adaptive for it to snap at small, dark, moving things on the
simplifying assumption that flies and small, dark, moving things were
reliably co-extensive in the frog's natural habitat. According to
Fodor, we can equally well say that the function of the device is to
detect flies <em>and</em> that its function is to detect small, dark,
moving things. So, if we try to determine the content of the
representation by reference to the function of the detection
mechanism, the content remains indeterminate. We can choose to
describe the function one way or another but if the content depends on
how we choose to describe the function it is not a naturalized
content. Note that the candidate contents <em>fly</em> and <em>frog
food</em> and <em>small, dark moving thing</em> each license different
assessments concerning misrepresentation.  If the frog is representing
the stimulus as a fly, for instance, it misrepresents something that
is small, dark and moving that is not a fly, using the relevant
representation. If it represents the stimulus as small, dark and
moving, it does not.  </p>

<p>

The standard response to this objection starts by pointing out that
the function of a trait is what that type of trait was selected
<em>for</em> and that the notion of selection <em>for</em> is a causal
notion (Sterelny 1990, Millikan 1991). A trait is
selected <em>for</em> its possession of a certain property only if
that property causally contributed to selection of traits of the type
(see Sober 1984). The heart was selected for circulating blood but
not for making a thumping noise even though the two co-occured. It was
selected for pumping rather than thumping given that the pumping but
not the thumping causally contributed to the inclusive fitness of
ancestral creatures and thus causally contributed to the selection of
hearts. Functions can therefore distinguish between two properties
that reliably co-vary as long as one but not caused the trait to be
selected. This point has mostly been well-taken.</p>

<p>
However, appeal to selection <em>for</em> does not suffice to
disambiguate content (Griffiths &amp; Goode 1995, Neander
1995). In the case of the frog's detection device, its responding to
small, dark, moving things and its helping the frog to catch and
swallow something nutritious <em>both</em> played a causal role in
selection of the relevant representation producing or consuming
systems. It was <em>by</em> detecting small, dark moving things that
the frog got fed. So neither the detecting of something small, dark
and moving, nor the eating of something nutritious was a mere
side-effect or mere piggy back trait.  We return to this issue in a
moment.</p>

<p>

Fodor (1996) anyway continues to object that there is a remainder of a
problem along these lines because content, he claims, is more
fine-grained than selection histories can account for. He maintains
that teleological theories cannot discriminate contents finely enough
when there are properties that are logically or nomologically
co-extensive.  Being triangular (being a closed plane figure with
three straight sides) and being trilateral (being a closed plane
figure with three inner angles) are logically co-extensive properties.
Being a renate (a creature with a kidney) and being a cordate (a
creature with a heart) are (Fodor assumes) nomologically
co-extensive. According to Fodor, we cannot distinguish between
selection for adaptive responses in the presence of one versus the
other of two such properties.  We can represent each distinctly but,
according to Fodor, selection histories are not sufficiently
fine-grained to distinguish such contents. </p>

<p>

Consider the two options: either the causal powers of two
co-extensional properties <em>F</em> and <em>G</em> are distinct or
they are not distinct. Suppose first that they are not distinct. On
some plausible and medium-grained theories of property individuation,
properties are individuated by their causal powers, so if there is no
difference in the causal powers of <em>F</em> and <em>G</em>, they are
the same property on such a theory. On this way of individuating
properties, a representation that refers to the one must refer to the
other too and so there is no problem here for a theory of referential
content. On this way of thinking, if there is no distinction between
the causal powers of triangularity and trilaterality, any difference
in the mental representations TRIANGULAR and TRILATERAL must be a
difference of a different sort. It might be a difference in
representational vehicle, or in other words, the two might be
different predicates denoting the same property. They might,
consistent with this, differ in their cognitive roles. Alternatively,
modest theories can maintain that these two representations are
semantically complex, in which case there might be a difference (even
a referential difference) in the constituent concepts out of which
TRIANGULAR and TRILATERAL are composed (e.g., one mentions angles and
one does not).</p>

<p>
Suppose, on the other hand, that <em>F</em> and <em>G</em> do have
distinct causal powers.  Most would agree that this is in fact the
case if <em>X</em> is the property of being a creature with a kidney
and <em>Y</em> is the property of being a creature with a heart. In
that case, this version of the objection does not get off the
ground. If the causal powers of the properties differ, they can play
different roles in selection histories.  Consider, for example, the
proposal that the contents of sensory-perceptual representations are
(so to speak) their Normal causes.  A system can have a disposition to
be caused by <em>F</em>s to do <em>M</em>, without having a
disposition to be caused by <em>G</em>s to do <em>M</em>,
if <em>F</em> and <em>G</em> have distinct causal powers even (if they
are co-extensive). The system can be selected for the one disposition
that it has but it cannot be selected for the disposition that it does
not have.
</p>

<p>

Fodor's objection has evolved into a general objection to any
adaptational explanation and to the very notion of
selection <em>for</em>.  It would take too much space to follow the
trail further here.  (See Fodor and Piatelli-Palmarini 2010 and see
esp. Block and Kitcher 2010 and Sober 2011 (Other Internet Resources)
for effective critical discussion). </p>

<p>

We turn now to the second functional indeterminacy problem. It stems
from the fact that organic systems are selected for complex causal
roles, as indicated earlier. For example, a gene in an antelope might
have been selected because it (i) altered the shape of hemoglobin,
(ii) which increased oxygen uptake, (iii) which allowed the antelope
to move to higher ground, (iv) which gave them access to richer
pasture in summer, (v) and so improved their nutritional status, their
immunity to disease, their vigor in avoiding predation, their
attraction to mates and (vi) their chances of survival and
reproduction (Neander, 1995). To determine the function of a trait,
such as the altered shape of the hemoglobin, the etiological theory of
functions tells us to ask, “what did past instances do that was
adaptive and that caused traits of that type to be
selected?”. In this case, the answer is (ii) through (vi).  The
altered shape of the hemoglobin did all of this, and all of this was
adaptive, and all of this contributed to the selection of the trait
(i.e., it was selected <em>for</em> all of this). So all of this would
seem to be the trait's function.  Its function is the complex causal
role for which it was selected.</p>

<p>

The problem for content can be seen when we consider mechanisms that
produce or consume representations.  For instance, the frog's
detection device was selected because it (a) responded to small, dark,
moving things and (b) that helped the frog catch these things, and (c)
that provided the frog with nutrients and (d) that contributed to the
frog's chances of survival and reproduction in various ways. Thus
ancestral detection devices contributed to the selection of that type
of device by way of a complex causal route in which the visible
configuration of the stimulus and the nutritional properties of the
stimulus both play a role. Note that this does not depend on these
features of the environment being co-extensional. Even if not all
small, dark and moving things were nutritious and not all nutritious
things were small, dark and moving in the frog's natural habitat, this
problem of complex causal roles would still remain.  The problem is
that the systems responsible for the production and the consumption of
representations were selected for complex causal roles in which a
number of environmental features were involved. </p>

<p>

Agar (1993) supports the idea that the frog's representation
represents small, dark, moving food, a content intended to incorporate
all of the properties causally responsible for the selection. Price
(1998, 2001) claims that, contrary to what has just been said,
there <em>is</em> a unique, correct function ascription for each trait
and she elaborates a number of principles to isolate the unique,
correct function ascription. Enc (2002) endorses Price's claim that
function ascriptions must be determinate if any teleological theory of
content is to succeed but raises problems for her attempt to show that
function ascriptions are suitably determinate. </p>

<p>
However, teleological theories of content do not merely gesture toward
functions and leave it at that. Consider again the causal theory
discussed in the preceding section.  The content of the frog's
sensory-perceptual representation is not indeterminate between the
configuration of visible features and something nutritious on that
theory, since the frog's visual system was not selected for producing
the relevant sensory-perceptual representation in response to the
nutritional value of the stimulus. A frog's visual system is not
causally sensitive to the presence or absence of nutrients and could
not have been selected for a causal sensitivity it did not have.  The
general point here is that teleological theories of content appeal to
functions in certain ways and one must examine the particular theory
to see if the theory isolates a sufficiently determinate
content.  </p>

<p>

In responding to the indeterminacy problem, Millikan (1991) might be
thought to rely on the fact that, on her theory, it is the proper
function of the consumer and not that of the producer of the
representation that determines its content.  For instance, in
discussing Dretske's magnetesome example she says that, “[t]he
mechanisms THAT USE the magnetesome's offerings don't care at all
whether the magnet points to magnetic north, geomagnetic north or,
say, to the North Star. The only one of the conditions Dretske
mentioned that is necessary FOR THE USER'S PROPER FUNCTIONING is that
the magnet point in the direction of lesser oxygen” (Millikan
(1991, 163) original emphasis). However, it seems (to this author)
that Millikan's emphasis here does not put the emphasis in the right
place for her theory.  Recall that one consumer of the frog's
perceptual representation is the motor control system which controls
the frog's orienting toward the stimulus.  We can describe its
function as controlling the frog's orienting toward frog food, but we
could also describe it as controlling the frog's orienting toward
small, dark, moving things.  A mere appeal to consumers would seem to
shift the problem without solving it. However, it does not follow that
Millikan's theory leaves content indeterminate. It is Millikan's
appeal to Normal conditions that does more work in disambiguating the
content for her. </p>

<p>

Finally, some proponents of teleological theories do not think that
content <em>is</em> determinate in the cases used to illustrate the
alleged problem. Dennett (1995) maintains that such content
indeterminacy is unproblematic. Papineau (1997) maintains that content
is indeterminate in the case of a creatures that lacks a belief-desire
psychological structure. Whether a creature lacks a belief-desire
structure will in part depend on how we construe this requirement. It
is not straightforward whether frogs lack a belief-desire
psychological structure given that they have both informational and
motivational states. Nonetheless, Papineau is probably right that the
informational and motivational states are not so distinct as ours and
he might also be right that content indeterminacy at this level is
unproblematic.  We will, however, need to resolve related content
indeterminacy problems for human mental states. </p>

<h3><a name="4.2">4.2 Swampman</a></h3>

<p>

Another objection that has been influential is the Swampman
objection. Swampman-style examples have been around for some
time. Boorse (1976) imagines a population of rabbits accidentally
coalescing into existence as a counter-example to Wright's etiological
theory of functions. Boorse's claim was that we could ascribe
functions to the rabbits' parts even if the rabbits lacked any
selection-history. Swampman in particular was raised by Davidson
(1987) as a potential objection to his own historical (but not
teleological) theory of content. When Swampman comes into existence he
is a synchronic (at a time, but not extended over time) physical
replica of Davidson at a certain point in time (<em>t</em>).
Swampman's history differs radically from Davidson's because he comes
into existence as a result of a purely accidental collision of
elementary particles. Crucially, he does not partake in our
evolutionary history or have any other evolutionary history or any
developmental history of his own. Nor is he created by God or copied
from Davidson by a machine. The resemblance between Davidson and
Swampman is nothing but a stupendous coincidence.  Swampman's
appearance of design is deceptive because he in no way derives from
any design process, natural or intentional. Swampman's component parts
have no functions according to an etiological theory of function and
so his “brain” states have no contents according to a
teleological theory of mental content.</p>

<p>

Many people find these results highly counter-intuitive, especially
the result that Swampman lacks all intentional states. Assuming
physicalism, we could substitute Swampman for Davidson and no one,
including his most intimate friends and family, would detect a
difference. Swampman would make noises that his friends and family
would interpret as witty, interesting and meaningful but, according to
teleological theories (and Davidson's own theory of content) Swampman
has no ideas about philosophy, no perceptions of his surroundings and
no beliefs or desires about anything at all.</p>

<p>

There are two broad strategies in responding to this objection. One is
to try to loosen the grip of the intuition that Swampman has
intentional states and the other is to argue that any intuitions that
remain do not show that teleological theories are wrong. In either
case, it is important to isolate the relevant intuition because, by
all accounts, Swampman would have much that Davidson had
at <em>t</em>. All of the chemical activity in Davidson's brain when
he understood words, for example, would occur in Swampman's
brain-analog and certain descriptions of this activity will apply to
both equally: e.g., physical, chemical and formal descriptions of
it. Further, it is trivial that Swampman has narrow content if
“narrow content” is defined as whatever most closely
approximates content that nonetheless supervenes on just the narrow
physical states of an individual at a time and “from the skin
in.” By definition, whatever narrow content Davidson's mental
states had at <em>t</em>, Swampman's inner states had too, since
Swampman is at <em>t</em> physically indistinguishable “from the
skin in” from Davidson at
<em>t</em>. What teleological theories entail is that Swampman, no
matter what narrow content he has, lacks regular normative
content. The intuition that conflicts with teleological theories,
therefore, is that Swampman's inner states, which are narrowly
identical to Davidson's, are true, false, accurate or inaccurate in
the usual sense.</p>

<p>

It is clear that, if Swampman's inner states do have truth-evaluable
contents, they cannot always have the same truth values as Davidson's.
Everyone will probably agree that, at <em>t</em>, Swampman cannot
remember his past life since at most he could only have
pseudo-memories of Davidson's. Everyone will also agree that Swampman
cannot correctly think that he is returning home to his wife and
sitting in his house, since the house and the wife are not
his. Further, it should be kept in mind that many think that Putnam
(1975) has shown that the contents of natural kind concepts do not
supervene on just what is “in the head.” If Putnam-style
twin cases can be constructed for other mental representations and
their contents as well (see Burge 1979, 1986) then Swampman's lack of
history might anyway be an issue even before considering the further
complication of a teleological theory. It thus requires careful
analysis with respect to controversial issues to determine just what
intuitions about Swampman would tell against the externalism of
teleological theories in particular.</p>

<p>

Those who try to dislodge any remaining intuitions against
teleological theories argue that an appearance of design can be
misleading. (Recall that “design” here includes the
mechanical design-work of natural selection.) Consider, for example,
Boorse's swamprabbits. It might be intuitive to attribute functions to
their eye-analogs. But in nature nothing so intricately organized as
if for the performance of a function fails to be the result of a
design process. It is argued that habits of thought, which usually
take us from an appearance of design to a function ascription, lead to
false ascriptions in purely hypothetical unrealistic cases (Neander
1991).  Dretske (1996) argues the case with another imaginary example.
Twin-Tercel, a random replica of his old Tercel, comes about as the
result of a freakish storm in a junk yard. It is molecule-for-molecule
identical to his old Tercel, except that its “gas-gauge”
does not move in relation to the amount of gas in its
“tank”. We might be tempted to say that the thing is
broken, but Dretske says that there is no basis for saying that it
does not work because to say that it does not work implies that it was
designed to do something it cannot do and it was not designed to do
anything. If we should reform our intuitions in the one case, perhaps
we should also reform them in the case of Swampman's intentionality,
he says.</p>

<p>

We might grant Dretske his claim about Twin-Tercel and yet resist
the move from functions to intentionality. The problem for theories of
content, as opposed to theories of function, is exacerbated by the
relation between intentionality and consciousness. Many philosophers
find it plausible that an individual's phenomenal consciousness at a
time supervenes on just the inner physical properties of that
individual at that time. If this narrow supervenience thesis is true,
then Swampman will have phenomenal consciousness when he comes into
existence, assuming Davidson did at <em>t</em>. However, it is hard to
see how we can attribute phenomenal consciousness to Swampman without
also attributing some intentional states to him. Suppose, for example,
that Swampman has a red-sensation. Then presumably it will seem to him that
he is seeing something red. But it seeming to him that he is seeing
something red is presumably an intentional state.</p>

<p>

Here we connect with another important issue that lies outside of
the scope of this entry. However, a couple of points can be made.
First, some proponents of teleological theories of content are not
troubled by this line of argument because they reject the view that
consciousness supervenes on narrow states and hold theories of
phenomenal consciousness that deny consciousness to Swampman. According
to some, phenomenal consciousness supervenes on (non-narrow) content,
so if Swampman lacks content he must also lack phenomenal
consciousness on this view (see esp. Dretske 1995). </p>

<p>If, though, any proponents of teleosemantics accept the narrow
supervenience thesis for phenomenal consciousness, they cannot deny
that Swampman would have phenomenal consciousness. In that case, the
objection remains in force.  Then there appear to be just two
options. One is to maintain that Swampman can have a red sensation
without it seeming to him that he sees something red. The other is to
maintain that, although it seems to Swampman that he sees something
red, this seeming is not truth-evaluable in the usual sense. This last
option fits with the traditional idea that seemings have a special
epistemic status; it fits with the idea that we cannot be mistaken
about how things seem to us and that, in that context,
misrepresentation is not possible.  It does not, however, fit with the
idea that a person is, in principle, always fallible with respect even
to how things seem.</p>

<p>

The second broad strategy is to argue that Swampman intuitions cannnot
show that teleological theories are incorrect because they are
irrelevant. They are, it can be argued, not to the point if a
teleological theory is offered as a real-nature theory (Millikan
(1996), Neander (1996)).  The analogy with an <em>a posteriori</em>
analysis of the nature of water is thought to be helpful here. Recall
that XYZ is an imaginary liquid that is superficially
indistinguishable from water (H<sub>2</sub>O), although it has a
different molecular constitution (dubbed “XYZ”). We can,
it is argued, agree that “water” and WATER can refer to
H<sub>2</sub>O exclusively, even if all of the members of the relevant
community would classify XYZ as water were they to find some, given
their ignorance of water's chemical composition. Following Kripke and
Putnam, many have been persuaded that “water” and WATER
might have referred to H<sub>2</sub>O exclusively, even before it was
known that water is H<sub>2</sub>O, because there was deference to an
unknown nature that explained the superficial properties by means of
which we usually recognise instances of the liquid. On this view, it
was (in 1700) an epistemological possibility that water was not
H<sub>2</sub>O, but it was not a metaphysical possibility, given that
water <em>is</em> in fact H<sub>2</sub>O. Along similar lines, it can
be argued that it is only an epistemological and not a genuine
metaphysical possibility that Swampman might have intentionality.</p>

<p>

Note that this last claim is not the claim that it is merely an
epistemological possibility that Swampman might exist. Rather, the
crucial claim is that, even if he did exist, it would remain a mere
epistemological possibility that he would have genuine intentionality.
This parallels the claim regarding water and XYZ. Even if XYZ were to
exist on Twin-Earth and Twin-Earth were in our universe, it would not
be water. Superficial appearances would be on the side of Swampman's
having intentionality, just as they would be on the side of XYZ's
being water, but it may turn out that Swampman's
“intentionality” is not intentionality, just as it would
turn out that XYZ is not water (it is just twin-water). Intuitions
about Swampman, it is claimed, cannot decide the issue of what the
correct analysis of intentionality is. Rather, the decision about
Swampman's intentionality should be driven by the theory of content
that best accounts for the real kind.  That in turn should be driven
by other considerations, such as which theory delivers correct content
ascriptions for us and other existing creatures.  </p>

<p>

Of course, in the case of intentionality, unlike the case of water,
the hidden nature or essence cannot be an inner structure, if a
teleological theory is correct. On such a theory, intentionality is
alleged to be an historical kind, so the previously hidden nature is
alleged to be a matter of history. As proponents of teleological
theories point out, there is an apparent need for other historical
kinds in biology (e.g., offspring, homologs and species).
(Braddon-Mitchell and Jackson (1997) have argued that this “real
nature” response is not available to proponents of teleological
theories of content.  See Papineau 2001 for a response.)</p>

<p>

The Methodological Individualism debate is also relevant here, since
it questions whether science <em>should</em> have any historical kinds.
If those who favor methodological invidualism are correct, teleological
theories of content do not provide us with a good scientific way to
individuate psychological states (Fodor 1991). One
argument for methodological individualism involves the claim that
science should individuate kinds on the basis of causal powers. In
brief, the idea is that, since science is in the business of causal
explanations and causal powers are what are relevant for causal
explanations, science should classify items on the basis of
similarities and differences in causal powers. Since there are no
differences in causal powers between Davidson's kidney or beliefs at
<em>t</em> and Swampman's kidney-analog and belief-analogs when he
first pops into existence, Davidson's kidney and Swampman's
kidney-analog should belong to all of the same scientific kind and
Davidson's beliefs and Swampman's belief-analogs should belong to all
of the same scientific kinds. (For discussion of this issue, see Heil
&amp; Mele eds. 1993.)</p>

<p>

One problem with methodological individualism is that it is radically
revisionary, for biology at least. Moreover, if we classify kidneys on
the basis of actual causal powers, we include Swampman's kidney-analog
at the cost of excluding many real kidneys, such as the kidneys of
people on dialysis. While the arguments given in favor of
methodological individualism may seem plausible, they are not usually
accompanied by any attempt to understand the role that historical
classifications play in biology or elsewhere. That being the case, we
have reason to worry that the understanding of scientific
classification that supports methodological individualism is too
simple. Further, it must be kept in mind that the proponents of
teleological theories claim that a historical theory of content is
needed to capture psycho-semantic norms. Perhaps this is wrong. But if
it is right, and if cognitive science needs such a normative notion,
then methodological individualism must be wrong. Thus the debate must
turn on the more specific issues of whether normative content involves
history and whether cognitive science needs normative content.</p>

<h3><a name="4.3">4.3 Sophisticated Concepts and Capacities</a></h3>

<p>

The weightiest objection to teleological theories of content and
the hardest to assess is that it is unclear how such theories could
explain our most sophisticated concepts and cognitive capacities. </p>

<p>
No naturalistic theory of content at this time yet makes perfectly
clear how we think about democracy, virtue, quarks or perhaps even
tomorrow, and so this is not a problem that is peculiar to
teleo-functional theories.  However, it is sometimes argued that
teleological theories of content have a special problem in this
respect (e.g., Peacocke (1992)). The thought is that they may have
some hope of working for contents that concern things that impact on
fitness — <em>food</em>, <em>shelter</em>,
<em>mates</em>, etc. — but that they are, in principle, unable
to deal with contents that cannot have impacted on fitness, or not in
any suitably selective way. Some contents cannot have impacted on
fitness because they belong to the future or are non-existent. Others
cannot affect fitness in any suitably selective way because, although
they have an impact, their impact is too non-specific: for example,
quarks have an impact but because they are omnipresent in our
environment they cannot qualify as the content of a representation by
virtue of some simple selectional story.</p>

<p>

This objection is hard to assess for a number of reasons. One is that
there are many different kinds of sophisticated concepts and
capacities and accounting for them all is a large task. Another is
that, while the objection is posed as an objection to all
teleosemantic theories, different versions will address it in
different ways. Yet another is that we might allow that it is still
early days with respect to the development of teleological (and other)
naturalistic theories of mental content. It has really only been since
the advent of cognitive science in the middle of the last century and
the general acceptance of a broadly physicalist perspective on the
mind in the decades that followed that philosophers of mind have
devoted much effort to trying to give a naturalistic theory of mental
content.  </p>

<p>
In view of all of this, the present section can do little more than
offer a few remarks about how some versions of teleosemantics make
some inroads on the issue. Most of the points that follow have been
touched on in earlier sections.</p>

<p>
It should be emphasized that those who favor teleosemantic theories
rarely restrict the relevant functions to those that derive from
natural selection operating over an evolutionary span of time.  As
remarked earlier, there might be non-intentional selection processes
that operate over the span of a culture or over the span of an
individual's own development or life.  Meme selection, conditioning or
some other forms of learning and neural selection are considered to be
relevant kinds of selection by some proponents of
teleosemantics.  </p>

<p>Those who favor modest teleo-functional theories would also
emphasize that conceptual atomism is highly controversial.  Conceptual
atomism is the view that every concept of roughly the grain of a
lexeme of a natural language derives its content, constitutively
speaking, independently of every other such concept's content. Many
psychologists and some philosophers believe that some complex concepts
are somehow composed out of or are anyway learned through the use of
simpler concepts.  Crucially, to deny that conceptual atomism is true
does not commit one to the view that complex concepts are simply
defined in terms of simpler concepts (a fuller discussion of concepts
and whether conceptions can play any role in determining reference is
outside of the scope of this entry).  </p>

<p>

Millikan would in this context ask us to take note of her notions of
derived and adapted proper functions. What Millikan refers to as a
“direct proper function” belongs to a mechanism for which
there has been selection. The mechanisms that produce camouflage
patterns on the surface of the octopus have the direct proper function
to do so.  The patterns that the mechanisms produce by means of which
they perform this function possess what Millikan calls a
“derived proper function,” derived from the function of
the mechanism to provide camouflage.  Further, a pattern produced on a
particular occasion has an “adapted derived proper
function,” which is a relational function, in this case to
provide camouflage in that particular setting in which the octopus is
situated. Millikan makes use of these extended senses in which items
may have functions to try to explain the contents of novel
representations and representations that are produced as a result of
learning. Learning mechanisms have certain functions and when they
perform their functions in particular circumstances their products can
have adapted derived proper functions in relation to those
circumstances, whether or not the circumstances obtained during the
history of our species.</p>

<p>
Millikan (2000) gives an extensive treatment of concepts. In brief,
her view is that conceptions play no role in determining the
extensions of the concepts with which they are associated. Millikan's
theory presupposes innate learning mechanisms that are tuned to
identify substances of different sorts in accord with certain
principles. The relevant sort of substance is that which accounts for
the past selective success of the learning mechanisms. For instance,
some mental mechanisms might have been selected for recognizing faces
of individuals in accord with certain principles of operation, and
others might have been selected for recognizing animals of different
species in accord with other principles of operation. These mechanisms
can acquire the “purpose” to recognize something more
specific, such as a particular individual's face or animals of a
particular species, because the mechanisms were selected for
recognizing things in that domain (faces or animals) in accord with
certain principles of operation and, in accord with those principles,
it is a particular individual's face or animals of a particular
species that it now has the “purpose” to recognize. The
extension of a substance concept, she tells us, is what substance it
was selected to recognize.  </p>

<p>

Large issues relevant to assessing the different teleological theories
of content remain to be settled. On a hopeful note, much good work has
been done in exploring the possible range of such theories, in
producing interesting in-principle objections and in responding to
such objections in ways that have resulted in better developed or
better defended versions.  We should also keep in mind that serious
work on naturalistic theories of content has only been going on for
decades rather than centuries and that, on a philosophical timescale,
that is quite a short time.</p>
