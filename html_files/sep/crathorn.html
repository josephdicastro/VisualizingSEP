<div id="preamble">

<p>

William Crathorn (fl. 1330s), like Adam Wodeham (d. 1358) and Robert
Holkot (c. 1290–1349), belonged to the first generation of Oxford
philosophers after William of Ockham (c. 1285–1347), who sought to
criticize and develop Ockham's philosophy. Crathorn is remembered for
his theories of language and cognition, and for some anti-skeptical
arguments strikingly similar to those found in Descartes'
<em>Meditations</em>. The radical ontology of his works is also
noteworthy, thought it has not yet been closely studied.</p>

<h2><a name="1">1. Life and Work</a></h2>

<p>

Very little is known about Crathorn's life. He might have been born
in the village of Crathorne in north Yorkshire. He became a Dominican
friar before going to Oxford, where he lectured on the first book of
Peter the Lombard's <em>Sentences</em> in the years 1330–32, a work we
can date because of a passage in which Crathorn mentions an eclipse
that we know occurred on July 16, 1330. His Dominican contemporary,
Robert Holkot, also tells us that that he lectured at the same time
(1331–33) as a Dominican named Crathorn (Courtenay 1978; Schepers 1970
and 1972)</p>

<p>

William Crathorn also lectured on the Bible, and Holkot is
presumably responding to Crathorn's arguments in his <em>Sex
articuli</em>. A manuscript in Vienna contains what could be Crathorn's
forty-two quodlibetal questions (Richter 1972), but most of these
questions are similar to the ones contained in his <em>Questions on
the Sentences</em> (<em>Quaestiones super librum
sententiarum</em>).</p>

<h2><a name="2">2. Relation to Other Scholars</a></h2>

<p>

Crathorn's <em>Sentences</em> commentary is of great philosophical and
historical interest for the study of the first generation of Oxford
thinkers after Ockham because he develops his own provocative
positions by discussing the major issues of his day and criticizing
the views of his contemporaries (Courtenay 1978, Gelber 2004). His
favorite target was Ockham, but he also argued against the views of
Thomas Aquinas (Krauss 1933), John Duns Scotus, Richard Fitzralph, and
Robert Holkot (Schepers 1970, 1972).</p>

<p>

Although Crathorn criticized Ockham, he remained a nominalist (he
admits only individuals in his ontology and subscribes to the same
kind of theory of predication as Ockham). Above all, he worked out
some of the consequences of Ockham's views in epistemology, the
philosophy of language, and ontology, to show what problems they
created. We do not know whether he knew Ockham personally, or only
indirectly, through his younger disciple, Adam Wodeham. Indeed,
Wodeham frequently refers to a Dominican <em>socius</em>, who could
have been Crathorn himself or a certain John Grafton, another Oxford
Dominican of this time.</p>

<h2><a name="3">3. Epistemology</a></h2>

<p>

The problem of knowledge is at the very heart of Crathorn's thought.
Going back to Roger Bacon, he held that the only way the human mind is
able to know the external world is through <em>species</em> that
resemble it (I <em>Sent.</em> q. 1, concl. 4). Bacon's theory of the
multiplication of species (<em>multiplicatio specierum</em>) was
developed to explain causality using the model of optics. A thing
<em>c</em> has an effect on another thing <em>e</em> through the
multiplication of species <em>s</em> from <em>c</em> towards
<em>e</em>, just as light is multiplied through the air when it
illuminates an object. According to Bacon, the species <em>s</em> is a
representative of
<em>c</em> but with a lesser mode of being. Thus, the species is
multiplied through the medium of air again and again until it arrives
at <em>e</em>. The causal power of <em>c</em> is in this way conserved
through the medium until it acts on <em>e</em>. The species is
therefore both the cause (i.e., the same thing as the cause but with a
diminished mode of being) and a likeness of that cause. Applying
Bacon's theory to epistemology, Crathorn asserts that we have no
direct access to things in the external world and that we immediately
perceive only their mental likenesses or representations, i.e., their
species.  These mental entities, whether we call them
‘species“ or ‘concepts” (the terms are
equivalent for Crathorn), have the same nature as the things they
resemble (<em>ibid.</em>  concl. 8). Contrary to Bacon, the Dominican
considers that the species has the same mode of being — i.e., material
being — outside and inside the mind. As a consequence, all the species
we have in the mind belong to the category of quality, for no real
substance or quantity can exist materially in the human soul. Since
concepts can only belong to the category of quality according to
Crathorn, they must be mental qualities having the same nature as
non-mental qualities and they must exist subjectively in the mind,
which is to say that they exist in some part of the brain (Pasnau
1997). Crathorn writes, “the word ‘cognition’
(<em>cognitio</em>) stands for the idea (<em>verbum</em>) of the thing
known, and that idea is the quality existing subjectively
(<em>subiective existens</em>) in the mind or in some part of the
brain” (I <em>Sent.</em> q. 1, concl. 1). Therefore, cognition is
nothing but the species itself or the part of the soul where it is
received and stored. From an ontological point of view, nothing
distinguishes sensible cognition, imagination and intellection except
the distinct part of the soul where the species is received. There is
no difference between sensible and intelligible species.</p>
<p>Crathorn goes on to describe
the different parts of the brain and their functions. As the canonical
medieval topology of the brain suggests, there are three main lobes
(<em>cellulae</em>) connected by nerves through which the information
conveyed by the species can be transferred from one lobe to another.
The first lobe corresponds to sensitive imagination (<em>cellula
fantastica</em>), the second to conceptualization and discourse
(<em>cellula syllogistica</em>) and the third to memory (<em>cellula
memoriale</em>) (I <em>Sent.</em> q. 2, concl. 4).</p>

<p>Crathorn thus had to emend Ockham's theory of evident knowledge,
because intuitive cognition is no more the guarantee of any certitude
regarding the existence of extramental things. In addition, the
cognition of the terms of a proposition — even a <em>per se nota</em>
proposition — is not sufficient, according to Crathorn, to ensure the
causal mechanism that leads to evidence and certitude. Indeed, as we
shall see below, Crathorn refuses to treat the species or cognitions
as linguistic elements of thought. All languages are conventional by
nature. Therefore, it is possible to cognize some terms the
signification of which remains unknown to the cognizing subject. As a
result, although empirical knowledge of the things signified by the
terms is usually needed, it is necessary to argue beyond simple and
intuitive cognitions, via syllogisms and demonstrations, to
consolidate one's certitude that not only representations
exist. Crathorn thus suggests that we substitute for the Ockhamist
definition of evident cognition his own definition: evident cognition
is a manifest, clear, and not obscure cognition (q. 1,
p. 69–70: <em>notitia evidens est notitia manifesta, clara et non
obscura</em>), be it simple or complex, intuitive or abstractive.</p>

<p>Incredibly, Crathorn affirms that whenever one is thinking of a
white thing, the mind of that person actually becomes white. His
notion of similarity is strict and uncompromising.  Mental concepts
cannot resemble substances but only qualities of substances
(I <em>Sent</em>., q. 1, concl. 7) because the species of substance
would have to be a substance itself and our minds would turn into a
new substance if we thought of it. It also cannot be a pure quantity
because in thinking of infinite magnitudes, our minds would become
infinite, and the same is true for the other categories besides
quality. According to Crathorn, our ability to conceptualize is
therefore limited to natural concepts of qualities, which in being
conceived become qualities of the soul.</p>  

<p>Crathorn had to face up to the skeptical consequences of this odd
epistemology. How can we know what is real if our only access to
reality is via representations of its qualitative features? His answer
to this question is quite radical: we cannot be naturally and directly
certain that reality exists as we conceive it since it is not possible
to distinguish qualities inside and outside the mind: as qualities,
they would have precisely the same nature (<em>ibid.</em>
concl. 10–13). The only solution to skeptical doubt here is the
principle, which he claims is known <em>per se</em>, that God does not
produce an effect supernaturally in order to lie or to lead people
into error (<em>ibid.</em> q. 1, concl. 14), a principle more famously
used in connection with Descartes' thought experiment of a <em>Dieu
trompeur</em> several centuries later.</p>  

<p>Crathorn endeavored elsewhere to gather at least a few certitudes,
since one could doubt whether the a priori principle that God would
never deceive us is itself certain. To rebut the skeptic, he turns
back to Augustine's version of the <em>cogito</em>-argument to prove
that we can at least be certain of our own mental activity, for if one
were to doubt a proposition such as ‘I am’, it would
follow that he exists, since he who does not exist does not
doubt. Hence, no one can be in doubt concerning the proposition,
‘I am’ (I <em>Sent</em>., q. 1, concl. 14; translated in
Tachau 1988, p. 273).</p>

<h2><a name="4">4. Philosophy of Language</a></h2>

<p>

One of the most important debates at Oxford around 1320–30 concerned
the proper object of scientific knowledge. When we know something
scientifically, is our knowledge about external things (the earth
interposed between the sun and the moon), propositions (‘The moon is
eclipsed’), or some other more complex state of affairs? Crathorn is
believed to have participated in the development of the idea that the
proper object of science is neither the external thing nor the
proposition (as Ockham and Holkot had argued), but the ‘total
significate’ of that proposition (Tachau 1987). Typically, the total
significate would include not only external things but also the
premises and other assumptions that generate our assent to the
proposition as the conclusion of a piece of demonstrative
reasoning.</p>

<p>

Another debate concerned the nature of mental language, specifically
whether it is conventional or natural (Gelber 1984; Panaccio 1996)
Ockham had argued that thinking occurs in a universally significative
language of concepts acquired causally via experience, and that all
conventional languages are subordinated to this mental language, which
is shared by everyone. But Crathorn could not accept such a position
because of his view that only qualities are natural signs of their
extra-mental significates. Indeed, languages also contain
substance-terms, verbs, and syncategoremata, i.e., logical particles
and connectives such as ‘or’, ‘but’,
‘all’, and ‘if’. Accordingly, Crathorn argues
that except for natural signs of qualities, no natural likeness in the
mind can explain the signification of these terms. Mental language is
therefore as conventional as spoken and written languages and is in
fact derived from conventional languages (I
<em>Sent</em>., q. 2; Cf. Panaccio 1996, Perler 1997, Robert
2009b and 2010b). Just as thought depends on the <em>species</em> or likenesses
of external things, mental words are likenesses of conventional words
and have exactly the same semantic force. Depending upon which
language(s) you learn to speak, your mental language will be a
likeness of Latin, English, French, etc. Crathorn was the only thinker
of his time to affirm that words are prior to ideas and that ideas are
shaped by words. Meaning is first given by a community of speakers;
mental language is simply the internalization of these spoken and
written languages. We always think in a conventional language or, more
precisely, in its mental reflection.</p>

<h2><a name="5">5. Ontology and Categories</a></h2>

<p>

In keeping with his views on knowledge and language, Crathorn
advocated radical changes to traditional Aristotelian ontology. These
are discussed in a sub-treatise on the categories in his <em>Commentary
on the Sentences</em> (I <em>Sent</em>. qq. 13–18).</p>

<p>

Ockham famously reduced the ten Aristotelian categories to two,
substance and quality, treating the other eight as modes of signifying
substances and qualities. For Crathorn, however, the entire
Aristotelian system has to be revised. The human mind naturally knows
nothing but qualities, and we cannot be certain that even they exist
without appealing to the principle that God could not deceive us.
Thinking and reasoning are of no help because, as we saw above, they
are purely conventional.</p>

<p>Instead, Crathorn treats the Aristotelian categories as
philosophical conventions. Following the chapters of Aristotle's
<em>Categories</em> step by step, he comes to the conclusion that none
of the ten categories are valid because the reasons Aristotle uses to
distinguish them are inadequate. For example, the category of
substance is distinguished from the other categories by the fact that
it has no contrary and can successively acquire contrary qualities
(Aristotle, <em>Categories</em> 5). But Crathorn claims that when we
heat a piece of wood or a man, not only the substance but also its
qualities become hot, such that its qualities change from one state to
their contrary exactly like a substance. Therefore, this crucial
distinction between substance and accidents does not apply. Crathorn
writes, “not only the substance of the wood can receive the
contraries, but also the accidents of the wood ... but if the wood is
hot, not only is the heat attached to the wood hot, but also all the
positive coextensive natures of the wood” (I
<em>Sent</em>., q. 13, concl. 13). He also affirms that “one and the
same thing numerically can truly be said to be substance and accident
in relation to different things” (<em>ibid</em>., concl. 5). Indeed,
water and fire can be considered as natural substances, but one is the
contrary of the other. As a general conclusion, Crathorn asserts that
the very same thing can be called a substance, a quality, a quantity,
a relation and so forth (q. 17, p. 462 and q. 18, p. 476). </p>

<p>

Crathorn develops his position mostly by attacking the views of other
philosophers who accepted such distinctions, but unfortunately he is
not always clear about his positive reasons for abandoning
Aristotelian ontology. But, on one hand it is consistent with his
epistemology, for our only direct and natural certitude is that
qualities exist. On the other hand, it is also consistent with his
frequent tendency to materialism. Indeed, we can discern hints of
atomism in his <em>Commentary on the Sentences</em>.</p>

<h2><a name="6">6. Atomism</a></h2>

<p>

Crathorn is less well known than other fourteenth-century atomists
such as the Oxford thinkers Henry of Harclay (d. 1317) and Walter
Chatton (c. 1285–1344), or the Parisians Gerard of Odo (1290–1349),
Nicolas Bonet (d. 1343), and Nicolas of Autrecourt (1299–1369)
(Murdoch 1974, 1982; Grellard and Robert 2009), yet we find several
questions on the divisibility of the continuum in
his <em>Sentences</em> commentary (particularly I
<em>Sent</em>., q. 3, but also qq. 4 and 14–16). He affirms that a
continuum is divisible into a finite number of atoms that are not
mathematical points but its real, physical parts (I <em>Sent</em>., q.
3; for discussion, see Wood 1988, Robert 2009a). Atoms are thus real singular
entities with discrete magnitude or quantity and a proper nature. For
example, he says that there are atoms of gold and atoms of lead, and
that these are different kinds of things (I <em>Sent</em>., q. 14).
Crathorn's atomism is far from that of Democritus.</p>

<p>

The most difficult problem for atomists arises from book VI of
Aristotle's <em>Physics</em>, where it becomes necessary to define the
contiguity of atoms. Since an atom by definition has no parts, how can
we say that they touch each other? If they are actually in contact,
they should be in one and the same place (if not, then there is no
continuity since continuity requires contiguity). Crathorn replies by
saying that this is a problem only for those who think of atoms as
mathematical points. But since he holds that atoms have a proper
magnitude and that they are defined by the fact that they occupy a
single location (<em>situs</em> or <em>locus</em>), a quantity that is
simply the place occupied by the quantified thing (I <em>Sent</em>.,
qq. 3 and 14–15), the contiguity and continuity of atoms can be
explained in terms of the contiguity of places. Atoms can form a
continuous magnitude if all of them are contiguous, i.e., if they all
occupy contiguous atomic places.</p>

<p>

The implications of Crathorn's atomism are truly astonishing. First,
every movement boils down to local motion of atoms in the void. Thus,
Crathorn affirms that a continuous motion has only one possible speed,
which is the greatest speed it could ever reach (Murdoch 1984). In
other words, movement is continuous when an atom changes from one
atomic place to another contiguous atomic place. The proportion of time
and place (i.e., the speed) is always equal to one. So how can he
explain the fact that things appear to move at different speeds? The
answer is quite simple: to every varying speed there corresponds a
discontinuous motion, with times of rest between some of the atomic
places occupied by the moving atoms (I <em>Sent</em>., q. 16, concl.
6). For example, the normal speed of an atom <em>a</em> corresponds to
its local motion from a place <em>p1</em> to another contiguous place
<em>p2</em> in a given atomic time. Variation of speed occurs if
<em>a</em> moves from <em>p1</em> to <em>p2</em> but with a time of
rest equivalent to two atoms of time. We may infer that speed can also
vary if <em>a</em> goes from <em>p1</em> to another place <em>p3</em>
that is not directly contiguous with <em>p1</em>.</p>

<p>Although Crathorn does not describe himself this way, he seems to
be one of the most radical atomists of the fourteenth century (Robert
2010a), sharing with his Parisian contemporary Nicholas of Autrecourt
much of the same anti-Aristotelian bent in his metaphysics and natural
philosophy.  Combined with his epistemology and philosophy of
language, his philosophy is certainly one of the most original forms
of reductionism in later medieval philosophy.</p>
