<h1>Feminist Epistemology and Philosophy of Science</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Wed Aug 9, 2000; substantive revision Wed Aug 5, 2015</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>

Feminist epistemology and philosophy of science studies the ways in
which gender does and ought to influence our conceptions of knowledge,
the knowing subject, and practices of inquiry and justification. It
identifies ways in which dominant conceptions and practices of
knowledge attribution, acquisition, and justification systematically
disadvantage women and other subordinated groups, and strives to
reform these conceptions and practices so that they serve the
interests of these groups. Various practitioners of feminist
epistemology and philosophy of science argue that dominant knowledge
practices disadvantage women by (1) excluding them from inquiry, (2)
denying them epistemic authority, (3) denigrating their
“feminine” cognitive styles and modes of knowledge, (4)
producing theories of women that represent them as inferior, deviant,
or significant only in the ways they serve male interests, (5)
producing theories of social phenomena that render women's activities
and interests, or gendered power relations, invisible, and (6)
producing knowledge (science and technology) that is not useful for
people in subordinate positions, or that reinforces gender and other
social hierarchies. Feminist epistemologists trace these failures to
flawed conceptions of knowledge, knowers, objectivity, and scientific
methodology. They offer diverse accounts of how to overcome these
failures. They also aim to (1) explain why the entry of women and
feminist scholars into different academic disciplines, especially in
biology and the social sciences, has generated new questions,
theories, and methods, (2) show how gender and feminist values and
perspectives have played a causal role in these transformations, (3)
promote theories that aid egalitarian and liberation movements, and
(4) defend these developments as cognitive, not just social, advances.
</p>

<p>

The central concept of feminist epistemology is that of a situated
knower, and hence of situated knowledge: knowledge that reflects the
particular perspectives of the subject. Feminist philosophers are
interested in how gender situates knowing subjects. They originally
articulated three main approaches to this question: feminist
standpoint theory, feminist postmodernism, and feminist
empiricism. Conceptions of how gender situates knowers also inform
feminist approaches to the central problems of the field: grounding
feminist criticisms of science and feminist science, defining the
proper roles of social and political values in inquiry, evaluating
ideals of objectivity and rationality, and reforming structures of
epistemic authority.</p>

<h2><a name="Sit">1. Situated Knowers</a></h2>

<p>

Feminist epistemology conceives of knowers as situated in particular
relations to what is known and to other knowers. What is known, and the
way that it is known, thereby reflects the situation or perspective of
the knower. Here we are concerned with <em>claims</em> to know,
temporarily bracketing the question of which claims are true or
warranted. </p>

<p>

<strong>Situated knowledge in general.</strong> Consider how people
may understand the same object in different ways that reflect the
distinct relations in which they stand to it.</p>

<p>

<em>Embodiment</em>. People experience the world by using their
bodies, which have different constitutions and are differently located
in space and time. In virtue of their different physical locations,
observers who stand in front of an object have different information
about it than observers who have a distant but bird's eye view of
it.</p>

<p>

<em>First-person vs. third-person knowledge</em>. People have
first-personal access to some of their own bodily and mental states,
yielding direct knowledge of phenomenological facts about what it is
like for them to be in these states. Third parties may know these
states only by interpreting external symptoms, imaginative projection,
or obtaining their testimony. People also have knowledge <em>de se</em>
about themselves, expressed in the form “<em>I</em> am F
<em>here, now</em>.” This is distinct in character and
inferential role from propositional knowledge having the same content,
which does not use indexicals.</p>

<p>

<em>Emotions, attitudes, interests, and values</em>. People often
represent objects in relation to their emotions, attitudes and
interests. A thief represents a lock as a frustrating obstacle while
its owner represents the lock as a comforting source of security.</p>

<p>

<em>Personal knowledge of others</em>. People have different
knowledge of others, in virtue of their different personal
relationships to them. Such knowledge is often tacit, incompletely
articulated, and intuitive. Like the knowledge it takes to get a joke,
it is more an interpretive skill in making sense of a person than a set
of propositions. (The German language usefully marks this as the
distinction between <em>Erkenntnis</em> and <em>Wissenschaft</em>.)
Because people behave differently toward others, and others interpret
their behavior differently, depending on their personal relationships,
what others know of them depends on these relationships.</p>

<p>

<em>Know-how</em>. People have different skills, which may also be a
source of different propositional knowledge. An expert dog handler
knows how to elicit more interesting behavior from an a dog than a
novice does. Such know-how expresses a more sophisticated understanding
of dogs on the part of the expert, and also generates new phenomena
about dogs for investigation.</p>

<p>

<em>Cognitive Styles</em>. People have different styles of
investigation and representation. What looks like one phenomenon to a
lumper may look like three to a splitter.</p>

<p>

<em>Background beliefs and worldviews</em>. People form different
beliefs about an object, in virtue of different background beliefs. In
virtue of the different background beliefs against which they
interpret a patient's symptoms, a patient may think he is having a
heart attack while his doctor believes he just has
heartburn. Differences in global metaphysical or political worldviews
(naturalism, theism, liberalism, marxism) may also generate different
beliefs about particulars on a more comprehensive scale.</p>

<p>

<em>Relations to other inquirers</em>. People may stand in different
epistemic relations to other inquirers—for example, as
informants, interlocutors, students—which affects their access
to relevant information and their ability to convey their beliefs to
others.</p>

<p>

These kinds of situatedness affect knowledge in several ways. They
influence knowers' access to information and the terms in which they
represent what they know. They bear on the form of their knowledge
(articulate/implicit, formal/informal, by acquaintance or description,
and so forth). They affect their attitudes toward their beliefs
(certainty/doubt, dogmatic/open to revision), their standards of
justification (relative weights they give to different epistemic values
such as predictive power and consilience, amount, sources, and kinds of
evidence they require before they accept a claim, etc.), and the
authority with which they lay claim to their beliefs and can offer them
to others. Finally, they affect knowers' assessment of which claims are
significant or important.</p>

<p>

<strong>Social situation.</strong> Feminist epistemology focuses on
how the <em>social location</em> of the knower affects what and how she knows.
It is thus a branch of social epistemology. An individual's
social locations consists of her ascribed social identities (gender,
race, sexual orientation, ethnicity, caste, kinship status, etc.) and
social roles and relationships (occupation, political party membership,
etc.). Partly in virtue of their different ascribed identities,
individuals occupy different social roles that accord them different
powers, duties, and role-given goals and interests. They are subject to
different norms that prescribe different virtues, habits, emotions, and
skills that are thought to be appropriate for these roles. They also
acquire different subjective identities. Subjective identification with
one's social groups can take several forms. One may simply know oneself
to have certain ascribed identities. One may accept or endorse these
identities, actively affirming the norms and roles associated with
them. Or one may regard one's social identities as oppressive (if, say,
one's identity is cast by society as evil, contemptible, or
disgusting), yet see one's fate as tied with the groups with which one
is identified, and commit oneself to collective action with other
members of those groups to overcome that oppression.</p>

<p>

<strong>Gender as a mode of social situation.</strong> Most feminist
theorists distinguish between sex and gender. Sex comprises the
biological differences between males and females. Gender is what
societies make of sexual differences: the different roles, norms, and
meanings they assign to men and women and the things associated with
them on account of their real or imagined sexual characteristics.
Gender thus has several dimensions (Haslanger 2000).</p>

<p>

<em>Gender roles</em>. Men and women are assigned to distinct social
roles. For example, most societies reserve political and military
offices mostly for men, and assign women most childrearing
responsibilities.</p>

<p>

<em>Gender norms</em>. Men and women are expected to comply with
different norms of behavior and bodily comportment. For example, men
are expected to be assertive and athletic; women, deferential and
modest. Gender norms are tailored to gender roles: men and women are
expected to conform to those norms that make them fit for their gender
roles (whether or not they actually occupy those roles).</p>

<p>

<em>Gendered traits and virtues</em>. Psychological traits are
considered “masculine” and “feminine” if they
dispose their bearers to comply with the gender norms assigned to men
and women, respectively. “Masculine” traits are therefore
regarded as virtues in men and (often) vices in women, while
“feminine” traits are regarded as vices in men and virtues
in women.</p>

<p>

<em>Gendered performance/behavior</em>. Many feminist theorists, often
influenced by postmodernism, stress the contextual and performative
aspects of gender (West &amp; Zimmerman 1987; Butler 1990). Rather
than viewing masculinity and femininity as fixed traits, these
theorists represent human beings as more flexible and disposed to
enact both “masculine” and “feminine”
behaviors in different contexts. The man who avoids tenderly
comforting a crying baby in the presence of women may do so when
alone.  Masculinity and femininity can be seen as contrasting styles
of performance in almost any role. Female body builders strive to show
off their muscles in a “feminine” way.</p>

<p>

<em>Gender identity</em>. A person's ascribed gender
identity—how others identify him or her—may not match his
or her subjective gender identity. Subjective gender identity includes
all of the ways one might understand oneself to be a man, a woman,
both, or neither. One could identify with any subset of gender norms,
roles, and traits ascribed to the gender of which one sees oneself as
a member, while repudiating others. One could even repudiate them all,
but still identify oneself as a man or a woman in terms of what one
sees as distinct roles men and women ought to play in bringing about a
just future (one that may or may not include gender distinctions). One
could, as many feminists do, understand one's gender identity as a
predicament shared by all with the same ascribed identity, and thus as
a basis for collective action to change the very basis of one's gender
identity. One could embrace an “androgenous” identity,
decline to view oneself in gender polarized terms at all, or play with
gender identities in a postmodernist spirit.</p>

<p>

<em>Gender symbolism</em>. Animals and inanimate objects may be
placed in a gendered field of representation through conventional
association, imaginative projection, and metaphorical thinking. Thus,
the garage is regarded as “male” space, the kitchen,
“female”; male deer are said to have “harems”;
pears are seen as “womanly”, assault rifles as
“manly.”</p>

<p>

<strong>Gendered knowledge.</strong> By bringing together the
general account of situated knowledge with the account of gender as a
kind of social situation, we can generate a catalog of ways in
which what people know, or think they know, can be influenced by their
own gender (roles, norms, traits, performance, identities), other
people's genders, or by ideas about gender (symbolism). Each mode of
gendered knowledge raises new questions for epistemology.</p>

<p>

<em>The phenomenology of gendered bodies</em>. People's bodies are
both differently sexed and differently gendered. Early child
socialization trains boys' and girls' bodies to different norms of
bodily comportment. In the U.S., these norms stress physical freedom,
aggressive play, large motor skills, informal and relaxed posture, and
indifference to clothing and neatness in boys; physical
constraint, subdued play, small motor skills, formal and modest
posture, and self-consciousness about clothing and neatness
for girls. Once internalized, such norms profoundly affect the
phenomenology of embodiment. They inform men's and women's distinct
first-personal knowledge of what it is like to inhabit a body, to
express capacities unique to one sex or another (e.g., breast feeding),
and to have experiences that are manifested through different body
parts in differently sexed bodies (e.g., orgasm). They also cause men's
and women's experiences of gendered behaviors that both can perform to
differ—in comfort, fluidity, feelings of
“naturalness” or novelty, self-consciousness, confidence,
awkwardness, shame, and so forth. One question these facts raise for
feminist epistemology is to what extent dominant models of the world,
especially of the relation between minds and bodies, have seemed
compelling because they conform to a male or masculine phenomenology
(Bordo 1987; Young 1990).</p>

<p>

<em>Gendered first-personal knowledge</em> de se. It is one thing to
know what sexual harassment is, and how to identify it in a case
described in third-personal terms. It is another to come to the
recognition “<em>I</em> have been sexually harassed.” Many
women who are able to see that women in general are disadvantaged have
difficulty recognizing themselves as sharing women's predicament
(Clayton &amp; Crosby 1992). The problems of <em>de se</em> knowledge
are particularly pressing for feminist theory, because it is committed
to theorizing in ways that women can use to improve their lives. This
entails that women be able to recognize themselves and their lives in
feminist accounts of women's predicament. Feminist epistemology is
therefore particularly concerned with investigating the conditions of
feminist self-understanding and the social settings in which it may
arise—feminist consciousness-raising sessions, women's studies
classes, and so forth (MacKinnon 1989).</p>

<p>

<em>Gendered emotions, attitudes, interests, and values</em>.
Feminist theory defines a representation as <em>androcentric</em> if
it depicts the world in relation to male or masculine interests,
emotions, attitudes or values. A “male” interest is an
interest a man has, in virtue of the goals given to him by social
roles designated as especially appropriate for men to occupy, or in
virtue of his subjective gender identity. A “masculine”
interest is an interest a man has in virtue of attitudes that are
thought specifically appropriate to men. Such attitudes and interests
structure the cognition of those who have them.  For example, a
representational scheme that classifies women as either
“babes,” “dogs,” “whores,” or
(grand)mothers reflects the androcentric attitudes, interests, and
values of single heterosexual adolescent men who view women in terms
of their fantasized eligibility for sexual intercourse with them. A
representation is <em>gynocentric</em> if it depicts the world in
relation to female or feminine interests, emotions, attitudes or
values. When a man is described as an “eligible bachelor,”
this reflects the gynocentric perspective of a heterosexual, single
woman interested in marriage. An interest, emotion, attitude, or value
might be symbolically gendered even if men and women do not manifest
it differently. For example, the ethics of care represents moral
problems in terms of symbolically feminine values—values
culturally associated with women's gender roles (Gilligan 1982). It
thus can qualify as a symbolically gynocentric perspective, even if
men and women do not differ in their propensity to represent moral
problems in its terms, and to act accordingly. Feminist epistemology
raises numerous questions about these phenomena. Can situated
emotional responses to things be a valid source of knowledge about
them (Diamond 1991, Jaggar 1989, Keller 1983, Pitts-Taylor 2013)? Do
dominant practices and conceptions of science and scientific method
reflect an androcentric perspective, or a perspective that reflects
other dominant positions, as of race and colonial rule (Merchant 1980;
Harding 1986, 1991, 1993, 1998, 2006, 2008; Schiebinger 2007)? Do
mainstream philosophical conceptions of objectivity, knowledge, and
reason reflect an androcentric perspective (Bordo 1987; Code 1991;
Flax 1983; Rooney 1991)? How would the conceptual frameworks of
particular sciences change if they reflected the interests of females
(Anderson 1995b, Rolin 2009, Wajcman 2004, Waring 1990)?</p>

<p>

<em>Knowledge of others in gendered relationships</em>. Gender norms
differentially structure the social spaces to which men and women are
admitted, as well as the presentation of self to others. Men manifest their male
identity, and women their female identity, differently alone than in
mixed company, and differently in these settings than in
gender-segregated contexts. Male and female inquirers therefore have
access to different information about others. Male and female
ethnographers may be admitted to different social spaces. Even when
admitted to the same social spaces, their presence has different
effects on those being observed. Research that elicits information
about others through personal contact between the researchers and the
research subjects therefore raises the question of how findings might
be influenced by the gendered relations between researchers and
subjects, and whether gender-inclusive research teams are in a better
position to detect this. Ethnography, which derives propositional
knowledge of others from personal knowledge of native informants in
long-term, often intimate relationships, raises these issues most
acutely (Bell et al 1993; Leacock 1981). Similar issues arise in
survey research, clinical research, and human experimentation (Sherif
1987).</p>

<p>

<em>Gendered skills</em>. Some skills are labeled masculine or
feminine because men and women need them specifically to perform their
respective gender roles, and they are not generically useful for
almost any role (as walking, talking, and seeing are). It takes a
particular knowledge of small children to know how to comfort them, a
particular knowledge of soldiers to know how to whip up their
morale. Although men and women alike may acquire these skills, they
are considered the peculiar responsibility of one or the other
gender. Men and women may therefore have differential access to such
skill-based knowledge. To the extent that the skill is perceived by
the agent as the proper province of the “other” gender, he
or she may have a difficult time seeing himself or herself perform it
confidently and fluidly. This inability to self-identify with the task
can impair performance. The feedback effects of the phenomenology of
gendered embodiment and <em>de se</em> knowledge of one's subjective
gender identity can therefore influence the exercise of gendered
skills. To the extent that a skill is perceived by others as the
proper province of one gender, others may grant or withhold
acknowledgment of an agent's expertise. If the successful exercise of
the skill requires that others be willing to accept it as a competent
performance, others' gender-based readiness or refusal to grant
expertise to an agent in exercising that skill can be a
self-fulfilling prophecy. These phenomena raise various questions for
epistemology. Does the “masculine” symbolism of certain
scientific skills, such as of assuming an “objective”
stance toward nature, interfere with the integration of women into
science? Do actually or symbolically “feminine” skills aid
the acquisition of scientific knowledge (Keller 1983, 1985a; Rose
1987; Ruetsche 2004; Smith 1974)?</p>

<p>

<em>Gendered cognitive styles</em>. Some theorists believe that men
and women have different cognitive styles (Belenky et al 1986;
Gilligan 1982). Whether or not this is true, cognitive styles are
gender symbolized (Rooney 1991). Deductive, analytic, atomistic,
acontextual, and quantitative cognitive styles are labeled
“masculine,” while intuitive, synthetic, holistic,
contextual and qualitative cognitive styles are labeled
“feminine.” For example, it is seen as masculine to make
one's point by means of argument, feminine to make one's point by
means of narrative.  Argument is commonly cast as an adversarial mode
of discourse, in which one side claims vindication by vanquishing the
opposition. Such pursuit of dominance follows the competitive pattern
of male gender roles in combat, athletics, and business. Narrative is
a seductive mode of discourse, persuading by an enticing invitation to
take up the perspective of the narrator, which excites one's
imagination and feeling. Its operations are more like love than war,
and thereby follows a mode of persuasion thought more suitable for
women. These phenomena raise numerous epistemological questions: does
the quest for “masculine” prestige by using
“masculine” methods distort practices of knowledge
acquisition (Addelson 1983; Moulton, 1983)? Are some kinds of sound
research unfairly ignored because of their association with
“feminine” cognitive styles (Keller 1983, 1985b)? Do
“feminine” cognitive styles yield knowledge that is
inaccessible or harder to achieve by “masculine” means
(Duran 1991, Rose 1987, Smith 1974)?</p>

<p>

<em>Gendered background beliefs and worldviews</em>. We have seen
above how men and women have access to different phenomenological
knowledge, <em>de se</em> knowledge, know-how, and personal knowledge
of others, in virtue of their gender. They also tend to represent the
world in different terms, in virtue of their gendered interests,
attitudes, emotions and values, and perhaps also (although this is a
matter of controversy among feminist theorists) in virtue of different
cognitive styles. These differences create different background
beliefs, against which additional information may be
processed. Representational schemes that are functional for different
gender roles and gendered attitudes make different kinds of
information salient. In traditional domestic settings, women tend to
notice dirt that men don't, because their gender role assigns them the
task of cleaning up. Besides making different kinds of information
salient to men and women, their different background knowledge may
lead them to interpret commonly accessed information differently. A
man might read a woman's demure smile as a coy come-on, where another
woman may interpret it as her polite and defensive reaction to
unwanted attention from him. Such differences can spring from
differential access to phenomenological knowledge. The male and female
observers imaginatively project themselves into her situation,
inferring her feelings from the feelings they think underlie her body
language. Because men's and women's phenomenologies of embodiment are
different—most men are not in the habit of smiling as a defense
against unwanted attention from women—the man may
narcissistically imagine the smile as relaxed and spontaneous, whereas
the woman may suspect it is forced. Here are a few epistemological
questions raised by these phenomena. Are there epistemic obstacles to
men's ability to know when they are raping or sexually harassing
women, or to legal institutions recognizing this, insofar as they
confine their thinking within a “masculine” perspective
(MacKinnon 1989)? Do sexist or androcentric background beliefs of
scientists cause them to generate sexist theories about women, despite
their adherence to ostensibly objective scientific methods (Harding
1986; Harding &amp; O'Barr, 1987; Hubbard 1990)? How might the social
practices of science be organized so that variations in background
beliefs of inquirers function as a resource rather than an obstacle to
scientific success (Longino 1990; Solomon 2001)?</p>

<p>

<em>Relations to other inquirers</em>. Gender differences in
knowledge and background beliefs can be reduced if men and women
participate in inquiry together. Each gender can take on testimony what
the other can acquire through direct experience. Each may also learn
how to exercise imaginative projection more effectively, and to take up
the perspective of the other gender. However, gender norms influence
the terms on which men and women communicate (Kalbfleisch 1995). In
many contexts, women are not allowed to speak or even show up, or their
questions, comments, and challenges are ignored, interrupted, and
systematically distorted, or they aren't accepted as experts. Gendered
norms of conversational interaction and epistemic authority thus
influence the ability of knowledge practices to incorporate the
knowledge and experience of men and women into their processes of
discovery and justification. Feminist epistemologists are therefore
interested in exploring how gender norms distort the dissemination of
testimony and relations of cognitive authority among inquirers
(Addelson 1983; Code 1991; Fricker 2007) and how the social relations of inquirers
could be reformed, especially with regard to the allocation of
epistemic authority, so as to enable more successful practices of
inquiry (Jones 2002; Longino 1990; Nelson 1990, 1993).</p>

<p>

<strong>Problems of and Approaches to Gendered Situated
Knowledge.</strong> Mainstream epistemology takes as paradigms of
knowledge simple propositional knowledge about matters in principle
equally accessible to anyone with basic cognitive and sensory
apparatus: “2 + 2=4”; “grass is green”;
“water quenches thirst.” Feminist epistemology does not
claim that such knowledge is gendered. Examination of such examples
is not particularly helpful for answering the epistemological problems
that arise specifically in feminist theory and practice. What is it to
know that I am a woman? What is it like to be sexually objectified? Why
is it that men and women so often have dramatically divergent
understandings of what happened in their sexual encounters? How can we
arrange scientific practices so that science and technology serve
women's interests? These kinds of questions make other kinds of
knowledge salient for feminist epistemology: phenomenological
knowledge, <em>de se</em> knowledge, knowledge of persons, know-how,
moral knowledge, knowledge informed by emotions, attitudes, and
interests. These kinds of knowledge are often gendered, and they can
influence the propositional claims people are disposed to form and
accept. This has critical implications for mainstream epistemological
conceptions of knowledge, insofar as the latter are based on false
generalizations drawing only from examples of ungendered knowledge.</p>

<p> Feminist epistemologists stress the situatedness or
perspective-relativity of much knowledge. They do not thereby embrace
epistemological relativism. To regard some knowledge claim or form of
understanding as situated in a perspective is not to claim that the
perspective yields true beliefs or satisfactory understandings (not
even “for” those taking up the perspective). It is not to
claim that perspectives can only be judged in their own terms.  What
attention to situated knowledge does do is enable questions to be
raised and addressed that are difficult to frame in epistemologies
that assume that gender, and the social situation of the knower more
generally, is irrelevant to knowledge. How are the knowledge claims
generated by gendered perspectives related to one another? Are certain
perspectives epistemically privileged? Is there any way to construct a
more objective perspective out of differently gendered perspectives?
What would be the point of achieving such a perspective? Feminist
epistemology does not rule out the possibility or desirability of
objective knowledge. It does raise new questions about
objectivity.</p>

<p>

Feminist epistemologists have developed their approaches to the
situatedness of knowledge within three broad epistemological
traditions: standpoint theory, postmodernism, and empiricism.
Standpoint theory identifies a particular social perspective as
epistemically privileged. Postmodernism rejects claims of epistemic
privilege, emphasizing instead the contingency and instability of the
social identity of knowers, and consequently of their representations.
Empiricism seeks standards, within a naturalized framework, for
differentiating the circumstances in which situatedness generates
error and in which it constitutes a resource that can be harnessed to
advance knowledge. It advances a conception of objectivity constituted
by critical and cooperative relations among a plurality of differently
situated inquirers.  The next three sections explain how these three
traditions were originally articulated, reserving to <a href="#trends">section 9</a> a discussion of recent interactions and
convergence among them.</p>

<h2><a name="standpoint">2. Feminist Standpoint Theory</a></h2>

<p>

<strong>Standpoint Epistemology in General.</strong> Standpoint
theories claim to represent the world from a particular socially
situated perspective that can lay a claim to epistemic privilege or
authority. A complete standpoint theory must specify (i) the <em>social
location</em> of the privileged perspective, (ii) the <em>scope</em> of
its privilege: what questions or subject matters it can claim a
privilege over, (iii) the <em>aspect</em> of the social location that
generates superior knowledge: for example, social role, or subjective
identity; (iv) the <em>ground</em> of its privilege: what it is about
that aspect that justifies a claim to privilege; (v) the <em>type</em>
of epistemic superiority it claims: for example, greater accuracy, or
greater ability to represent fundamental truths; (vi) the <em>other
perspectives</em> relative to which it claims epistemic superiority and
(vii) modes of access to that perspective: is occupying the social
location necessary or sufficient for getting access to the perspective?
Many claims to epistemic privilege on behalf of particular perspectives
with respect to certain questions are commonplace and uncontroversial.
Auto mechanics are generally in a better position than auto consumers
to know what is wrong with their cars. Practical experience in
fulfilling the social role of the mechanic grounds the mechanic's
epistemic privilege, which lays a claim to greater reliability than the
judgments of auto consumers. </p>

<p>

Standpoint theories are mainly used to claim epistemic
privilege over socially and politically contested topics on behalf of
the perspectives of systematically disadvantaged social groups,
relative to the perspectives of the groups that dominate them. The
scope of the claimed privilege includes the character, causes, and
consequences of the social inequalities that define the groups in
question. This type of standpoint theory <em>classically</em> claims
three types of epistemic privilege over the standpoint of dominant
groups: First, it claims to offer deep over surface knowledge of
society: the standpoint of the disadvantaged reveals the fundamental
regularities that drive the phenomena in question, whereas the
standpoint of the privileged captures only surface regularities.
Second, it thereby claims to offer superior knowledge of the
modality of surface regularities, and thus superior knowledge of human
potentialities. Where the standpoint of the privileged tends to
represent existing social inequalities as natural and necessary, the
standpoint of the disadvantaged correctly represents them as socially
contingent, and shows how they could be overcome. Third, it claims to
offer a representation of the social world in relation to universal
human interests. By contrast, the standpoint of the privileged
represents social phenomena only in relation to the interests of the
privileged class, but ideologically misrepresents these interests as
coinciding with universal human interests.</p>

<p>

<strong>Marxist Standpoint Theory.</strong> Marxism offers the classic
model of a standpoint theory, claiming an epistemic privilege over
fundamental questions of economics, sociology, and history on behalf
of the standpoint of the proletariat (Marx 1964, Lukács
1971). Workers do not naturally have this standpoint; they attain it
by gaining collective consciousness of their role in the capitalist
system and in history. Several aspects of workers' social situation
enable them to attain an epistemically privileged perspective on
society. Workers are oppressed, central to the capitalist mode of
production, endowed with a cognitive style based on their practical
productive material interaction with nature, and collectively
self-conscious agents of a potentially universal class. Oppression
gives them an objective interest in the truth about whose interests
are served by the capitalist system. Centrality gives them
experiential access to the fundamental relations of capitalist
production. Because, under capitalism, the standing of all other
classes is defined in relation to them, in coming to know themselves
and their class position, workers come to know their society as a
totality (Lukács 1971). Practical productive interaction with
the world is the fundamental mode by which people come to know it, in
a materialist epistemology. It leads workers to represent their world
in terms of use values, whereas capitalists represent it in terms of
exchange values. The workers' representation is more fundamental,
because the basic laws of economics and history are expressed in terms
of the struggle over the appropriation of surplus (use-) value, not in
terms of superficial money (exchange) values. The necessary and
transhistorical character of this practical, instrumental mode of
knowing also gives it an objective validity for all
societies. Universality—the workers' standing as the agents for
the future universal class they will become under communism
—entails that workers represent the social world in relation to
universal human interests, rather than in relation to class-specific
interests. This gives their representations of society greater
objectivity than capitalist representations. Finally, the collective
self-consciousness of the workers has, as all successful intentional
action does, the character of a self-fulfilling prophecy. Workers'
collective insight into their common predicament and the need to
overcome it through collective revolutionary action generates a
self-understanding which, when acted upon, gets realized. Workers
become the universal class, the primary agent of history, by acting on
that self-understanding. The epistemic privilege of the standpoint of
the proletariat, therefore, is also grounded in the epistemic
privilege that autonomous agents have over what they are doing.</p>

<p>

<strong>Grounds of Feminist Standpoint Theory.</strong> Feminist
standpoint theory claims an epistemic privilege over the character of
gender relations, and of social and psychological phenomena in which
gender is implicated, on behalf of the standpoint of women. The
privilege is relative to theories that justify patriarchy or reflect
sexist assumptions. Various feminist standpoint theories ground the
claim to epistemic privilege in different features of women's social
situation. Each can be seen as drawing an analogy with one or more
strands of Marxist epistemology.</p>

<p>

<em>Centrality</em>. According to Marxist feminists, such as Hartsock
(1987) and Rose (1987) women are central to the system of
reproduction—of socializing children and caring for
bodies—as workers are central to the system of commodity
production.  Because women are in charge of tending to the needs of
everyone else in the household, they are in a better position than men
to see how patriarchy fails to meet people's needs. Men, in virtue of
their dominant position, have the privilege of ignoring how their
actions undermine the interests of subordinates. The epistemic
privilege of women therefore rests on the fact that they
have superior access to information about whose needs are
served under patriarchy.</p>

<p>

<em>Collective self-consciousness</em>. According to MacKinnon (1999)
male dominance is based on sexual objectification, which involves
mystification. In objectification, dominant groups project
their desires onto subordinate groups and, in virtue of their power,
make subordinate groups conform to the way dominants want them to
be. It represents as given, natural, and necessary the group
differences that are caused by dominant group desires. Gender is the
mode of objectification constituted by erotic desire, the
eroticization of domination. Men constitute women as women by
representing their natures as essentially sexually subordinate to men
and treating them accordingly. Women can unmask these ideological
misrepresentations by achieving and acting on a shared understanding
of themselves as women—that is, as a social group unjustly
constituted by sexual objectification. Women act collectively on this
shared understanding in resisting the sexist representations made of
them, through campaigns against sexual harassment, pornography,
restrictions on reproductive freedom, and so forth. Through these
feminist actions, in which women refuse to act as sexual objects,
women show that representations of women as sexual objects are not
natural or necessary. Their privileged knowledge is agent
self-knowledge, made true by being put into action.</p>

<p>

<em>Cognitive style</em>. Some early versions of standpoint theory
(including Flax 1983, Hartsock 1987, Rose 1987, and Smith 1974) accept
feminist object relations theory, which explains the development of
stereotypical feminine and masculine traits in terms of the different
problems of identity-formation faced by male and female children
raised by female caregivers (Chodorow 1978). Object relations theory
postulates that male children form their masculine identities by
separating themselves from their mothers, a task that involves a need
to maintain distance and boundaries by controlling and denigrating the
feminine. Female children acquire their gender identity through
identification with their mothers, and so are more comfortable with a
blurring of boundaries between self and other. The development of
gender identities leads males and females to acquire distinctively
masculine and feminine cognitive styles. The masculine cognitive style
is abstract, theoretical, disembodied, emotionally detached,
analytical, deductive, quantitative, atomistic, and oriented toward
values of control or domination. The feminine cognitive style is
concrete, practical, embodied, emotionally engaged, synthetic,
intuitive, qualitative, relational, and oriented toward values of
care.  These cognitive styles are reinforced through the distinctive
types of labor assigned to men and women—men having a near
monopoly on the theoretical sciences, warmaking, and on positions of
political and economic power calling for detachment and control; and
women being assigned to hands-on emotional care for others. The
feminine cognitive style is said to be epistemically superior because
it overcomes the dichotomy between the subject and object of knowing
and because an ethic of care is superior to an ethic of
domination. Ways of knowing informed by the motive of caring for
everyone's needs will produce more valuable representations than ways
of knowing informed by the interests of the dominant (Hartsock
1987). They will produce representations of the world in relation to
universal human interests, rather than in terms of the interests of
dominant classes. To institutionalize the feminine way of knowing,
however, would require overcoming the division of mental, manual, and
caring labor that characterizes capitalist patriarchy (Rose 1987).</p>

<p>

<em>Oppression</em>. Women are oppressed, and therefore have an
interest in representing social phenomena in ways that reveal this
truth. They also have direct experience of their oppression, unlike
men, whose privilege enables them to ignore how their actions affect
women. The logic of an epistemology that grounds epistemic privilege
in oppression is to identify the multiply oppressed as multiply
epistemically privileged. Within feminist theory, this logic has led
to the development of black feminist epistemology. Collins (1990)
grounds black feminist epistemology in black women's personal
experiences of racism and sexism, and in cognitive styles associated
with black women. She uses this epistemology to supply black women
with self-representations that enable them to resist the demeaning
racist and sexist images of black women in the wider world, and to
take pride in their identities. The epistemic privilege of the
oppressed is sometimes cast, following W.E.B. DuBois, in terms of
“bifurcated consciousness”: the ability to see things both
from the perspective of the dominant and from the perspective of the
oppressed, and therefore to comparatively evaluate both perspectives
(Harding 1991, Smith 1974, Collins 1990).  Black women are
“outsiders within,” having enough personal experience as
insiders to know their social order, but enough critical distance to
empower critique.</p>

<p>

<strong>Access to the Feminist Standpoint.</strong> Every standpoint
theory must offer an account of how one gains access to its situated
knowledge. This depends on whether membership in the group whose
perspective is privileged is defined objectively, in terms of one's
position in a social structure, or subjectively, in terms of one's
subjective identification as a member of the group. When group
membership is defined objectively, it is neither necessary nor
sufficient for gaining access to the privileged perspective. It is not
sufficient, because one might be unaware of the objective significance
of being a group member. Members become aware of their objective group
identity only by achieving a shared understanding of their predicament
with other group members. This is the function of
consciousness-raising groups in feminist practice (MacKinnon 1999). It
is not necessary, because when a group is defined objectively, the
facts that constitute the group as such and its interests are publicly
accessible, so anyone can theorize phenomena in relation to the
interests of that group. Thus, Marx theorized from the standpoint of
the proletariat, even though he was not a worker. However, to the
extent that the ground of epistemic privilege lies in the
self-knowledge of autonomous agents, only those who participate in
that agency can have first-personal agent knowledge. At this point,
the site of epistemic privilege shifts to the group defining itself as
a collective political agent. The privileged standpoint is not that of
women, but of feminists. Men can participate in the feminist movement,
too. But they cannot assume a dominant role in defining (hence
knowing) the aims of the feminist movement, given that a constitutive
aim of feminism is overcoming male dominance. When group membership is
defined purely subjectively, then membership in the group is both
necessary and sufficient to gain access to the perspective of the
group.  However, most versions of standpoint theory represent the
epistemically privileged standpoint as an achieved, not a given,
perspective, requiring critical reflection on the power structures of
society and the relations of one's group to it.</p>

<p>

<strong>Goals of Feminist Standpoint Theory.</strong> Feminist
standpoint theory is a type of
 <a href="../critical-theory/">critical theory</a>, as this 
term was understood by the Frankfurt school of
critical social theorists. Critical theories aim to empower the
oppressed to improve their situation. They therefore incorporate
pragmatic constraints on theories of the social world. To serve their
critical aim, social theories must (a) represent the world in relation
to the interests of the oppressed; (b) enable the oppressed to
understand their problems; and (c) be usable by the oppressed to
improve their condition. Critical theory is theory of, by, and for the
subjects of study. These features of critical theory raise the
possibility that claims of superiority for particular theories might
be based more on pragmatic than epistemic virtues (Harding 1991,
Hartsock 1996). Even if a particular feminist theory cannot make good
on the claim that it has <em>privileged</em> access to reality, it may
offer true representations that are more <em>useful</em> to women than
other true representations.</p>

<p>

<strong>Criticisms of Feminist Standpoint Theory.</strong> Longino
(1993b) argues that standpoint theory cannot provide a noncircular
basis for deciding which standpoints have epistemic privilege. Bar On (1993) argues
against grounding women's epistemic privilege in their oppression, via
feminine cognitive styles. If the feminine ethics of care provides the
epistemically privileged perspective on morality, then our access to
moral knowledge is predicated on the continuation of existing gender
relations, which produce this ethic. Grounding epistemic privilege in
feminine cognitive styles therefore forces a choice between having
ethical knowledge and living in a nonsexist society. Bar On also claims
that the center-periphery model that underwrites the epistemic
privilege of workers does not apply to women. Marx held that class
conflict is the central phenomenon that drives all other forms of group
conflict, including sexism, racism, imperialism, and national and
religious conflict. So understanding class could yield an understanding
of other dimensions of inequality. It is implausible to hold
that <em>any</em> group inequality is central to all the others; they
intersect in complex ways (Crenshaw 1999). Hence, women
cannot even have privileged access to understanding their own
oppression, since this takes different forms for different women,
depending on their race, sexual orientation, and so forth. This
critique has been forcefully developed by feminist postmodernists, who
question the possibility of a unified standpoint of women, and
see, behind the assertion of a universal woman's viewpoint, the
perspective of relatively privileged white women (Lugones &amp; Spelman
1983).</p>

<h2><a name="postmod">3. Feminist Postmodernism</a></h2>

<p>

<strong>General Postmodernist Themes.</strong> Postmodernism as a North
American intellectual movement draws inspiration from a variety of
French poststructuralist and postmodernist theorists, including
Foucault, Lacan, Derrida, Lyotard, and Irigaray. It embodies a
skeptical sensibility that questions attempts to transcend our
situatedness by appeal to such ideas as universality, necessity,
objectivity, rationality, essence, unity, totality, foundations, and
ultimate Truth and Reality. It stresses the locality, partiality,
contingency, instability, uncertainty, ambiguity and essential
contestability of any particular account of the world, the self, and
the good. Politically, the postmodernist emphasis on revealing the
situatedness and contestability of any particular claim or system of
thought is supposed to serve both critical and liberatory functions. It
delegitimizes ideas that dominate and exclude by undermining their
claims to transcendent justification. And it opens up space for
imagining alternative possibilities that were obscured by those claims.</p>

<p>

Although postmodernist themes are often expressed in an obscure
jargon, they can be cast in terms more familiar to other
philosophers. Postmodernists begin with ideas about language and
systems of thought. They claim that (what we think of as) reality is
“discursively constructed.” This is the linguistic version
of the now inescapable (!) Kantian thought that our minds grasp things
not as they are “in themselves” but only through concepts,
signified by words. “The linguistic sign acts reflexively, not
referentially” in a “discursive field.” This is a
version of radical meaning holism: signs get their meaning not from
their reference to external things but from their relations to all of
the other signs in a system of discourse. Meaning holism entails that
the introduction of new signs (or elimination of old ones) will change
the meanings of the signs that were already in use. Signs therefore do
not have a fixed meaning over time. This is a Heraclitean version of
historicism: we cannot step into the same stream of thought twice.
Together, these ideas support the “rejection of totalizing
metanarratives.” There can be no complete, unified theory of the
world that captures the whole truth about it. Any such theory will
contain a definite set of terms. This entails that it cannot express
all conceptual possibilities. For a discourse that contained different
terms would contain meanings not available in the discursive field of
the theory that claims completeness. Thus, the selection of any
particular theory or narrative is an exercise of
“power”—to exclude certain possibilities from
thought and to authorize others.</p>

<p>

Postmodernism extends these ideas about language to social practices
more generally. The key idea underwriting this extension is that
actions and practices are linguistic signs. Like words, they signify
things beyond themselves by means of linguistic devices such as
metaphor and metonymy. For example, the elevation of the judge's bench
metaphorically signifies his superior authority over everyone else in
the courtroom. This permits an analysis of social practices and
behaviors as exhibiting the same structure and dynamics as language
itself. Just as words get their meaning from their relations to other
words rather than from their relation to some external reality, so do
actions get their meaning from their relations to other actions, rather
than from their relation to some pre-linguistic realm of human nature
or natural law. Thus, the superior authority of the judge consists in
the conventions of deference others manifest in their actions toward
him. It is not underwritten by a supposed natural tendency of humans to
obey authority, or by an underlying normatively objective authority.
The latter thoughts express essentialist and objectivist power plays,
attempts to foreclose contests over practices by fixing them in a
supposedly extra-linguistic reality. Such attempts are not only
objectionable but futile, because the meanings of actions are
constantly being subverted by other actions that, in changing the
context of the former actions, changes their meanings. This is why
postmodernists celebrate ironic, parodic, and campy renditions of
conventional behaviors as politically liberating (Butler 1993). If Marx
lamented that history repeats itself twice—first as tragedy,
second as farce—postmodernists revel in the same process.</p>

<p>

Postmodernists view the self as likewise constituted by signs that
have meaning only in relation to other signs. There is no unified self
that underlies the play of a stream of signifiers. This is a linguistic
version of Hume's fragmented stream-of-consciousness account of the
self, but with a social twist. Signs, unlike Hume's simple ideas, form
language, which is socially constructed. Thus, although subjectivity is
constituted through the production of signs, the self is not free to
make of these whatever it wants, but finds itself entangled in a web of
meanings not of its own creation. Our identities are socially imposed,
not autonomously created. However, this does not foreclose the
possibility of agency, because we occupy multiple social identities
(e.g., a woman might be a worker, a mother, lesbian, Mexican, and so
forth). The tensions among these conflicting identities open up spaces
for disrupting the discursive systems that construct us.</p>

<p>

Because, in its philosophy of language, words refer to concepts
rather than things in the world, postmodernism reproduces in linguistic
terms some of the same epistemological conundrums posed in the history
of modern philosophy by the veil of ideas. This generates a tendency
toward idealism in both traditions. However, given the constant flux of
meanings generated by holism, these tendencies cannot secure the
certainty or stability that empiricists thought they could attain by
resorting to idealism. The more careful practitioners of postmodernism
resist wholesale idealism. Claims that bodies, matter, or the objects
investigated by the natural sciences are “discursively
constructed” or “socially constructed” do not assert
that the external world would disappear if people stopped talking about
it. Rather, they assert a kind of nominalism: that the world does not
dictate the categories we use to describe it, that innumerable
incompatible ways of classifying the world are available to us, and
therefore that the selection of any one theory is a choice that cannot
be justified by appeal to “objective” truth or reality.
Even the ways we draw our distinctions between mind and body, ideas and
objects, discourse and reality, are contestable.</p>

<p>

<strong>Feminist Postmodernism.</strong> Within feminism,
postmodernist ideas have been deployed against theories that purport to
justify sexist practices—notably, ideologies that claim that
observed differences between men and women are natural and necessary,
or that women have an essence that explains and justifies their
subordination. The oft-cited claim that gender is socially or
discursively constructed—that it is an effect of social
practices and systems of meaning that can be disrupted—finds
one of its homes in postmodernism (Butler 1990). However, postmodernism
has figured more prominently in internal critiques of feminist
theories. One of the most important trends in feminist thinking in the
past twenty years has been exposing and responding to exclusionary
tendencies within feminism itself. Women of color and lesbian women
have argued that mainstream feminist theories have ignored their
distinct problems and perspectives (Collins 1990; Hull, Scott, and
Smith, 1982; Lorde 1984). Feminist postmodernism represents both a
vehicle for and response to these critiques. It underwrites a critique
of the concept “woman”—the central analytical
category of feminist theory. And it proposes perspective-shifting as a
strategy for negotiating the proliferation of theories produced by
differently situated women.</p>

<p>

<em>The critique of the concept “woman.”</em> Feminist
postmodernists have criticized many of the leading feminist theories of
gender and patriarchy as essentialist (Butler 1990, Flax 1990, Spelman
1988). Essentialism here refers to any theory that claims to identify a
universal, transhistorical, necessary cause or constitution of gender
identity or patriarchy. The objection to essentialism is fundamentally
political: in claiming that gender identity is one thing or has one
cause, such theories convert discursively constructed facts into norms,
difference into deviance. They either exclude women who don't conform
to the theory from the class of true “women,” or else
represent them as inferior. The critiques of feminist theories by
lesbian women and women of color have reinforced skepticism about the
unity presumed in the category “woman” by highlighting the
intersectionality of identities of gender, race, class, and sexual
orientation. The chief faultlines for the fragmentation of the category
“woman” have thus been the other identity formations along
which social inequalities are constructed.</p>

<p>

This critique of “woman” as a unified <em>object</em> of
theorizing entails that “woman” also cannot constitute a
unified <em>subject</em> of knowing (Lugones &amp; Spelman 1983). The
theories of universal gender identity under attack are ones in which
the authors, all white middle class heterosexual women, could see
themselves. Critics claim that the authors fail to acknowledge their
own situatedness and hence the ways they are implicated in and
reproduce power relations—in this case, the presumptuous
authority of white middle class heterosexual women to define “the
standpoint of women”—to speak for all other women and
define who they are. Feminist standpoint theorists, who claim an
epistemic privilege on behalf of their standpoint, are thereby unmasked
as asserting a race and class privilege over other women.</p>

<p>

Feminist postmodernists draw two lessons from this critique. First,
universal claims about women, gender, and patriarchy should be avoided.
Second, feminist standpoint theory's project of identifying a single
epistemically privileged perspective is fundamentally flawed, an
unjustified assertion of power in the name of an unattainable
objectivity. This lesson applies to subaltern feminist standpoints as
well. The assertion of a black feminist standpoint, for example,
objectionably essentializes black women. Once the postmodernist
critique of essentialism is granted, there is no logical stopping point
in the proliferation of perspectives.</p>

<p>

<em>Perspective shifting</em>. Feminist postmodernism thus envisions
our epistemic situation as characterized by a permanent plurality of
perspectives, none of which can claim objectivity—that is,
transcendence of situatedness to a “view from nowhere.”
This position has sometimes been characterized as relativist. Haraway
(1991) replies that it rejects both objectivism and relativism for the
ways they let knowers escape responsibility for the representations
they construct. To claim objectivity for a representation is to claim
that “the world made me represent things this way.” To
claim relativism is to claim that “my identity (my situation)
made me represent things this way (and my identity/situation is not
inferior to yours).” Both positions disclaim the active
participation of the knower in constructing her representations. Even a
photograph, the paradigm of an “objective” representation,
reflects the photographer's choice of film, lenses, frames, exposure,
and so forth. But the resort to a relativism of identity is no better.
In asserting the equality of all perspectives, it claims immunity from
the critiques of differently positioned others, and complacency in
one's own position. Although it acknowledges the dependence of a
knower's representations on the particulars of her situation, it claims
that she had no choice about that. Postmodernists, however, reject the
fixity and unity of personal identity on which relativism rests. People
are not epistemically trapped inside their cultures, their gender,
their race, or any other identity. They can choose to think from other
perspectives. Thus, although we will always have a plurality of
perspectives, their constitution is constantly shifting rather than
static, and there is no stable correspondence between individuals and
perspectives.</p>

<p>

Negotiating the bewildering array of situated knowledges therefore
involves two types of epistemic practice. One is acceptance of
responsibility, which involves acknowledging the choices of situation
that entered into the construction of one's representations (Haraway
1991), and considering how one's situation affects the content of
one's representations (Harding 1993). The second is “world
traveling” (Lugones 1987) or “mobile
positioning”—trying to see things from many other
perspectives. Mobile positioning can never be transparent or
innocent. Imagining oneself in another's situation is full of
risks. It requires sensitive engagement with and sympathy for the
others who occupy those positions. Both transform situated knowing
into a critical and responsible practice.</p>

<p>

<strong>Criticisms of Feminist Postmodernism.</strong> Both key
features of feminist postmodernism—the rejection of
“woman” as a category of analysis, and the infinite
fragmentation of perspectives—are controversial within feminist
theory. A wholesale opposition to large-scale generalizations about
women seems to arbitrarily preclude a critical analysis of large-scale
social forces that critically affect women (Benhabib 1995). That women
in different social positions may experience sexism differently does
not entail that they have nothing in common—they still suffer
from sexism (MacKinnon 2000). Intersectionality, rather than being a
basis for dissolving the category “woman,” may be
accommodated through a structural analysis of gender that allows for
racialized and otherwise particularized modes of sexist oppression
(Haslanger 2000). The postmodernist alternative of fragmentation and
multiplicity threatens both the possibility of analytical focus (it is
impossible to keep all axes of difference in play at once) and of
politically effective coalition building among women with different
identities. Carried to its logical conclusion, feminist postmodernism
dissolves all groups, thereby reproducing the individualism of the
Enlightenment epistemology it claims to repudiate. And the idea of
mobile positioning may simply reproduce the objectivism and ideas of
autonomy that postmodernists claim to reject, only now in the guise of
“the view from everywhere” rather than “the view from
nowhere” (Bordo 1990). Critics argue that feminists would do
better if they forthrightly appropriated ideals of human rights and
autonomy, rather than embracing “the death of the subject”
in the fragmentation of the self (Benhabib 1995). Despite these
difficulties, postmodernism remains a powerful current in feminist
epistemology, due to the acknowledgment by all feminists that a
plurality of situated knowledges appears to be an inescapable
consequence of social differentiation and embodiment.</p>

<h2><a name="empiricism">4. Feminist Empiricism</a></h2>

<p>

<strong>Relations of Feminist Empiricism to Empiricism in
general.</strong> Empiricism is the view that experience provides the
sole or primary justification for knowledge. From
the classical empiricists to some early twentieth-century theorists,
empiricists held that the content of experience could be described in
fixed, basic, theory-neutral terms—for example, in terms of
sense-data. Most also supposed that philosophy could
provide a transcendent or external justification for empirical or
scientific methods. Quine revolutionized empiricism by rejecting both
of these ideas. For Quine, observation is theory-laden. It
is cast in terms of complex concepts not immediately given
in experience, which are potentially subject to revision in
light of further experience (Quine 1963). And epistemology, far from
providing an extrascientific vindication of science, is just
another project within science, in which we empirically investigate our
own practices of inquiry (Quine 1969). In these respects, feminist
empiricists are the daughters of Quine. However, Quine accepted a sharp
division between facts and values that feminist empiricists argue
cannot be sustained within a thoroughly naturalized empiricism.
Feminist empiricists consider how feminist
values can legitimately inform empirical inquiry, and how scientific
methods can be improved in light of feminist demonstrations of sex bias
in currently accepted methods. Their version of naturalized
epistemology therefore does not follow Quine in reducing epistemology
to nonnormative psychological investigations, but rather upholds the
roles of value judgments in rigorous empirical inquiry (Campbell 1998,
Nelson 1990). Quine also presupposes an individualist account of
inquiry; his preferred reduction basis for naturalized epistemology is
behavioral and neuro- psychology. Feminist empiricists are concerned
with the impact on inquiry of social practices relating to gender,
race, class and other bases of inequality. They therefore take
sociology, history, and science studies seriously. Most advocate a
socialized epistemology, in which inquiry is treated as a fundamentally
social process, and the subjects of knowledge may even be
communities or networks of individuals. </p>

<p>

<strong>The Paradoxes of Bias and Social Construction.</strong> The
central problematics of feminist empiricism can be captured in two
apparent paradoxes. First, much feminist science criticism consists in
exposing the androcentric and sexist biases in scientific research,
especially in theories about women, sexuality, and gender differences.
The force of this criticism seems to rest on a prior empiricist
commitment to the view that bias is epistemically bad. Yet, advocates
of feminist science urge that feminist values inform scientific
inquiry. This amounts to a recommendation that science would improve
if it adopted certain biases. This is the paradox of bias. Second, and
relatedly, much feminist science criticism is devoted to exposing the
influence of social and political factors on scientific
inquiry. Scientists advocate androcentric and sexist theories because
they are influenced by the sexist values of the wider society. This
would seem to imply that, to eliminate these social biases, feminists
adopt an individualist epistemology. Instead, feminist epistemologists
urge, not that inquirers insulate themselves from social influences,
but that they restructure scientific practices to be open to
<em>different</em> social influences. Call this the paradox of social
construction.</p>

<p>

Feminist empiricists argue that the key to dissolving both paradoxes
is to undermine the assumptions that underlie them: that biases,
political values, and social factors can influence inquiry only by
<em>displacing</em> the influence of evidence, logic, and whatever
other cognitive factors tend to lead to true theories. Not all
bias is epistemically bad (Antony 1993). There are three general
strategies for showing this, which may be called pragmatic,
procedural, and moral realist. The pragmatic approach stresses the
plurality of aims that inquiry serves. Inquiry seeks truths, or at
least empirically adequate representations, but <em>which</em> truths
any particular inquiry seeks depends on the uses to which those
representations will be put, many of which are practical and derived
from social interests.  The paradoxes are dissolved by showing how
responsible inquiry respects a division of labor between the functions
of evidence and social values—the evidence helping inquirers
track the truth, the social values helping inquirers construct
representations out of those truths that serve the pragmatic aims of
inquiry (Anderson 1995b). This view may be joined with a view of
nature as rich, complex, and messy. No single theory captures the
whole structure of reality, since different ways of classifying
phenomena will reveal different patterns useful to different practical
interests (Longino 2001). The procedural approach argues that
epistemically bad biases can be kept in check through an appropriate
social organization of inquiry. A social organization that holds
people with different biases accountable to one another will be able
to weed out bad biases, even if no individual on her own can be free
of bias (Longino 1990). This view may be joined with the idea that the
subject of knowledge (Nelson 1993), epistemic rationality (Solomon
2001) or objectivity (Longino 1990, 2001) is the epistemic community,
not the individual. The moral realist approach argues that moral,
social and political value judgments have truth-values, and that
feminist values are true. Inquiry informed by feminist values
therefore does not displace attention to the evidence, because the
evidence vindicates these values (Campbell 1998).</p>

<p>

Feminist empiricists appeal to the pragmatist tradition to undermine
the sharp dichotomy between fact and value (Antony 1993; Nelson 1993).
They argue (compatibly with other pragmatists, such as Hilary Putnam),
that Quine's arguments about the underdetermination of theory by
evidence lead to a view of facts as partially constituted by values,
and values by facts. Without a sharp distinction between facts and
values, it cannot be argued that inquiry explicitly motivated by
feminist values is <em>in principle</em> opposed to the truth.
Whether any particular feminist, or sexist, theory is true will depend
on empirical investigation informed by epistemic norms—norms
which may themselves be reformed in light of the merits of the
theories they generate. This is the project of naturalized
epistemology, whereby the vindication of norms of inquiry is sought
not outside, but within, empirical investigation. Feminist empiricist
investigations of the interaction of facts and values are further
discussed <a href="#valinq">below</a>.  Feminist empiricist
explorations of how norms of inquiry should be constituted to enhance
objectivity are also discussed <a href="#object">below</a>.</p>

<p>

<strong>Criticisms of Feminist Empiricism.</strong> Feminist
postmodernists criticize feminist empiricists for presuming the
existence of an individual, transhistorical subject of knowledge
outside of social determination (Harding 1990). Feminist empiricists
are also criticized for accepting an uncritical concept of experience
(Scott 1991), and for naively holding that science will correct the
errors and biases in its theories about women and other subordinated
groups by itself, without the aid of feminist values or insights
(Harding 1986, 1991). These criticisms apply to what Harding called
“spontaneous feminist empiricism”—the view that
elimination of sexist bias, without further modification of scientific
methods as understood by traditional logical empiricists, is
sufficient for feminist critique. However, the Quine-inspired
naturalized epistemology of most feminist empiricists views knowers as
socially situated, empirical evidence as theory-laden and critically
revisable in light of theoretical and normative reflection, and
objective knowledge of human phenomena as requiring inclusion of
feminist inquirers as equals in the collective project of inquiry
(Longino 1993a, 1993b).  Hundleby (1997), a standpoint theorist,
criticizes feminist empiricism for overlooking the vital role of
feminist political <em>activity,</em> in particular, the development
of oppositional consciousness, as a superior source of hypotheses and
evidence for challenging sexist and androcentric theories.</p>

<h2><a name="femsci">5. Feminist Science Criticism and Feminist Science</a></h2>

<p>

The history of feminist interventions into most disciplines follows a
common pattern. Feminist inquiry begins as a critique of accepted
disciplinary methods, assumptions, and theories. As it matures, it
develops constructive projects of its own. This history helps us see
how feminist epistemology negotiates the tension between the two poles
in the paradox of bias that lies at the core of feminist
empiricism. Feminist science critics began by focusing on exposing
androcentric and sexist biases in science as sources of error.  As
philosophers and historians of science joined the practice of feminist
science criticism, they developed a more sophisticated understanding
of some biases as epistemic resources. Advocates of feminist science
develop this theme in seeking to practice science in the light and
service of feminist aims and values, which function as epistemic
resources. </p>

<p>

<strong>Feminist Science Criticism: Bias as Error.</strong> Feminist
science criticism originated in the critiques that working biologists,
psychologists, and other scientists made of the androcentric and
sexist biases and practices in their own disciplines—especially
of theories about women and gender differences that legitimate sexist
practices. Exemplary works in this tradition include Bleier (1984),
Fausto-Sterling (1985), Hrdy (1981), Leacock (1981), Sherif (1987),
and Tavris (1992).  Feminist science criticism includes several types
of research. (1) Studies of how the exclusion or marginalization of
women scientists impair scientific progress. For example, the failure
to provide Barbara McClintock with professional standing, resources,
and access to graduate students delayed incorporation of her
pioneering discoveries of genetic transposition into mainstream
biology (Keller 1983). (2) Studies of how applications of science and
technology disadvantage women and other vulnerable groups and treat
their interests as less important. Examples include eugenics (Hubbard
1990), and economic development policies that reinforce gender
hierarchy by offering training and resources to men, but not women, in
developing countries (Waring 1990). Such ill-effects of science
applications can be partly traced to epistemic defects in the
underlying science—to bogus concepts of race in the case of
eugenics, and to failures to recognize women's work as contributing to
the “economy” in the case of sexist development policies.
(3) Studies of how science has ignored women and gender, and how
turning attention to these issues may require revisions of accepted
theories. Hays-Gilpin and Whitley (1998) document dramatic examples of
this in archaeology. (4) Studies of how biases toward working with
“masculine” cognitive styles—for example, toward
centralized, hierarchical control models of causation as opposed to
“feminine” (contextual, interactive, diffused)
models—have impaired scientific understanding, for example, in
studies of slime-mold (Keller 1985b) and molecular biology (Spanier
1995). (5) Studies of how research into sex differences that
reinforces sex stereotypes and sexist practices fail to live up to
standards of good science—for example, in drawing inferences on
the basis of miniscule sample sizes or correlations not tested against
an appropriately designed control group, or in ignoring disconfirming
data (Fausto-Sterling 1985, Fine 2010, Tavris 1992). Gender bias may
also be revealed in the conceptual framework of the theory in
question—for example, in representing subjective gender
identification as a dichotomous variable, thereby eliminating other
possibilities, such as androgyny, from consideration (Bem 1993).</p>

<p> In these cases, gender bias is represented as a cause of
error. But, as philosophers and historians of science joined the
practice of feminist science criticism, alternative models of gender
bias were developed, sometimes in cooperation with working
scientists. Exemplary works of feminist science criticism by
philosophers and historians of science include Bluhm (2013), Haraway
(1989), Harding (1986, 1991, 1993, 1998), Lloyd (2006), Longino &amp;
Doell (1983), Meynell (2012), Schiebinger (1989), and Wylie
(1996). Some of this work argues that the interests in technological
control that underlie the modern practice of science limit its scope
and what it takes to be significant knowledge (Lacey 1999, Merchant
1980, Tiles 1987).  Feminist science critics also show how theories go
beyond the data that support them, with the gap often being filled by
sexist and androcentric assumptions. Thus, Haraway (1989) shows how
hypotheses in primatology and evolutionary theory depend on narrative
conventions (for example, casting the transition from ape to hominid
as a heroic drama) and tropes (for example, casting primates as
mirrors of human nature). While these narrative conventions and tropes
have rhetorical appeal, the evidence does not compel their
selection.</p>

<p>

Feminist science critics have identified multiple kinds of bias in
research programs. Bias leads to <em>error</em> or <em>unjustified
conclusions</em> to the extent that it generates or rests on (1)
confused or nonreferring concepts (for example, the concept of
“race” as biological subspecies of human beings); (2)
violation of valid methodological principles; (3) belief in a theory
despite a lack of evidential support, or evidence against it; (4) a
disposition to interpret evidence, regardless of its content, as
supporting a favored theory; (5) continued commitment to a theory with
some evidential support, even when rival theories dominate it with
respect to all epistemic values.  Biases that generate error in this
way should be avoided, through better training of scientists or the
adoption and enforcement of methodological principles and social
practices (such as peer review) designed to check their
influence. Feminist science criticism in the bias-as-error mode
parallels the heuristics-and-biases tradition of psychology (Kahneman,
Slovic and Tversky 1982), which has been taken up in naturalized
epistemology and philosophy of science (e.g., Solomon 2001). On a
normative level, it generates methodological principles for engaging
in nonsexist science. Exemplary methodological works generated by
feminist science criticism include Altmann (1974) and Eichler
(1988).</p>

<p>

Bias in a research program is shown to be <em>limiting</em> or
<em>partial</em>, but not necessarily erroneous, to the extent that
avoids clear error and has some empirical successes, while rival
theories in the same domain, depending on different concepts and/or
methods, also avoid clear error and have <em>different</em> empirical
successes or other epistemic virtues. Such biases are
<em>legitimate</em>: it is rationally acceptable to conduct scientific
inquiry under their influence. Indeed, psychological investigations
strongly suggest that we have no choice but to think in accordance
with some biases.  Moreover, the underdetermination of theory by data
implies that without some biases, we would be unable to make sense of
our world (Antony 1993). When biases are partial but not erroneous,
they serve a <em>generative</em> function, producing new concepts,
methods, and hypotheses that open up new aspects of the world for
understanding. They are epistemic <em>resources</em>. From a normative
point of view, feminist philosophers of science argue that we have an
epistemic interest in ensuring that certain limiting biases do not
dominate research to the exclusion of other generative biases that
would yield rival theories possessing a different range of important
empirical successes. Exposing the androcentric and sexist biases lying
behind certain theories makes salient the room for alternative
programs not based on such biases.</p>

<p>

<strong>Feminist Science: Bias as Resource</strong>. Most advocates
of <em>feminist science</em> argue, in this vein, that scientific
inquiries informed by feminist values are based on legitimate,
generative limiting biases. They argue that feminist sciences
should be included among the legitimate choices available to
investigators. This picture of science is pluralistic, compatible with
the postmodern rejection of “totalizing narratives,” but
more inclined than postmodernists to explain the persistence of
pluralism in the social and applied sciences in realist
terms: science is disunified because the world is rich with a multitude
of cross-cutting structures, which no single theoretical vocabulary can
capture. Different communities have interests in different aspects of
reality, so leaving them free to follow their interests will reveal
different patterns and structures in the world (Harding 1998; Longino
2001).</p>

<p>

Against this pluralistic view, some advocates of feminist science
define it in terms of adherence to specific ontologies and
methodologies expressing a “feminine” cognitive style
(Duran 1991, Keller 1983, 1985a). On this conception, for example, the
content of any feminist theory should have a relational rather than an
atomistic ontology, favor the concrete over the abstract, avoid
generalizations about women in favor of exposing the richness and
particularity of different women's lives and perspectives, and so
forth. Its methods should encompass intuition, emotional engagement, and
other cognitive styles associated with a feminine sensibility. For example, Stanley &amp;
Wise (1983) argue that only qualitative methods that accept women's
reports of their experiences in their own terms, refusing to
generalize, can uphold feminist values of respecting differences among
women and avoiding the replication of power differences between
researchers and research subjects.</p>

<p> Pluralist feminist scientists and philosophers of science have
vigorously contested these attempts to define feminist science in
terms preferred content and “feminine” method. They argue
that many questions of interest to feminists are best answered with
quantitative methods (Jayaratne &amp; Stewart, 1991), and that
feminists may properly make use of a wide range of methods (Harding
1987, Nielsen 1990, Reinharz 1992). Feminist science is not defined by
its content, but rather by the pragmatic interests that generate the
questions it asks. Feminists are interested in uncovering the causes
of women's oppression, revealing the dynamics of gender in society,
and producing knowledge that women can use to overcome the
disadvantages to which they are subject. Forms of knowledge that
simply valorize the “feminine” may not be helpful to women
who would be better off not having norms of femininity imposed on
them.  Feminist pluralists argue that advocates of
“feminine” science have not shown that feminine cognitive
styles and ontologies are generally better able to track the truth
(Longino 1989).</p>

<p>

If feminist science amounts to “doing science as a
feminist”—that is, using science to answer questions
generated by feminist interests—one may ask whether it differs
in any substantive respect from the science that is already practiced
by nonfeminists. Feminist pluralists reply that doing biology, primatology, anthropology,
archaeology, psychology, economics, history or any other special
science as a feminist has resulted in many and various
<em>local</em> methodological innovations, discoveries of new sources
of evidence, and developments of alternative theories (see, for
example, Bell, Caplan and Karim 1993; Haraway 1989; Hays-Gilpin and
Whitley 1998; Nielsen 1990). These are then made available to inquirers
asking other, nonfeminist questions. There is no presumption that
certain methods, evidence, etc. are uniquely available to serve
feminist cognitive interests.</p>

<p>

Nevertheless, some common threads in “doing science
as a feminist” tend, in particular contexts, to favor certain types of
representation over others (Longino 1994). Feminists are interested in
epistemic practices that reveal the operations of gender in the world,
and opportunities for women to resist and transform these operations.
One way gender bias reinforces sexism is through the
perpetuation of categorical, dichotomous thinking which represents
masculinity and femininity as “opposites,” femininity as
inferiority, and nonconformity to gender norms as deviant. This gives
feminists an interest in the value of “ontological
heterogeneity”—using categories that permit the
observation of within-group variation, and that resist the
representation of difference from the group mean as deviance.
Gender bias also reinforces sexism through single-factor causal models
that attribute seemingly intrinsic powers to men by neglecting their
wider context. The value of “complexity of relationship”
favors the development of causal models that facilitate the
representation of features of the social context that support male
power, including female participation and complicity. Other feminist
cognitive values involve the <em>accessibility</em> of knowledge:
feminist favor knowledge that “diffuses power” in being
cast in a form usable to people in subordinate positions, who often
lack technical expertise and access to expensive equipment. This
interest underlies the appropriate technology movement in developing
countries. For similar reasons, feminists are especially interested in
knowledge applicable to meeting human needs. These values are
feminist in the sense of advancing feminist interests, but their
usefulness is not confined to feminism. These feminist
cognitive values do not displace or compete with the search for truth, because
doing science as a feminist, like doing science with any other interest
in mind (for example, medical or military interests) involves
commitment to the cognitive value of producing empirically adequate
theories.</p>

<h2><a name="valinq">6. Feminist Defenses of Value-Laden Inquiry</a></h2>

<p>

<strong>The Challenge of Value-Neutrality.</strong> The theory and
practice of feminist science raises the question of how any inquiry
shaped by moral, social, and political interests can simultaneously be
faithful to the fundamental epistemic interest in truth. Against the
project of feminist science, many philosophers hold that true science
is neutral among social, moral, and political values. Lacey (1999)
usefully distinguishes the following claims of value-neutrality: (1)
<em>Autonomy</em>: science progresses best when uninfluenced by
social/political movements and values. (2) <em>Neutrality</em>:
scientific theories do not imply or presuppose any judgments about
noncognitive values, nor do scientific theories serve any particular
noncognitive values more fully than others. (3) <em>Impartiality</em>:
The only grounds for accepting a theory are its relations to the
evidence. These grounds are impartial among rival noncognitive values. </p>

<p>

Of these claims, neutrality is the most dubious, because it depicts
the grounds for accepting social, political and moral values as utterly
detached from evidence about human potentialities and about what
happens when people try to realize these values in practice. If this
were true, then the defenders of keeping mathematics a male preserve
would not have bothered arguing that women were not intellectually
capable of doing mathematics and that their uteri would wander if they
tried to do it—and feminists would not have bothered disputing
those claims. Neutrality is less a claim about the character of science
than about the justification of social and political values. As a
categorical claim about the latter, it is false. Taylor (1985) and
Tiles &amp; Oberdiek (1995) show, in detailed case studies, how
scientific theories do serve some social and political values more than
others.</p>

<p>

The core claim of value-neutrality, however, is impartiality. The
thought that underwrites impartiality is that scientific theories aim
at the truth, at what <em>is</em> the case, whereas value judgments
deal with what <em>ought</em> to be the case. Even if neutrality is
false, because facts constitute part of the warrant for value
judgments, the converse is not true. Only facts can supply the warrant
for other facts. Autonomy, in turn, is defended as a means to ensure
that science satisfies the demands of impartiality. Social and
political movements are thought to threaten autonomy because their
primary influence on science is thought to consist in pressuring
scientists to ignore the facts and validate their worldviews. Defenders
of impartiality object to the very idea of feminist science because
they view it as threatening impartiality.</p>

<p>

<strong>The Basic Underdetermination Argument.</strong> Feminist
empiricists reply to the challenge of value-neutrality by extending
Quine's argument that theory is underdetermined by evidence (Longino
1990, Nelson 1993). Any body of observations counts as evidence for
particular hypotheses only in conjunction with certain background
assumptions. Vary the background assumptions, and the same
observations will support quite different hypotheses. For example, the
failure to observe stellar parallax in the 16th century was taken as
evidence that the Earth stands still by geocentrists, and as evidence
that the stars are very far away by heliocentrists. No logical
principle stops scientists from choosing different background
assumptions against which to interpret their observations. In
practice, scientists face some constraints in the selection of
background assumptions, based on cognitive values such as simplicity
and conservatism (resistance to revising deeply entrenched assumptions
on which many other beliefs depend). But with respect to questions
still under active investigation, these cognitive values rarely reduce
the scope for choice down to one option, and their interpretation and
weights are contestable in any event (geocentrism was overturned only
by overriding conservatism). Feminist empiricists conclude that, given
the scope for choice in background assumptions, no logical or
methodological principle categorically forbids scientists from
selecting their background assumptions on account of their fit with
social and political values, or indeed any other preference or
interest. It follows that feminist scientists may select their
background assumptions on account of their fit with feminist
values.</p>

<p>

Putnam (1981) has advanced a similar argument, carried to feminist
conclusions by Nelson (1993). Value judgments operate like factual
judgments in the web of belief, such that value judgments figure in
the background assumptions that support factual judgments, and
vice-versa. If the web of belief integrates judgments of fact and of
value, then there is no clear distinction between these two judgment
types. So there is no good argument against permitting feminist values
to shape scientific judgments.</p>

<p>

One must be careful not to overstate what the underdetermination
argument shows.  As Intemann (2005) argues, it does not show that
contextual value judgments are <em>needed</em> as background
assumptions in science. The underdetermination argument simply pries
open a <em>potential</em> space for social values in science. It is
not sufficient to demonstrate the legitimacy of any
<em>particular</em> ways of introducing feminist values into
science. Feminist science critics and feminist scientists agree that
there are cognitively illegitimate as well as cognitively legitimate
ways for social values to influence science. That is the basis for
distinguishing error-generating biases from biases that serve as
cognitive resources, a distinction required to dissolve the paradox of
bias. Standing alone, the underdetermination argument does not help us
discriminate one from the other. Additional criteria are needed.</p>

<p>

One lesson about what to look for can be drawn from earlier debates
over the theory-ladenness of observation. It is now generally agreed
that the theory-laden character of observations does not threaten
their status as evidence for a theory, provided that the theories
presupposed in those observations do not immediately include the very
theory being tested by those observations. Circularity, at least of a
narrow sort, should be avoided. Similarly, the chief danger of
value-laden inquiry is a kind of circularity of wishful thinking or
dogmatism (Anderson 2004). The value-laden character of the background
assumptions linking evidence to theories should not foreclose the
possibility of discovering that one's values are mistaken, because
(for example) they are based on erroneous beliefs about human
potentialities and the consequences of putting certain values into
practice. (Notice that it makes sense to worry about the danger of
wishful thinking only if the neutrality thesis is false.) If women
really can't do math, or their uteri really do migrate when they try
(causing hysteria, as the sexist theory held), the values incorporated
into feminist science should not close off this possibility in
advance. Although, in setting out to test these sexist hypotheses,
women scientists presuppose their own mathematical competence, this
does not preclude their discovering otherwise. They need only open
their calculations to public criticism to keep this possibility
alive.</p>

<p>

<strong>The Basic Pragmatic Strategy</strong>. The above reflections
provide a standard for determining when socially value-laden inquiry
has gone wrong. They do not explain what positive epistemic
influence they could have. How could they function as an epistemic
<em>resource?</em> Some feminist epistemologists at this point stress the
pragmatic functions of inquiry (Anderson 1995b). All inquiry begins
with a question. Questions may be motivated not only by the purely
cognitive interest of curiosity, but by various practical interests in
understanding the nature and causes of situations one judges to be
problematic, and in finding out how to improve those situations. The
resulting product of inquiry should therefore be shaped to these
practical-cum-cognitive interests. The pragmatic aspects of inquiry
introduce new dimensions of evaluation to theories. We can ask not only
whether the theories are backed by sufficient evidence to warrant their
acceptance, but whether they are cast in forms that are cognitively
accessible to the situated knowers who want to use these theories,
whether they are useful to these knowers (help them solve their
problems), and whether they answer the questions they were designed to
answer. A set of statements can be true, yet fail these pragmatic
tests.</p>

<p>

Even the staunchest defenders of the value-neutrality of science
acknowledge that pragmatic factors legitimately influence the choice of
objects of study. In this function, then, pragmatic interests,
including social and political values, are epistemic resources:
inquirers with different interests will study and make discoveries
about different aspects of the world. But the defenders of
value-neutral science contend that once inquirers decide where to cast
their flashlight, what gets lit up is determined entirely by the nature
of the world. Feminist epistemologists argue that the light of
practical interests penetrates more deeply into what is discovered than
this. Knowers (subjects) play a more active role in constituting the
object of knowledge than the flashlight metaphor suggests. (This is one
thing feminist epistemologists mean when they say they reject
“the subject-object dichotomy.”) “Constitution”
has two senses, representational and causal. In the representational
sense, knowers constitute the object of knowledge in choosing the terms
in which they represent it, and in defining the context in which it is
represented as operating. If knowing is like seeing, all seeing is a
form of “seeing as”—and different interests will
make us see the “same” things differently (Longino 1990).
This is a straightforward implication of the fact of situated knowing.
In the causal sense, some representations have a causal impact on what
is represented. When what we are representing is <em>ourselves</em>,
uptake of our self-representations will change who we are and what we
do. This follows from our agency, which is the determination to govern
ourselves by our self-understandings. This is sometimes what is meant
by the claim that subjects, or their identities, are “socially
constructed.”</p>

<p>

The basic pragmatic strategy for defending feminist science, or any
inquiry shaped by social and political values, is to show how the
pragmatic interests of that inquiry license or require a particular
mode of influence of values on the process, product, and uptake of the
product of inquiry, while at the same time leaving appropriate room for
evidence to play its warranting role. Values and evidence play
different, cooperative roles in properly conducted inquiry; values do
not <em>compete</em> with evidence for the determination of belief
(Anderson 1995b, 2004).</p>

<p>

<strong>A Catalog of Types of Legitimate Influence of Social Values in
Science.</strong> Feminist philosophers of science stress the variety
of roles for social and political values in science, and the
contingency of their effects (Wylie and Nelson 2007).  We must examine
how particular values operate in particular scientific investigations
and judge, on a case by case basis, whether they are closing off the
possibility of discovering unwelcome facts, leading scientists to
reason dogmatically, or insulating their findings from critical
scrutiny, or whether the values are enabling new discoveries. What
follows is a catalog of <em>types</em> of influence of social values
that feminist epistemologists and philosophers of science have argued
<em>may</em> legitimately influence theory choice (although whether
their influence is epistemically good or bad in a particular case
requires further investigation).</p>

<p>

<em>Selection and weighting of cognitive values</em>. Kuhn (1977)
argued that scientists need to appeal to cognitive values to take up
the slack between theory and evidence. His list of cognitive values
included accuracy (empirical adequacy or truth), scope, simplicity,
fruitfulness, internal consistency and consistency with other beliefs
(conservatism). As noted above, Longino (1994) argues that feminists
have reason to prefer theories that manifest other cognitive values,
such as diffusion of power. Diffusion of power, like simplicity, is
not a truth-oriented cognitive value. Both count as cognitive values
because they make theories cognitively accessible, comprehensible to
our finite minds. Diffusion of power recognizes that cognitive
accessibility is relative to the situation of the knower.  (Longino's
characterization of other values of feminist science, such as
ontological heterogeneity and complexity of relationship, as
“cognitive” values is something of a misnomer—these
fit better under the rubrics of classification and models, below.)
Both simplification and diffusion of power stand in tension with
truth, in that theories that embody them not only ignore many complex,
messy truths, but may even make false claims. Whether this is bad
depends on whether the truths ignored or the inaccuracies embraced are
<em>important</em>, and this can be judged only in relation to the
interests of the investigator, or the interests that the investigation
ought to serve. All legitimate research programs must seek to
incorporate the value of empirical adequacy, which requires at least
that theories try to <em>approximate</em> the truth. How much accuracy
this requires depends on how much the expected usefulness of the
knowledge will be compromised by larger margins of error. The
situation and pragmatic interests of the inquirer or of the potential
users of a theory may therefore legitimately affect the selection and
weighting of cognitive values in theory choice.</p>

<p>

<em>Standards of Proof</em>. By convention, social scientists reject
the null hypothesis (that observed results in a statistical study
reflect mere chance variation in the sample) only for P-values &lt; 5%,
an arbitrary level of statistical significance. Bayesians and others
argue that the level of statistical significance should vary, depending
on the relative costs of type I error (believing something false) and
type II error (failing to believe something true). In medicine,
clinical trials are routinely stopped and results accepted as genuine
notwithstanding much higher P-values, if the results are dramatic
enough and the estimated costs to patients of not acting on them are
considered high enough. (The cost of not providing a potentially
effective treatment may be death, while the cost of providing a useless
treatment may be small.) This practice explicitly incorporates social
value judgments in the standard of proof required before results are
accepted. Hare-Mustin and Maracek (1994) argue, by parallel reasoning,
that whether studies that find gender differences, or that fail to find
them, should be accepted depends on the relative costs of Alpha Bias
(exaggerating differences) and Beta Bias (neglecting differences) in
the context at hand.</p>

<p>

<em>Classification</em>. The ways observed phenomena are classified
may legitimately depend on the values of the researcher. In medicine,
the distinction between health and disease reflects moral judgments
about human welfare and appropriate ways of dealing with problems, as
well as judgments about causation. A condition regarded as bad for
human beings is not classified as a disease unless some kind of
medical therapy is considered both an appropriate and a potentially
effective way to deal with it. Feminist inquiries, too, raise
questions about the causes of women's oppression that require
classifying phenomena as instances of rape, sexual objectification,
sex discrimination, and so forth—classifications all tied to
their meeting both empirical and evaluative criteria (Anderson 1995a,
1995b).  In general, when the question being asked concerns
value-laden phenomena, such as the impact of certain practices on
human welfare, or whether certain institutions are fair or
discriminatory, the contours of the empirical phenomena to be studied
will be defined by evaluative judgments (Intemann 2001, 2005).</p>

<p>

<em>Methods</em>. The methods selected for investigating phenomena
depend on the questions one asks and the kinds of knowledge one seeks,
both of which may reflect the social interests of the investigator.
Experimental methods in social science may be good for discovering
factors that can be used to control people's behavior in similar
settings. But to grasp their behavior as <em>action</em>—that
is, as attempts by agents to govern their behavior through their
understandings of what they are doing—requires different empirical methods,
including qualitative interviews (which allow subjects to delineate
their own systems of meaning) and participant observation. Standpoint
theories, as critical theories, aim as well at empowering the subjects
of study by helping them forge liberatory self-understandings, and
these, too, may require different methods of inquiry—for
example, consciousness-raising (MacKinnon 1999).</p>

<p>

<em>Causal Explanations; Models; Explanations of Meaning;
Narratives</em>.  For most phenomena, the number of factors that have
a causal impact on their occurrence is vast—too large to
comprehend or test in a single model. Investigators must therefore
select a subset of causal factors to include in the models they
test. This selection may be based on considerations of cost or
availability—some types of data are hard or expensive to get;
cheap and accessible methods may be better suited to testing the
causal influence of some variables than others. The selection of
causal variables may also be based on fit with the social or personal
interests of the investigator (Longino 1990, 2001). These interests
often reflect background social and moral judgments of blame,
responsibility, and acceptability of change. To take an innocuous
case, in most contexts, what is singled out as a cause of dangerous
fires is a spark, flame, or flammable material, not the presence of
oxygen. The items judged possible to change, or worth changing, are
the focus of causal explanation. To take a more controversial case,
conservatives are more likely to study divorce and out-of-wedlock
birth as causes of women's poverty, whereas feminists are more likely
to focus on other causes—for example, the exclusion of women
from better-paid jobs, the weak bargaining power of women in marriage,
and norms of masculinity that induce fathers to avoid significant
participation in child-rearing, thereby forcing women to forego
earnings in taking up the slack. Notice that these causal explanations
are not incompatible. All the causal factors cited may contribute to
the feminization of poverty.  More subtly, normative interests may
determine whether one models only main effects or also interaction
effects on outcomes relevant to human welfare.  A variable--say, a
certain lifestyle--that has a positive main effect on a population
considered in aggregate may have a negative effect on certain minority
subpopulations.  Whether one models and tests for such effects may
depend on whether one believes that one lifestyle does or should fit
all, or whether one values pluralism and ontological heterogeneity
(Anderson 2004).</p>

<p>

Often what inquirers seek is not merely a set of facts, but what the
facts mean. The meaning or significance of
facts depends on their relations to other facts. Even if two inquirers
agree on the causal facts, they may still disagree about their meaning
because they relate the facts in different ways, reflecting their
background values. Feminists may agree with conservatives that divorce
is a cause of the feminization of poverty, but deny that this means
that women are better off married. They argue that marriage itself,
with its gendered division of domestic and market labor, constitutes
one of the major structural disadvantages women face, setting them up
for worse outcomes in the event of divorce (Okin 1989). Conservatives,
viewing marriage as an indispensable condition of the good life, are no
more willing to view marriage in this light than most people would be
willing to blame oxygen for the occurrence of house fires. It might be
thought that scientists should stick to the facts and avoid judgments
of meaning. But most of the questions we ask demand answers that fit
facts into larger, meaningful patterns. Scientists therefore cannot
help but tell stories, which require the selection of narrative
frameworks that necessarily go beyond the facts (Haraway 1989). This
selection may depend both on their fit with the facts and on their fit
with the background values of the storyteller.</p>

<p>

<em>Framework Assumptions</em>. As we ascend to higher levels of
abstraction, very general framework assumptions come into play in
constituting the object of study. Some of these are disciplinary.
Economics studies humans as self-interested, instrumentally rational
choosers. Social psychology studies humans as responding to socially
meaningful situations. Behaviorism studies humans as influenced by
objectively defined environmental variables. Behavioral genetics
studies humans as influenced by their genes. These are all forms of
“seeing as.” Longino (1990) and Tiles (1987) argue that the
selection of framework assumptions may depend on their fit with the
interests of the inquirer. Feminists are interested in promoting
women's agency, so they tend to prefer frameworks that permit the
representation of women as agents. This selection does not guarantee
that they will confirm the background assumption that women are agents.
Causal models that include only agentic variables may not explain much
of the variation in women's behavior; models that include both agentic
and nonagentic variables may find that the latter explain all of the
variation. The value-laden selection of framework assumptions need not
lead to a vicious circle of reasoning, because it is still left up to
the evidence to determine how successful the assumptions are in
explaining the phenomena of interest.</p>

<p>

<strong>Pluralism and naturalized moral epistemology as upshots of
value-laden inquiry.</strong> Because the interests and values of
inquirers vary, and inquirers select background assumptions in part
for their fit with their interests and values, their background
assumptions will also vary.  Rather than lamenting this fact, feminist
epistemologists urge us to embrace it (Haraway 1991, Harding 1998,
Longino 2001). A pluralism of theories and research programs should be
accepted as a normal feature of science—as it is in the human
sciences. As long as the different research programs are producing
empirical successes not produced by the others, and avoiding clear
error and viciously circular or dogmatic reasoning, there is good
reason to treat the value-biases animating them as epistemic
resources, helping us discover and understand new aspects of the world
and see them in new perspectives, rather than as obstacles to the
search for truth. Feminist science takes its place as one set of
legitimate research programs among others. This generates the disunity
of science, but does not imply relativism. Value-laden research
programs are still open to internal and external critique. A
naturalized epistemology that rejects neutrality allows that
observations may undermine any background assumptions, including value
judgments (Anderson 2004).</p>

<p>

One way to support this last claim is to advance Quinean holism, and
insist that any evidence may bear on any belief or value whatsoever
(Nelson 1990).  While accepting the bi-directional influence of facts
and values, Anderson (2004) rejects holism, arguing that some
observations bear closer relevance relations than others to specific
values.  Solomon (2012) agrees: that a certain metaphorical use of
feminist values is successful or not in an irrelevant scientific
domain--for example, non-hierarchical interactional models of
nucleus-cytoplasm functioning--has no bearing on the value of
non-hierarchical interaction in human societies.  Anderson's and
Solomon's arguments point to the undertheorization of values in
contemporary discussions of value-laden science.  Further progress in
understanding legitimate and fruitful interactions of facts and values
in scientific inquiry will likely involve naturalizing moral
epistemology, to get a clearer view of the bearing of observations on
values.  Tobin and Jaggar (2013) offer a promising way to naturalize
feminist moral epistemology, in ways attentive to relevance
relations.</p>

<h2><a name="object">7. Feminist Critiques and Conceptions of Objectivity</a></h2>

<p>

<strong>Feminist Critiques of Objectivity.</strong> Feminists regard
the following conceptions of objectivity as problematic: (a)
Subject/object dichotomy: what is really (“objectively”)
real exists independently of knowers. (b) Aperspectivity:
“objective” knowledge is ascertained through “the
view from nowhere,” a view that transcends or abstracts from our
particular locations. (c) Detachment: knowers have an
“objective” stance toward what is known when they are
emotionally detached from it. (d) Value-neutrality: knowers have an
“objective” stance toward what is known when they adopt an
evaluatively neutral attitude toward it.  (e) Control:
“objective” knowledge of an object (the way it
“really” is) is attained by controlling it, especially by
experimental manipulation, and observing the regularities it manifests
under control. (f) External guidance: “objective”
knowledge consists of representations whose content is dictated by the
way things really are, not by the knower. These ideas are often
combined into a package of claims about science: that its aim is to
know the way things are, independent of knowers, and that scientists
achieve this aim through detachment and control, which enable them to
achieve aperspectivity and external guidance. This package arose in
the 17th-18th centuries, as a philosophical account of why Newtonian
science was superior to its Scholastic predecessor. According to this
account, the predecessor science, which represented objects as
intrinsically possessing secondary qualities and ends, confused the
way things are in themselves with the ways they are related to
emotionally engaged human knowers, who erroneously projected their own
mental states and value judgments onto things. Adoption of the
objective methods listed above enabled the successor scientists to
avoid these errors and achieve an “absolute” conception of
the universe (Williams 1978). Feminists object to each element in this
package as a normative ideal and as a general description of how
science works.</p>

<p>

<em>Subject/object dichotomy</em>. If the object of science is to
grasp things as they are, independent of knowers, then it is important
to draw a sharp distinction between the knower and the
known. Feminists argue that the assumptions that science or
“objective” inquiry aims at, and achieves, such
“absolute” knowledge presupposes a problematic
ontology. When the objects of inquiry are knowers themselves, these
assumptions rule out the possibility that knowers' self-understandings
help constitute the ways knowers are. It therefore rules out the
possibility that some of our characteristics, such as our gender, are
socially constructed.  Ironically, these assumptions may lead people
to make the very projective errors the objectivity package is supposed
to avoid: attributing to the essential natures of the objects of study
what are actually products of people's contingent beliefs and
attitudes about those objects (Haslanger 1995).</p>

<p>

<em>Aperspectivity</em>. The ideal of aperspectivity is justified as
a means to achieve knowledge of the way things are, independently of
their relations to knowers. If one views things from no particular
position, without any presuppositions or biases, then the only thing
that guides belief-formation is the object itself (external guidance),
not the knower. Feminists question the intelligibility of a “view
from nowhere,” and a presuppositionless, bias-free science, for
both postmodernist (Haraway 1991) and pragmatist (Antony 1993) reasons.
Representations of the world reflect the interests, positions, and
biases of observers, and could hardly do otherwise, given that
scientific theories always go beyond the evidence offered for them.
Biases are necessary to get theorizing off the ground. Therefore, our
proper project should not be to give up on presuppositions or biases,
but to empirically study which biases are fruitful and which mislead,
and reform scientific practice accordingly, as naturalized epistemology
would recommend (Antony 1993). Some feminist critics argue that the
assumption of aperspectivity is not just an epistemological error. It
generates further errors in scientific theories of the world, which
have pernicious consequences for those occupying subordinate social
positions. In the most radical form of this critique, the practice of
objectivity—assuming that observed regularities reflect the
intrinsic natures of things, and treating those things
accordingly—when adopted by those in power, produces the very
regularities taken to vindicate that assumption. When male observers
exercise the power to make women behave in accordance with their
desires (for instance, to elicit female submission to their aggressive
sexual advances), but assume their own aperspectivity, they
misattribute the behavior to women's intrinsic natures (feminine
passivity) rather than to their own socially positioned power. The
androcentric projection of masculine desires onto women, posing as
aperspectival, constitutes an exercise of male power that causes women
to behave in accordance with men's wishes. This process constitutes the
“objectification” of women. It is harmful to women, because
it legitimates the same sexist practices that reinforce the projection,
in a morally vicious circle. And it is epistemically flawed, in that it
misrepresents the modality of observed regularities (as necessary,
rather than socially contingent), as well as their cause (as generated
by the intrinsic nature of the things observed, rather than by the
observer's own stance toward what is observed.) (MacKinnon 1999,
Haslanger 1993).</p>

<p>

<em>Detachment</em>. The ideal of objectivity as detachment,
according to which good scientists should adopt an emotionally
distanced, controlling stance toward their objects of study, is
defended as necessary to avoid projective error. Keller suggests that
it is responsible for the symbolically “masculine” standing
of science that marginalizes women in science (because women are
stereotyped as emotional). Moreover, it reflects an androcentric
perspective, in that it serves mens' neurotic anxieties about
maintaining sharp boundaries between self and other, and keeping the
“feminine” at arms-length (Keller 1985a, Bordo 1987). Other
criticisms of objectivity-as-detachment focus more on the epistemic
defects of emotional distance. A “feeling for the [individual]
organism” may sensitize a scientist to critical data (Keller
1983, Ruetsche 2004).</p>

<p>

<em>Value-neutrality</em>. The ideal of objectivity as
value-neutrality is justified as a psychological stance needed to guard
against temptations toward wishful thinking and dogmatic, politically
motivated or ideological reasoning. Feminists argue, on the basis of
historical and sociological investigations of the history and current
practice of science, that this insistence on the value-neutrality of
scientists is self-deceptive and unrealistic (Potter 1993, 2001;
Longino 1990, 2001; Harding 1991, 1998; Wylie 1996). Indeed, it is
self-defeating: when scientists represent themselves as neutral, this
blocks their recognition of the ways their values have shaped their
inquiry, and thereby prevents the exposure of these values to critical
scrutiny. Advocates of neutrality think the only influences of
evaluative presuppositions on science are pernicious. Feminists argue
that this stance ignores the many positive roles value judgments play
in guiding the process and products of inquiry noted above. Other
procedures are available to block the effects of wishful thinking and
political dogmatism on what claims science ultimately accepts, without
requiring scientists to bracket their value judgments (Anderson 1995, 2004,
Longino 2001).</p>

<p>

<em>Control</em>. Experimental contexts, in which scientists elicit
regularities in the behavior of the objects of study by manipulating
them under controlled conditions, are often taken to generate
epistemically privileged evidence about the objects of study. Such
evidence is thought to ground knowledge of how the objects
“really are”, in contrast with evidence about the objects
of study generated through “subjective” modes of
interaction with them, such as participant observation, dialogue,
political engagement, and caring for their needs. Feminists argue that
the stance of control is a stance of social, often specifically male, power.
The epistemic privilege it enjoys reflects both androcentrism (a male
point of view, misrepresented as universal) and the social prestige
attached to whatever is gender-symbolized as “masculine”
(Merchant 1980, Smith 1974). Such considerations do not provide
legitimate grounds for granting epistemic privilege to the stance of
control. At the same time, they underrate the epistemic value of
experiences gained from loving or cooperative engagement with the
objects of study. The chief feminist complaint against
objectivity-as-control is not that it grounds false theories, but that
the theories it produces generate only a partial view of the
potentialities of the objects of study, reflecting and serving
interests in control over the objects, but not interests in engaging
with the objects in other ways, or in enabling the objects of study, if
they are human, to govern themselves (Tiles 1987).</p>

<p>

<em>External guidance</em>. The ideal of external guidance assumes
that to achieve knowledge of the way things “objectively”
or “really” are, independent of knowers, one's beliefs must
be guided by the nature of the object, not by the presuppositions and
biases of the knower. Feminists argue that the contrast between
external and internal (“subjective”) guidance poses a false
dichotomy. The underdetermination of theories by evidence entails that
theories cannot be guided purely by the nature of the object. Inquirers
must make numerous, contingent choices along the way, concerning how to
conceive and represent the object of knowledge, what aspects of it to
study, how to interpret evidence concerning the object, and how to
represent the conclusions drawn (Longino 1990, Nelson 1990). The
pretense that sound scientific theories are the products of purely
external guidance obscures the forces shaping these choices and
absolves scientists from responsibility for defending them. For
example, feminists have paid particular attention to the ways choices
of metaphors and narrative genres constrain scientific explanations
(Haraway 1989, 1991). The decision to narrate the fertilization of egg
by sperm as a romance casts the sperm in an active role, and egg in a
passive one, obscuring the causal role of eggs in bringing about
fertilization (Martin 1996). Similarly, the decision to narrate the
transition from ape to hominid as a heroic drama dictates a focus on
presumptively male activities, such as hunting, as the engine of
evolution, obscuring less dramatic alternatives that are at least
equally supported by the data, but that focus on presumptively female
activity (balancing child care needs with gathering) or on behaviors,
such as language use, that are shared by both males and females
(Haraway 1989, Longino 1990).</p>

<p>

These feminist criticisms of different conceptions of objectivity
share some common themes. The problematic conceptions of objectivity
generate <em>partial</em> accounts of the world, which they
misrepresent as complete and universal. The forms of partiality they
underwrite are either androcentric (represent the world from a male
point of view), symbolized as “masculine,” or serve male
interests (or the interests of other dominant social positions). They
are justified by appealing to models of cognition that represent error
and bias in terms of qualities that are gender symbolized as
“feminine” and stereotypically attributed to women. Such
conceptions of objectivity, because they recommend avoidance of the
“feminine,” function to exclude women from participation in
inquiry or deprive them of epistemic authority. The problematic
conceptions of objectivity ignore the knowledge-enhancing,
epistemically fruitful uses of supposedly “feminine”
approaches to theorizing (e.g., uses of emotional engagement and
explicit attention to perspectival knowledge). By representing partial
perspectives as aperspectival and externally guided, these problematic
conceptions of objectivity induce systematic mistakes on the part of
those who embrace these conceptions. Ironically, the mistakes they
induce, such as projective error (mistaking qualities of the knower or
relations of knower to known for intrinsic qualities of the object
known) and partiality, are the very errors these conceptions of
objectivity are supposed to avoid. Moreover, these conceptions of
objectivity tend to prevent adherents from recognizing and correcting
these errors, and so tend to entrench them in scientific practice.</p>

<p>

<strong>Feminist Conceptions of Objectivity.</strong> The feminist
critiques of objectivity just surveyed identify errors and illegitimate
biases in inquiry, and therefore presuppose their own conceptions of
objectivity. Feminist epistemologists and philosophers of science avoid
ontological accounts (such as subject/object dichotomy), which define
objectivity in terms of an a priori idea of what counts as really real,
preferring to leave open to inquiry what sorts of entity exist.
Instead, feminist conceptions of objectivity are procedural. Products
of inquiry are more objective, the better they are supported by
objective procedures. Some of the more influential feminist conceptions
of objectivity include the following:</p>

<p>

<em>Feminist/nonsexist research methods</em>. Rather than offering a
comprehensive account of objectivity, some feminists have offered
methodological guidelines for avoiding the sexist and androcentric
errors and biases that feminists have identified in mainstream science.
Eichler (1988) offers an exemplary work of this kind, explaining how to
avoid androcentrism, overgeneralization, gender insensitivity, and
sexual double standards in research. More ambitiously, feminists have
sought research methods that embody feminist values—for example,
ensuring that gendered features of social phenomena are made salient
(Nielsen 1990, Reinharz 1992). Some theorists argue that feminism
requires controversial methodological standards, such as preferring
qualitative over quantitative methods, or not questioning female
subjects' own interpretations of their experiences (Stanley &amp; Wise
1983). But other feminist researchers vigorously contest such claims
(Greaves, Wylie &amp; Staff, 1995; Jayaratne &amp; Stewart 1991). Harding
(1987b) persuasively argues that there is no single feminist method;
doing science as a feminist requires that one be willing to adopt
various methods, depending on the question under investigation.</p>

<p>

<em>Emotional engagement</em>. Various feminist theorists have
stressed the epistemic fruitfulness of emotional engagement with the
object of study. Emotions serve critical epistemic functions in moral
and political inquiry, attuning observers to evaluatively relevant
features of the world (Jaggar 1989, Little 1995, Anderson 2004). In social scientific
inquiry more generally, emotional engagement with one's subjects of
study may be necessary both to elicit and interpret behaviors of
scientific interest. Ethnographers may need to win the trust of their
subjects to get them to open up, and to achieve a rapport with them to
understand what they are up to. Sympathetic identification with the
subjects of study may generate important criticisms of dominant
theories and significant rival hypotheses (Hrdy 1986). Keller (1985a)
has developed the idea of objectivity as (non-neurotic) emotional
engagement in her ideal of “dynamic objectivity.” Dynamic
objectivity utilizes a mode of perception based on loving attention
toward the object. Keller argues that it is superior to
objectivity-as-detachment, in that it does not express a neurotic need
to allay anxieties about maintaining the independence of the self by
dominating the object of study. Longino (1993b) has objected to
Keller's ideal on the ground that, even if it is true that dynamic
objectivity involves a less neurotic mode of interaction with the
world, this does not show that it is epistemically superior. Keller's
case study of Barbara McClintock's pathbreaking discovery of genetic
transposition (1983), represented as an exemplary manifestation of
dynamic objectivity, demonstrates the epistemic fruitfulness of loving
attention to the objects of study without fully answering Longino's
challenge. (It is one thing to demonstrate that a mode of engagement is
epistemically fruitful, another to demonstrate that it is epistemically
superior, across-the-board, to other modes of engagement).</p>

<p>

<em>Reflexivity</em>. Harding (1993) argues that the objectivity of
a representation is greater, the more reflexive is its process of
generation. Reflexivity demands that inquirers place themselves on the
same causal plane as the object of knowledge. They must make explicit
the social positions, interests, background assumptions, biases, and
other contingent, perspectival features of themselves that shaped the
questions, methods, interpretations, and modes of presentation of the
claims the knower accepts as knowledge. Reflexivity affirms the
partiality of representations without denying their possible claim to
truth. A representation can be true without being the whole truth about
the object represented. It enhances objectivity by avoiding a
narcissistic confusion of one's own partial perspective with a
comprehensive view, and by highlighting contingencies of representation
that could be questioned. Harding argues that inclusion of marginalized
groups into inquiry will improve reflexivity, because the marginalized
are more likely to notice and take issue with features of accepted
representations that are due to the unquestioned adoption of the
perspectives of the dominant. Democratic inclusion is therefore an
implication of reflexivity. Harding's ideal of “strong
objectivity” includes both reflexivity and democratic inclusion
as the key features of more objective processes of inquiry. She casts
this ideal as a reconfiguration of standpoint theory, because it
accords the standpoints of marginalized groups an indispensable role in
producing objective knowledge. However, strong objectivity does not
accord epistemic privilege to the standpoints of the oppressed,
considered by themselves. Rather, it prefers representation produced by
communities that include them over representations produced by
communities that exclude them.</p>

<p>

<em>Democratic discussion</em>. Longino (1990, 2001) has developed
most fully a conception of objectivity based on democratic discussion.
Her key idea is that the production of knowledge is a social
enterprise, secured through the critical and cooperative interactions
of inquirers. The products of this social enterprise are more
objective, the more responsive they are to criticism from all points of
view. This idea builds on a long tradition including J.S. Mill, Karl
Popper, and Paul Feyerabend (Lloyd 1997a). Feminists develop this
tradition by offering (i) a more articulate conception of “all
points of view,” stressing the influence of the social positions
of inquirers on the representations they produce; (ii) a more
empirically informed account of the social interactions characteristic
of different communities of inquiry (e.g., Potter 1993, 2001); (iii) a
greater stress on the importance of equality among inquirers. In
Longino's influential account, a community of inquirers is
objective—entitled to credit its products as knowledge—if
it: (1) offers public venues for the criticism of knowledge claims; (2)
responds to criticisms by changing its theories according to (3)
publicly recognized standards of evaluation; and (4) follows a norm of
equality of intellectual authority among its members. The requirement
of equality of intellectual authority secures the democratic
credentials of the theory. It is also its most criticized element,
given the need to recognize differences in expertise and competence
among inquirers. Advocates of the democratic discussion model of
objectivity have responded by refining the norm of equality so as to
distinguish legitimate differences of expertise and competence from
illegitimate exercises of social power to exclude some criticisms, such
as those emerging from disadvantaged social positions, from a serious
hearing (Anderson 1995c, Longino 2001).</p>

<p>

<strong>Pluralist Themes in Feminist Conceptions of
Objectivity.</strong> The conceptions of objectivity criticized by
feminists identify objectivity with a single point of view, the
“view from nowhere,” and dismiss all other points of view
as false or biased. Most feminist conceptions of objectivity
accommodate both methodological and theoretical pluralism. Different
communities of inquiry take an interest in different aspects of the
world, and develop various partial theories to satisfy varied
epistemic and pragmatic values. While no empirical theory can be
justified unless it is supported by evidence, the underdetermination
of theories by evidence permits the development of a plurality of
theories, each of which may claim its own successes. Most feminists
resist the thought that these varied theories, to the extent that they
contain truths, must eventually be unified into a single grand theory
of everything, based on a single observation language and a single set
of theoretical terms. As long as different communities of inquiry and
their associated theories are producing empirical successes in
accordance with publicly recognized standards, while holding
themselves accountable to criticism from all sides, their products may
each count as objective, however irreducibly plural the content of
their theories may be (Longino 2001, Harding 1991, 1998).  However,
Intemann (2011) questions the value of unlimited pluralism in the
Millian models of democratic science followed by Longino (1990) and
Solomon (2001).  If sexist and racist values have been found to be
unjustified after sustained inquiry, then scientific theories informed
by these values need not be funded or taken seriously.</p>

<h2><a name="auth">8. Epistemic Authority, Epistemic Injustice, Epistemologies of Ignorance, and Virtue Epistemology</a></h2>

<p>

Recent work in naturalized epistemology stresses our pervasive
epistemic interdependence (Nelson 1990).  Because inquiry is
collaborative and reliant on testimony, what we believe is influenced
by who we believe.  Who we believe depends on attributions of
epistemic authority, which rely on views or attitudes about people's
competence, expertise, epistemic responsibility, and trustworthiness.
Feminist epistemologists explore the ways gender and other
hierarchical social relations influence attributions of epistemic
authority, considering their impact on (1) general models of
knowledge; (2) the epistemic standing of knowers; (3) whose claims
various epistemic communities accept, and ought to accept, as
credible; and (4) how this affects the distribution of knowledge and
ignorance in society. Some of these effects amount to <em>epistemic
injustice</em> against members of subordinated groups. Some feminist
epistemologists have advanced conceptions of <em>virtue
epistemology</em> to remedy epistemic injustice and ignorance.</p>

<p>

<em>Epistemic Authority and General Models of Knowledge</em>.
Gendered ideas about epistemic authority can distort our general
models of knowledge.  Code (1991) argues that contemporary analytic
epistemology's core model of propositional knowledge implicitly
presupposes a male knower.  The instances of knowledge analytic
epistemology takes to be paradigmatic when it analyzes the formula
“S knows that P” are propositions about readily observable
mind-independent objects.  To take these as the paradigmatic instances
of knowledge invites a model of the knower as emotionally detached,
impersonally oriented to things rather than persons, and oriented in
an “objective” posture toward the object of knowledge.
These features of knowers are symbolically gendered masculine and
stereotypically attributed to men.  This fact, in conjunction with the
cultural representation of masculinity and femininity as opposed and
mutually exclusive, implicitly denies epistemic authority to women.
Code argues that knowledge of other persons rather than of
propositions should be taken as a primary model of knowledge.  Such
second-person knowledge calls the implicit masculinity of knowers into
question, since getting to know others typically requires intimacy,
dialogue, empathy and other characteristics that are gender symbolized
as “feminine.”</p>

<p>

While Code's proposal has not been generally followed, recent
epistemology's focus on the indispensability of testimony to inquiry
has led feminist epistemologists to take Code's ideas in a different
direction, by investigating the dependence of propositional knowledge
on knowledge of persons.  This dependence is evident in anthropology,
where inquirers face an alien world that they initially lack the
conceptual resources to interpret.  Anthropologists must cultivate
personal relationships of trust with native informants to gain access
to the natives' situated knowledge of their cultures.  This requires
reflection on the ways differences in power, interest, and social
situation between the anthropologist and his or her informants
influence the testimony elicited in personal interaction and its
interpretation.  Feminist epistemologists question models of testimony
as a transparent and unidirectional transmission of objective
information, highlighting instead testimony's dialogic, strategic, and
empathetic features, as well as the importance and difficulty of
cultivating epistemically fruitful relations of mutual trust across
differences in power (Bergin 2002; Lugones 1987).</p>

<p>

<em>Epistemic Injustice</em>. Other feminist epistemologists focus on
the impact of gender and other hierarchical social relations on the
epistemic authority accorded to knowers.  Dominant groups tend to
accord epistemic authority to themselves and withhold it from
subordinates by constructing stigmatizing stereotypes of subordinates
as incompetent or dishonest.  They promote, as external markers of
epistemic authority, characteristics they have, or are stereotypically
supposed to have (such as a gentleman's sense of honor or an
“educated” accent), that subordinates lack or are
stereotypically supposed to lack (Addelson 1983; Shapin 1994).  They
also hoard opportunities for gaining access to these markers—for
instance, by denying subordinate groups access to higher
education. Such power-distorted practices of assigning epistemic
authority commit an epistemic injustice against members of subordinate
groups, undermining their ability to participate in collaborative
inquiry.  Fricker (2007) calls this “testimonial
injustice.” The core case of testimonial injustice occurs when
people discount the credibility of what others say on account of
prejudice against their social group.  Dotson (2011) distinguishes two
kinds of testimonial injustice, silencing and smothering.  In
silencing, the audience unjustly denies or discounts the speaker's
testimony, due to systematic, prejudicial ignorance against the
speaker's identity. In smothering, the speaker silences or limits her
testimony out of recognition that the audience is liable to discount
or misunderstand it, due to their prejudicial ignorance, and that
their misunderstanding is likely to be harmful to her or her identity
group.  For example, women of color victimized by domestic violence
are often reluctant to testify to whites about this, because such
testimony is liable to reinforce white prejudices against black
men. Hookway (2010) identifies an injustice analogous to testimonial
injustice in practices that exclude people from participating in
inquiry more generally.  Such participation need not take the form of
offering testimony, but may involve other acts such as asking
questions, suggesting hypotheses, raising objections, and drawing
analogies.  When others fail to take such contributions seriously out
of prejudicial stereotyping of the contributor, this is also an
injustice. It injures the speaker not as a knower but as an
inquirer.</p>

<p> 

Additional types of epistemic injustice follow from or are akin to
testimonial injustice.  <em>Hermeneutical injustice</em> occurs when
the interpretive resources available to a community render a person's
experiences unintelligible or misunderstood, due to the epistemic
marginalization of that person or members of her social group from
participation in practices of meaning-making (Fricker 2007).  An
example of hermeneutical injustice is the dismissal of women as
humorless or hypersensitive for getting upset at what was seen as mere
cloddish courtship or joking, before the concept of sexual harassment
was available to make sense of their experiences.  This was an
injustice because the victims of harassment were prejudicially denied
effective access to the practices of meaning-making whereby they could
have made their experiences intelligible to others.  Mason (2011)
argues that marginalized communities may well have developed
hermeneutical resources within which their oppression is understood as
such.  Hermeneutical injustice could still obtain if the dominant
community fails to take up these resources by according epistemic
authority to the marginalized, but rather sustains its ignorance
through its cultivation of its own inadequate hermeneutical resources.
Pohlhaus (2011) argues that such ignorance can be willful, leading to
a type of hermeneutical injustice that Dotson (2012) defines as
<em>contributory injustice</em>, an intentional maintenance of
inadequate hermeneutical resources that harmfully obstructs the uptake
of resources the oppressed have developed to make sense of their
experience.  </p>

<p>

<em>Epistemologies of Ignorance.</em> Recent work in social
epistemology has taken up ignorance as an important subject of study,
as something that has systematic patterns and social-structural
causes.  As the above discussion indicates, feminist epistemologists
tie ignorance to epistemic injustice.  Injustice in according people
status as knowers and inquirers generates systematic ignorance that
damages the interests of subordinated groups.  Some ignorance involves
forgetting or suppressing particular facts.  For example, society
could have access to, but forget or suppress, knowledge useful to
subordinated groups--for example, about the anatomy and role of the
clitoris in women's sexual enjoyment (Tuana 2006), or about tropical
plants that are effective abortifactants (Schiebinger 2007).  It also
could forget or suppress knowledge about its own injustices.  For
example, white Americans persist in imagining the history of the
“frontier” as empty land waiting to be settled, erasing
the memory of repeated ethnic cleansing of Native Americans (Mills
2007).  Since accurate information on such important matters is or
once was available, some explanation is needed for why it is ignored
or forgotten.  In some cases, ignorance can be traced to segregation
of situated knowers, preventing knowledge or understandings held by
subordinate groups from disseminating to others (Margonis
2007). Members of subordinated groups may have strategic,
self-protective interests in hiding knowledge about themselves from
dominant groups (Bailey 2007).  Most importantly, dominant groups have
interests in avoiding the truth about their own injustices (Mills
2007).  They could even willfully cultivate hermeneutical ignorance,
so that they cannot grasp the claims of the oppressed.  The varieties
of ignorance and mechanisms for generating and maintaining it are
areas of active investigation (Pohlhaus 2011, Proctor &amp;
Schiebinger 2008, Sullivan &amp; Tuana 2007, Tuana &amp; Sullivan
2006).</p>

<p>

Feminist epistemologists offer various responses to the problem of
power-distorted assignments of epistemic authority.  Bar On (1993)
argues that claims to speak and be given a serious hearing need to be
detached from claims to epistemic authority.  While agreeing with Bar
On that the original claim of feminist standpoint theory to epistemic
privilege must be abandoned, Janack (1997) and Fricker (1999) argue
that we cannot avoid judgments of epistemic authority; hence our task
must be to reconfigure the norms for ascribing epistemic authority
more justly.</p>

<p>

<em>Virtue epistemology</em>. Some feminist epistemologists have
advanced conceptions of epistemic virtue to address epistemic
injustice.  Fricker (2007) argues that to correct for testimonial
injustice, hearers need to cultivate the virtue of epistemic justice,
which she characterizes as a disposition, rooted in one's testimonial
sensibility or second-nature perception of others' credibility, to
neutralize the effects of prejudicial stereotypes that would otherwise
influence one's credibility judgments.  Jones (2002) proposes specific
rules for checking such biases when confronted with testimony one
finds astonishing.  These include undertaking independent assessments
of the credibility of the witness and the plausibility of what they
say; and letting the presumption against accepting some astonishing
testimony be rebutted when one has good reason to distrust one's
distrust of the witness.  Alcoff (2010) suggests that correcting for
testimonial injustice requires the adoption of standpoint
epistemology: what is needed is not merely neutralizing prejudice, but
actively according epistemic privilege to the marginalized.  Rolin
(2009) and Code (2008) point out that doing so requires not just
unilateral adjustment of credibility estimates by hearers, but
empowerment of speakers and advocacy on their behalf. Kwong (2015)
stresses the virtue of open-mindedness, and Daukas (2011) of
trustworthiness, while Townley (2006) and Sholock (2012) explore the
importance of the dominant being disposed to acknowledge their own
ignorance of the situated knowledge and perspectives of the oppressed,
so that they seek the latter's testimony, and extend trust and
epistemic authority to them.</p>

<p>

Some theorists have questioned suggestions to remedy epistemic
injustice with individual virtues (Bohman 2012).  We must share
responsibility for devising epistemic practices of resistance to
epistemic injustice (Medina 2013).  Even a structural conception of
remedies does not preclude the use of virtue epistemology to address
structural epistemic injustice, as long as epistemic institutions and
systems can be bearers of epistemic virtue (Anderson 2012).  Such
reflections may point back to structural reforms such as
institutionalized practices of inclusion and democracy across domains
of inquiry.  Investigation of the nature and causes of epistemic
injustice and ignorance, and remedies for it, is one of the most
active areas of feminist epistemology today. </p>

<h2><a name="trends">9. Trends in Feminist Epistemology:  Interactions of Standpoint Theory, Postmodernism, and Empiricism</a></h2>

<p> When Harding (1986) proposed her classification of feminist
epistemologies into empiricism, standpoint theory, and postmodernism,
she cast them as offering three fundamentally contrasting frameworks.
Trends in feminist epistemology in the last twenty-five years have
blurred the distinctions among feminist empiricism, standpoint theory,
and feminist postmodernism—trends Harding herself both predicted
and promoted (1990, 1991, 1998).  Early theorizing in feminist
epistemology tended to explore global questions about gender and
knowledge: are dominant conceptions or practices of science,
objectivity, and knowledge masculine or androcentric? Do men and women
have different cognitive styles manifested in different orientations
to knowledge?  The field has steadily evolved toward local
investigations of the varieties of ways gender is implicated in
knowledge practices in specific subject matters, among particular
communities of inquiry, using distinct methods. This turn to the local
has facilitated the convergence of the three types of feminist
epistemology.</p>

<p>

<a name="supercede"><em>Feminist standpoint theory</em></a>. The
postmodernist critique of standpoint theory, in conjunction with the
proliferation of subaltern women's standpoints (black, Latina,
lesbian, postcolonial, etc.) has led most standpoint theorists to
abandon the search for a single feminist standpoint that can claim
overarching epistemic superiority. They have rather moved in a
pluralistic direction, acknowledging a multiplicity of epistemically
informative situated standpoints of different, intersecting
marginalized groups (Harding 1991, 1998; Collins 1990).  A system of
knowledge that draws on their insights and starts from their
predicaments will be richer than one that draws only on the insights
and starts from the predicaments of privileged groups alone (Harding
1993, 1998). One way of understanding this claim is methodological:
thinking from subaltern standpoints is more <em>fruitful</em> than
confining one's thinking to dominant perspectives.  This shifts the
privilege claimed on behalf of subaltern standpoints from the context
of justification to the context of discovery. Another way to
understand the claim is in terms of pragmatic advantages: thinking
from these standpoints enables us to envision and realize more just
social relations (Hartsock 1996). Shifting from claims of general
epistemic privilege in access to truth to claims of practical
advantage in discovering morally or politically significant truths has
been a key strategy defenders of standpoint theory (Collins 1996;
Harding 1996; Hartsock 1996) have used against postmodernist critics
such as Hekman (1996). Wylie (2003) demonstrates that a consensus has
emerged among feminist epistemologists on two points: (1) a rejection
of essentialism (the idea that the social groups defining any
standpoint have a necessary and fixed nature, or that their members do
or ought to think alike) and (2) a rejection of attempts to grant
automatic epistemic privilege to any particular standpoint.  Instead,
Wylie stresses how the social situation of
“insider-outsiders” (members of disadvantaged groups who
need accurate knowledge of the worlds of the privileged to navigate
them successfully) can sometimes afford a <em>contingent</em>
epistemic privilege or advantage in solving particular problems.
Thus, standpoint theorists' focus on pluralism reflects a productive
interaction with feminist postmodernism; their shift toward
pragmatism, experience, and contingent epistemic advantages of the
disadvantaged reflects a position convergent with feminist
empiricism.</p>

<p>

In recent years theorists have devoted considerable effort to
precisely identifying particular contingent cognitive advantages that
may be afforded by the adoption of a feminist standpoint.  The focus
is on specifying the claim of epistemic advantage with sufficient
precision that it could be empirically testable, or at least open up
areas in which plausible empirical hypotheses of epistemic advantage
could be tested.  Thus, Solomon (2009) suggests that the achievement
of a feminist standpoint involves characteristics that have been
empirically associated with creative thinking; Ruetsche (2004) that it
could involve Aristotelian second-nature capacities to recognize
certain kinds of evidence—for example, social interactions among
primates—relevant for understanding primate social organization.
Other standpoint theorists have stressed the cognitive advantages of a
feminist standpoint for revealing and uncovering phenomena in domains
of interest to feminists.  Rolin (2009) points to the superior
capacity of a feminist standpoint to reveal how power relations
obscure their operations and effects, and enable inquirers to overcome
these obstacles to understanding by empowering those subordinated by
power relations (for example, by means of consciousness
raising). Scientists who have investigated the causes of women's
underrepresentation in the sciences from a feminist standpoint have
produced more empirically adequate theories, using more normatively
adequate conceptions of bias and discrimination, than nonfeminist
researchers (Rolin 2006, Wylie 2009).</p>

<p>

<em>Feminist postmodernism</em>. Wariness of the fractionating and
centrifugal forces in postmodernism has led some feminists sympathetic
to postmodernism to seek middle, more stable grounds that feminist
empiricists, standpoint theorists, and postmodernists can share.
Haraway (1989) stands out among feminist postmodernists for the
tributes she pays to the achievements of feminist scientists working
within empiricist standards of evaluation. She also seeks to
reconstruct ideas of objectivity and epistemic responsibility
consistent with situated knowledge (1991). Fraser (1995) and Fraser
&amp; Nicholson (1990) also urge a reformulation of the lessons of
postmodernism, toward pragmatism, fallibilism, and contextualization of
knowledge claims—all features fully compatible with naturalized
feminist empiricism—as against categorical rejections of
large-scale social theory, history, normative philosophy, and even
humanist values.</p>

<p>

<em>Feminist empiricism</em>. While early, nonphilosophical feminist
science criticism by working scientists may have presupposed a naive
version of empiricism, attempts by feminist epistemologists to make
sense of feminist science criticism have, following Quine,
incorporated explicitly pragmatist and naturalizing themes into
feminist empiricism.  Thus, feminist empiricists today stress the
centrality of situated knowledge, the interplay of facts and values,
the absence of transcendental standpoints, and the plurality of
theories. These themes converge with those of postmodernism.  The
femininist empiricist commitment to revealing the varieties of ways
gender operates in particular domains has also converged with feminist
standpoint theorists' recent emphasis on identifying local,
contingent, empirically testable cognitive advantages supplied by
various versions of a feminist standpoint.</p>

<p>

After twenty-five years of development, it is getting harder to
identify points of disagreement between feminist empiricism and
feminist standpoint theory. Intemann (2010) argues that different
views about the role of values in promoting objectivity persist.
Feminist empiricists stress how value pluralism within the scientific
community enables the exposure and critical scrutiny of unexamined
background assumptions and multiplication of potentially fruitful
hypotheses.  Feminist standpoint theorists argue that better values
produce better theories.  Intemann argues that feminist empiricists
should accept the value claim of standpoint theory.  Feminist
empiricists have already done so, as long as these claims are kept
contingent and local (Anderson 2004, Wylie and Nelson 2007).  Some
feminist standpoint theorists, however, deny that inclusion of
antifeminist standpoints, or bad values, can be epistemically
justified (Intemann 2010, 2011, Hicks 2011).</p>

<h2><a name="crit">10. External Criticisms of Feminist Epistemology</a></h2>

<p>

Outside critics of feminist epistemology have argued that the entire
research program is flawed at its foundations.  Leading critiques of
feminist epistemology include a collection of essays in the
<em>Monist</em>, 77(4) (1994), Gross and Levitt (1994), Haack (1993),
and Pinnick, Koertge and Almeder (2003).  The most important criticism
of feminist epistemology, found in all these works, is that it
corrupts the search for truth by conflating facts with values and
imposing political constraints on the conclusions it will accept.
Truths inconvenient to a feminist perspective will be censored, and
false views promoted because they support the feminist cause.  In a
closely allied charge, also found in these works, critics accuse
feminist epistemologists of a corrosive cynicism about science,
claiming that they reject it wholesale as a raw imposition of
patriarchal and imperialist power.  Feminist epistemologists are said
to hold that there are no objective standards of truth and that
beliefs are governed by the struggle for political power.  On this
account, feminists are seen as holding that, since everyone else is
engaged in a cynical power-play, they may as well join the battle and
try to impose their beliefs on everyone else.</p>

<p>

Defenders of feminist epistemology reply that these criticisms depend
on serious misreadings of the feminist research program.  Feminists do
not reject objectivity and science, but rather seek to improve it by
correcting sexist and androcentric biases in scientific inquiry, and
by promoting criticism of research from all points of view (Lloyd
1995a, 1995b, 1997a, 1997b, Nelson 1990).  Nor do they deny that
science as currently constituted discovers genuine truths.  The
complaint is rather that, as dominantly practiced, it offers a
<i>partial</i> view of the world that is primarily oriented to
discovering those truths that serve particular human interests in
material control and maintaining current social hierarchies (Harding
1986, 1998, 1993; Tiles 1987). Feminist epistemologists observe that
the democratic and egalitarian norms for cognitive authority they
accept, along with their requirement that the scientific community be
open and responsive to criticism from all quarters, are incompatible
with censorship of evidence, argument, or conclusions on political
grounds, and with ignoring or suppressing evidence that undermines any
theory, including theories inspired by feminist values (Longino 1990,
1993a, 2001; Anderson 2004—see Other Internet Resources).
Although facts and values are intertwined, attention to values does
not displace or compete with regard for the evidence (Anderson
1995b).</p>

<p>

A second major charge outside critics make against feminist
epistemology is that it accepts traditional stereotypes about women's
thinking (as intuitive, holistic, emotional, etc.) and uncritically
valorizes these stereotypes.  Yet there
is no evidence that women all do think alike or that thinking in a
“feminine” way reliably leads to truth.  Acceptance of conventional
stereotypes about women also puts unjust pressure on women who think
otherwise to conform to feminine cognitive styles. (Haack 1993).
Valorization of “feminine” ways of thinking may also trap women in
traditional gender roles and help justify patriarchy (Nanda 2003).
Promotion of feminist epistemology may carve out a limited “separate
sphere” for female inquirers, but one that will turn into an
intellectual ghetto, much as female scholars in an earlier era were
largely confined to “feminine” fields such as home economics and
nursing (Baber 1994).</p>

<p>

Defenders of feminist epistemology reply that the critics are
attacking an obsolete version of feminist epistemology that was only
briefly—and even at the time, controversially—entertained when the
field was launched in the 1980s (Wylie 2003, Anderson 2004—see
Other Internet Resources).  It has since been
 <a href="#supercede">superceded</a>, for many of the
reasons the critics have articulated, plus others arising from the
critiques of black and Latina feminists and feminist
postmodernists.</p>

<p>

Further development of external critiques of feminist epistemology
awaits the critics' engagement with the feminist epistemology's
defenders and with current developments in the field.</p>
