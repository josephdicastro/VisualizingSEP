<h1>Publicity</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Wed Jan 12, 2005; substantive revision Fri Aug 4, 2017</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
Publicity can be opposed both to privacy and to secrecy. This entry
will mostly be dealing with the latter meaning. In everyday life,
calls for more transparency or openness in political and economic life
may seem rather uncontroversial. Still, the precise reasons why and
the extent to which publicity should be guaranteed are not
straightforward. Moral and political philosophers, along with social
scientists, have until now provided us with only fragmentary elements
in this respect. We shall review here what has been gathered so
far.</p>

<p>
This entry unfolds in three parts. We start with <em>hypothetical</em>
publicity, and singularly with Immanuel Kant’s publicity test,
contrasting his position with the one of Henry Sidgwick and looking
both at the justification and implications of the Kantian test
 (<a href="#HypoPubl">§1</a>).
 More precisely, our focus in this first part will be on two
questions. First, what (if anything) justifies the importance of this
test? Second,what are its implications for moral and political
philosophy in general and for actual publicity in particular?
Hypothetical publicity may appear to some readers as the only
genuinely philosophical development on publicity, which justifies 
why we will examine it first.</p>

<p>
We then look more closely at <em>actual</em> publicity, focusing on
two moments of our political life (voting and deliberation) and two of
its actors (citizens and representatives)
 (<a href="#ActuPubl">§2</a>).
 Authors such as John Stuart Mill and Jon Elster will be our guides
here. Secret ballots have not always been the rule. Hence, shifting
away from open vote gave rise to fascinating debates, especially in
the British 19th century. We then move to the analysis of reasons for
and against public deliberation, Elster’s argument from the civilizing
force of hypocrisy being our starting point here. At least two central
questions should be kept in mind while reading this second part of the
entry. First, are the arguments in favor of open/secret voting
different from those in favor of open/secret deliberation? Second, how
much weight should be attached, in philosophical arguments about
publicity, to empirical claims, and have philosophers paid enough
attention to relevant empirical complexities?</p>

<p>
In the third section, we introduce the reader to a few
dimensions of the concept of publicity as it is used in John Rawls’s
work. As for many other questions, Rawls has revived the topic. The
ideas of “public rules” and “public reason”
have now become important in political philosophy. We shall briefly
present and discuss them.</p>

<h2 id="HypoPubl">1. Hypothetical Publicity</h2>

<h3 id="KantHypoPublTest">1.1 Kant’s Hypothetical Publicity Test</h3>

<p>
Kant’s hypothetical publicity test appears in the second appendix to
his <em>Zum ewigen Frieden</em> (<em>Perpetual Peace</em>) (1795
[1923:  381]).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-1" id="ref-1">1</a>]</sup>
 He writes:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
All actions relating to the right of other human beings are wrong if
their maxim is incompatible with
 publicity.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-2" id="ref-2">2</a>]</sup></p>
 </blockquote>

<p>
There are at least three interesting issues here. First, what is the
justification for such a publicity test? Is there any reason to
suspect any connection between the ability to stand publicity and the
rightness of a position? Second, which maxims of action and, more
generally, which moral theories are likely not to pass such a
publicity test? Third, what does this test entail with regard to the
need for <em>actual</em> publicity? Answering each of these questions
requires some degree of hermeneutics, especially when it comes to
inferring the meaning of words such as “incompatible” and
“publicity”.</p>

<p>
Some interpretation issues can be quickly disposed of. <em>First</em>,
the Kantian test applies specifically to <em>political</em> maxims and
is the equivalent in that sphere of the more general categorical
 imperative.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-3" id="ref-3">3</a>]</sup>
 This is why Kant refers to it as the “transcendental principle
of the publicity of public law” (1795 [1923: 382]).
<em>Second</em>, it is plausible to read the Kantian test as a merely
<em>negative</em> one: whether a maxim would pass the test only means
that one necessary condition for its rightness has been satisfied. It
will therefore not be sufficient to guarantee that all successful
maxims are right. This is suggested both by the expression
“wrong if” and by Kant’s explicit statement: “this
principle is, furthermore, only negative, i.e., it only serves for the
recognition of what is not just to
 others”.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-4" id="ref-4">4</a>]</sup>
 Such a reading entails a difference with the categorical imperative
insofar as the latter is a necessary <em>and sufficient</em> condition
for permissibility. <em>Third</em>, it is also clear from the
principle that neither an action itself, nor the actual motives
underlying such an action (Davis 1991: 418) need to be able to be
successfully disclosed in order to guarantee that they are not wrong.
The test only applies to the <em>maxim</em> of such an action, which
already indicates one respect in which such a hypothetical test could
possibly leave room for actual secrecy. This is true notwithstanding
the plausibility of Luban’s following claim: </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
the best way to make sure that officials formulate policies that
<em>could</em> withstand publicity is by increasing the likelihood
that policies <em>will</em> withstand publicity (Luban 1996:
 157).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-5" id="ref-5">5</a>]</sup></p>
 </blockquote>

<p>
Now, what does Kant mean when he uses the word
“publicity”? Were we to face an <em>actual</em> public, we
could give it a more or less demanding interpretation, ranging from
merely general knowledge (each of us actually knows or is able to
know) or mutual knowledge (each of us knows, and knows that the others
know), to critical debate where what we know is being actively
discussed (Luban 1996: 169–172). The latter form of publicity,
while seeming much richer and appealing, probably does not fit the
Kantian
 text.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-6" id="ref-6">6</a>]</sup>
 It could itself be understood in two ways. Either, publicity would be
taken as a synonym of <em>debateability</em>, i.e., the fact that the
maxim be such as to be deemed minimally appropriate for public
discussion, in which case the test would probably not exclude much.
Were it alternatively to be taken as referring to the ability of a
maxim to pass the filter of <em>actual</em> public debate and be
accepted by its participants, the test would then have a very
contingent outcome, depending on the real public we are facing.</p>

<p>
In fact, we can try to ascertain whether publicity should be
understood as general knowledge, mutual knowledge, or publicity as the
outcome of public
 debate.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-7" id="ref-7">7</a>]</sup>
 What matters much more however, in the context of understanding the
nature of the Kantian test, is that Kant is referring to an <em>ideal
and rational</em> public (Davis 1992:
 180f.).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-8" id="ref-8">8</a>]</sup>
 The test is thus hypothetical, not only because it does not
necessarily require <em>actual</em> publicity (as we shall see), but
also because any outcome of actual publicity would inevitably remain
at best a rough approximation of what the test would lead us to with
an ideal
 public.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-9" id="ref-9">9</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
With this reference to an ideal and rational public in mind, we may
then proceed with the interpretation of the concept of
<em>incompatibility</em> (Luban 1996: 172–176; Davis 1992: 170).
The two notions should be understood jointly as Kant’s following quote
demonstrates: </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
A maxim which I cannot divulge without defeating my own purpose must
be kept secret if it is to succeed; and, if I cannot publicly avow it
without inevitably exciting universal opposition to my project, the
necessary and universal opposition which can be foreseen a priori is
due only to the injustice with which the maxim threatens everyone
(1795 [1924: 381]). </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The idea of <em>necessary</em> opposition present here can hardly make
sense if it is not used with reference to an <em>ideal</em> public.
Now, in order to give substance to what such an incompatibility could
mean more precisely, let us briefly turn to Sidgwick’s views on covert
utilitarianism before coming back to Kant.</p>

<h3 id="SidgCoveUtil">1.2 Sidgwick on Covert Utilitarianism</h3>

<p>
As we shall see in
 <a href="#ActuPubl">Section 2</a>,
 classical utilitarians such as Bentham and especially John S. Mill
were rather sympathetic to the idea of publicity. Still, it is also
among utilitarians that we find one of the strongest principled
defenses of secrecy. Sidgwick defends the idea that it may be
necessary for utilitarianism to go under cover, and that this does not
have to be considered unjust. In his <em>Methods of Ethics</em>
(1874), he writes:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
[…] on Utilitarian principles, it may be right to do and
privately recommend, under certain circumstances, what it would not be
right to advocate openly; it may be right to teach openly to one set
of persons what it would be wrong to teach to others; it may be
conceivably right to do, if it can be done with comparative secrecy,
what it would be wrong to do in the face of the world; and even, if
perfect secrecy can be reasonably expected, what it would be wrong to
recommend by private advice or example […]. Thus the
Utilitarian conclusion, carefully stated, would seem to be this; that
the opinion that secrecy may render an action right which would not
otherwise be so should itself be kept comparatively secret; and
similarly it seems expedient that the doctrine that esoteric morality
is expedient should itself be kept esoteric. Or if this concealment be
difficult to maintain, it may be desirable that Common Sense should
repudiate the doctrines which it is expedient to confine to an
enlightened few. And thus a Utilitarian may reasonably desire, on
Utilitarian principles, that some of his conclusions should be
rejected by mankind generally; or even that the vulgar should keep
aloof from his system as a whole, in so far as the inevitable
indefiniteness and complexity of its calculations render it likely to
lead to bad results in their hands. (Sidgwick 1874 [1893:
487–489])</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
As in the Kantian case, Sidgwick not only deals with secret actions,
but with the secrecy of doctrines underlying such actions. Two of his
points are worth stressing. <em>First</em>, the relative
confidentiality of a given practice or—more importantly for
us—of its maxim may not only be acceptable, but may even be a
<em>necessary</em> condition for the moral acceptability of such a
practice—which is then the reverse of what Kant defends.
Utilitarians may indeed consider some practices acceptable on the
condition that they remain marginal. And keeping such practices
confidential may be required for them not to spread around. Secrecy
would thus not only be <em>allowed</em> in this case. It would also be
<em>required</em>. <em>Second</em>, there is a doctrine of
<em>meta-secrecy</em> at play as well, as Sidgwick’s argument applies
on top of actions to both maxims and meta-maxims. For him, the very
idea that utilitarianism may allow and even require such covert
actions should itself be kept relatively secret. As Luban puts it,
</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
not only is it best if utilitarianism is not widely believed, but it
is best if the very fact that the belief in utilitarianism has been
suppressed by the “enlightened few” is not widely
believed. This is no longer Government House utilitarianism. It is
conspiratorial utilitarianism (Luban 1996: 167). </p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="SidgKantExam">1.3 Sidgwick’s and Kant’s Examples</h3>

<h4 id="SidgCeliLyin">1.3.1 Sidgwick on Celibacy and Lying</h4>

<p>
With the aim of identifying the exact implications of Kant’s and
Sidgwick’s views, let us look first more closely at the examples they
actually provide in the course of their discussion. We shall begin
with Sidgwick who contrasts two cases: lying and
 celibacy.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-10" id="ref-10">10</a>]</sup>
 The argument unfolds as follows. <em>First</em>, some types of
behavior are morally acceptable only provided that they remain (very)
restricted in
 scope.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-11" id="ref-11">11</a>]</sup>
 If lying and celibacy were to become widely practiced, this would
become a problem for utilitarians, according to Sidgwick. However, as
long as they remain marginally practiced to an extent that is
justified on utilitarian grounds, they should be accepted.
<em>Second</em>, the question arises as to whether we should recognize
all this publicly. Albeit not raising any difficulty in the case of
 celibacy,<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-12" id="ref-12">12</a>]</sup>
 publicly abandoning an absolute prohibition on lying might not be
acceptable for utilitarians. Sidgwick writes:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
… assuming that general unveracity and general celibacy would
both be evils of the worst kind, we may still all regard it as
legitimate for men in general to remain celibate if they like, on
account of the strength of the natural sentiments prompting to
marriage, because the existence of these sentiments in ordinary human
beings is not affected by the universal recognition of the legitimacy
of celibacy: but we cannot similarly all regard it as legitimate for
men to tell lies if they like, however strong the actually existing
sentiment against lying may be, because as soon as this legitimacy is
generally recognized the sentiment must be expected to decay and
vanish (Sidgwick 1874 [1893: 486]).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
It is worth emphasizing that Sidgwick clearly states that the need for
secrecy in the case of lying arises only because we are dealing with a
general public that is <em>not</em> constituted of only enlightened
utilitarians. For Sidgwick considers that </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
if therefore we were all enlightened Utilitarians, it would be
impossible for any one to justify himself in making false statements
while admitting it to be inexpedient for persons similarly conditioned
to make them; as he would have no ground for believing that persons
similarly conditioned would act differently from himself (Sidgwick
1874 [1893: 486–487]; Piper 1978: 190f). </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
However, once we assume that we do <em>not</em> live in such an ideal
world populated by only enlightened utilitarians, we may want to
keep our complex moral rules secret in order to avoid
counterproductive consequences from an utilitarian perspective. Such
consequences may flow from various sources, such as a lack of time
(e.g., people spending too much time finding out what the fair action
would be), misunderstandings possibly due to inadequate cognitive
abilities (e.g., construing too broadly the class of cases in which
lying would be acceptable from a utilitarian point of view, leading to
a spread of lying) or from distrust towards utilitarianism (e.g.,
principles having a larger number of exceptions generating more doubts
about their cogency than elegant and exceptionless ones).</p>

<p>
Notice moreover the difference between the Sidgwickian argument, as
illustrated by these two examples, and another utilitarian argument
that would justify “self-effacement”, i.e., the idea that
to remain able to reach its goals, utilitarianism should go totally
undercover. In other words, even enlightened utilitarians should stop
being motivated by it. The argument is the following one: being
<em>motivated</em> by a utilitarian goal may impede our ability actually to
<em>reach</em> this very goal. For instance, truly believing
in the value of an artistic project independently of its ability to
bring about happiness is more likely to generate welfare maximization
than being motivated towards this project out of a commitment to
utilitarianism. In other words, a society committed to utilitarian
principles may well turn out to be a less happy one than a society
relying on a given set of common sense principles. If this is true, we
would not only have an argument, for “Government House
utilitarianism” (i.e., for utilitarian principles being relied
upon only by the enlightened few), or for its stronger
“meta-secrecy” version (of which a few enlightened would
still be aware). We would in fact have a case for something even more
radical: the full self-effacement of utilitarianism for utilitarian
reasons, i.e., even enlightened utilitarians would have to forget
about it if they are really committed
 utilitarians.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-13" id="ref-13">13</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
In short, Sidgwick’s argument explicitly refers to a
<em>non-ideal</em> public (“society as actually
constituted”, “mankind in general” or “the
vulgar”, as opposed to “an ideal community of enlightened
Utilitarians”). And his view then has to do with a logic of
confinement (necessary to preserve the practice’s acceptability)
requiring in cases such as legitimate lying—as opposed to
celibacy—a certain degree of concealment given the fact that
many of us are not enlightened utilitarians. In other words, several
of the reasons for secrecy that could underlie Sidgwick’s view on the
lying case would not apply if we were all enlightened utilitarians. It
is worth stressing however that, besides the
“self-effacement” argument, Piper has argued that there
may be utilitarian grounds for secrecy in an <em>ideal</em> community
of enlightened utilitarians as well. For knowing that in such a
society, e.g., promises <em>might</em> not necessarily be
kept—keeping them depending in each case on the outcome of a
utilitarian calculus—will cause significant
<em>coordination</em> problems due to lack of predictability of other
people’s action. In the absence of secrecy, such an ideal society
would then become less efficient (Piper 1978: 198–199).</p>

<h4 id="KantRebeSece">1.3.2 Kant on Rebellion and Secession</h4>

<p>
Interestingly enough, while Kant’s test refers to an ideal public, the
examples he provides us with have to do—as in Sidgwick’s
discussion—with a <em>non-ideal</em> public. As we shall see
however, the mechanisms on which Kant’s argument rest differ from
those on which Sidgwick’s does. Two cases are being envisaged:
rebellion and secession. Let us begin with the former. Kant asks:
“Is rebellion a legitimate means for a people to employ in
throwing off the yoke of an alleged tyrant (<em>non titulo, sed
exercitio talis</em>)?” (1795 [1923: 382]). The publicity test
is used here in two ways. <em>First</em>, Kant claims that the open
acknowledgment of the maxim of rebellion “would make its own
purpose impossible” (1795 [1923: 382]). The argument is the
following. A person cannot be said to be the chief if the people may
sometimes employ force against him (chief-with-absolute-power
assumption). The establishment of a state requires a chief in this
sense (no-state-without-chief assumption). Therefore publicizing the
maxim of rebellion would make the establishment of a state impossible.
This is valid however only if we accept the two assumptions mentioned
above. <em>Second</em>, the chief himself may publish the maxim
according to which rebellion will be sanctioned with death, “for
when he knows he possesses irresistible power […] he need not
fear vitiating his own purpose by publishing his maxims” (1795
[1923: 383]). And it is because of such irresistibility that publishing
this maxim will not be self-frustrating. Again, Kant does not say
whether in a non-ideal situation in which nobody is in a position to
have absolute power, the fact that publishing the same maxim would
frustrate its very purpose would also mean that this is an
<em>unjust</em> maxim. And what is also worth stressing is that such
purpose frustration does not imply approval by an ideal and
rational public. It merely derives from power relations. Hence, were
we to adopt the same line of argument, we could conclude that the
stronger a despotic power, the larger the spectrum of maxims that may
pass the publicity test, a conclusion that Kant implicitly endorses in
the case of maxims of international
 law.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-14" id="ref-14">14</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
The rebellion example illustrates the difficulty involved in moving
from the hypothetical test to real life situations. What is at stake
is our understanding of what “compatibility” could
plausibly mean once we move from an ideal to a non-ideal public. The
tension in Kant’s text is the following. As we keep reading the
general part of his argument, it all looks as if reference is made to
the universal acceptability of a maxim in the eyes of an ideal and
rational public. The rebellion as well as the other examples he gives
however (1795 [1923:  383–384]) all rely on a
“self-frustration” (or counter-productivity) mechanism.
The latter may certainly have a direct connection with what it may be
rational for the beneficiaries and victims of a maxim to do. Kant
remains unclear however about the connection between such
preoccupations and the <em>just or unjust nature</em> of a maxim.</p>

<p>
Let us then take the secession example:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
“If a smaller State is situated as to break up the territory of
a larger one, and continuous territory is necessary to the
preservation of the larger, is the latter not justified in subjugating
the smaller and incorporating it?”. We easily see that the
greater power cannot afford to let this maxim become known; otherwise
the smaller states would very early unite, or other powers would
dispute the prey, and thus publicity would render this maxim
impracticable. This is a sign that it is illegitimate. (1795 [1923:
384])</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Again, Kant refers here to the risk that defense strategies of the
potential losers of a maxim’s implementation may render the latter
less efficacious, if not totally inefficacious. There are at least two
difficulties with this. <em>First</em>, in a real life context (e.g.,
Cuba or Chechnya type) in which the large state knows that other small
or large states are unlikely to intervene in such situations,
publicity would <em>not</em> make the maxim impracticable. Hence, the
maxim could in principle still be <em>fair</em> if we were to follow
the Kantian logic. <em>Second</em> (and conversely), take a domestic
analogy involving a state fighting a local mafia. Were the state to
announce in advance that it will run a special anti-mafia operation on
a given day, any benefits from a surprise intervention would vanish.
In other words, a maxim stated precisely enough to include the date of
the police intervention could not be publicized. All the local Mafiosi
would seek to hide themselves on that very day, hence making the
intervention totally useless. This will not suffice to convince us
however—even if we were ideal and rational observers—that
the planned police intervention (and the maxim on which it would be
grounded) is <em>unjust</em>.</p>

<p>
Both Sidgwick’s and Kant’s examples rely on non-ideal publics.
Admittedly they do so in a slightly different manner. Kant’s ideal
public apparently sticks to the role of a judge whereas Sidgwick’s
ideal community of utilitarians is taken as a set of actors whose
understanding of the rules is likely to affect their actual behavior.
However, the reasons justifying secrecy in the examples each of them
gives are of a very different nature. For Sidgwick’s illustrations do
not necessarily involve power relation problems. They rather imply
motivational or cognitive dimensions. What matters as well for our
purposes is that whereas the examples given by Sidgwick properly
illustrate the logic of his argument, those provided by Kant do not
really enlighten us further, for the idea of purpose frustration (or
“self-frustration”) mobilized in the rebellion and
secession cases is certainly not applicable once we shift to an ideal
public. Therefore, we shall now rely on four examples distinct from
those of Kant in order to ascertain the meaning and implications that
could be attached to the Kantian test insofar as maxims that have to
do with actual publicity are concerned.</p>

<h3 id="DoesKantTestProhActuSecr">1.4 Does the Kantian Test Prohibit Actual Secrecy?</h3>

<h4 id="SidgMetaSecrDoct">1.4.1 Sidgwick’s Meta-Secrecy Doctrine</h4>

<p>
Let us ask ourselves first whether Sidgwick’s covert utilitarianism
would be unable to pass Kant’s publicity test. As we have seen, this
doctrine states that we should keep secret the very idea that some
principles and actions should remain secret. This means that, even at a
very high level of generality, there is no way we could submit any
maxim for assessment to the ideal public, unless such a maxim makes no
direct reference to the problem of publicity. What about the following
maxim however : “any means should be deemed appropriate if they
serve the utilitarian ideal”? Utilitarians will claim that an
ideal public should at least consider utilitarianism a plausible
doctrine. And it is therefore unlikely that the Kantian test will lead
to a “necessary and unanimous” rejection of this proposed
higher-order formulation of the maxim. Hence the test may be passed
successfully, without any discussion on the issue of publicity. Of
course, one may find such a maxim totally unjust for other reasons.
But Kant himself does not seem to claim that his test should be seen
as a <em>sufficient</em> test for justice anyway.</p>

<h4 id="GlomResp">1.4.2 Glomar Responses</h4>

<p>
Our second example comes from actual Freedom of Information (FoI)
regimes. That a public authority may have to minimally justify each of
its significant decisions will seem totally sound. In principle, this
should also hold each time a public authority denies access to a
document requested by a citizen on the basis of his FoI right. The
citizen should know whether it is, e.g., on privacy, on trade secret
or, on State security grounds that access is being denied to the
document he wants to double-check. There are cases however in which
disclosing the exact reason why access to a document is denied would
unavoidably entail the disclosure of the document’s very content. One
could deny access with no overt justification, implying that
disclosing <em>the precise ground</em> for denial would be equivalent
to disclosing the document’s very content. Along the same lines, an
authority could even refuse to deny or confirm <em>the very
existence</em> of the requested document—which is known in US
law as a Glomar
 response.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-15" id="ref-15">15</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
Again, one may well propose a higher-order principle accounting for a
Glomar type of response: </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
whenever access to a document may be denied on a legitimate basis and
disclosing either the basis for denial or even the very existence of
the document would jeopardize the pursuit of this very goal, a
justification for denial or even the confirmation of the document’s
(non)-existence may be withheld. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
So long as the set of such legitimate bases for denial is publicly
discussed and (procedural) checks are being put in place to make sure
that access is not denied on other grounds, there is <em>no</em>
reason to believe that publicizing such a maxim will be
self-frustrating in presence of a real public, nor that such a maxim
should be rejected by an ideal public. Admittedly, the Glomar doctrine
embodies some extent of “meta-secrecy”. However, it does
not go as far as a meta-secrecy “à la Sidgwick”.
For the very possibility that a state may sometimes act on secret
grounds is not publicly denied, nor are the grounds for justifiable
Glomar responses necessarily left outside the sphere of public
 discussion.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-16" id="ref-16">16</a>]</sup></p>
 

<h4 id="JudiTrueGoal">1.4.3 The Judiciary’s True Goal</h4>

<p>
Third example. Suppose that the true goal of the judiciary were to
promote peace and stability rather than justice. However, let us
assume as well that letting people believe that the genuine goal of
such institutions is justice would best guarantee peace, for decision
acceptance would be enhanced accordingly if such decisions were
perceived as just (Luban 1996: 160). In such a world, there is no
question that peace would better be pursued by keeping it secret as
the true goal of judiciary. The maxim may be: </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
act in a way such that if peace is best pursued by letting people
think (wrongly) that it is in fact justice that is being pursued, you
should let people think so. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Publicizing such a maxim may be “self-frustrating” and
would therefore not pass the Kantian test.</p>

<p>
However, besides asking ourselves whether such self-frustratingness is
what accounts for the possibly unjust nature of the maxim, we may
provide a higher order formulation of the maxim: </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Act in a way such that if one legitimate goal is best pursued by
letting people think (wrongly) that it is in fact another legitimate
goal that is being pursued, you should let people think so. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This higher-order maxim’s publication is <em>not</em> self-frustrating
(even in a case in which we assume that the legitimacy of each goal
has been examined in detail, along with the legitimacy of other
goals). Of course, this does not end the discussion since, in case we
were to grant priority to justice over peace, the maxim’s
implementation could still lead to injustice, which the Kantian test
does not exclude anyway.</p>

<h4 id="OptiConfFoILaws">1.4.4 The Optimal Confidentiality of FoI Laws</h4>

<p>
Let us finally move to an example that deals again with real Freedom
of Information (FoI) regimes. One of the surprises of such regimes is
that, as a matter of fact, their very existence remains rather
confidential in many countries. Citizens do not seem to exercise their
right of access to state-detained documents as much as one might
expect. This could be regarded as unfortunate. One may as well
consider it necessary, however, at least if we find meaningful the
idea of an <em>optimal level of confidentiality</em> of FoI regimes.
This optimal level would consist in some active citizens being
maximally aware of its existence, and all civil servants being as
little aware of it as possible. For if (non-ideal) civil servants know
that they are potentially being watched, they may admittedly try to
change their behavior for the better. However, they may simultaneously
want to hide even further the more problematic aspects of their
behavior (e.g., through shifting from written to oral discussions). In
other words, in order for the fundamental FoI right to be maximally
effective, its existence and exercise may have to remain relatively
covert (or unequally known).</p>

<p>
What should an ideal public think about the following maxim then:
“In order for a legitimate goal to be pursued, while the goal
itself would be fully public (here: the accountability of public
authorities), while the social expectations of citizens towards civil
servants would be fully transparent, some of the means enabling such
citizens to ensure the accountability of public authorities may remain
covert”? Not each and every such covert means is acceptable.
However, the one consisting in a right to ask for a copy of
administrative documents may very well be so. Of course, publicizing a
lower order version of this maxim may be self-frustrating, hence
incapable of passing the Kantian test. But again, this does not seem
to be sufficient to discard this lower order maxim as being unjust,
nor does it mean that a higher-order translation of it (as suggested
above) would be unable to pass the Kantian test.</p>

<p>
These four examples leave us with two important open questions on the
Kantian test. <em>First</em>, how should we assess the test’s importance if
the level of generality at which the maxim of an action should be
phrased cannot be normatively fixed? As we have illustrated above, the
lower the level of generality at which a maxim is phrased, the higher
the risk that its publicity would be self-frustrating, and vice versa
(Luban 1996: 189–191). No doubt, the test would be
<em>over-exclusive</em> if we were forced to phrase our maxims at a
very low level of generality. This is clear when we think about
keeping secret the date of a currency devaluation or of a police
intervention to trap criminals, the location of a stock of weapons in
times of peace or of the place where an unjustly threatened writer is
being sheltered. Kant himself never suggests that all secret actions
should be ruled out by his test. The problem is that as long as we do
not have any indication as to the appropriate level of generality at
which an action’s maxim should be tested, the opposite risk of
<em>under-exclusiveness</em> becomes hard to avoid as our four
examples above illustrate. Perhaps our expectations towards such a
test are too high however, as they often tend to be towards other
hypothetical devices as well, such as the Rawlsian veil of ignorance
or hypothetical social contracts.</p>

<p>
<em>Second</em>, it is not entirely clear why self-frustratingness (or
purpose-frustratingness) should be read as an indicator of injustice.
In other words, whenever the Kantian test bites, why would this tell
us anything about the just or unjust nature of a maxim and the actions
that fall under
 it?<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-17" id="ref-17">17</a>]</sup>
 And answering this question would be even more crucial for those
who—contrary to us—view the publicity test as a necessary
<em>and sufficient</em> condition for permissibility. What we need
then is an account of the “intrinsic connection” between
self-frustratingness and injustice—in the same way as one may
ask why, for (neo-) contractarians there should be a significant
connection between (hypothetical) insurance and justice. Such an
account is however not provided by Kant who claims about the principle
that “like an axiom, it is indemonstrably certain” (1795
[1923: 382]). One sound suggestion is Luban’s (Luban 1996: 191). Imagine
that making the maxim of my action public would frustrate my ability
to reach this maxim’s very goal. This can be taken as a sign of
the injustice of this maxim <em>only if</em> the frustration-generating
mechanism is at least in part based itself on morally justifiable
grounds. But if publicizing a doctrine generates distrust from a real
audience merely because of people’s attraction for simplicity or
non-demandingness, the frustration flowing from such a distrust should
hardly be considered relevant to the assessment of the maxim’s
(in)justice.</p>

<h2 id="ActuPubl">2. Actual Publicity</h2>

<p>
Actual publicity can be looked at through the prism of hypothetical
publicity. However, philosophers have been approaching the issue from
other angles as well. Their arguments have mobilized both empirical
assumptions and philosophical claims regarding the purpose of voting
and political representation, the importance of participation and
deliberation, etc. Hereinafter, we will examine more closely arguments
in favor or against actual publicity in the political arena. In order
to do so, we will restrict ourselves to two modes of political action
(vote and deliberation) and two types of actors (electors and
representatives). In so doing, we will consider two types of
relationships: <em>horizontal</em> ones (among voters or among
representatives) and <em>vertical</em> ones (between voters and
representatives). Notice already that the view one favors regarding
the function attached to one’s vote as a member of the electorate and
to one’s activity as a representative will have an impact on the
reasons why publicity may matter and the extent to which it does.</p>

<p>
Before engaging in this philosophical discussion, let us clarify what
the arguments developed below may show for one significant practical
evolution, i.e., the development of Freedom of Information (FoI)
regimes in democratic countries during the second half of the 20th
 century.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-18" id="ref-18">18</a>]</sup>
 Such regimes have been set up with the view of allowing citizens to
participate more actively in public affairs, enabling them to have
access to the detail of most administrative documents in due
 time.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-19" id="ref-19">19</a>]</sup>
 Hence, not only MPs but civil servants become more effectively
accountable. This means that citizens are not forced simply to accept
package deals from their representatives at the time of elections.
They can question the practicalities of implementation at any
time.</p>

<p>
Not only does the enactment of FoI regimes provide opportunities for
multiple interactions between active citizens and state authorities, they also force us to weigh the relative importance of open government
vis a vis other fundamental rights or the public interest in general.
Specific grounds for denying access to administrative documents
include the protection of privacy, property rights (e.g., trade
secrets), secrecy easing the gathering of information from third
parties (e.g., executive
 privilege<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-20" id="ref-20">20</a>]</sup>
 or medical secrecy), paternalistic justifications (e.g., in the case
of technical documents that could be misinterpreted), state interests
(e.g., in defense and terrorism matters or international
negotiations), and economic efficiency (e.g., in public procurement, the
content of the offer made by competitors being only disclosed after
the final decision). Sometimes, such grounds for secrecy will justify
strict denial of access. On other occasions, the disclosure of
information will be deferred (e.g., through declassification
procedures) or be selective (e.g., to some types of actors only). This
variety of potential justifications of secrecy and the diverse ways of
accommodating the conflicting values constitute a largely unexplored
terrain for applied political philosophy. Here, we will focus only on
<em>general</em> reasons to promote or restrict actual publicity.</p>

<h3 id="Voti">2.1 Voting</h3>

<h4 id="Mill1861CaseAgaiSecrBall">2.1.1 Mill’s (1861) Case Against Secret Ballot</h4>

<p>
Let us look at voting first. We may begin with the view according to
which the electoral process aims only at aggregating people’s
individual preferences regarding the type of decisions they consider
in their own interest (rather than in the public interest). Under such
a view, there is no strong case for making sure that my fellow citizen
be able to know what my actual preferences are. This is especially
significant when it comes to direct democracy (e.g., referendum).
However, in cases involving representation, there may still be good
reasons under this view of democracy, for representatives to know
which type of electors exactly they are representing, hence for open
ballots. In other words, even under an “aggregation of private
interests” view of democracy, there may be a case for open
ballots. This case will have nothing to do with the need for fellow
voters to know about their neighbor’s actual preferences, though. Only
their representatives need to know about them.</p>

<p>
Let us now move to a different conception of democracy, the one
advocated by John Stuart Mill:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
In any political election, even by universal suffrage (and still more
obviously in the case of a restricted suffrage), the voter is under an
absolute moral obligation to consider the interest of the public, not
his private advantage, and give his vote, to the best of his judgment,
exactly as he would be bound to do if he were the sole voter, and the
election depended upon him alone. This being admitted, it is at least
a <em>prima facie</em> consequence that the duty of voting, like any
other public duty, should be performed under the eye and criticism of
the public; every one of whom has not only an interest in its
performance, but a good title to consider himself wronged if it is
performed otherwise than honestly and carefully. Undoubtedly neither
this nor any other maxim of political morality is absolutely
inviolable; it may be overruled by still more cogent considerations.
But its weight is such that the cases which admit of a departure from
it must be of a strikingly exceptional character (1861 [1991:
355]).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
J.S. Mill later discusses whether such reasons to depart from
publicity do hold—an issue to which we shall return. What
matters here however is that once we consider that voters are supposed
to vote according to what they believe would promote the public
interest, rather than their own private
 interests,<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-21" id="ref-21">21</a>]</sup>
 the case for publicity is reversed. On the one hand, if we can
associate to such a conception of voting one of representation
according to which representatives are supposed to defend the public
interest rather than the class interests of their identifiable
 electors,<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-22" id="ref-22">22</a>]</sup>
 the case for vertical publicity weakens. For knowing who their
electors actually are may induce MPs to stick to a defense of their
actual electors rather than to promote the public interest at large.
On the other hand, the very act of taking part in an election acquires
a non-private dimension, such that we should consider ourselves
accountable towards our fellow citizens (horizontal accountability).
And this view according to which we should regard ourselves as
horizontally accountable towards those who may be affected by the
consequences of our choices clearly supports the case against secret
ballots. For J.S. Mill, this is a very significant reason for open
ballots. In fact, he even stresses that, as electors, we should see
ourselves accountable not only towards fellow electors, but also to
<em>non-electors</em> whenever the franchise is not as universal as it
could be (which generates the risk of electors voting only to defend
their class interests as
 voters).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-23" id="ref-23">23</a>]</sup>
 The example from Mill’s times is the one of women, who were excluded
from “manhood suffrage”. Present day illustrations could
refer to non-national residents excluded from the right to vote or to
those below the age of
 majority.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-24" id="ref-24">24</a>]</sup></p>
 

<h4 id="WhyWorrAbouOpenVote">2.1.2 Why Worry About Open Vote?</h4>

<p>
John Stuart Mill was not the first to write about vote secrecy.
Authors such as Cicero (III.15),
 Montesquieu,<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-25" id="ref-25">25</a>]</sup>
 Rousseau<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-26" id="ref-26">26</a>]</sup> and
 Tocqueville<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-27" id="ref-27">27</a>]</sup>
 had also expressed their views on the matter. And J.S. Mill’s
intervention is in fact part of a lively debate that had been going on
in England for several
 decades.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-28" id="ref-28">28</a>]</sup>
 He writes:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
It may, unquestionably, be the fact that if we attempt, by publicity,
to make the voter responsible to the public for his vote, he will
practically be made responsible for it to some powerful individual,
whose interest is more opposed to the general interest of the
community than that of the voter himself would be if, by the shield of
secrecy, he were released from responsibility altogether. When this is
the condition, in a high degree, of a large proportion of the voters,
the ballot may be the smaller evil. When the voters are slaves,
anything may be tolerated which enables them to throw off the yoke.
The strongest case for the ballot is when the mischievous power of the
Few over the Many is increasing […].</p>

<p>
But in the more advanced states of modern Europe, and especially in
this country, the power of coercing voters has declined and is
declining; and bad voting is now less to be apprehended from the
influences to which the voter is subject at the hands of others than
from the sinister interests and discreditable feelings which belong to
himself, either individually or as a member of a class. To secure him
against the first, at the cost of removing all restraint from the
last, would be to exchange a smaller and a diminishing evil for a
greater and increasing one […] (J.S. Mill, 1861 [1991:
 355–357]).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-29" id="ref-29">29</a>]</sup></p>
 </blockquote>

<p>
Brennan &amp; Pettit (1990) revived J.S. Mill’s argument, endorsing
the view that while we should not assume that people will generally
tend to vote according to their private interest whenever voting is
secret, unveiling the vote would certainly encourage further the
practice of voting in accordance with what one considers to be the
common good (Brennan &amp; Pettit 1990: 325–329). They argue as
well that the case for open vote is especially strong in pluralistic
societies involving large
 electorates.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-30" id="ref-30">30</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
Still, J.S. Mill’s lesser evil type of justification for open votes
has been rejected in the past on at least three grounds.
<em>First</em>, one could question the very purpose that J.S. Mill
ascribes to voting. Hence, some of the protagonists of the 19th
century British debate criticized the view according to which voting
should be regarded as a trust rather than a
 right.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-31" id="ref-31">31</a>]</sup>
 This entails, in contrast with J.S. Mill’s view, that ballot
secrecy is not even a lesser evil. It is no evil at all.
<em>Second</em>, one may disagree with Mill at the factual
level rather than at the normative one. James Mill, his father,
clearly agreed with his son on the purpose of voting, referring
explicitly on various occasions to the idea of a trust. In his long
essay “On the Ballot”, he states that “The voter for
a member of Parliament has a trust placed in his hands, on the
discharge of which the highest interests of his country
 depend”.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-32" id="ref-32">32</a>]</sup>
 However, James Mill considered—in opposition to his son’s
view—that the negative consequences attached to the secret
ballot were not only less weighty than its advantages, but devoid of
any weight at
 all.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-33" id="ref-33">33</a>]</sup>
 This entails that for James Mill as well, introducing secrecy of vote
was not even a lesser evil reform. It did not involve any evil at all.
<em>Third</em> , let us consider Bentham’s position. Although he does
not refer explicitly to the trust-based view of voting, he considers
that voters should be influenced by <em>tutelary</em> motives. For
him, </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
in judging whether a motive ought to be referred to the class of
<em>seductive</em> or <em>tutelary</em> motives, it is necessary to
examine whether, in the case in question, it tends […] to
favour the greatest or the smallest number (Bentham 1843 [1999:
 145]).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-34" id="ref-34">34</a>]</sup>
 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
After balancing the pros and cons of publicity, Bentham concludes:
</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The system of secresy has therefore a useful tendency in those
circumstances in which publicity exposes the voter to the influence of
a particular interest opposed to the public interest. Secresy is
therefore in general suitable in elections. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In contrast with James Mill, Bentham’s argument is of the lesser-evil
type. But contrary to J.S. Mill, it is a lesser-evil argument in favor
of secrecy rather than
 publicity.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-35" id="ref-35">35</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
Such developments may be dismissed as being of merely historical
interest. And indeed, except for Brennan &amp; Pettit’s (1990) paper,
there is not much debate today anymore about the suitability of secret
ballot. Rather, the whole debate on secrecy seems to have shifted its
focus to parliamentary debate and to administrative activity (FoI).
Still, there are at least three lessons to be learnt from the old
“secret ballot” debate, over and above the fact that vote
secrecy should not be seen as entailing no costs at all.
<em>First</em>, already at that time, there were attempts at
envisaging simultaneously the questions of vote secrecy in the case of
electors and in the case of
 representatives.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-36" id="ref-36">36</a>]</sup>
 And the interesting fact is that we do not have today a clear theory
telling us why we should have secret ballots for electors and open
votes in plenary parliamentary sessions. Simply referring to the fact
that representatives are accountable to their electors (vertical
accountability) in a sense in which electors are not to their fellow
citizens (horizontal accountability) seems insufficient in that
respect. <em>Ceteris paribus</em>, the importance of horizontal
accountability, insofar as it emphasizes the need to minimally justify
our decisions to those who may suffer from their consequences, could
suffice to justify openness. Moreover, it is probably also
insufficient to claim that the fact that representatives may lose
their job as a result of electoral discontent is not as problematic as
the fact that electors could lose their job if their employer were to
know about who they voted for. This does not mean that differences are
absent. <em>Ceteris paribus</em>, a representative has more power for
example than a
 citizen.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-37" id="ref-37">37</a>]</sup>
 What we need to ask ourselves is whether this is sufficient to
justify a different of treatment between the two categories with
regard to vote publicity.</p>

<p>
<em>Second</em>, open vote in parliament may not only give room to
pressure from your actual electors, it may also lead to pressure from
those who did not actually vote for you or from well-organized lobbies
defending some specific interests. This is probably one of the
concerns today in many countries. Publicity allows the electors to use
the stick/threat of non-reelection in full knowledge of what a
representative actually did. Still, it allows as well other actors to
do so, who may neither be the representative’s actual electors, nor
lobbies acting in the name of the general interest. The employers and
landowners may not pressure employees and landless people anymore.
Still, lobbyists representing the former may still be pressuring the
MPs elected by the latter, with comparable results. This indicates how
pressure made possible through publicity may force representatives to
take directions that do not fit with the view of the public interest
defended by those who elected them. Pressure is a double-edged sword.
This may call for at least mixed systems, to which we shall come back
shortly. Perhaps this may even justify taking more seriously the
possibility of vote anonymity in parliament, provided that the number
of votes for and against each proposal be known anyway.</p>

<p>
<em>Finally</em>, one may consider that the only way of dealing with
such issue will consist in obtaining empirical evidence on the
respective effects of secrecy and publicity and weighing them
 up.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-38" id="ref-38">38</a>]</sup>
 More principled arguments could be developed however. Such principled
arguments could take at least two (non-exclusive) forms. According to
one strategy, even in a society where the level of coercion on voters
is very weak on average, it is reasonable to assume that those who
will suffer most from such risk of coercion (given their higher
dependence on others) are the least advantaged. There may thus be a
<em>maximin case</em> for secret ballots on such grounds, putting
priority on the protection of the most vulnerable. The other strategy
would consist in stressing the fact that the extent to which
intimidation and coercion on voters obtains in a given society may
fluctuate, hence evolve at some point for the worse, in line with
political or economic degradations, including good results of
intimidating extreme right or left parties or a higher vulnerability
due to growing unemployment rates. A <em>preventive approach</em>
would thus consist in saying that once coercion would increase to an
extent such that it would become worrying (provided that there are
levels of coercion that would not be worrying in the first place), it
would then be too late to switch back to secret vote. This could
justify preserving vote secrecy all along (and possibly banning, e.g.,
voting via mail or the internet insofar as they do not guarantee
secrecy strictly enough), even when the risk of coercion or
intimidation is currently
 negligible.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-39" id="ref-39">39</a>]</sup></p>
 

<h3 id="Deli">2.2 Deliberation</h3>

<h4 id="PublCiviRepr">2.2.1 Can Publicity Civilize Representatives?</h4>

<p>
Let us now turn to the issue of public deliberation. Notice first that
the arguments for open ballots invoked above in the context of an
“aggregation of private interests” view of voting, equally
justify the publicity of debates taking place between
representatives. This may have to do with the mere need to
“learn about each other”. In other words, in a system in
which vertical accountability matters, it is essential both for
citizens to know exactly what their representatives think and do, and
for representatives to know more than once every four years how the
electorate reacts to their arguments and decisions.</p>

<p>
Learning <em>about</em> each other is one thing. Learning
<em>from</em> each other (about facts, what to think or how to act) is
another,
 however.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-40" id="ref-40">40</a>]</sup>
 Publicity is not supposed to allow only for citizens and their
representatives to act upon fixed preferences regarding their private
or even the public interests. The interactions that publicity allows
for are also potentially rich in transformative power. Such a dynamic
impact can take various forms. Publicity of deliberations between
representatives may play an exemplary role for citizens (both
procedurally and substantively), as suggested for instance by Jeremy
Bentham, who writes that </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
the order which reigns in the discussion of a political assembly, will
form by imitation the national spirit. This order will be reproduced
in clubs and inferior assemblies, in which the people will be pleased
to find the regularity of which they have formed the idea from the
greater model (Bentham 1843 [1999:
 31]).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-41" id="ref-41">41</a>]</sup>
 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Similarly, we have seen that open ballots can force electors to
restrict themselves in public to positions that they would be able to
justify to other fellow citizens. And this is true <em>even when</em>
their fellow citizens are not especially educated, as J.S. Mill
argued:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The notion is itself unfounded, that publicity, and the sense of being
answerable to the public, are of no use unless the public are
qualified to form a sound judgment. It is a very superficial view of
the utility of public opinion to suppose that it does good only when
it succeeds in enforcing a servile conformity to itself. To be under
the eyes of others—to have to defend oneself to others—is
never more important than to those who act in opposition to the
opinion of others, for it obliges them to have sure ground of their
own. Nothing has so steadying an influence as working against
pressure. Unless when under the temporary sway of passionate
excitement, no one will do that which he expects to be greatly blamed
for, unless from a preconceived and fixed purpose of his own; which is
always evidence of a thoughtful and deliberate character, and, except
in radically bad men, generally proceeds from sincere and strong
personal convictions. Even the bare fact of having to give an account
of their conduct is a powerful inducement to adhere to conduct of
which at least some decent account can be given. If any one thinks
that the mere obligation of preserving decency is not a very
considerable check on the abuse of power, he has never had his
attention called to the conduct of those who do not feel under the
necessity of observing that restraint. Publicity is inappreciable,
even when it does no more than prevent that which can by no
possibility be plausibly defended—than compel deliberation, and
force every one to determine, before he acts, what he shall say if
called to account for his actions (1861 [1991:
 360–361])<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-42" id="ref-42">42</a>]</sup></p>
 </blockquote>

<p>
Now, representatives can civilize their electorate through public
deliberation, as suggested by Bentham. And voters may well be
civilized by their not-necessarily-civilized fellow voters (and
non-voters) in case of open ballots, as J.S. Mill argued. Jon Elster
presents still another view according to which the publicity of
<em>deliberation</em> would help citizens civilizing <em>their
representatives</em>. Hereinafter, we briefly elaborate on what Elster
refers to as “the civilizing force of hypocrisy”. The
central passage is the following:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Generally speaking, the effect of an audience is to replace the
language of interest by the language of reason and to replace
impartial motives by passionate ones. The presence of a public makes
it especially hard to appear motivated merely by self-interest. Even
if one’s fellow assembly members would not be shocked, the audience
would be. In general, this civilizing force of hypocrisy is a
desirable effect of publicity. […] Publicity does not eliminate
base motives, but forces and induces speakers to hide them (Elster
1998a: 111; Naurin 2003).</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="Filt">The Filter</h5>

<p>
Elster’s idea can be presented in two steps. The first one is the
filtering step. The public is meant to hold normative expectations
regarding what representatives are supposed to
 say.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-43" id="ref-43">43</a>]</sup>
 One of these expectations is that any overt reference to mere
self-interest in the course of justifying their position would be seen
as
 unacceptable<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-44" id="ref-44">44</a>]</sup>—which
 leaves open the question whether a reference to the self-interest of
their class of electors
 would.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-45" id="ref-45">45</a>]</sup>
 Another expectation could be that representatives justify their
position through a reference to minimally <em>general</em> principles.
Finally, there would also be a social norm favoring arguing over
 bargaining,<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-46" id="ref-46">46</a>]</sup>
 such that whenever the debate would have to take place in public,
deliberation oriented towards the force of the better argument would
be promoted. This will entail at the very least the need to disguise
overt threats as warnings (Elster 1998a: 103–104). We may
multiply the number of such expectations. Such normative expectations
regarding acceptable discourse will act as a filter on what the
representatives are allowed to say. Notice that it is not hypocrisy as
such that filters out the set of unacceptable speech elements.
However, it allows the representative to engage into a discourse in
which he does <em>not necessarily</em> believe. In other words, this
account does not necessarily presuppose a normative expectation among
the public that politicians ought to be
 sincere.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-47" id="ref-47">47</a>]</sup>
 Actually, hypocrisy is rather an enabling factor (allowing for an
initial gap between what is said and thought) than a cleaning up
factor.</p>

<p>
Does the argument presuppose that voters be on average more civilized
than their representatives? At least two types of answers can be
provided. <em>First</em>, there are reasons of principle to
<em>doubt</em> that representatives be on average wiser (or more
committed to the common good) than their electorate. As Luban
writes,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
… the empirical validity of the publicity principle turns not
on whether the Many are ignorant or wrong-headed, but on whether their
leaders are less ignorant or less wrong-headed. No doubt the Wise are
few; and the leaders are few; but it hardly follows that the leaders
are wise. Before we reject the publicity principle because the leaders
know best, we must have reason to believe that the leaders know
better. And to find that out, we must look carefully at the variety of
mechanisms by which decision-making elites are actually selected. If
actual selection mechanisms choose randomly between the Many and the
Wise, or affirmatively disfavor the Wise, then the foolishness of the
many is irrelevant: the Few in official positions have no reason to
suppose that their policy brainstorms are any less foolish (Luban
1996: 193).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
<em>Second</em>, the average level of civilization may be less
relevant than the presence of at least a <em>minority</em> of
civilized members. As J.S. Mill puts it, “[…] cases exist
[…] in which almost the only restraint upon a majority of
knaves consists in their involuntary respect for the opinion of an
honest minority” (1861 [1991: 362]). In line with this Millian
view, were the average level of civilization among representatives
higher or equivalent to the one obtaining within the electorate,
publicity could still increase in absolute terms the amount of
civilized persons attending the representative’s discourse, adding
civilized members of the public to those who are civilized in
parliament. Hence, through such a <em>sampling effect</em>, if we
agree with Mill that the mere presence of a civilized minority can
make some difference, a larger absolute size of such a minority might
be relevant. As for Elster, he explicitly relies more directly on a
<em>multiplier effect</em>, insisting that “a small group of
impartially minded individuals might induce many others to mimic their
impartiality out of self-interest” (Elster 1995: 249). And as
Elster points out, this is even more true whenever there is
<em>uncertainty</em> as to who these impartially minded people are
(Elster 1995: 248). </p>

<h5 id="ReduCognDiss">Reducing cognitive dissonance</h5>

<p>
Now, here comes a second step in Elster’s argument (Elster 1986,
§II). There is an additional normative expectation: once
representatives commit themselves in public to a given view, they are
not supposed to switch to another view unless they can justify such a
departure (Elster 1998a: 104). As Elster puts it, </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
public speaking is subject to a consistency constraint. Once a speaker
has adopted an impartial argument because it corresponds to his
interest or prejudice, he will be seen as opportunistic if he deviates
from it when it ceases to serve his needs (Elster 1998a:
 104).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-48" id="ref-48">48</a>]</sup>
 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Citizens may be more or less vigilant regarding compliance with such a
“consistency through time” requirement. Still, it is
likely to have some weight.</p>

<p>
Furthermore, as representatives cannot publicly depart from the
principled views they have expressed earlier, they may begin believing
in what they say, even though they may not have been holding such
views at the time they began expressing
 them.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-49" id="ref-49">49</a>]</sup>
 Hence, being forced to restrict oneself to publicly acceptable views
may turn out to influence what one eventually <em>believes</em>,
insofar as in order to reduce the dissonance between what one says and
what one believes, one may come genuinely to believe what one is
expected to say. Civilizing people’s speech will eventually civilize
their mind (and hopefully in turn their non-linguistic actions)
and—so Elster claims—“on the average, […]
yield more equitable outcomes” (Elster 1995: 251). What begins
as a strategic use of a non-self-interested arguments ends up leading
to preference change (Fearon 1998: 54). </p>

<p>
Notice that Goodin has proposed an alternative account to the
cognitive dissonance reduction one. For him, people do have a latent
moral sense and having to state arguments in public acts as a
<em>reminder</em> of what they already agree with. They may not
necessarily have connected the issue at stake with the principles they
do endorse
 otherwise.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-50" id="ref-50">50</a>]</sup>
 One possible way of contrasting Goodin’s alternative with the
cognitive dissonance view is the following. What is at stake would be
as much a matter of reducing dissonance between what one says and what
one genuinely believes, as one of reducing dissonance between two
separate beliefs one holds.</p>

<p>
Having offered an account of Elster’s idea of the civilizing force of
hypocrisy, there are at least two empirical questions to be asked.
First, are Elster’s factual assumptions empirically plausible? Second,
are there no other negative side effects related to publicity that
could outweigh the benefits identified by Elster? In the next section,
we provide elements that may be relevant to answering the latter
question. Let us briefly address the first challenge here. Naurin
(2004) provides interesting evidence in this respect. On the one hand,
he refers to a study by Joerges &amp; Neyer (1997) that looks closely
at European Union comitology committees. Their study indicates that
public-spirited deliberation can be present in such committees whose
existence is unknown to most people. This may seem reassuring as it
could suggest that publicity is <em>not necessary</em> to foster truly
deliberative behavior. However, on the other hand, Naurin refers to
evidence from Eliasoph (1998: 7) suggesting in the case of activists
that, while in backroom conversations they tend to express themselves
with reference to justice and common good concerns, shifting to a
front stage context also increases their use of self-regarding
arguments. Naurin’s (2004) own empirical data illustrate a similar
trend in the case of industry lobbyists in the European Union context.
In other words, a forum-like type of behavior would already be present
in the lobby corridor. Surprisingly enough, bringing lobbyists from
the backstage to the front stage would actually make things
<em>worse</em> from the point of view of reducing reference to mere
self-interest. One should admittedly be cautious in extrapolating such
 results.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-51" id="ref-51">51</a>]</sup>
 Still, both Eliasoph and Naurin identify a phenomenon that actually
goes in the opposite direction of what Elster’s view implies. This is
clearly a serious challenge to his theory.</p>

<h4 id="QualDeli">2.2.2 The Quality of Deliberation</h4>

<p>
The variety of effects of publicity on the nature of the deliberation
process is clearly an understudied matter. We have already looked at
some impacts, asking ourselves whether publicity substitutes
public-interest-oriented to self-regarding arguments, and whether it
leads to a shift from bargaining to deliberation. Here, leaving
Elster’s account aside for a moment, we go on with examining other
dimensions of what can be referred to—in an admittedly vague
manner—as the quality of the debate. For one central problem
with publicity is that besides being possibly beneficial in some
respects, it may also modify the nature of the discussion in ways that
are <em>not</em> desirable. One such negative side-effect, as
identified by James Madison in 1787 in the case of the American
Constitutional Convention, is the following:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Had the members committed themselves publicly at first, they would
have afterwards supposed consistency required them to maintain their
ground, whereas by secret discussion no man felt himself obliged to
retain his opinions any longer than he was satisfied of their
propriety and truth, and was open to the force of
 argument.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-52" id="ref-52">52</a>]</sup></p>
 </blockquote>

<p>
The idea of sticking to a position and not being ready to depart from
it despite the existence of good arguments can be a problem for at
least two
 reasons.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-53" id="ref-53">53</a>]</sup>
 Consensus will be harder to reach because of it, which matters
whenever agreement can be reached only by consensus (be it in a
deliberation or in a bargaining type of context). More importantly, we
may be worried not so much about the lack of sincerity of the actors,
but certainly about the loss in debate
 spontaneity.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-54" id="ref-54">54</a>]</sup>
 Unless the deliberating parties are able to try out ideas out of the
blue with the risk of having to abandon them straightaway (trial and
error), to show
 hesitation,<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-55" id="ref-55">55</a>]</sup>
 to re-consider the issues again and again with a fresh eye, the
actual deliberation may not be more than the juxtaposition of
pre-prepared statements with no actual interaction taking
 place.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-56" id="ref-56">56</a>]</sup>
 For the public may view hesitation and trial and error as signs of a
lack of commitment, which may disadvantage those representatives truly
taking part in the discussion, hence inhibiting them from adopting a
genuinely deliberative posture. And as Naurin puts it, </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
[…] if deliberation is about transforming preferences, and
publicity forces you to know what you want and stand by your position,
then “public deliberation” is something of a contradiction
in terms (Naurin 2003: 32). </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
We value deliberation as a true living interaction with real
transformative power, there might then be a strong case for at least
some proportion of political deliberation taking place behind
closed-doors, despite the latter’s negative
 side-effects.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-57" id="ref-57">57</a>]</sup></p>
 

<p>
Meade &amp; Stasavage (2008) document another way in which publicity
might negatively affect the quality of deliberation. They deal with
the specific case of central banks and whether minutes of board
meetings should be released. Based on empirical evidence, they show
how, under conditions of publicity, the fact that expert advisors may
have career concerns reduces the chances of dissent being expressed
during deliberation. Here, what is at stake is not whether one sticks
to one’s <em>own</em> initial position (posture problem). Rather, it
has to do with whether one is ready to show disagreement with the
position taken by <em>another</em> expert who is highly regarded and
has spoken first (dissent
 problem).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-58" id="ref-58">58</a>]</sup>
 Hence, publicity might generate disincentives both to openly changing
one’s mind and, in some contexts, to dissenting with other
(authoritative) people’s views.</p>

<p>
Chambers (2004) points at still another negative impact of publicity
on the quality of deliberation. Discussion behind closed doors will
admittedly tend to allow for the expression of particularistic (which
does not necessarily mean “self-serving”) reasons that
would not pass the test of actual publicity. However, while making
deliberation public might force the deliberating parties both to
provide the best possible <em>reasons</em> in support of their claims
(Socratic effect) and to provide <em>public</em> reasons (democratic
effect) in the sense of reasons that should refer to the public
interest and be acceptable to a wide audience in a pluralistic
society, one problem
 remains.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-59" id="ref-59">59</a>]</sup>
 For publicity also tends as a matter of fact to favor reasons that
are “plebiscitory” in the sense of <em>shallow</em> or
manipulative (Chambers 2004: 393). Moving from private,
particularistic reasons to truly public reasons may then often have an
associated price, i.e., shifting from profound (private) reasons to
shallow (public) reasons. Admittedly, the reason why they are shallow
might have to do with the need for a common denominator (which could
be needed as well in a deliberation behind closed doors). However, it
is plausible that it may also have to do with an attempt at pleasing
the public (populism).</p>

<p>
These are just a few illustrations of possible negative side effects
of bringing deliberation under the public eye. It may become less
lively (in the sense of being a real interaction), leave room to less
dissent in the presence of an authoritative member, and favor the more
shallow types of arguments, no matter how rational and public they
are. It matters to identify exactly which benefits and which negative
side effects are attached to actual publicity and secrecy, and what
their respective weight could be. It is true in this respect that the
argument may be of a different nature or at least carry a different
weight depending on whether one deals with voting or deliberation. For
instance, the importance of learning from each other (rather than
simply about each other) may provide a strong argument for public
deliberation without necessarily being sufficient to entail the need
for open ballots.</p>

<p>
Once all normative and empirical dimensions have been carefully
considered, one may want to adopt a firm standpoint regarding the need
for publicity or secrecy in deliberation and voting in general.
However, we may also want to try to <em>mix</em> secrecy and publicity
in ways that allow for more optimal schemes, providing us with the
best of both worlds. Let us illustrate this through pointing at two of
such schemes. First, Bentham refers to a system obtaining in the
Polish Permanent Council in the late 18th century by which an open
vote was followed by a secret vote on the very same issue (Bentham
1843 [1999: 147–148]). Second, Elster argues that a
constitution-making process </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
ought to contain elements of both secrecy (committee discussion) and
publicity (plenary assembly discussions). With total secrecy, partisan
interests and logrolling come to the forefront, whereas full publicity
encourages grandstanding and rhetorical overbidding. Conversely,
secrecy allows for serious discussion, whereas publicity ensures that
any deals struck are capable of withstanding the light of day (Elster
1998a: 117). </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
One can thus mix both publicity and secrecy in the case of voting
(Bentham) or deliberation (Elster), through a succession of openness
and secrecy
 (Bentham)<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-60" id="ref-60">60</a>]</sup>
 or secrecy and openness
 (Elster).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-61" id="ref-61">61</a>]</sup>
 One could also envisage to mix public deliberation and secret vote
(which is probably a correct description of what happens during
electoral periods in many democratic countries), or, conversely,
secret deliberation and public vote (which is what actually takes
place in parliamentary systems with secret commissions in which
plenary debates take a purely formal dimension). Each of such mixes
may have specific properties that could be studied further.</p>

<h2 id="RawlPublReasPublRule">3. Rawls on Public Reason and Public Rules</h2>

<p>
Having looked at both hypothetical publicity and actual publicity, let
us now turn to examine the place of publicity within the political
philosophy of John Rawls. We shall analyse two distinct conceptions of
publicity that arise in his writings. The first relates to the
doctrine of <em>public reason</em>. The second relates to the doctrine
of <em>public rules</em>. Though we begin with some remarks about
public reason, we shall focus predominantly on public rules, as this
idea is less familiar.</p>

<h3 id="DoctPublReas">3.1 The Doctrine of Public Reason</h3>

<p>
Stated in a quite general way, the doctrine of public reason holds
that, when justifying the exercise of political power, we ought to
appeal exclusively to reasons that all “citizens as free and
equal may reasonably be expected to endorse in the light of principles
and ideals acceptable to their common human reason” (Rawls 1996,
137). So as to highlight their shared nature, we can call
these <em>public reasons</em>.</p>

<p>
In contrast with public reasons, there are <em>non-public
reasons</em>. These reasons are controversial, in the sense that they
are not reasons that we can expect all reasonable citizens to accept.
Their possibility emerges from the fact of reasonable pluralism (Rawls
1996: 36–39), which refers to the idea that, in any
society in which basic rights are protected, citizens will inevitably
disagree about the worth of competing conceptions of the good life.
The doctrine of public reason states that, because certain reasons are
controversial, we ought not to appeal to them when making the case for
the political legislation we support. In this respect, the doctrine
calls for a kind of <em>justificatory restraint</em> (Rawls
1996:
 447).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-62" id="ref-62">62</a>]</sup>
 </p>

<p>
To illustrate, let us consider the case of a Christian, who is opposed
to abortion for religious reasons. The doctrine of public reason holds
that, even though this citizen may act on these reasons in her own
personal life, she ought not to appeal to her religious beliefs in
order to oppose the legal right to abortion. This is because her
Christian reasons are not ones that we can reasonably expect others to
endorse. Instead, if she wishes to oppose the legislation, she must
offer reasons that are shared by all reasonable citizens (Rawls
1996: 243 n. 32).</p>

<p>
One concern with the doctrine of public reason is that, by asking
citizens to set aside certain controversial reasons in political
decision-making, it invites them to misrepresent their beliefs in
various ways. This is the Insincerity Objection. For example, the
Christian who is prohibited from appealing to her religious beliefs in
order to oppose the legal right to abortion may decide to offer an
argument that she does not find persuasive, but that she hopes others
will, in order to advance her political agenda. This may be
objectionable for a number of reasons, including because it may reduce
the quality of political deliberation (Quong 2011:
ch. 9; Schwartzman 2011).</p>

<p>
A further concern is that the doctrine of public reason proves too
much. This is because we disagree about almost all values, including
political values. Even when we use political power in seemingly just
ways, such as in the name of equality of opportunity, say, we must
appeal to controversial reasons that are not widely accepted. Does it
follow that we cannot reasonably expect citizens to endorse those
reasons, and, if so, isn’t the doctrine of public reason too
restrictive? Or, despite such disagreement, can we still reasonably
expect their endorsement? If so, why can’t we also reasonably
expect citizens to endorse other controversial reasons, such as those that
derive from religious beliefs? Proponents of the doctrine must answer
these questions by explaining why we may treat disagreements about
political values differently from disagreements about conceptions of
the good life. For this reason, we can call it the Asymmetry Objection
(Caney 1995; Fowler &amp; Stemplowska 2015; Sandel 1994; Waldron
1994).</p>

<p>
The precise formulation of the doctrine of public reason is subject to
further variation. Among other factors, it will depend upon (1) how we
discriminate between the reasons that we can and cannot reasonably
expect others to endorse; (2) whether its demands apply
<em>broadly</em> to any matter of public concern or <em>narrowly</em>
only to the essentials of a political constitution (Kelly 2013; Quong
2011: ch. 9); and (3) whether we acknowledge that there may be
conditions under which the doctrine is defeated by other
considerations, such concerns for religious salvation, say (Rawls
1996: 152; Clayton &amp; Stevens 2014).</p>

<p>
Though the arguments we discuss below provide partial answers to these
questions, we shall not explicitly discuss these issues here. Instead,
our goal is to outline the various arguments in defence of the idea of
public reason. These arguments clarify the demands of public reason,
as well as inform our later analysis of public rules.</p>

<p>
We can distinguish three distinct justifications for the doctrine,
each of which finds support within Rawls’s texts:</p>

<ol>

<li>The Political Autonomy Argument</li>

<li>The Civic Friendship Argument</li>

<li>The Stability Argument</li>
</ol>

<p>
The Political Autonomy Argument begins with the claim that each
citizen has a weighty interest in being <em>politically
autonomous</em>—that is, in freely identifying with the
constraints that she faces, such that she fully comprehends and
endorses the justification of those constraints (Rawls 1996:
 402).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-63" id="ref-63">63</a>]</sup>
 Only by justifying the exercise of political power by appeal
exclusively to public reasons can we protect citizens’ interest
in political
 autonomy.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-64" id="ref-64">64</a>]</sup>
 After all, what distinguishes public reasons from non-public reasons
is that the former are ones that we can reasonably expect everyone to
endorse and to act upon.</p>

<p>
One objection to this argument comes from those who deny that citizens
have a weighty interest in being politically autonomous. This is
because it is possible to justify the kind of justificatory restraint
imposed by the doctrine of public reason only if this interest is
sufficiently weighty. If the interest were not very
weighty, or if there were no interest at all, then it is difficult to
see why we ought to exercise the kind of justificatory restraint that
the doctrine of public reason calls for, especially since it prevents
us from appealing to a certain class of sound reasons (Raz 1986; Wall
1998).</p>

<p>
The second justification for the doctrine of public reason is the
Civic Friendship Argument. On this view, we can justify the doctrine
by appeal to its role in enabling citizens jointly to maintain just
institutions, and thereby realise a form of <em>civic friendship</em>.
Public reason is central to this task since the <em>joint pursuit</em>
of justice is possible only if citizens “affirm the same
political conception of justice” and so “share one very
basic political end” (Rawls 1996: 202).</p>

<p>
Political autonomy and civic friendship are distinct ideals. Unlike
political autonomy, civic friendship is an essentially common
good—its benefits cannot be enjoyed by an individual in
isolation but can be enjoyed only with others. Only citizens who
relate to each other in a particular way—that is, as joint
pursuers of a shared conception of justice—can enjoy this kind
of civic friendship (Rawls 1996: 204; Leland &amp; Wietmarschen
2017; Lister 2013; Ebels-Duggan 2010; Schwarzenbach 1996, 2005; Watson &amp; Hartley 2018).
Elaborating upon the idea of essentially common goods, Rawls
writes,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
That there should be such a political and social good is no more
mysterious than that members of an orchestra, or players on a team, or
even both teams in a game, should take pleasure and a certain (proper)
pride in a good performance, or in a play of the game, one that they
will want to remember (Rawls 1996: 204).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The success of the Civic Friendship Argument depends upon two claims.
The first is that it is not possible, or at least it is much more
difficult, for citizens to realise civic friendship in ways other than
by upholding the doctrine of public reason. Some deny this claim,
instead maintaining that forms of democracy that do not uphold the
doctrine of public reason can fare equally as well in this regard
(Billingham 2016; Caney 1995). The second is that citizens’
interest in realising civic friendship is sufficiently weighty so as
to justify the kind of restraint imposed by the doctrine of public
reason (Caney 1995).</p>

<p>
The third justification of the doctrine of public reason is the
Stability Argument. This argument emphasizes the alleged psychological
fact that citizens are more likely to support principles and
institutions that they themselves see as just (Rawls 1996:
140–4; Weithman 2011). This implies that, if we want to extend
the life-expectancy of our institutions, then we should favour
principles and institutions that will predictably generate their own
support (Freeman 2007b: ch. 3). This counts in favour of the doctrine
of public reason, whose defining claim is that we may appeal only to
those reasons that we can reasonably expect others to endorse.</p>

<p>
Unlike the previous two arguments, the Stability Argument is purely
instrumental. Its sees citizens’ support of the principles and
institutions to which they are subject as valuable only insofar as
it enhances the stability of those principles and institutions. Of
course, this is not to say that stability is always valuable: instead,
the stability of a set of institutions is valuable only if
those institutions meet other moral standards, such as if they treat
citizens justly.</p>

<h3 id="DoctPublRule">3.2 The Doctrine of Public Rules</h3>

<p>
Whereas the doctrine of public reason restricts the reasons to which
we may appeal, the doctrine of public rules regulates the character of
the requirements that principles of justice may
 produce.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-65" id="ref-65">65</a>]</sup>
 More specifically, it states that we have weighty reasons to prefer
principles of justice that can serve as a public standard, in the
senses that they are (i) not self-effacing; and yield demands (ii)
that are sufficiently determinate and accessible, and (iii) compliance
with which is sufficiently verifiable to others (Rawls 1996:
66–67; Rawls 1999a: 48–49; see also Williams 1998: 233).
We explain each of these properties in turn.</p>

<p>
First, principles of justice provide a public standard only if they
are <em>not self-effacing</em> - that is, only if the success of the
principles from which the rules derive does not depend upon some
citizens being ignorant of these principles, or upon some citizens
being ignorant of others’ knowledge of these principles (see
 <a href="#SidgCeliLyin">section 1.3.1</a>).
 In other words, the idea of publicity requires mutual knowledge, and
not mere general knowledge (see
 <a href="#KantHypoPublTest">section 1.1</a>).
 In clarifying what he means by a public system of rules, Rawls
writes,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
I mean then that everyone engaged in it knows what he would know if
these rules and his participation in the activity they define were the
result of an agreement… He also knows that the others know this
and that they know that he knows this, and so on (1999a:
 48).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-66" id="ref-66">66</a>]</sup></p>
 </blockquote>

<p>
Second, principles of justice provide a public standard only if they
provide sufficiently determinate and accessible standards of moral
permissibility, such that a “person taking part in an
institution knows what the rules demand of him” (Rawls 1999a:
48). This has two components. First, principles pass the <em>test of
determinacy</em> only if they are not so vague that they are incapable
of producing clear
 directives.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-67" id="ref-67">67</a>]</sup>
 Second, principles pass the <em>test of accessibility</em> not merely
when citizens can attain knowledge of how they would be required to
act if they were to have the relevant empirical information, but
instead only if citizens are in fact able to attain knowledge of that
empirical information (Rawls 1996: 182; Lippert-Rasmussen 2008:
41).</p>

<p>
Third, principles of justice provide a public standard only if
compliance with their demands is sufficiently <em>verifiable to
others</em>. For Rawls, what matters is not only that “the
institutions of the basic structure are just” but also that
“everyone recognizes this” (1996: 66). This
<em>test of verifiable compliance</em> therefore requires the
possibility of widespread knowledge of the extent to which citizens
discharge their duties. This test is most plausibly understood as an
<em>aggregative</em> one. For example, the duty not to litter is verifiable to
others in virtue of the fact that we can attain knowledge of the
extent to which others <em>on aggregate</em> refrain from littering,
even though we may not be able to attain knowledge of the extent to
which any given citizen refrains from
 littering.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-68" id="ref-68">68</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
Rawls appeals to the doctrine of public rules in order to justify
several features of his view, including the idea that the principles
of justice should govern the distribution of social primary goods
rather than the distribution of welfare. Part of what justifies this
verdict is that, because it is not feasible accurately to measure
welfare, principles that refer to welfare fail the test of
accessibility. Accordingly, these principles “run afoul of the
[publicity] constraint”, such that “In political life
citizens cannot sensibly apply or follow it” (Rawls 1996:
182 n. 11; Rawls 1999b: 13 n. 3). Because of this, principles of
justice that govern the distribution of welfare abrogate their chief
purpose, which is “to provide a publicly recognized point of
view from which all citizens can examine before one another whether
their political and social institutions are just” (Rawls
1996: 9).</p>

<p>
In the same vein, Andrew Williams writes,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
…we have reason to reject conceptions of justice which, given
the fact of limited information, are too epistemically demanding to be
public and stable. We should, like Rawls, favour conceptions whose
scope is restricted to publicly accessible phenomena (1998: 245).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
An implication of the doctrine of public rules, therefore, is that we
have reasons to object to highly epistemically demanding principles of
justice that fail the tests of determinacy, accessibility, and/or
verifiable compliance. As an example of this, let us consider G.A.
Cohen’s claim that justice requires citizens to internalize an
<em>egalitarian ethos</em> that condemns self-serving behaviour and,
subject to a personal prerogative and special labour burdens, requires
citizens to be guided by a concern for the least advantaged when
making occupational choices (2008: part 1). Rejecting this possibility
on the grounds that it violates the doctrine of public rules, Williams
writes that </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
it is quite possible that, in typical cases, we will lack a
sufficiently precise public standard by which to justify, or
criticize, each other’s self-serving behavior (1998: 240). </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This is because, in order to calculate whether a citizen is acting in
accordance with the demands with the egalitarian ethos, we would need
to know which occupation available to her best serves the interests of
the least advantaged, as well as whether her choice to pursue an
alternative occupation would be protected by either her personal
prerogative or a concern for special labour burdens.</p>

<p>
The success of Williams’s reply to Cohen depends partly upon the
existence of weighty reasons to endorse the doctrine of public rules.
For this reason, we shall now turn our attention to the various
arguments in defence of this doctrine. In particular, we highlight
three distinct justifications, each of which corresponds to an
argument in defence of the doctrine of public reason.</p>

<p>
The Political Autonomy Argument justifies the doctrine of public rules
by appeal to its role in protecting political autonomy (Williams 1998:
244). If citizens have no clear sense of what the principles of
justice demand of them, then they lack awareness of the moral
constraints to which they are subject, and so are prevented from
freely identifying with those constraints. A similar threat to
political autonomy arises when principles of justice fail the test of
verifiable compliance. If citizens are freely to identify with the
constraints to which they are subject, it is important that they can
recognise these constraints as a product of others’ compliance
with principles of justice.</p>

<p>
The second justification is the Civic Friendship Argument, according
to which we should uphold the doctrine of public rules because of the
role it plays in realising civic friendship (Williams 1998: 244).
According to this view, civic friendship can exist within a society
only when citizens are able justifiably to regard themselves and
others (<em>and</em> justifiably be regarded by themselves and others)
as doing what is necessary to sustain reasonably fair terms of social
cooperation. Publicity facilitates each of these ends. Just as members
of an orchestra are denied a common good when they cannot hear, or
otherwise appreciate, their own or others’ contributions to
their joint performance, so too citizens are denied the good of civic
friendship when they are denied awareness of their own or
others’ compliance with the principles of justice.</p>

<p>
Finally, the Stability Argument justifies the doctrine of public rules
on the grounds that its acceptance enhances “the long-term
probability of a society conforming with its conceptions of
justice” (Williams 1998: 244). Again, this instrumental argument
relies upon the alleged psychological fact that citizens are more
likely to support principles and institutions that they perceive as
just (Rawls 1996: 140–4). This supports the doctrine of
public rules insofar as citizens are more likely to perceive
principles and institutions as just when the demands of justice are
sufficiently determinate and accessible, and compliance with them is
sufficiently verifiable to others (for objections: Caney 1995;
Lippert-Rasmussen 2008: 45–46).</p>

<h3 id="GoodFaitEffoObje">3.3 The Good Faith Efforts Objection</h3>

<p>
The most sustained critique of the doctrine of public rules comes from
G.A. Cohen (2008: ch. 8). Though he advances a number of distinct
objections to the doctrine, for reasons of space we shall focus on
only one element of his analysis, in which he disputes the claim that
principles of justice must pass tests of determinacy, accessibility,
and of verifiable compliance. Cohen denies that, in order to be valid,
principles of justice must be capable of serving as a public standard.
Instead, he maintains that we can rely solely upon citizens’
<em>good faith efforts.</em> This is the Good Faith Efforts Objection
(Casal 2015; Lippert-Rasmussen 2015: ch. 8).</p>

<p>
In support of this objection, let us consider a gender egalitarian
ethos that condemns women having to do more housework than men, for no
good reason. As with Cohen’s egalitarian ethos, this ethos may
fail to provide a public standard by which to justify and to criticize
our own and others’ sexist behaviour. This is because, in order
to determine whether a husband who refuses to do the washing up
because of backache is acting in accordance with the demands of the
gender egalitarian ethos, we would need to know how severe his
backache is, as well as to compare the other domestic burdens that he
has borne with those that his wife bears. This makes the gender
egalitarian ethos highly epistemically demanding, such that it may
fail the tests of determinacy, accessibility, and/or verifiable
compliance (Cohen 2008: 359–60). However, it is intuitively
implausible to reject the gender egalitarian ethos on this basis.
Rather, in this case, justice requires “good-faith efforts, not
omniscience” (Casal 2015:
 822).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-69" id="ref-69">69</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
Cohen offers a second case in support of the Good Faith Efforts
Objection:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
During World War II in Britain, a social ethos induced people to
sacrifice personal interests for the sake of the war effort, and
everyone was expected, as a matter of justice, to “do his
bit,” to shoulder his just share. It is absurd to suppose that
someone could have stated precisely what amount of sacrifice that
injunction required, and it is true, therefore, that, with respect to
many people, one couldn’t tell, and with respect to some, they
couldn’t even themselves tell, whether they were sacrificing on
the required scale (2008: 353).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Cohen maintains that, rather than reject such an ethos on the grounds
that it is inconsistent with the demands of the doctrine of public
rules, we should instead abandon the latter. What matters in these
cases, Cohen thinks, is that citizens are able to make “a
reasonably efficacious societywide <em>good faith effort</em>”
(2008: 352 [emphasis in original]).</p>

<p>
In reply to this objection, proponents of the doctrine of public rules
might circumscribe their claims, holding that we should prefer
principles of justice that provide a public standard <em>only under
certain conditions</em>. One possibility is to relinquish the doctrine
of public rules in those cases in which citizens are required to bear
costs that are much smaller than the benefits generated by good faith
efforts to comply with those principles. This would explain why the
indeterminacy, inaccessibility, and lack of verifiable compliance is
not troubling in the two cases we have just considered. In the first,
the gender egalitarian ethos requires citizens to bear minimal costs
in the fight against sexism; and in the second, Cohen’s
sacrifice ethos requires citizens to bear potentially larger costs,
but the reward is enormous.</p>

<p>
This would not amount to an abandonment of the doctrine of public
rules. Rather, according to this reply, we should prefer principles of
justice that provide a public standard, except when there is not this
discrepancy in costs. As the costs that citizens are required to bear
increase in comparison with the benefits they are required to
generate, it becomes increasingly important that citizens know both
what their duties demand of them and the extent to which others
discharge their duties.</p>

<p>
Two reasons support this conviction. First, without determinate and
accessible standards of moral permissibility, there is a risk that
some citizens will make larger sacrifices than what is morally
required of them. When the costs involved are comparatively high, this
is likely to be unfair. To illustrate this unfairness, we can consider
the case of an individual who internalises the egalitarian ethos, and
who takes on some gruelling occupation only because she fails to
recognise that, because of her personal prerogative, she would be
morally justified in pursuing a more enjoyable occupation. </p>

<p>
Second, it is sometimes reasonable for a citizen who makes
considerable sacrifices to have <em>assurance</em> that other citizens
are discharging their duties. This is because she knows that she is
not being exploited by non-compliers, and because she knows that, if
she were not to make such sacrifices, she would be free-riding on
benefits that others’ compliance brings (Mason 2012: 541).
Again, these concerns are likely to be more powerful when sacrifices
required of citizens are comparatively high.</p>

<p>
This reply to the Good Faith Efforts Objection is incomplete in
multiple ways. Proponents of this reply must specify the implications
of their views in a larger range of cases, including those in which
the costs and benefits involved are of comparatively equal values
(both high and low). Moreover, it also remains important to explain
more precisely how this reply relates to the three justifications for
the doctrine of public rules that we considered above. Meeting these
challenges is central to establishing the plausibility of the doctrine
of public rules.</p>

<h2 id="Conc">4. Conclusion</h2>

<p>
We began our exploration by looking at Kant’s hypothetical publicity
test. We asked ourselves whether there were good reasons to believe
that hypothetical publicity should be considered a sound requirement
to test maxims of action. We also wondered whether hypothetical
publicity entailed significant restrictions from the point of view of
actual publicity. The answer appears to be rather negative in both
cases. For, <em>first</em>, there does not seem to be any intrinsic
relationship between self-frustratingness and justice. To put things
in another way, the less the effect of publicity is contingent, the
more we can doubt about its validity as a test of justice. And
<em>second</em>, if no criterion is provided as to the level of
generality at which the Kantian test should operate, we run both risks
of under- and over-exclusiveness. Which maxims of action should be
deemed unjust is therefore left rather undefined by the test in most
cases.</p>

<p>
While it is unclear whether the Kantian hypothetical publicity test
could (and should) be rescued, there is no doubt that actual publicity
issues raise very interesting philosophical challenges. One of them
has to do with the articulation between, on the one hand, the function
that political philosophy ascribes to voting, representation and
deliberation, and, on the other hand, the types of effects that could
be expected from going public. In the course of our discussion, we
also tried to draw parallels and to identify differences between
voters and their representatives (e.g., through the idea of horizontal
accountability) and between the voting and the deliberation debate.
The meaning of the publicity requirement may differ significantly as
well when we compare standard representative bodies (e.g.,
parliaments) with the civil service or with “independent”
bodies acting within a democratic context (e.g., central banks or
courts). Publicity in the latter case is likely to have both a meaning
and consequences quite different from the ones attached to public
deliberation, e.g., in a parliament’s plenary session.</p>

<p>
Moreover, while we certainly did not question the possibility of
developing <em>principled</em> views in the field of actual publicity,
<em>factual</em> assumptions present in most of the key arguments in
this respect (e.g., in those of J.S. Mill or Elster) require more
extensive empirical research. The results that we reported from some
of these empirical investigations are potentially rich in consequences
for our normative theories. The data gathered by Naurin (2004) and
Meade &amp; Stasavage (2008) are especially important in this respect.
As is the case with other issues in political philosophy, there is
certainly a need here for philosophers to engage in a dialogue with
social scientists.</p>

<p>
Finally, we briefly presented Rawls’s uses of the idea of publicity.
The variety of ways in which he refers to it certainly shows the need
for a more substantial mapping enterprise, at a strictly conceptual
level. This could in turn indicate reasons to develop philosophical
arguments in new directions.</p>
