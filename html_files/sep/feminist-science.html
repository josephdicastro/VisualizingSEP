<h1>Feminist Perspectives on Science</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Wed Dec 23, 2009; substantive revision Tue Mar 31, 2015</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>

Feminists have a number of distinct interests in, and perspectives
on, science. The tools of science have been a crucial resource for
understanding the nature, impact, and prospects for changing
gender-based forms of oppression; in this spirit, feminists actively
draw on, and contribute to, the research programs of a wide range of
sciences. At the same time, feminists have identified the sciences as both a
source and a locus of gender inequalities: the institutions of
science have a long tradition of excluding women as practitioners;
feminist critics of science find that women and gender (or, more
broadly, issues of concern to women and sex/gender minorities) are
routinely marginalized as subjects of scientific inquiry, or are
treated in ways that reproduce gender-normative stereotypes; and,
closing the circle, scientific authority has frequently served to
rationalize the kinds of social roles and institutions that feminists
call into question.</p>

<p> Feminist perspectives on science therefore reflect a broad
spectrum of epistemic attitudes toward and appraisals of
science. These perspectives range from urging the reform of gender
inequities in the institutions of science by calling attention to the
underrepresentation of women or neglected questions while still
embracing the standards and practices of the sciences they engage, to
critical and constructive alternative programs of research that, to
varying degrees, aim at transforming the framework assumptions,
methodologies, substantive content, and epistemic ideals that shape
the sciences. The content of these perspectives, and the degree to
which they generate transformation depends not only on the types of
philosophical and political commitments that inform them but also on
the nature of the sciences and their subject domains. Feminist
perspectives appear to have had greater impact on sciences that deal
with objects of inquiry that are understood as gendered—those in
the social and human sciences—and, secondarily, on sciences
where the objects of inquiry are often characterized in gendered
terms, metaphorically or by analogy (projectively gendered
subjects)—chiefly the biological and life sciences. Feminist
perspectives are relevant to sciences that deal with non-gendered
subject matters, but perspectives vary substantially in content and in
critical import depending on the sciences and the particular research
programs they engage.</p>

<h2><a name="DimDifAmoFemPerSci">1. Dimensions of Difference among Feminist Perspectives on Science</a></h2>

<p> Feminist scientists, critics, and analysts of science articulate
positions that range from profound ambivalence to respect and
enthusiasm for the sciences. At the critical end of this spectrum lie
such famous indictments of science as Virginia Woolf's declaration:
“science, it would seem, is not sexless: he is a man, a father
and infected too” (1938). Lorraine Code expresses a similar view
at the meta-scientific level. She argues that many of the
epistemological ideals that inform science have androcentric origins
and that once subjected to feminist scrutiny these ideals are found to
be in need of reconstruction (1991, 314; 1993, 20). The worry here is
that the sciences are not just superficially or inadvertently
androcentric—male-centered in the questions they ask, in their
claims and practice, their institutions and authority, their
implications for the lives of women and for those marginalized within
normative sex/gender systems—but are fundamentally sexist; they
embody deep and systematic gender bias by which women, and any
interests, perspectives, or insights associated with them, are
disvalued and marginalized. On this view the sciences are
“master's tools,” to use Audre Lorde's phrase (1984), that
will inevitably subvert attempts to turn them to emancipatory or, at
least, non-oppressive ends.</p>

<p> In fact, such implacably negative views of science are more often
attributed to feminists than embraced by them. The claim that
feminists are categorically hostile to science appears to derive from
a conviction that feminism, as a political stance, is inimical to
science. On this view, the distinctive objectivity of the sciences
depends on shielding scientific inquiry from the influence of
contextual (non-epistemic) values and interests of just the sort that
feminists would bring to bear. However, such an understanding of the
objectivity of science begs the question of the role of values in
science and assumes a clear distinction between epistemic and
non-epistemic values. Since the late twentieth century research
exploring the role of values in science —undertaken by both
feminist scholars and those who do not explicitly identify as feminist
—suggest a more nuanced understanding of how epistemic and
non-epistemic values interact and shape science in a variety of ways,
including setting research agendas, evaluating evidence, and
justifying theories (see for example Douglas 2009; Kitcher 2003, 2011;
Lacey 1999; Longino 1990, 2002, 2012; Solomon 2001). However, even if
one holds a traditional understanding that good science should not
incorporate non-epistemic values, except perhaps in the choice of
research questions, it does not follow from feminist
critiques—of scientific institutions, the authority vested in
the disciplines identified as scientific, framework assumptions, or
specific methodologies and research results—that feminists are
hostile to the sciences, to the epistemic ideals presumed to underpin
the sciences, or to the diverse assumptions and methods associated
with specific research traditions. </p>

<p>Many feminists embrace (and defend) the orienting ideals and
tradition-specific conventions associated with the fields in which
they work. Some focus chiefly on equity issues, often insisting that
gender bias in the institutions of science does not bear on issues of
content or method (see the section
 <a href="#FemEquCri">Feminist Equity Critiques</a>). 
 Others make a case for redefining research priorities
without challenging existing research traditions; they aim to extend
well established modes of inquiry to questions that have not been
asked and to aspects of otherwise well mapped subject domains that
have been neglected but that are of particular interest to women and
feminists. This selective appropriation of the tools and methods of
science as they have been traditionally understood also serves
critical ends when feminists use them to expose and correct gender
bias in the content of favored models and theories or background
assumptions. Advocates of these “successor science”
projects, as Sandra Harding describes them (1986, 160, 240), often
endorse the very epistemic ideals of value freedom and objectivity
feminists have been accused of repudiating.  They insist that feminist
critiques of and contributions to the sciences should be taken
seriously precisely because they represent better science, in a
traditional sense. </p>

<p>
In practice these more circumscribed feminist critiques of
science—equity critiques, arguments for applying the tools of
science to new research questions, localized critiques of sexism or
androcentrism in specific claims or methods, and remedial research
designed to correct these omissions or biases—often lead to more
profound epistemic/methodological, ontological/theoretical, and
socio-political questions about the sciences than their advocates
(initially) intend (see the sections
 <a href="#SelAppConCri">From Selective Appropriation to Content Critique</a>,
 <a href="#FemMetDeb">The Feminist Method Debate</a>, and
 <a href="#PhiImp">Philosophical Implications</a>). 
Even epistemically conservative
critiques expose a depth and pervasiveness of gender bias in our best
science as well as in manifestly bad science (Harding 1986, 19,
102–105), calling into question the neutrality of the conceptual
frameworks within which scientists work and, by extension, the
capacity of standard research methodologies to ensure the objectivity
they claim. Consequently feminist critique anywhere along the spectrum
of epistemic attitudes can and has led to more radical re-evaluation
of the standards of good science, including questions about the
neutrality of method and what is meant by the objectivity of
science. Conversely, new questions lead to new research strategies,
new categories of analysis, and an expanded repertoire of explanatory
hypotheses, which frequently result in research programs that chart
new domains of inquiry
(see the section
 <a href="#SelAppConCri">From Selective Appropriation to Content Critique</a>).
In the end, feminist initiatives often
reshape scientific practice and in the process challenge its orienting ideals (see 
the section
 <a href="#PhiImp">Philosophical Implications</a>).</p>

<p>

It is epistemically significant that critical reflections on these
feminist interventions in the sciences, undertaken internally by
practitioners and by external commentators and scholars, suggest that
the interests and “angle of vision” that feminists bring to
bear on the sciences can play a constructive role in exposing error,
raising evidential standards, and generating innovative insights both 
within and about science (see the section
 <a href="#SelAppConCri">From Selective Appropriation to Content Critique</a>).
Hence feminist critique can pose a fundamental challenge to the
conviction that non-epistemic and/or contingent contextual values
unavoidably corrupt the capacity of science to generate credible
knowledge. What constructive as well as critical feminist engagements
demonstrate is that non-epistemic and/or contextual values are not
only ineliminable from scientific practice, but are instrumental to
its empirical and explanatory success, including its capacity to
interrupt entrenched patterns of understanding (see the section
 <a href="#PhiImp">Philosophical Implications</a>). The central
epistemic challenge for feminists then is to conceptualize what counts
as success in scientific inquiry in terms that realistically capture
both its capacity to generate empirically rigorous, explanatorily
probative knowledge and its context-specificity (see the sections
 <a href="#FemMetDeb">The Feminist Method Debate</a>
and <a href="#PhiImp">Philosophical Implications</a> below). The
usefulness of the sciences to feminists—the emancipatory promise
of scientific inquiry as a resource for understanding and changing
sex/gender inequities — depends precisely on this paradoxical
epistemic character of empirical inquiry: that the sciences are a
thoroughly social, human undertaking bearing the marks of their
context of origin and the interests of their practitioners, yet with
the capacity to challenge—to critically transform—the very
assumptions, interests, and beliefs that constitute these contexts and
motivate scientific inquiry.</p>

<p>The diversity evident in the various feminist perspectives on
science arises, then, on several dimensions:</p>
      
<ul>
<li>feminists engage the sciences as practitioners operating within
particular sciences intent on improving their field; as science
studies scholars of various kinds interested in understanding the
histories, social dynamics, and epistemic norms that animate sciences;
as external commentators concerned with issues of accountability and
with the impact of science on society, specifically on women and
gender minorities;</li>

<li>feminists focus on distinct aspects of science: its institutions;
its methods and underlying epistemic commitments; its content, ranging
from highly specific models and empirical claims to quite general
framework assumptions (ontological, theoretical, and epistemic);</li>

<li>feminist critiques of sexist or androcentric content take
different forms depending on the nature of the science and its subject
domain (e.g., whether it is thought to be intrinsically gendered,
projectively gendered, or gender-neutral);</li>

<li>feminists adopt a range of epistemic stances: some embrace quite
conventional ideals of objectivity, evidence, and justification while
others reject these epistemic presuppositions; some insist that a
distinctive, new approach is required while others bring established
philosophical perspectives to bear in articulating alternative
epistemologies;</li>

<li>the level of abstraction at which feminist perspectives on the
sciences are formulated varies considerably, from critiques and
interventions that are specific to particular research programs and
the claims they generate, to conceptual analysis of overarching
theoretical/ontological commitments and orienting ideals.</li>
</ul>

<p> The result is, not surprisingly, a highly diverse array of
feminist perspectives on science.</p>

<h2><a name="FemEquCri">2. Feminist Equity Critiques</a></h2>

<p>

Feminists have challenged both the presumption that the sciences are
an inherently masculine domain—that women are unfit for science,
or science unfit for women—and the conviction that the
institutions of science are a model of gender-neutral
meritocracy. Feminist historians of science document entrenched
historical patterns of exclusion of women while, at the same time,
recovering evidence of women's active participation in the sciences,
often in the face of stiff resistance. Analyses of the gendered
structure of contemporary science undermine gender-conventional
explanations of the continued marginality of women and show that
inequalities persist in the representation, recognition, and effective
integration of women into science, even as they gain access to the
“training pipeline,” demonstrate an aptitude for
scientific training, and make substantial contributions to the
sciences.</p>

<p>

The historical research on women in science suggests that the
masculine profile of the sciences, as they have developed in
Euro-American contexts in the last 300 years, was by no means
monolithic or inevitable. For example, Londa Schiebinger argues that
elite women and women involved in traditions of craft production in
the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries played an active role in the
early formation of the sciences. The best known are noblewomen like
Queen Christina of Sweden (1626–1689), Margaret Cavendish, the
Duchess of Newcastle (1623–1673), and Madame du Chatelet
(1706–1749), all of whom made contributions recognized by their
peers but were denied membership in the scientific academies that were
taking shape in their day. The emerging New Science “st[ood] at
a fork in the road” with respect to the inclusion of women,
Schiebinger argues (1989, 100), but as it became established it was
defined by monastic university traditions and associations of
aristocratic men that not only excluded women but, more generally,
purged all things feminine (Schiebinger 1989, 9, chapter 8).  The
major academies of science excluded women: Marie Curie
(1867–1934) was denied membership in the French Academie des
Sciences in 1911 despite being the first person to win two Nobel
Prizes (in 1903 and 1911); the U.S. National Academy of Sciences
admitted its first woman (Florence R. Sabin) in 1925, but it was not
until 1962 that the French Academie elected Marguerite Perey, an
assistant to Marie Curie, as a correspondent of the Academie (Ramey
1992; Schiebinger 1989, 2).  After the 1860s, when women were first
admitted to universities and colleges, they slowly gained access to
training in the sciences. By the 1940s there were “thousands of
… women working in a variety of fields and institutions,
whereas sixty or seventy years earlier there were about ten at a few
early women's colleges” (Rossiter 1982, xviii).  This was an
achievement realized by “the best efforts of a host of talented
women, who, seeing how both science and women's roles were changing
around them, took steps to carve out a legitimate place for themselves
in the new order” (Rossiter 1982, xviii). Nonetheless, these
gains came at the price of what Margaret Rossiter describes as
“a pattern of segregated employment and underrecognition”
which few women escaped (Rossiter 1982, xviii); they served
predominantly as technicians, assistants, or “computers,”
and populated women's colleges and schools of home
economics. Moreover, these gains proved to be vulnerable. The
“new order” suffered a sharp downturn in the 1950s, when
conventional views about the social roles appropriate for women
regained prominence and women's participation in the sciences
declined, as in paid jobs and the professional workforce generally, in
the post-war years. It was another twenty years before women regained
the levels of representation they had achieved in the sciences in the
1920s and 1930s.</p>

<p>

Second wave feminist activism was instrumental in regaining and
building on the educational gains realized by first wave feminism.
These challenges to the continuing marginalization of women, in the
sciences as in many other spheres of professional and public life,
resulted in landmark legislation in the late 1960s and early 1970s
that mandated equal opportunity in employment and education; chief
among these were the Title IX Education Amendments of 1972 that
extended the Equal Pay Act of 1963 to higher education (Rossiter 1995,
382). Women have since made dramatic gains, doubling and quadrupling
their representation in college and graduate programs in science, and
among employed scientists and engineers. Taking all the science and
engineering disciplines together (the NAS includes social and life
sciences, as well as physical science and engineering), women have
received 25% or more of the PhD's awarded in the sciences for the last
thirty years; since 2000, they have accounted for more than 50% of the
bachelor's degrees awarded in the sciences. In 2006 women were awarded
40% of the doctorates in the sciences and engineering (National
Science Foundation, Division of Science Resource Statistics, Survey of
Doctorate Recipients 2006). The distribution of degrees by discipline
illustrates more clearly where the majority of these gains have
been. “[W]omen earned almost half the doctorates in earth,
atmospheric, and ocean sciences, chemistry, and math; and
approximately one-fifth of the doctorates in computer science,
engineering, and physics”(AAUW 2010, 12). </p>

<p>Since the mid-1980s, however, there has been growing concern that
these gains for women in the science training “pipeline”
have not been translating into comparable improvements in their
representation in faculties of science and in “leadership
positions” in the sciences (NAS 2007, ix); as one commentator
put it in 2000, thirty years after the formal barriers to women's
participation had been struck down, the representation of women among
full professors was still less than 10%, well below what you would
expect given “the number of doctorates awarded … [and]
the number of years it takes to move from PhD to full professor”
(Greenwood 2000, 19). In academia as a whole, women continue to be
concentrated in the most insecure positions and at the lowest ranks of
the academic hierarchy; despite their growing representation in the
PhD training pipeline, this “inverted pyramid” pattern of
distribution—a primary target of feminist challenges to
educational and employment inequities in the 1960s—has proven to
be stubbornly resistant to change. This pattern of distribution is
especially clear in the sciences. 19.4% of full professors in science
and engineering are women compared with 25% across all fields. This
disparity is amplified at the top research institutions where women
make up only 16% of full professors in science and
engineering. “If we compare the percentage of tenured female
faculty in 2006 with the percentage of STEM doctorates awarded to
women in 1996 (allowing 10 years for an individual to start an
academic job and earn tenure), in most STEM fields the drop-off is
pronounced. ...Even in fields like biology, where women now receive
about one-half of doctorates and received 42 percent in 1996, women
make up less than one-quarter of tenured faculty and only 34 percent
of tenure-track faculty in 2006” (AAUW 2010, 17). This pattern
is reflected in salary differences and other professional rewards, in
disparities in types of appointment and in rates of promotion, even
when a range of other variables—e.g., institutional type,
measures of productivity, discipline—are taken into account
(Ginther 2004; West and Curtis 2006, 12).</p>

<p>

The question of how to explain these persistent inequalities in the
representation of women in the sciences has been the focus of intense
controversy. Conventional accounts typically invoke the talents,
drive, and preferences of women. For example, in 1979 Jonathan Cole
argued that inequities in the employment status, compensation, and
reputational standing of women in the sciences are best explained in
terms of their self-selection out of the training pipeline and, when
they persist in professional careers, by lower levels of productivity
that cannot be accounted for by marital or parental status; in short,
women conform to gender-conventional expectations even if they get the
necessary training. In a statement that generated intense public
debate twenty-five years later (2005), Larry Summers (who was then the
president of Harvard) reiterated these intuitions without the backing
of any systematic analysis of the kind Cole presented, and without
responding to the wide range of critiques and reassessments that have
substantially undermined Cole's claims in the intervening twenty-five
years. From the outset, feminists challenged both the specifics of
Cole's analysis and the assumptions that informed it noting the
difficulty of disentangling the influence of the environment in which
women make choices from their “natural”
inclinations. Through the 1980s, a growing body of grass-roots,
activist research documented what came to be known as the
“chilly climate” for women in academic institutions (Hall
and Sandler 1982; The Chilly Collective 1995; Wylie, Jakobsen, Fosado
2008). While overt, intentional discrimination was by no means a thing
of the past, what these reports documented were the debilitating
effects for women of having to negotiate a “host of subtle
personal and social barriers” that run along lines of gender
difference and that often operate “below the level of awareness
of both men and women” (Sandler 1986, 17; Hall and Sandler 1982,
2984). The sorts of mechanisms reported in these studies include, for
example, the patterns of exclusion of women from informal mentoring
and communication networks within the profession and the workplace;
gender-normative work assignments that channel women into heavy
advising, undergraduate teaching, and into administrative positions
that carry substantial organizational responsibility but little
decision-making power; gendered patterns of evaluation bias by which,
for example, the accomplishments of women are more readily attributed
to luck or external factors while those of men are treated as evidence
of talent, training, and hard work (for an overview, see Wylie 1995;
Wylie, Jakobsen, Fosado 2008).</p>

<p>

The insights central to these reports and pamphlets came to
prominence when the authors of the 1999 MIT report on the Status of
Women in the Faculty of Science declared that women continue to face
gender discrimination in this “post-civil rights era” but
that it does not operate through the formal, overt barriers to
participation that had mobilized activists in the 1960s. It takes the
form of diffuse but persistent differences in recognition and response:
“a pattern of powerful but unrecognized attitudes and assumptions
that work systematically against women despite good will” (MIT
1999, 11). The MIT study documented systematic differences in such
tangibles as salary and merit increments, institutional responses to
external job offers, internal support for research, and the allocation
of office and laboratory space, as well as more subtle differences in
service expectations, teaching assignments, and the influence women
have over decisions that affect their worklife. Although
“micro-inequities” in these various areas may each seem
trivial, taken individually, they translate into patterns of
devaluation and marginalization that amplify through the trajectory of
a career. The MIT study reports an age-related pattern of gender
differences that is corroborated by a growing number of quantitative
studies of gender difference in scientists' career trajectories
(e.g., Ginther 2004; Sonnert and Holton 1995; Xie and Shauman 2003);
small initial differences (in salary, initial appointment, workload)
are compounded in ways that have a substantial cumulative impact on the
quality of women's work lives and their effectiveness in the
workplace, and result in significant differences in their career
outcomes compared to those of similarly well trained and accomplished
men (MIT 1999, 8). These forms of “subtle” discrimination are
now the primary target of initiatives designed to redress what the
Chair of the NAS Committee describes as a “needless waste of the
nation's scientific talent” (Shalala, in NAS 2007, ix). For
example, they figure prominently in the arguments for extending Title
IX requirements for equal opportunity in education to science training
programs (Rolison 2000, Zare 2006), that had, in the past, chiefly been
applied to inequities in support for women's
sports. They are also addressed by projects designed to foster
“institutional transformation” that have been funded by the
National Science Foundation ADVANCE program (the Program for the
Advancement of Women in Academic Science and Engineering Careers);
these include a range of strategies for counteracting gender-based
evaluation bias in the allocation of resources, in the review of
researchers' credentials at the point of hiring, promotion and
tenure, and in a range of other decision making processes (for links to
ADVANCE projects see “Internet Resources” below).</p>

<p>

The 2010 AAUW report, <i>Why So Few? Women in Science, Technology,
Engineering, and Mathematics</i>, reviews these issues and makes
recommendations to counteract such inequities in science
education. The report identifies three themes that persist in
conventional explanations of the gender disparities in STEM
fields. The first is the idea that there are innate sex-linked
differences in talent —specifically that men typically have
better mathematical skills and that these are required for success in
STEM fields. The second is the idea that both drive and preferences
differ by gender—that girls are simply less interested in STEM
disciplines and so do not choose to pursue STEM careers. The third is
related to the sorts of micro-inequities described in the MIT study,
revolving around the workplace, including both explicit and implicit
biases within the workplace and life-work balance issues that are
thought to drive women out of STEM fields. As detailed above, these
conventional themes resurface periodically in the discussion of gender
inequities in STEM fields suggesting an inevitability of the status
quo. The AAUW report challenges each of these standard explanations in
turn and makes suggestions designed to address features of STEM
education that seem likely to contribute to this persistent gender
disparity. This and the other studies and recommendations described
above are good examples of the ways that scientific research has been
brought to bear on issues of gender equity.</p>

<p>
The shift of attention away from overt discrimination and towards the
cumulative effects of small scale disadvantages that exist in everyday
interactions in the social fabric of scientific institutions,
education, and culture more generally represents a highly
consequential reframing of the issues with which advocates for gender
equity in the sciences have been struggling for several decades. It
converges on, and increasingly draws inspiration and empirical
grounding from, several lines of demographic, experimental (social
psychological), and sociological research that have been developing
since the late 1970s. Yu Xie and Kimberlee Shauman (2003) decisively
challenge Cole's claim that women demonstrate a productivity deficit
unrelated to marital or parental status (2003, chapter 9), and they
call into question the reliance in later gender equity research on a
rigid “pipeline” metaphor, arguing that a less linear life
course model provides a better framework for recognizing the more
complex patterns of delayed entry, short-term withdrawal and reentry
evident in the scientific training and career paths typical for many
women (2003, 6–9). The experimental work of cognitive
psychologists and social psychologists delineates a set of
mechanisms—in the form of cognitive schemas and other heuristics
that play a role in automatic cognitive processing—that operate
below the threshold of conscious awareness, generating patterns of
evaluation bias that track not only gender but also race/ethnicity and
a range of other dimensions along which social inequality is
constituted (Steele 1998; Valian 1999).</p>

<p>
Finally, a number of ambitious longitudinal and cohort studies have
put sociologists and historians of science in a position to refine
models of the complex processes by which the
“micro-inequities” generated by the operation of automatic
cognitive processing can produce large-scale gender differences in
outcomes.</p>

<p>

What has taken shape in the last two decades is, then, a fundamental
reorientation in our understanding of the gendered nature of
scientific institutions that both informs and is rooted in the
critical perspectives brought to bear by feminists. It can no longer
be assumed that, unless formal barriers to access or discriminatory
intent can be established, the persistent under-representation and
marginalization of women in the sciences must be attributed to factors
internal to the women themselves. As the NAS and AAUW reports make
clear, the preponderance of evidence tells against conventional
explanations that attribute to women an inherent cognitive deficit or
a lack of drive and commitment to succeed in science; explanations of
the forms of gender inequality that persist in the sciences must take
into account the effects of training and workplace environments that
are inhospitable for women and minorities, the role of various forms
of evaluation bias that operate below the threshold of conscious
awareness, and the impact of institutional structures that fail to
counteract, or that amplify, these disadvantages (NAS, S-2, 3 and
AAUW, xvi). These insights suggest that gender inequities in the
sciences cannot be expected to resolve themselves without concerted
effort, and that this effort should focus, not (primarily) on adapting
women to existing institutions, but on ensuring that these
institutions are accountable for changing entrenched practices that
are responsible for the continued loss of trained scientific talent. A
primary focus of efforts to realize “institutional
transformation” of this sort (as outlined by the ADVANCE
projects mentioned above) is to counteract subtle forms of bias as
they operate in small-scale interactions in the workplace, in training
and mentoring relationships, and in decision processes throughout the
institutions of science education and employment.</p>

<p>

In addition, although many self-identified feminist scientists
insist that their critiques of gender inequity in no way impugn the
epistemic integrity of their fields, there are good reasons to think
that systematic institutional biases do affect the content and practice
of the sciences. What form this takes will vary widely by field and
subfield depending, for example, on whether gender categories are
constitutive of the subject domain (as in the case of most social
sciences), or on how directly they can be projected onto it (as in the
case of animal behavior research). But even in those areas of the
physical sciences where the subject domain is, at most, attributed
gender characteristics on a metaphorical basis (as symbolically or
projectively gendered subjects), patterns of workplace segregation that
run along gender lines (e.g., with women predominantly working in
particular subfields and research niches), and gender differences in
recognition and support (e.g., in funding and in citation patterns),
may well have an impact on what questions are given priority, what
hypotheses get uptake, and what results are recognized as bearing on
problems that are central to the research agenda of the discipline.</p>

<h2><a name="SelAppConCri">3. From Selective Appropriation to Content Critique</a></h2>

<p>

What feminists share, despite enormous internal diversity of
perspective, is a concern to understand and to change conditions of
oppression that operate along lines of gender difference. To realize
these goals it is necessary to understand with accuracy, subtlety, and
explanatory precision the nature and sources of oppression, and
scientific inquiry is one of the most powerful tools available for
doing this. Thus, feminists have an interest in research programs that
address questions of particular concern to women and to feminists or,
more generally, to those who are systematically disadvantaged by
traditional gender roles and social relations structured by
conventions of heterosexuality (heteronormative and
sex/gender-normative conventions).</p>

<h3><a name="SelApp">3.1 Selective appropriation</a></h3>

<p>

At their most conservative epistemically and conceptually, the
research initiatives undertaken by feminists do not challenge the
background assumptions and methodological commitments that underpin
existing programs of scientific research; often the goal is to expand
the range of questions addressed in particular social, medical, and
biological sciences or to selectively appropriate the tools of
scientific inquiry for application in feminist-directed research. Key
examples come from the medical sciences where the women's health
movement has been pivotal, not only in educating women and redefining
their relationship with health care professionals, but in bringing
feminist critique and activist pressure to bear on medical research
that has chiefly focused on the ailments of men, or has taken male
bodies and disease profiles as the norm for the medical diagnosis and
treatment of women. The feminist activism responsible for making
breast cancer a primary focus in the “war on cancer” is
one high profile example.  Feminist advocacy played a critical role,
in the 1960s and 1970s, in challenging a tradition of medical practice
that made radical mastectomy the treatment protocol of choice much
longer in the U.S.  than elsewhere. The clinical trials that
demonstrated the efficacy of less invasive alternatives to radical
mastectomies were a model of rigorous medical research (e.g.,
Fischer's trials, as described by Lerner 2001, 136–138), but
considerable pressure was required to convince the medical
establishment that such research was needed and to take its results
seriously (Lerner 2001, 115–169). More generally, feminist
activism was responsible for “a great awakening [in the 1980s]
of mainstream medicine to women's health concerns,” as
Schiebinger describes it, that put pressure on the medical
establishment not only to direct attention to neglected conditions
that affect primarily women (e.g., osteoporosis and breast cancer),
but also to take account of ways in which women's health and disease
profiles diverge from models based on studies of male subjects (1999a,
113). Heart disease is one especially prominent example of a well
studied condition the understanding of which was based, until the late
1980s, almost entirely on samples of men, even when it concerned the
effects of hormones like estrogen (Schiebinger 1999a, 113). Feminist
activism was directly responsible for federally enforced reforms of
medical research, instituted in the early 1990s, that required the
inclusion of female subjects in clinical trials, given findings that
FDA-approved drugs were routinely tested exclusively on men and that
publicly funded research on women was largely limited to reproductive
health issues (Schiebinger 1999a, 114–117). The NIH guideliness,
updated in 2001, are an example of the results of such activism.</p>

<p>

A similar impulse is evident in much of the research undertaken by
feminists in the social sciences, or in response to feminist demands,
where the goal has been to apply established research tools to
neglected questions that particularly concern women and feminists.
These “successor science” traditions of research have
faced stiff criticism internal to feminism since at least the
mid-1980s, on grounds that they are “insufficiently
critical” of the scientific ideals that animate many social
sciences (Harding 1986, 30), but they continue to thrive and have made
substantial contributions in a number of contexts. The sophisticated
quantitative analysis of the career paths, patterns of compensation,
and professional outcomes for women in the sciences described in the
last section
 (<a href="#FemEquCri">Feminist Equity Critiques</a>)
is one example in which
conventional social scientific methods have been used to good effect to
document persistent patterns of gender-based discrimination in
institutions that purport to be meritocratic. 
Other examples include a wide range of policy-oriented
research aimed at documenting, and designing effective strategies for
solving, specific problems created by gendered social institutions,
cultural conventions, and divisions of labor. One strand of research on
violence against women (Greaves and Wylie 1995) makes use of
conventional demographic analysis to show that gender-based patterns of
violence cross-cut class and ethnic, race, and religious
identification; the aim was to effect a change in policing and funding
policies that address domestic violence. Other action and policy
oriented research includes, for example, studies of the “gender
gap” in voting patterns, the gendered nature of poverty
world-wide, and the differential impact of development policies on
women.</p>

<p>

Another productive tradition of feminist research in this
appropriative spirit is characterized by “remedial”
research designed to fill lacunae in established theories or bodies of
knowledge, correcting errors that arise from ignoring women and gender
without changing the terms of disciplinary engagement. For example,
the women entering anthropology in unprecedented numbers in the 1960s
were quick to recognize the need for compensatory
ethnography. Sometimes male researchers had scant access to women
informants, and sometimes they ignored or discounted them, with the
effect that women, their roles and relationships, their distinctive
sub-cultures and activities, were often strikingly absent from
ethnographic narratives.  Claude Levi-Strauss is famous for a
description entered in his field journal in the 1930s that illustrates
the problem: “the entire village left the next day in about
thirty canoes, leaving us alone in the abandoned houses with the women
and children” (1936, cited by Margrit Eichler and Jeanne Lapointe 1985,
11). Deepening this critique, Shirley and Edwin Ardener describe
the “problem of women” as a case in which ethnographic
subjects are muted both within their own societies and by social
anthropologists who, they observe, have traditionally characterized
the societies they studied in terms of “dominant male systems of
perception” (S. Ardener 1975, xiii): “the study of women
is on a level little higher than the study of the ducks and fowls they
commonly own” (E. Ardener 1975, 1), which is to say, women had
been taken into account only insofar as they figured, or were valued,
in the public languages and worlds of men. Similar ideas are also
reflected in substantial shifts of focus in fields like primatology
where projected gender norms had given rise to a “general vision
that primate society revolves around males and is based on aggression,
domination, and hierarchy” (Strum and Fedigan 2000, 5). Here a
reorientation of field observation practices brought into focus the
central role played by females in primate societies, and the
importance of “tactics other than aggression (particularly those
that rely on social finesse and the management of
relationships),” making it clear that “hierarchy may or
may not have a place in primate society, but that males and females
are equally capable of competition” (Strum and Fedigan 2000, 5;
see also Fedigan and Fedigan 1989).</p>

<h3><a name="DeeCriCon">3.2 Deepening critiques of content</a></h3>

<p>

Even when they are
methodologically and epistemically conservative, feminist interventions
that correct specific errors of omission and extend the tools of
science to neglected problems often generate more deeply challenging
questions. The successes of these remedial exercises make it clear that
many fields have been compromised by unrecognized and unintended bias
in the way their subject domain had been defined. When women have been
restored to the historical record and to sociological, political, and
anthropological accounts from which they have been
omitted, eclipsed (Smith 1978), or relegated to a
walk-on role (Novick 1988, 497), it often has become clear that
the problem was not just erasure but systematic distortion. As critical
reflection on conceptual androcentrism deepened, the role of
ethnocentric gender norms in structuring inquiry has proven to have
profound implications, not only for how women and explicitly gendered
subjects are conceived, but also for ostensibly gender neutral aspects
of social, historical subjects, and for various natural domains as
well.</p>

<p>

Specific critiques of research that either ignore women altogether or
assimilate them to male-defined norms and expectations have taken
shape in every field that deals with human subjects. An example of the
former comes from political science where Pamela Paxton argues that in
operationalizing democracy one of its key indicators,“universal
suffrage,” is often explicitly or implicitly understood as
universal male suffrage.  When universal suffrage includes women
Paxton notes that many of the key claims about the development of
democracy—including a standard interpretation that identifies
three waves of democracy—may need to be revised (Paxton
2000). Accounts that make claims about the causes of democracy rest on
this classification into three waves and so the decision about how to
operationalize the latent concept can have far-reaching effects for
theoretical explanation. </p>

<p>A well-known critique of taking male norms as universal is Carol
Gilligan's reassessment of Lawrence Kohlberg's model of moral
development, an account that had been based exclusively on samples of
boys. Kohlberg had assumed that the developmental stages manifest in
these all-male samples could be generalized; girls were expected to
conform to what he took to be a universal trajectory. Gilligan argued
that when you attend to the specifics of moral reasoning among girls,
a distinctive trajectory of moral development emerges, characterized
by an increasingly sophisticated “contextual mode of
judgment” that diverges (in the intermediate stages of moral
development) from the decontextualized, universalizing, rule-based
forms of moral reasoning Kohlberg found in his research on boys
(1982). She makes the case for recognizing, in this “difference
voice,” evidence that calls into question the stage structure
and universalizing assumptions fundamental to Kohlberg's
system. Gilligan has since been criticized for reproducing the
structure of a fixed developmental scheme (taken over from Kohlberg
and developmental psychology generally), and for ignoring the impact
on moral reasoning of a range of social and economic factors other
than gender. Nonetheless, her posit of a “different voice”
represents a decisive challenge to the androcentric presumption that
male experience, perception, and patterns of development can be
treated as normative for human psychology as a whole. </p>

<p>

In other contexts feminist content critiques
focus on gender stereotypes reflected in the converse assumption: that
men and women are categorically different. In such cases similar and
overlapping traits are either ignored or are characterized in different
terms when associated with men rather than women; Eichler refers to
these as errors that arise from imposing a “double
standard” and from “sexual dichotomism” (1988).
Examples of this practice are widespread in sex difference research
(Fausto-Sterling 1985), a field that continues to reproduce
gender-normative stereotypes despite trenchant and sustained critique
(Young and Balaban 2006). One consequential example of research
undertaken to counteract interconnected errors of erasure and
distortion is the ethnographic work with groups long identified as
“hunter-gatherers.” Ethnographers who focused on the roles
and activities of women in these groups discovered that, among
temperate, desert dwelling and subtropical foragers, the small game and
plant resources provided by women gatherers may account for as much as
70% of the group's total dietary intake. Ironically, they found that
when small game was “collected” by women it was described
as gathering, whereas it counted as hunting when the same activities
were attributed to men. They learned, as well, that women gatherers are
highly mobile, like the men of their social groups (they are not
limited to a home base); they control their own fertility to an extent
not previously acknowledged; and they play leadership roles, presumed
to be the exclusive domain of men, particularly when decisions concern
group movement and subsistence strategies (e.g., Slocum 1975; see also
contributions to Lee and Devore 1968, and overviews by Dahlberg 1981,
and Fedigan and Fedigan 1989).</p>

<p>

These findings were, in part, the impetus for rethinking models of
human evolution that depended on ethnographic models of the subsistence
patterns and social organization of foragers defined in terms of the
role of male hunters. In the first instance, they inspired corrective
“woman the gatherer” models of human evolution that challenged the
assumption that “the demands of the hunt shaped the
characteristics that make us human” (e.g., Dahlberg 1981, 1). The
reorientation of primatology, mentioned in
 <a href="#SelApp">3.1 Selective appropriation</a>, was another source
of corrective pressure on male-centered models of human evolution, in
this case, in a field where the subject of inquiry is projectively
gendered. But as research has taken shape in these fields, predicated
on skepticism that ethnocentric gender stereotypes can be assumed to
hold for contemporary foragers, much less for diverse species of
primates and early hominids, it has become increasingly clear that the
female-centered antithesis is just as problematic as the sexist and
androcentric models of human evolution they are intended to displace.
Linda Marie Fedigan argues that feminists should resist the tendency to invert and
revalue the gender-dichotomous categories central to our own sex/gender
system; it seems likely that our hominid ancestors lived in social
groups and utilized subsistence strategies that were unlike any that
are familiar from contemporary ethnographic or primatological research
(Fedigan 1986). With reference to primate models, Sperling argues that
anthropomorphized “langurs with lipstick are no improvement over
baboons with briefcases” (1991, 27); contemporary gender
stereotypes—“the new female primate is dressed for success
and lives in a troop that resembles the modern corporation”
(1991, 4)—are no more adequate a framework for understanding
primates than the stereotypes of an earlier era, which represented
females as passive coquettes and males as aggressive strategists. She
urges a thorough-going reassessment of assumptions about the
naturalness of sex/gender roles and identities that make
anthropomorphic projections of gender stereotypes seem plausible. If
we are to come to terms with the complexity and flexibility of primate
behavior, we must be prepared to set aside simplifying assumptions
about its species-specificity and sex-dimorphism, especially where
characteristics like aggression are concerned (Sperling 1991,
20–22). </p>

<p>Despite sustained critique, the
conventions of sex/gender taken to be common sense continue to inform evolutionary
theorizing. Elisabeth Lloyd describes pervasive androcentric and sexist biases in
evolutionary explanations of human female orgasm that reflect not only
an uncritical acceptance of entrenched assumptions about women's
sexuality (even by authors who invoke the results of sexology research
that decisively disproves these assumptions), but also a deep-seated
conviction that this trait must be explicable in adaptationist terms,
often construed in terms of transparently ethnocentric and sexist
assumptions about the function(s) that the capacity for female orgasm
fulfills and for which it must have been selected (1993, 2005).</p>


<p>Sarah Richardson also exposes and explores projective attributions
of gender in the ways that stereotypical ideas about male and female
traits shape research on chromosomes and sex determination. She argues
that “[f]rom the earliest theories of chromosomal sex
determination to the midcentury hypothesis of the aggressive XYY
supermale, the longstanding belief that the X is the ‘female
chromosome,’ and the recent claim that males and females have
‘different genomes,’ cultural gender conceptions have
influenced the direction of sex chromosome genetics” (2013,
2). As one example of the effects of this projection she explores the
failed supermale hypothesis—the idea that XYY males have more
“maleness” in virtue of having two Y
chromosomes. Supermales were hypothesized to be, among other things,
more aggressive. Their greater numbers in institutions (both
psychiatric and correctional) seemed to support this. The gendering of
the Y chromosome—thinking of it as having stereotypically male
traits—supported the flawed transitive reasoning: Y
distinguishes maleness, males with double Y should have more (double?)
maleness (e.g., aggression). The result was not only a false
conclusion but a failure to examine evidence that did not support the
hypothesis. For example, institutional populations were revealed to
also contain a disproportionate number of XXY males. If one uses the
same reasoning based on gender stereotypes, this evidence appears to
be inconsistent with the supermale hypothesis. Ultimately the
hypothesis was discredited for a variety of reasons, but this
“embarrassment” in chromosomal sex determination research
is only one example of how assumptions about gender can shape
understanding of the object of inquiry. Richardson argues that such
areas of research carry with them ”gender valence“—a
more nuanced projective gendering of the subject matter that is more
subtle than what is typically referred to as “gender
bias.”</p>
<p>

As these examples illustrate, critiques of erasure and of distortion
have implications for the framework assumptions—ontological
commitments, explanatory repertoire, conventional categories of
description and analysis—that have structured research in many
fields; they throw into relief aspects of these various subject
domains that are left out of accounts, or prove to be inexplicable
when they are conceived in terms of gender categories and norms of
behavior that are specific to a relatively narrow selection of
contemporary human social experience. For example, Lloyd's critique of
evolutionary theorizing about female orgasm poses a challenge, not
just to the specifics of the explanatory theories she considers but to
the broader, culturally conventional assumptions about distinctively
male and female roles, sexual response, and behavioral predispositions
that underpin adaptationist research programs in a wide range of
areas; the aggressive, promiscuous male and the coy, passive female of
sociobiological theorizing populate not only explanations of human
sex/gender traits (ranging from the physical capacity for orgasm to
the psychology of mate preference and social patterns of investment in
offspring), but also accounts of the behavior of primates and ducks
and, projectively, even the reproductive functioning of biological
organism like slime mold, an example to be discussed. </p>

<p>

Thus we see that even when the
subject domain of a science is not intrinsically gendered, as in the
case of most natural and life sciences, it may be projectively or
symbolically gendered; gendered language and concepts may figure as
heuristic resources in the description of bio-physical phenomena
(Spanier 1995), and scientific categories that are not overtly gendered
may have gendered social meanings in the contexts of their formation
(Potter 1988). To take the latter case first, Elizabeth Potter develops an
account of the role of 17th century gender politics in shaping
Boyle's commitment to the mechanistic orientation that ultimately
yielded his theory of gases (2001). His opposition to the radical
politics associated with the animism of the alternative hylozoic
theory informed not only his choice of orienting metaphysics but also
the emerging norms of experimental, methodological practice—for
example, norms of simplicity—in terms of which his theory was
assessed and debated. Potter's point is not that Boyle's
gas laws are themselves explicitly gendered, but that their
formation and ratification as scientific was deeply shaped by the
articulation of gender politics and theological commitments specific to
17th century England.</p>

<p>

In analyses of the life sciences feminists show how research in
reproductive physiology has been structured by the attribution of
stereotypically masculine traits to sperm (as active agents) and
feminine traits to eggs (as passive), sometimes at considerable cost
to empirical adequacy and explanatory power (Martin 1991; Spanier
1995).  Bonnie Spanier discerns the influence of these metaphors in
molecular biology even when the subject is not human reproduction, in
the attribution of sex differences to E. Coli organisms, for
example. Here the transfer of genetic material from one single-cell
organism to another is characterized in gendered terms: the donor and
recipient cells are labeled “male” and
“female,” respectively, and the transfer process is
described as mediated by “conjugal unions between male and
female cells” (1995, 56). This hetero/sexualizing and gendering
at the level of molecular phenomena is evident (Spanier 1995, 26). But
we also see a more subtle sort of gendering in competing models of the
factors that control the aggregation of slime molds, a case analyzed
by Evelyn Fox Keller in connection with a more general critique of the
“force of the concept of predetermined centralized control as a
‘natural’ model of relationship among components of living
systems or populations” Keller 1985, 150–157). By
projecting causally familiar models — models of governance and
control that reflect the gender hierarchy of society with which we are
familiar — “we risk imposing on nature the very stories we
like to hear,”(Keller 1985, 187). </p>

<p>

In short, although the specifics of feminist content critiques are
necessarily quite different in the biological and physical, as opposed
to the social and historical sciences, they follow a similar
trajectory. Even narrowly circumscribed, gap-filling and corrective
interventions often expose patterns of omission or gender-normative
distortion that compromise not just the details but the framework
assumptions of the sciences examined. Discovery of these omissions and
distortions leads to critical questions about the methodological
standards and epistemic ideals that inform scientific practice. By the
mid-1980s feminist research had exposed such pervasive androcentric and
sexist bias that it called into question not just “bad
science,” but much that passes for “good science,”
even exemplary science (see Longino and Doell 1983, 207–208; Harding
1986, 22–23; Wylie 1997). Feminist content critiques thus pose two
related challenges. If established scientific methodologies routinely
(although not always) reproduce androcentric and sexist bias or
themselves generate these biases, then the question arises whether and
how feminists could do better; the feminist methods debate took shape,
chiefly in the social sciences, in response to this question
(see section
 <a href="#FemMetDeb">The Feminist Methods Debate</a>).
By extension, feminist critiques of and contributions to the sciences
suggest the need to reassess making a sharp distinction between
“contextual” values (non-epistemic, socio-political
interests and considerations) and cognitive factors (good reasons,
evidence)—the ideals (truth, objectivity) understood to be
“constitutive” of the sciences.  Thus challenges for
feminist philosophers of science include clarifying the role of
contextual/non-epistemic values in successful science and articulating
norms of epistemic credibility and justification—including
conceptions of objectivity—in an account of good science that
incorporates such values.</p>

<h2><a name="FemMetDeb">4. The Feminist Methods Debate</a></h2>

<p>

While at times feminists have been skeptical about the capacity of
conventional research methods to expose systematic bias, it is now
generally agreed that a plurality of methods have been productive for
achieving feminist goals. Nonetheless there are questions related to
method that feminists have wanted to explore. To understand what is at
stake, it may be helpful to use Harding's distinction between method,
methodology, and epistemology. Methods are “techniques for
gathering evidence,” whereas methodology is “a theory and
analysis of how research should proceed.” Epistemology is the
“theory of knowledge or justificatory strategy” that
underlies the methodology (Harding 1987, 2). While quantitative,
qualitative, and mixed methods research have all produced evidence for
science that is consistent with feminist goals, questions have been
raised about the possibility of problematic epistemological
presuppositions underlying the use of particular methods to gather
that evidence—and about how those presuppositions might inform
methodology (see section
 <a href="#PhiImp">Philosophical Implications</a>). </p>

<p> For example, some scholars reject the conviction that social
research must conform to models of natural scientific practice on
grounds that, when formulated in terms of positivist theories of
science, these models entrench “ruling practices” in the
form of quasi-experimental and quantitative methods that reproduce the
categories of dominant ideology and obscure devalued or subordinate
perspectives (Mies 1983; Smith 1974; Stanley and Wise 1983). This
objection is an objection to the methodological framework within which
these methods have been employed. Although few maintain that research
methods are intrinsically sexist or androcentric, feminist social
scientists have often found that, if they are to recover dimensions of
social life ignored by mainstream research, they often must use forms
of evidence considered ephemeral (e.g., diaries, private papers,
material culture, as opposed to archives of public record) and rely on
methods that are non-standard or marginal by the conventions of their
fields (e.g., qualitative methods in fields dominated by experimental
and quantitative modes of inquiry inspired by the natural
sciences). Nonetheless there are times when the more mainstream
quantitative methods can provide powerful resources for making
feminist arguments (section <a href="#FemEquCri">Feminist Equity
Critiques</a>). </p>

<p>
Shulamith Reinharz's review of feminist social research methods
(1992a) identified productive feminist applications of virtually every
research method available in the social sciences, and by the end of
the 1990s, Heidi Gottfried concluded that feminist practitioners had
made a decisive “move from singularity to plurality”(1996,
12).  Epistemic arguments reinforced this impulse toward a plurality
of methods. Sandra Harding (1987) and Helen Longino (1987) argued that
there is no justification for positing “a distinctive female way
of knowing” and that it is more fruitful to ask what it means to
“do science as a feminist” (Longino 1987, 53), and to
recognize that feminist research practice will be as diverse as are
the commitments that generate the questions it addresses and the
fields in which feminists work. Thus, the current “feminist
methods debate” is more aptly characterized as debate about
methodology—a debate about the theoretical framework for
knowledge production within which the methods are used.</p>

<p>

Consistent with this idea, feminist researchers have converged around
a set of commitments that shape their research—commitments that
guide how to use methods as feminists—and thus provide a
methodological framework. Four shared commitments are particularly
salient: relevance, experiential grounding, accountability, and
reflexivity (Wylie 2007). These commitments aid in guiding research
that is non-sexist and otherwise consistent with feminist ideals
(Eichler 1988; Fonow and Cook 1991; DeVault 1999; Hesse-Biber and
Yaiser 2004; Hesse-Biber 2007). The first of
these—relevance—refers to the goals of feminist research;
to do research as a feminist means to address questions that are
relevant to women and, more generally, to those oppressed by
gender-structured systems of inequality (many of whom are not
women). Sometimes this principle is more specifically formulated in
activist terms; feminist research should be
“movement-generated” in the sense that it should not only
provide an understanding of sexist and hetero-normative institutions,
but should also generate strategies for changing these institutions
(Ehrlich 1975, 10, 13).</p>

<p>

The commitment to experiential grounding is embodied in the directive,
variously formulated, that feminists should start their research from
the lives of women and those marginalized by conventional sex/gender
structures. As articulated by Dorothy Smith in the early 1970s and
subsequently elaborated by Harding (1991, 2004a), this is a
recommendation to take women's everyday lives as a “starting
point” point for research: focus on those aspects of social life
and forms of understanding that typically remain
“off-stage,” “eclipsed” by the normatively
masculine focus of conventional social sciences (Smith 1978;
1987). The feminist research that most straightforwardly exemplifies
these ideals are community self-study projects: research undertaken by
women, on women, for women (Gorelick 1991, 459), in which women's
experience and concerns give rise directly to the questions
asked. Examples include the grass-roots “chilly climate”
(workplace environment) research discussed above
 (in the section <a href="#FemEquCri">Feminist Equity Critiques</a>),
studies of
the needs of homeless and poor women of the kind supported by the
Vancouver Women's Research Center in the 1970s (Jacobson 1977)
and undertaken by “Roofless Women” twenty years later
(1997). The principles that inform these projects—that inquiry
should be motivated by explicitly activist objectives and designed with
the aim of leveling the hierarchy of authority inherent in traditional
“expert” forms of social scientific research—have
also inspired the robust traditions of participatory research
associated with the women's shelter movement, described by Patricia
 Maguire in her classic account, <em>Doing Participatory Research: A
Feminist Approach</em> (Maguire 1987) and by Naples in connection with
studies of women's “invisible” work, and research
with adult survivors of childhood sexual abuse (Naples 2003). In the
context of ongoing debate about the status and authority of the
“evidence of experience” (Scott 1991), the second
principle—that feminist research “start from,” and be
grounded in, women's experience—has been reframed as a
commitment to treat gendered experience and self-understanding as a
critical resource at all stages of research (Wylie 1992).</p>

<p>

The commitment to accountability leads to the specification of ethical
and pragmatic norms for feminist research; these include
accountability to research subjects in a variety of ways. Minimally
the research process should not, itself, exploit or demean research
subjects who are oppressed by sex/gender systems; ideally, it should
empower them. Often feminists hold themselves to a higher standard,
arguing that research practice should be a site for instituting
feminist social and political values: in designing research projects
they should do all they can to counteract the hierarchical structures
that make social science a “ruling practice,” implementing
egalitarian, participatory forms of knowledge production. Here
feminist principles converge on ideals that inform a number of
research traditions that emphasize participatory modes of inquiry but
are not explicitly or primarily feminist in orientation, and on a set
of general arguments for inclusive norms of research practice that
Longino has developed (2002) (see section
 <a href="#Obj">6.4 Objectivity</a>). 
For example, practitioners of participatory action
research (PAR) and community based collaborative research (CBPR) in
fields as diverse as forestry (Fortmann 2008; Wilmsen et. al 2008),
development (Hickey and Mohan 2004), and community health (Minkler and
Wallerstein 2003), make the case that a commitment to emancipatory
goals requires, not just that research address relevant questions, but
that it be non-exploitative and subject-driven. In addition, like many
feminists, they argue that a commitment to accountability and
reciprocity requires, in the ideal, that research subjects should be
involved at all stages of research design, data collection, analysis,
and authorship. The rationale here is not only moral and
political—that fully collaborative practice exemplifies a
thoroughgoing “diffusion or decentralization of power,” as
Longino describes the feminist “community value” at work
here (1994, 476)—but that social norms which reinforce a
“tempered equality of intellectual authority” and
inclusive modes of critical engagement in scientific communities are
instrumental to epistemic ends (Longino 2002, 131). Although her point
of departure was the delineation of commitments characteristic of
feminist research, Longino has developed a set of entirely general
arguments for such norms; they ensure that the epistemic resources of
diverse perspectives are brought to bear in the critical assessment of
research methods, evidence, and inference, as well as the claims based
on them (1995; 2002, 128–135). Given that the unconditioned
subjectivity of a “view from nowhere” is unattainable, she
argues, the basis for ratifying knowledge claims can only be the
integrity of the processes of knowledge production as assessed against
jointly social and cognitive norms such as these (1993, 113).</p>

<p>

Finally, each of the commitments outlined above entails that feminist
researchers make reflexivity a central virtue. A strength of feminist
critique lies in uncovering previously hidden androcentric
assumptions. Thus feminist social scientists bring to their research
an awareness of the need to contextualize research. As Shulamith
Rheinharz puts it, they should “state their premises rather than
hide them” (1992b, p. 426), unlike the approaches they
critique. The interests that motivate their choice of questions, the
assumptions that underpin the hypotheses they consider, and the
reasons for adopting particular methods of inquiry and categories of
description and analysis should be explicit. On stronger formulations,
this commitment to cultivate a stance of critical reflexivity requires
that feminists take into account the various ways in which their own
socially defined angle of vision, interests, and values are
constitutive of the research process and of the understanding it
produces (e.g., Fonow and Cook, 1991; Mies, 1983). Harding has
elaborated this in terms of a requirement for “strong
objectivity”: “Strong objectivity requires that the
subject of knowledge be placed on the same critical plane as the
objects of knowledge. Thus strong objectivity requires what we can
think of as ‘strong reflexivity’” (Harding 2004a,
136)(section <a href="#PhiImp">Philosophical Implications</a>). At a
meta-level, Longino has argued the case for a governing principle of
“methodological provisionalism”: feminists should be
prepared to revise any of their norms in light of what they learn from
practice (1994, 483).  While principles of critical reflexivity and
“provisionalism” are not—in
themselves—feminist, Longino suggests a “bottom
line” proviso that should inform their application by feminists:
the basis for adopting, and for assessing and revising, any
methodological norms that inform feminist research should be a
commitment to “prevent gender from being disappeared”
(1994, 481).</p>

<p>

In articulating these principles, feminist practitioners often work as
insiders to the disciplines whose methods and results they critique;
far from being cynically dismissive of scientific inquiry, they are
committed to improving the epistemic credibility and integrity of
research practice in these fields. The challenge they engage, in
practical and methodological terms, is that of showing that
ineliminable contextual values can be a resource for doing better
science.</p>

<h2><a name="FemSciStu">5. Feminist Science Studies</a></h2>

<p>

Science Studies is an interdisciplinary field that draws upon
anthropology, cultural studies, economics, feminism, history,
philosophy, political science, and sociology in order to study science.
Historian Mario Biagioli (1999, xii) defines science studies as a field
that asks how science works rather than what science is and he
describes science studies as using a variety of methodologies and
research questions to find out how science works. For example,
anthropologist, Sharon Traweek (1988) compared two communities of high
energy physicists by asking “how they have forged a research community
for themselves, how they turn novices into physicists and how their
community works to produce knowledge.” David Hess characterizes science
studies as tracking “the history of disciplines, the dynamics of
science as a social institution, and the philosophical basis for
scientific knowledge” (1997, 1). And sociologist Emma Whelan
characterizes science studies as focusing on “how social factors
<em>intrude upon</em> science,” “the <em>products</em> of
science” and “the <em>process</em> of doing scientific work
itself” (Whelan 2001, 544; italics in original). Though
definitions offered by science scholars differ, they nevertheless agree
that the focus of science studies is on the interactions of science
with society, including both micro and macro interactions. A
fundamental aim of science studies is to critique narrow understandings
of science as a rational activity, (e.g., as instantiating a logic of
science) and to show, from a variety of perspectives, that science is a
social activity.</p>

<p>

Sue Rosser (1989) notes the impact of feminism on science and
science studies in six areas: pedagogical and curricular transformation
in science, attention to the history of women in science as well as to
the current status of women in science, feminist critique of science,
feminist theory of science and feminine science (see Rosser 1989,
Harding 1986 and 1991, and Rose 1994). When science was first
identified as having a masculine basis, many asked whether this implies
that there is a feminine science or that women would do science
differently than men. The idea of a feminine science helped to
challenge the idea of science as only a masculine endeavor and focused
the analytical gaze on its “feminine” aspects such as
intuition, collaboration, and social networks. In general
feminist science studies scholars have contributed gender analyses that
address “issues of power and inequality, varieties of knowing and
knowers, discourse and materiality, subjectivity and objectivity,
embodiment, representation, work, resistance, and the lay/expert
divide” (Whelan 2001, 538). In addition, most feminist science
studies scholars try to understand the relationships among science,
gender, race, class, sexuality, disability and colonialism and how
science constructs and applies these differences. Among the most
frequently cited feminist science scholars are: Ruth Bleier, Adele
Clarke, Anne Fausto Sterling, Joan Fujimura, Donna Haraway, Sandra
Harding, Evelynn Hammond, David Hess, Ruth Hubbard, Evelyn Fox Keller,
Emily Martin, Sue Rosser, Margaret Rossiter, Linda Layne, Richard
Levins, Richard Lewontin, Helen Longino, Carolyn Merchant, Rayna Rapp,
Hilary Rose, Londa Schiebinger, Bonnie Spanier, S. Leigh Star, Sharon
Traweek, and Nancy Tuana. (See the
 <a href="#Bib">Bibliography</a>
for sample work by these scholars.)</p>

<p>

Hilary Rose (1983, 82) notes that as critical work becomes “more
theoretical, more fully elaborated, so women and women's interests
recede from the forefront.” For example, Evelyn Fox Keller (1995)
observes that feminist scholars first questioned the objectivity of
science, a question later appropriated by mainstream historians of
science. This could explain the impact of feminist science studies
scholars on the field of science studies at the inception of the field
in the late 1970s and the decrease in obviously feminist science
scholarship in the two main journals of science studies: <em>Science,
Technology and Human Values</em> and <em>The Social Studies of
Science</em> in the 1990s and 2000s. Eulalia Pérez Sedeño
(2001) critiques science studies for not employing a serious gender
analysis in its skeptical, constructively critical account of science
and challenges mainstream science studies to include the private sphere
as well as the high profile public sphere as locations of research. In
the same way, scholars have called for closer engagement between
feminist theory and feminist science studies. For example, a special
issue of <em>Feminist Theory</em>, edited by Susan Squier and Melissa
Littlefield (2004) suggests that a closer examination of materiality,
agency, and performance in feminist science studies could create a
point of mutual interest for feminist theory and feminist science
studies.</p>

<p>

Since its inception, feminist science studies has not been a unified
field. The category, “feminist science studies” includes
feminist critiques of science, history of women in science, attention
to equity issues for women in science, the experience of women in
science, the effects of science on women, cultural constructions of
gender and feminist theories of scientific knowledge. Under the rubric
of gender, science and culture we find scholars discussing the
marginalization of women in science, raising questions of equity in
science, analyzing the gendered nature of science and questioning the
construction of scientific knowledge. These various dialogues from
multiple directions create disparate subspecialties and give the
appearance of a feminist science studies diaspora. Research in feminist
science studies is found in anthropology, biology, cultural studies,
ethnic studies, history of science, literary studies, philosophy of
science, philosophy, postcolonial studies, sociology, and women's
studies among other disciplines. Thus, the field is diverse in its
methodologies and approaches to research. This is both its strength and
its weakness. Most feminist science studies scholars identify
themselves primarily with a traditional discipline and secondarily with
feminist science studies, which can make it difficult to distinguish
work in the field. But its diverse methods and approaches also give the
field flexibility, diversity, breadth and depth. Thus, Banu Subramaniam
(Hammonds and Subramaniam 2003, 929) celebrates the field of feminist
science studies because it allows for the possibility of construction
and collaboration in addition to critique. Finally, despite the
diversity of methods and approaches, most scholars address not only the
relationship of science and gender, but also the relationship of
science, race, class, sexuality, disability and colonialism and ask how
science has been used to construct and apply these differences.</p>

<p>

The early feminist science scholars addressed a number of binaries
that were prevalent in scientific discourse: rational/irrational,
objective/subjective, science/nature, pure/constructed, and sex/gender
that reflected contemporary thinking and beliefs about science.
Feminist science scholars were not alone in questioning the binaries
of modernity but they were first to do it for science and their work
contributed to a more critical analysis of scientific culture. Ruth
Hubbard's (1990) work illustrated that science reflects the values of
those who do science: privileged, educated white men who have defined
what counts as rational/irrational, objective/subjective and
pure/constructed. Susan Griffin (1979) and Carolyn Merchant (1980)
explored the science/nature discourse through historical and cultural
analysis to illustrate the values of nature as feminine and science as
masculine that permeated modern science. Donna Haraway (1989) explored
assumptions concerning the binaries, objective/subjective and
science/nature, through an analysis of gender and racial bias in
primatology. Sandra Harding's (1991) work illustrated that science
produces meanings that are constructed. Helen Longino and Ruth Doell
(1987) documented masculine bias within evolutionary and
endocrinological research. Luce Irigaray (1989) showed how scientific
language was not neutral and needed to be interpreted as sexed
logic. These same binaries are no longer the major focus of feminist
science studies because the critiques have been mainstreamed into
theories on the social construction of science.  However, the
science/nature distinction is still being actively explored (Suchman
2008; Barad 2003, 2007; Hammond 2003; Goodman 2003) because it speaks
to the boundary between human and machine and addresses the question
of difference that has engaged feminist scholarship since its
inception.</p>

<p>

Scholarship that explores how scientific knowledge is constructed both
inside and outside the laboratory and the application of this
knowledge to the lives and bodies of women is a central focus of
feminist science studies. Turning first to the production of
knowledge, based on accounts of Rosalind Franklin (Maddox 2002) and
Barbara McClintock (Keller 1983), Ruth Hubbard (2003) has concluded
that the relationship between science and gender is not to be found in
the simple claim that women do science differently than men. As she
puts the point, “ovaries or testes do not directly affect what
science we do and how we do it.” Other feminist science studies
scholars argue for the social construction of science and aim to show
that how we do science and how the science we do are both constructed
through lenses that are culturally and socially created and that are
gendered. Thus it is not the ovaries or the testes but the culture
that shapes how we do science. Science is not separate from the person
who does science or from the culture in which science is embedded
(Tuana 1989). Although social constructivism has been the prevailing
theoretical framework for feminist work, Donna Haraway (1991) has
cautioned both that it may not be the most powerful tool for
deconstructing science and its objects since it may help maintain the
ideological doctrines of science through its focus on rhetoric and
that it abandons objectivity. Karen Barad challenges feminist science
studies to take up “<em>onto-epistem-ology</em>—the study
of practices of knowing in being” [italics in the original,
2003: 829] that would acknowledge that we “are part of the world
in its differential becoming.” This echoes an earlier challenge
expressed by Rose (1983) about the importance of the personal within
our theories and the need for theories that integrate and interpret
lived experiences.</p>

<p>

Turning to applications of scientific knowledge, the medicalization of
women's lives and bodies provides excellent examples of feminist
questions and approaches. Rayna Rapp's (1999) work on amniocentesis
illustrates the convergence of feminist theory with science studies
that allows Rapp to analyze gender, power and culture in this area of
medicine. By analogy with a Venn diagram Rapp explores the
“intersecting and juxtaposing” perspectives of scientific
literacy, disability rights, reproductive rights and the technological
transformations of bodies/pregnancy into a woman-centered research
project. In her study of immunity in American culture, Emily Martin
emphasizes “the commonalities and the differences among people
who have various kinds of experience and expertise” in
scientific knowledge (Martin 1994, 14). Martin begins with the premise
that science is “an active agent in a culture that passively
acquiesces” and that society fails to “provide an
adequately complex view of how scientific knowledge operates”
(1994, 7) and it is part of her methodology to “deliberately
cross” the borders that have historically separated the
scientists producing knowledge and the society applying it. And
finally, Deborah Blizzard's (2007) ethnography of the sociocultural
development of fetoscopy applies a constructivist framework to show
how “patient-mothers,” physicians, clergy and others in a
social network actively affect the process of development and
acceptance of fetoscopy. These studies move beyond science texts to
situate scientific knowledge on the bodies and lives of women.</p>

<p>

One early area of study for feminist science studies was
investigation of the location of women in science and their absence
from science. (See Rossiter 1982, 1995; Wertheim 1995; and
 <a href="#FemEquCri">Feminist Equity Critiques</a>
above.) Having documented and challenged
women's and other minorities' absence from science,
scholars have, by asking why specific individuals both male and female
leave science, aimed to improve the number of minorities in science
(Seymour and Hewitt 1997). Feminist scholars have suggested and
encouraged several strategies for improvement. Modest curricular reform
in the sciences has included a more community-based education that
includes peer instruction, “real world” problem-solving
activities, active learning, inquiry-based learning, and
team-structured activities that reflect the realities of doing science
while challenging common stereotypes of science. Second, feminist
scientists and scholars of science encouraged the education and
training of scientists “to conduct their investigations in
accordance with feminist principles, to resist androcentric currents
of mainstream research communities and in some cases to organize their
intellectual production along theoretical lines identified with
feminism” (Kohlstedt and Longino 1997, 6). This influence on
education and training may be the fastest growing area of feminist
science studies (broadly construed) as scientists begin to take up
feminist concerns (see, for example, Mayberry et al. 2001 and Wyer et
al.  2001). Recently, scholars have asked, “has feminism changed
science?” and have begun to answer it in the affirmative. (See
the special issue of <em>Signs</em> (2003) edited by Londa
Schiebinger, especially articles by physicist, Amy Bug; archaeologist,
Margaret W.  Conkey; and evolutionary biologist, Patty Gowaty. See
also Schiebinger 1999b.) Feminism has been most successful in
influencing/changing the use of metaphors in biology (see Spanier
1995) and scientists are beginning to be more explicit about their
methods, values and beliefs and how these might influence their
work. Medicine, primatology, biology and archaeology are most
frequently cited for having incorporated gender analyses into their
science (Schiebinger 1999a.)</p>

<p>

The presence of women in the sciences, feminist critiques and
feminist theories have contributed to changes in modern science as well
as in studies of science. But an important goal of feminist science
studies is to encourage the presence of women and men who differ by
race, class, nation, sexuality, disability, etc. and who can bring to
science and science studies a multifaceted awareness of difference,
power relations, domination, language and of the need for innovative
methodologies. Having documented the absence and reasons for the
absence of women in science in the industrialized nations, scholars
have begun to examine the role of gender and science in developing
nations and in the processes of development (Campion &amp; Shrum 2004);
however, more analysis of gender, science and culture outside of
western cultures is needed. Although race is more likely to be
addressed within feminist than in mainstream science studies, even
there it is a nascent area of study. Scholars addressing race and
science include: Evelynn Hammond, Banu Subramaniam, Jenny Reardon,
Alondra Nelson, and researchers in Sandra Harding's 1993b anthology,
<em>The “Racial” Economy of Science</em>. Disabilities
studies is also a new field that promises to trouble the space between
science, able bodies and feminist theory (see Kafer 2003, Hall 2002,
Kittay et al 2001 and the
 <a href="#Bib">Bibliography</a>
for work by these scholars). Feminist science scholars continue to
respond to Hilary Rose's challenge to create a “practice of
feeling, thinking and writing that opposes the abstraction of male and
bourgeois scientific thought” (Rose 1983, 87).</p>

<h2><a name="PhiImp">6. Philosophical Implications</a></h2>

<p>

Feminist science studies, feminist activist research, and feminist
appropriations of science often pose a challenge to conventional views
about what makes science scientific. The traditional conception of
objectivity and the value neutrality, or the freedom of science from
non-epistemic (moral, social, or political) values often associated
with such a conception of objectivity, come into question. Feminist
perspectives on science sometimes expose instances in which such
non-epistemic values compromise scientific results, as we have
seen. When sexist assumptions, either directly or projectively, shape
the understanding or approach to the objects of inquiry, a variety of
distortions of science can occur. But feminist science studies also
reveal that in some instances moral, social, and political values can
improve science. It follows that a key task for philosophers of
science operating from a feminist perspective is reframing accounts of
evidence, justification, and objectivity to show how it is possible
that non-epistemic values can improve science. The following
subsections focus on the approaches of several feminist philosophers
of science who have taken up this challenge by re-examining the role
of values in science and reconceptualizing objectivity. </p>

<h3><a name="FemEmpHol">6.1 Feminist Empiricist Holism</a></h3>

<p>

One way in which feminist philosophers of science have responded to
these challenges is through an approach that we might call
“empiricist holism.” Many feminist empiricists were
influenced by the American pragmatists of the second half of the
twentieth century, particularly Wilfred Sellars, Willard van Orman
Quine, and Donald Davidson. Miriam Solomon notes the prevalence of
this influence on a variety of contemporary feminist empiricists
including herself (2012, 435).  These feminists take a naturalized
approach to the philosophy of science, basing their accounts on the
knowledge practices of the sciences on which they focus. They are
empiricists in taking experience as the ultimate arbitrator of our
beliefs; they are holists in that they take beliefs to answer to
experience as whole—in Quine's phrase, as a “web of
belief”—rather than one-by-one. Longino's contextual
empiricism, discussed in detail elsewhere (see the entries on
 <a href="../feminism-epistemology/">feminist epistemology and philosophy of science</a>,
 <a href="../feminist-social-epistemology/">feminist social epistemology</a>,
<a href="../scientific-knowledge-social/">the social dimensions of scientific knowledge</a>,
 and briefly in this entry in section
 <a href="#Obj">6.4 Objectivity</a>), is one of the most influential examples of these
approaches (Longino 1990, 2002). We will examine several other
versions in the work of Lynn Hankinson Nelson, Alison Wylie, Elizabeth
Anderson, and Sharyn Clough.</p>

<p>
Lynn Hankinson Nelson's naturalized, holistic, feminist empiricist
account is explicitly derived from her reading of Quine, as the title
of her book makes clear (<em>Who Knows: From Quine to a Feminist
Empiricism</em> 1992). For Nelson, a philosophy is naturalized when it
is commensurable with the actual history and contemporary practice of
science, grounded in sciences relevant to theories of theorizing,
e.g., psychology, cognitive science, biology, and/or sociology, and it
explains consensus and dissent, progressive and less than progressive
episodes, in the same terms. Thus, a good philosophy of science must,
like good science, achieve a balance among empirical success,
predictive success and explanatory power and must, as a good
epistemology of science, describe and explain how scientific knowledge
is acquired. Nelson holds that a naturalized philosophy of science
does not justify knowledge in general or our particular knowledge
claims; instead it must give an empirically adequate description of
the production of scientific knowledge, i.e., it is held accountable
to case studies that have not been rationally reconstructed to fit its
own (or any other) philosophy of science. Its only normative job is to
ask whether the social processes currently characterizing scientific
practices, recruitment, education, etc. are likely to produce the best
theories and if not, suggest changes to ensure that they do. Feminist
naturalized philosophy of science, then, attends to processes,
including especially methodological processes, reflecting gender
considerations. And since gender is never in fact separated from race,
class and other socio-political categories, feminist philosophy of
science attends to these also. The actual practice of science thus
incorporates socio-political and cultural values and in this way
values are part of into the interconnected system of beliefs that is
subject to empirical constraint.</p>

<p>

In Nelson's empiricist holism, hypotheses, models and theories
put forward in the sciences must be tested against relevant evidence
where evidence includes the observational consequences of the
hypothesis and a large set of theories within which the hypothesis is
embedded, including common-sense theories. Thus, a hypothesis or model
in any branch of science is related to many, but not all, of our
current theories. For Nelson, the evidence supporting a specific theory,
hypothesis, or research program is of two types: observation, although
not the pre-theoretic observation of traditional empiricism, but
rather observations already informed by background theory; and
“a body of accepted standards and theory” which also
differ from the traditional empiricist account in that they are
informed by social beliefs and values (1996, 100). This account is
empiricist and holist inasmuch as it states that evidence is
constituted by observation and by theories which themselves are
supported by evidence and by other theories. Yet the holism here is
relatively modest in that evidence for a hypothesis includes the
observational consequences of many, but not all, current theories,
metaphysical assumptions, methods, standards and practices (1996,
101).</p>

<p>The account is also naturalized, for Nelson notes that observation
is largely structured as current theories would have it, meaning that
observational experience is explained by scientific accounts such as
those given in neurobiology, developmental biology, neuropsychology
and evolutionary biology, rather than by a philosophical
account. Nelson points to feminist and other case studies of good
scientific work which show that socio-political values influence
scientific justification. (See 1990, 205–212 and passim for a
discussion of the “man, the hunter” theory of human
evolution; 1995, 410–413 and 414 for a discussion of work in
neuroendocrinology showing that hemispheric lateralization is
sex-differentiated; and 415ff for a discussion of the centrality of
sex differences in sociobiology.) She concludes from these case
studies that it is a lack of empirical success that makes scientific
work bad—not necessarily socio-political values that do so. Her
holistic view of evidence allows us to see that the androcentric
assumptions made by scientists and revealed by feminist science
studies are not baseless; they rest upon evidence which includes
commonly held social assumptions about relations between the sexes
(1993, 147). That feminists do not hold them is due in large part to
their perspective, a perspective arising from their shared response to
current “social experiences, relations, traditions, and
historically and culturally specific ways of organizing social
life” (1993, 147). For Nelson, the distinction between good and
bad science is still based on traditional constitutive or epistemic
virtues including (though not limited to) empirical adequacy,
explanatory power and predictive power.</p>

<p>

Moreover Nelson argues, case studies also reveal that socio-political
and other contextual or non-epistemic values sometimes help constitute
evidence in good science, i.e., science which scientists themselves
say is good science. Thus, the theories that, together with our
experiences, constitute evidence include social values and
socio-political theories.  We must, she says, “reconsider the
assumption that political beliefs and theories, and values, are not
subject to empirical control, that there is no way to judge between
them” (1990, 297). Finally, on the basis of her case studies,
Nelson also argues that knowledge is produced and maintained by
communities. While individual scientists put forward candidates for
knowledge, they do not know their hypotheses autonomously, before the
relevant community has deemed the hypotheses confirmed.</p>

<h3><a name="ConModCon">6.2 The Consilience Model of Confirmation</a></h3>

<p>

Among the challenges to empirical holistic accounts is that in such
accounts of science confirmation of hypotheses appears to be circular,
i.e., our scientific beliefs merely confirm one another. Archaeology
provides us with a particularly salient example, for archaeologists
must use analytical theories drawn from familiar sources to make
hypotheses about past cultures and lifeways and to interpret
archaeological data as evidence to test these hypotheses. Clearly
their observations and hence their observational evidence is
“theory-laden.” Given that the evidence used to support
hypotheses and theories about the cultural past is informed by
theories based on the cultural present, how can archaeologists avoid
begging the question in favor of their own understanding of past
cultures?</p>

<p>

Alison Wylie has developed the Consilience Model of Confirmation
through analysis of many cases showing how archaeologists in fact
judge the relative credibility of evidential and explanatory
claims. The model is compatible with other forms of holism, such as
Nelson's in that it shows how hypotheses from different domains bear
on: (1) the interpretation of data so that the data function as
evidence for a hypothesis, (2) hypotheses taken as background
assumptions supporting an argument from the evidence to the hypothesis
under test, (3) the interpretation of the hypothesis, and ultimately,
(4) how hypotheses and principles from different domains affect the
theory giving rise to, and in turn supported by, the hypothesis being
tested.</p>

<p>

Questions about the adequacy of an interpretive hypothesis are
usually settled, Wylie notes, when independently constituted lines of
evidence converge. Archaeologists recognize that evidence is not a
stable, foundational given; it is always “theory-laden,”
but mitigated objectivity is achieved when the theories used to
construe/interpret data as evidence are secure and independent.</p>

<p>

Evidence must be secure in two senses: first, the background knowledge
used to link the present record (data) with antecedent causes
(conditions that produced it) or past events must be credible in its
home context (e.g., paleobotanical claims used in an argument must be
well established in paleobotany), and second, the inferences supported
by this background knowledge are secure to the degree to which the
links between the present record (data) and antecedent causes or past
events (background assumptions) are unique or deterministic, and to
the degree to which the argument chains are relatively short and
simple.  The evidence must also exhibit epistemic independence in two
senses: (1) background assumptions used to establish the evidence must
be independent of the hypothesis being tested; and (2) background
assumptions (linking principles or sets of linking principles) derived
from one or more different sources used to establish the evidential
import of archaeological data must be confirmed independently of one
another. Background assumptions also must be horizontally independent
of one another, i.e., no one set of linking principles entails the
others as a proper subset of itself or is confirmed by the same
evidence. Once the evidence is secure and independent, then
archaeologists can triangulate, set up a system of mutual constraint
among different lines of evidence bearing on a hypothesis and
ultimately on a theory. Wylie's model shows that archaeologists use an
enormous diversity of evidence and the diversity ensures that the
evidence can sometimes function as a semi-autonomous constraint on
claims about the cultural past, particularly when some of it depends
on background knowledge from one or more different sources and when it
enters interpretation at different points. Thus different lines of
evidence can be mutually constraining when they converge or fail to
converge on a coherent account of a particular past context.</p>

<p>
Wylie's model provides a good analysis of how gender considerations
enter archaeological reasoning and it allows us to see when evidential
considerations do meet standards of good practice in the field and
when they do not. For example, when current assumptions about women
and gender roles are uncritically taken up and used to support
hypotheses about the cultural past in a particular context, such
middle-range, linking hypotheses about past women and gender roles
fail to be <em>independent</em> of present assumptions and often fail
to be fully <em>secure</em>. A number of feminist case studies in
archaeology reveal instances in which conventional work fails the
requirement that collateral theories be independent. For example,
Patty Jo Watson and Mary C. Kennedy 1991, reveal pervasive
androcentrism in explanations of the emergence of agriculture in the
Eastern Woodlands of what is now the U.S; Christine Hastorf 1991,
through her study of pre-Hispanic sites in the central Andes, shows
that gender roles and household structures are not the same everywhere
at all times, but change as societal structures or dominant ideas
change; and Elizabeth Brumfiel 1991 whose work in the Valley of Mexico
shows that the Aztec state depended on tribute to maintain its
political and economic hegemony, and this depended on changes in the
organization and deployment of predominantly female domestic
labor.</p>

<h3><a name="FemPerVal">6.3 Feminist Perspectives on Values in Science</a></h3>

<p>
Arguably the greatest challenge for feminist science scholars is in
showing how feminist values can result in epistemically better
science. Critics argue that feminists hold their values
dogmatically. Indeed, these critics argue that everyone holds their
values dogmatically because values cannot be influenced by
facts. Moreover, critics claim that when social values and interests
influence scientific work, they supplant reasoning from evidence and
so interfere with the goal of science which is finding out the truth
about nature and about humans and human life, or finding theories with
a “good fit,” i.e., that fit the data reasonably
well. Thus, when social values or interests influence scientific work
they make it bad science. Since many feminists argue that feminist
values are able to improve science, this is a challenge to which they
must respond. One way to do this would be to make a distinction
between legitimate and illegitimate uses of values. This is the
approach that Elizabeth Anderson takes (1995a, 2004).</p>

<p>
As an illustration of the use of values in a legitimate way
(non-dogmatically) Anderson offers an analysis of Abigail Stewart et
al.'s (1997) research on divorce (Anderson 2004)—research that
was explicitly guided by feminist values in a variety of
ways. According to Anderson, the values that Stewart and her team of
researchers brought to their investigation are of the sort that are
answerable to empirical evidence—the evidence of emotional
states. Anderson argues that values are subject to critical scrutiny
and revision in light of arguments and evidence; briefly, experiences
such as disillusionment allow most people (those who are not dogmatic)
to learn from experience that some of their values are mistaken. Like
most experiences, emotional experiences have cognitive, usually
representative, content and we can find out that the representative
content is erroneous, confused, etc. Thus, if we find out that the
cognitive content of an emotional experience is defective in some way,
we might discount the importance of the feeling, too. Such emotional
experiences can function as evidence for values because these
experiences are independent of our desires and ends. We can be
persuaded by reasons and by facts that despite our emotional
experience of something or someone, that thing or person is valuable
(or not). This sort of persuasive argument is quite common and makes
sense only because our emotions are responsive to facts. And usually
our emotions are reliable, though certainly not infallible, evidence
for our value judgments. The exceptions include emotions affected by
drugs, depression, etc. (2004, 9–10).</p>

<p>
Anderson examines how background values function at various stages of
Stewart et al.'s research: the framing of research questions, the
understanding of the objects of inquiry, the making of decisions about
what data to collect, the generation and sampling of data, the
analysis of the data including the choice of technique for analysis,
decisions about when to end data analysis, and what conclusions are
drawn. To illustrate, we focus on just one of these stages—the
way that values enter into understanding the objects of inquiry.</p>

<p> In the case of the divorce study, there are a variety of such
objects that need to be considered, but prominent among these are
“divorce” and “family.” Stewart's research
team acknowledges these objects of inquiry as “thickly”
described—meaning that value concepts are part of their
descriptions. Anderson notes that, for example, the values
incorporated in the concept of divorce used by Stewart's team differ
from those incorporated into Judith Wallerstein and Joan Kelly's
research on divorce (Wallerstein and Kelly 1980). For Wallerstein and
Kelly divorce is conceived of as a loss or trauma. Stewart's team, in
contrast, took divorce to be a process of adjustment to a new
state. There are two important differences in this alternative
conception of divorce. The first is that divorce is not treated as a
one-time event with an aftermath but rather as an ongoing life
adjustment. Second, the process of adjustment is open-ended allowing
for both positive and negative effects. Wallerstein and Kelly's
framing of divorce as a trauma or loss calls for researchers to focus
on the negative effects and so shapes the data collection. Anderson's
analysis makes it clear that both studies incorporate values—it
is not that one is value-free and the other value-laden. However,
Stewart et al's values are explicitly and self-consciously present and
thus, open to empirical scrutiny.</p>

<p>Anderson's argument is that Stewart et al.'s divorce study is
better science than previous research on divorce because it is more
empirically adequate and thus her argument is consistent with
evaluation on standard constitutive/epistemic values—accounts
that have increased empirical adequacy are prima facie better
accounts. However, what differs is her analysis of the values invoked
in the study and their responsiveness to empirical evidence. Stewart's
conception of the objects of inquiry allows for both negative and
positive experiences to count as evidence of the effects of divorce
and so the way her team conceptualizes the objects of inquiry allows
for a consideration of all of the evidence (unlike Wallerstein and
Kelly's research which focuses only on the negative effects). Thus
Anderson's analysis of the research indicates how the feminist values
held by the researchers and incorporated into the research produce
more empirically adequate, and hence better, science. </p>

<p>
Sharyn Clough's approach to the question of values in science develops
a view based on Donald Davidson's account of belief formation—an
extension of Quinean holism. For Clough, holism requires that all
values are empirically adjudicated—“some political claims
(e.g., feminist claims) are better supported by empirical evidence
than others”(2003b, 4). She has made use of her account to
examine how sexist and racist values are not well-supported by
evidence and hence science that is sexist and racist is clearly not
good science (Clough 2003a; Clough and Loges 2008). She has also
examined how feminist values improve research.</p>

<p> One recent example is her analysis of research on the hygiene
hypothesis—the hypothesis that increased levels of concern about
sanitation and the consequent decrease in exposure to micro-organisms
and pathogens is related to increasingly high rates of auto-immune
disease and allergies, particularly in the industrialized nations of
the North and West (Clough 2011, 2012). The primary evidence for the
hypothesis is the correlation between the rates of disease and the
hygiene habits in the areas where the rates have increased. Further
support for the hypothesis is garnered from recent research that shows
that increased exposure to microbes in childhood is correlated with
increased immunity in adulthood. Clough explores this case from a
feminist perspective after noting additional data—the affected
populations (those suffering from the illnesses) have disproportionate
representation of women and girls. Clough argues that when viewed
through an awareness of the gender structure of human societies, which
generally require higher standards of cleanliness for female children
than for males, this greater incidence of morbidity among females
becomes evidence for the hygiene hypothesis and thus provides an
opportunity for increased empirical adequacy. In other
words, <em>not</em> paying attention to gender—not using the
minimum feminist value that gender matters—narrows the range of
data that researchers treat as evidence. Thus values have the
potential to increase the empirical adequacy of an account. In effect,
feminist values give rise to an augmented hygiene hypothesis that
takes into account the differential enforcement of standards of
cleanliness and so predicts a decreased immunity in adult females.</p>

<p>
On Clough's analysis, the feminist values that drive the research are
“first and foremost, beliefs, the semantic content of which is
formed no differently from the content of factual beliefs. Together,
all of our beliefs form a holistic web of meaning, to use the Quinean
metaphor. Factual and value judgments might be used for different
rhetorical purposes in our explanations and research, but that is
different from saying that one kind of judgment has empirical content
and the other does not” (Clough 2012, 423).</p>

<p>These two examples provide an illustration of how case study
analysis may be used to work through the role that values can serve in
good science and so how the general sorts of insights that holist
accounts provide can be made specific. Each of the accounts discussed
requires that political, social, moral, and cultural values of the
sort that are traditionally understood to be non-epistemic must answer
to empirical evidence. While they differ on the philosophical
details of exactly how evidence bears on theory, the accounts have
strong similarities and suggest avenues for reconciliation or even
convergence. But holist accounts do present challenges in this
regard. Solomon has expressed concerns about the ability of feminist
holist empiricism to provide a general analysis of how values function
in knowledge production. She questions whether any single approach to
values will be able to provide an account of the various ways that
values may function in science. She argues that values are not all of
one type and consequently, when relevant (and they may not always be
relevant, according to Solomon) they may be relevant in different
ways, playing different roles in knowledge production. Different
approaches—such as those that have been discussed and other ways
of thinking about contextual or non-epistemic values and
science—may be better for understanding the various roles that
such values play in knowledge production (Solomon 2012,446). Miriam
Solomon's critique and the ongoing discussion highlight another aspect
of the diversity of feminist perspectives on science.</p>

<h3><a name="Obj">6.4 Objectivity</a></h3>

<p>

One reason that many philosophers of science have found it difficult
to accept the conclusion that non-epistemic, feminist values can make
a positive contribution to science is their commitment to an ideal of
scientific objectivity. Elisabeth Lloyd notes that the meaning of
“objectivity” or of “objective” is complex,
unstable and far from clear. In one philosophical picture,
“objective” characterizes a relationship between knowers
and reality-as-independently-existing; methodologically, the knower
must be detached, because investment in a particular belief or
attachment to a point of view (“bias”) “could impede
the free acquisition of knowledge and correct representation of
(independent) reality…”. In Lloyd's analysis the problem
lies with the claim that this “objective” reality
—what she refers to as the “Really Real”— is
“converged upon through the application of objective
methods.” The Really Real can be known since it is publicly
accessible to those who use these objective methods and who are
properly detached or disinterested.  As Lloyd points out, this view
assumes (a) that the Really Real is completely independent of us;
thus, (b) objective knowledge of this Reality requires an
“objective method” characterized by detachment, because
(c) attachment or point of view might interfere with our independence
from the reality we wish to know, and (d) this reality is publicly
accessible, if it is accessible at all (1995, 354–356). These
assumptions are each problematic and here and in the next
section, <a href="#FemStaThe">Feminist Standpoint Theory</a>, we will
consider how they affect feminist philosophy of science.</p>

<p>

The first assumption, that the Really Real is completely independent
of us, fails to acknowledge that in addition to “resistances by
reality,” sociocultural factors are ”necessarily involved
in the development of knowledge and concept-formation.”
Anthropologists are virtually unanimous in holding that “sex and
gender roles lay the foundations of every human society's other social
practices,” therefore, any epistemology or philosophy of science
that includes social interests and values as integral to the
acquisition of knowledge should include sex and gender related values
and interests (Lloyd 1995, 373 and 367–368). </p>

<p>
Lloyd elaborates that when researchers investigate a phenomenon their
goal is not only to represent reality, but to give
a <em>significant</em> representation (i.e., relevant). Scientific
accounts (theories and hypotheses) must focus on the parts of reality
that are relevant to the interests (and values) that give rise to the
research questions that motivate the research (2005,
244–245). While reality may be independent of us, our accounts
of reality are accounts of the aspects of reality that matter to us
and are shaped by our the interests that give rise to our research
programs. Additionally, the questions addressed through research
arise, in part, from what is thought to be known at the time that the
research commences, this means that part of the evidence for the
account rests in that background knowledge. The ineliminability of
values in both the background knowledge and the current projects
challenges the traditional idea of objectivity.</p>

<p>In addressing the question of objectivity, Lloyd and Anderson both
make use of Hugh Lacey's distinction between two aspects of the
value-free ideal: neutrality and impartiality, to clarify how
interests and values may be implicated in good science (Lacey 1999,
2–6). Neutrality is the requirement that scientific theories
neither presuppose nor support any non-epistemic (moral, political,
social, or cultural) values. Impartiality is the requirement that
theories must be evaluated on the basis of evidence and the extent to
which they fulfill other epistemic values. (Anderson cites Kuhn's 1977
list: empirical adequacy, consistency, scope, external consonance with
established theories) (Anderson 3004, 3). Impartiality is not achieved
by disregarding evaluative standards—interests and values;
instead it is achieved by “a commitment to pass judgment in
relation to a set of evaluative standards that transcends the
competing interest of those who advocate rival answers to a
question” (Anderson 1995b, 41–42). Thus, Lloyd and
Anderson take impartiality to be the key feature of objectivity, as
does Lacey, “<em>Impartiality</em> is the ‘rock
bottom’ component of the idea that the sciences are value
free” (Lacey 1999, 78). However, as discussed in section 6.3,
Anderson notes that at least some value judgments answer to empirical
evidence and so they may serve as part of the evidence for background
theories against which we evaluate evidence for hypotheses under
consideration. This realization forces a reassessment of the ideal of
impartiality—background theories may affect our assessment of
the evidence and so we must be prepared to determine when such
influence is pernicious and when beneficial. As we have seen in
section <a href="#FemPerVal">6.3 Feminist Perspectives on Values in
Science</a>, Anderson makes the distinction by examining the extent to
which the values are responsive to evidence— that is, the extent
to which they are held non-dogmatically.  In order to meet the ideal
of impartiality researchers must consider all of the
evidence—since some of the evidence is either value-laden or
supports the values that direct the research questions, impartial
science need not be neutral.</p>

<p>This discussion has focused on approaches that fall under the 
general description “empiricist,” many of which owe
 much to Longino's contextual empiricism (see the entries on
 <a href="../feminism-epistemology/">feminist epistemology and philosophy of science</a>,
 <a href="../feminist-social-epistemology/">feminist social epistemology</a>, and
 <a href="../scientific-knowledge-social/">the social dimensions of scientific knowledge</a>) 
and so we will close with a brief description of the features of 
contextual empiricism that bear on the question of objectivity.</p>

<p>
Using Kuhnian arguments for underdetermination of theory by evidence,
Longino argues that since empirical evidence can never fully determine
that we should accept any particular theory, contextual values
(social, moral, political, and cultural) must play a role in that
determination. Therefore, evidence is relative to the contextual
values against which the evaluation of the theory occurs, a view that
is shared among most of the philosophers discussed above. As a result,
scientific theory is not neutral; it presupposes certain social and
political values that are among the background assumptions against
which the theory is evaluated and hence it is not objective in the
traditional sense that requires neutrality (2008, 80). For Longino,
scientific theory is not impartial either since social and political
values play a role in theory acceptance. Longino offers another
understanding of objectivity that grows out of the social character of
science, which provides the opportunity for “transformative
criticism.” Such criticism requires the adherence to social
norms: publicly recognized forums for the criticism of evidence, of
methods, and of assumptions and reasoning; uptake of criticism, which
requires that the community not merely tolerate dissent, but alter its
beliefs and theories over time in response to the critical discourse;
publicly recognized standards by reference to which theories,
hypotheses, and observational practices are evaluated and by appeal to
which criticism is made relevant to the goals of the inquiring
community; and finally, communities must be characterized by tempered
equality of intellectual authority (Longino 1993, 1997, 2002). When
science is conducted according to these norms it balances partialities
and Longino considers it objective to the degree that it fulfills
these norms.  But it is neither neutral nor impartial since scientific
theory is informed by values that shape the context in which the
relevance of evidence is determined.
</p>

<p>Feminist standpoint theory is often contrasted to feminist
empiricism as an alternative epistemology for addressing concerns
about the role of values and questions of objectivity. We will briefly
discuss several different analyses of feminist standpoint theory in
the next section. While it has been standard to distinguish feminist
empiricism from feminist standpoint theory since Harding's 1986
categorization of feminist alternatives to traditional epistemology
into three types—feminist empiricism, feminist standpoint
theory, and feminist postmodernism—as we shall see, recent
analyses of feminist standpoint theory and refinement to feminist
empiricism suggest that the views are not only compatible but may
converge (Intemann 2010).</p>

<h3><a name="FemStaThe">6.5 Feminist Standpoint Theory</a></h3>

<p>
Philosophical accounts of feminist standpoint theory begin with Sandra
Harding's account of a methodology that sociologist Dorothy Smith used
and advocated (Smith 1974; Harding 1987).  While there are various
versions, the commonalities include endorsement of the following three
theses: the situated knowledge thesis, the thesis of epistemic
privilege, and the achievement thesis (Wylie 2001, 2003, 2004; Rolin
2009; Intemann 2010; Crasnow 2013, 2014). The thesis of situated
knowledge is based in the understanding that knowledge is <em>for</em>
and <em>by</em> a particular set of socially situated knowers and so
is always <em>local</em>—a cultural/social/political
“location” characterized by the power relations endemic in
such settings. The differential distribution of power and differences
in interests are closely related—and thus the questions asked
and the features of the world that are relevant to answering those
questions vary depending on location as well. As Smith puts
it,“From the point of view of ‘women's place’ the
values assigned to different aspects of the world are changed”
(1974, 7). Among the differences that are most salient are those that
are in conflict with the interests of the dominant groups.  Thus the
metaphors of situated knowledge and social location give rise to one
of the key ideas of feminist standpoint theory—the idea of the
researcher as an insider/outsider who has “double vision.”
Patricia Hill Collins (1986), for example, advocates the use of
standpoint to analyze race and class. She argues that the researcher
who is marginalized may recognize that many of the concepts and
procedures adopted by the discipline are problematic when her
colleagues do not, precisely because she is able to see the objects of
inquiry both with the eyes of a researcher trained in the discipline
and through her own experience from a marginalized social
location.</p>

<p>Epistemic privilege has been one of the more contentious components
of feminist standpoint theory.  Much criticism of the view stems from
a mistaken understanding in which epistemic privilege is thought to be
automatic. As Kristen Intemann points out, if this was the claim that
feminist standpoint theory made the view would be either trivial or
false (Intemann 2010). But feminist standpoint theory is not committed
to the clearly false claim that any woman can <em>automatically</em>
know about the experience of all other women. Nor does it make the
trivial claim that only those who have had a particular experience
know what that experience is like. This seemingly trivial claim
suffers from another problem in any case since the idea that only
women can know the experience of other women depends on a
presupposition of some <em>sameness</em> of women's experience—a
presupposition that is blatantly false. A finer-grained understanding
of social location reveals the flaws of this presupposition since
there are many differences among women having to do with social
cultural, political locations. Misunderstandings of the situated
knowledge and epistemic advantage theses result from thinking of them
in isolation from each other and mistakenly taking them to be claims
about individualistic knowledge. Feminist standpoint theory is not an
account of how an individual acquires knowledge, but rather an account
that treats knowledge as social. This point can be made more clearly
by considering the achievement thesis.</p>

<p>Understanding the achievement thesis requires distinguishing
standpoint from perspective. Harding does so in the following
ways. Feminist standpoint theory intends to map the practices of
power—the ways the dominant institutions and their conceptual
frameworks create and maintain oppressive social relations and
structures. It does this by uncovering a distinctive insight about how
the hierarchical social structure works. This comes about through the
creation of a group consciousness rather than through the shift in
perspective of an individual (Harding, 2004b, 31–32). While the
change in location of an individual automatically brings a different
perspective, achievement of a standpoint is not automatic. Perspective
does not necessarily include the awareness one would need to
“map the practices of power” or understand forms of
oppression. Perspective also is not the right metaphor for
understanding the way in which a groups' consciousness is created and
differs from that of an individual. </p>

<p>Harding emphasizes the deeply political aspect of feminist
standpoint theory. This characterization also makes clear the
challenge that feminist standpoint theory raises for objectivity. Both
neutrality and impartiality seem violated by feminist standpoint
theory. Using the analysis of the previous section, we can see that
the thesis that knowledge is situated means that it is
partial. Treating epistemic privilege as a virtue rather than a vice
depends on the partiality of the knowledge. And finally, the view that
this privilege is not automatic—not merely a result of social
location but achieved— prescribes striving for partiality rather
than impartiality. It is not surprising that resistance to feminist
standpoint theory has revolved around the way it has been perceived as
a threat to the objectivity of science (Pinnick 2005).</p>

<p>Harding addresses the concern about objectivity through what she
calls “strong objectivity,” (see also
the section <a href="#FemMetDeb">The Feminist Methods Debate</a>).
 “Strong objectivity,” means that the subject
of knowledge and the process through which knowledge is produced are
to be scrutinized according to the same standards as the objects of
knowledge. The contextual elements that function as part of the
evidence, the selection of problems, the formation of hypotheses, the
design of research (including the organization of research
communities), the collection, interpretation, and sorting of data,
decisions about when to stop research, the way results of research are
reported and so on need to be open to critical evaluation. But such
evaluation requires that these contextual elements be visible to
researchers. The insider/outsider double-vision that feminist
standpoint theory produces gives rise to the epistemic advantage
through which researchers have access to this
information. “...[A] maximally critical study of scientists and
their communities can be done only from the perspective of those whose
lives have been marginalized by such communities. Thus, strong
objectivity requires that scientists and their communities be
integrated into democracy-advancing projects for scientific and
epistemological reasons as well as moral and political ones”
(Harding 2004a, 136).</p>

<p>

Alison Wylie offers an alternative approach to the question of
objectivity in her account of feminist standpoint theory that suggests
a blurring of the lines between feminist empiricism and feminist
standpoint theory. She notes that “objectivity” is
frequently used to indicate a relationship between theory and the
world and so is identified as a property of knowledge claims. She
proposes that we think about objectivity as the degree to which these
claims conform to some standard set of epistemic virtues such as: empirical
adequacy, explanatory power, internal coherence, consistency with
other established bodies of knowledge. These theoretical virtues can
rarely, if ever, all be maximized and so which virtues are deemed most
important at any given time will depend on the interests, purposes,
intentions, and goals of the knowers—all of which might be
elements of a standpoint. Consequently, feminist standpoint can
improve objectivity through determining what sort of empirical
adequacy, explanatory power, or other virtues are relevant for a
particular knowledge project and the degree to which each is
relevant. Empirical adequacy is typically thought to be the most
crucial of these virtues—a theory must fit the
phenomena—and consequently it might be thought that empirical
adequacy should always be preferred over other virtues. But Wylie
points out that “empirical adequacy” is ambiguous. It
could be either “fidelity to a rich body of localized evidence
(empirical depth), or...a capacity to ‘travel’ (Haraway)
such that the claims in question can be extended to a range of domains
or applications (empirical breadth” (Wylie 2004, 345) and so
even in the case of empirical adequacy interests (and so standpoint)
are relevant. On Wylie's account, science is not neutral (values
inform hypotheses and are implied by them), nor is it impartial, given
that values determine which among the characteristics that determine
objectivity are to be considered the most relevant for <em>this</em>
knowledge project. But impartiality has not entirely vanished in that
what counts as empirical is not determined by values, although its
relevance is. The epistemic privilege thesis of feminist standpoint
theory shows in that those in positions of subordination have
epistemic privilege regarding some kinds of evidence and its
relevance, special inferential heuristics, and interpretative or
explanatory hypotheses. Wylie thus affirms the thesis of epistemic
privilege although she notes that such epistemic privilege is
contingent. It is always relative to a specific knowledge
project. </p>

<p>Both Harding and Wylie appeal to standards (epistemic values) that
transcend any social/political (non-epistemic values) and yet their
accounts accommodate social/political values and provide ways of
understanding how such values play a positive role in knowledge
production. Intemman has argued that contemporary feminist empiricism
and feminist standpoint theory have converged in many ways. For
example, Wylie's account of feminist standpoint theory is compatible
with her holism discussed in
 <a href="#ConModCon">6.2 The Consilience Model of Confirmation</a>.
 However, Intemann identifies two remaining
areas of difference: feminist empiricism and feminist standpoint
theory differ over the kind of diversity needed for objectivity and
they differ over the role that non-epistemic values play in enhancing
objectivity (Intemann 2010, 790). She contends that feminist
empiricism would benefit from adopting feminist standpoint theory's
understanding of diversity—i.e., that it is the diversity of
social locations rather than diversity of interests and values that
are what contribute to objectivity. Intemann argues that feminist
standpoint theory offers a better explanation of the positive role of
feminist values in science rather than simply advocating for the
diversity of values as feminist empiricism does. Whereas feminist
empiricism argues for a balancing of values through diversity and so
embraces impartiality, Intemann claims that feminist standpoint theory
extols feminist values because they are <em>good</em> values rather
than for their role in improving impartiality. She suggests a
convergent position that she dubs “feminist standpoint
empiricism” (2010, 794).</p>

<p>Gaile Pohlhaus, Jr. (2002) has suggested that there are distinctive
features of feminist standpoint theory that have not been fully
developed. She criticizes Harding's explication of feminist standpoint
theory as being too individualist, identifying the spatial metaphor of
social location as the source of this problem. The location metaphor
has the effect of individualizing the knower—only one individual
can occupy a place at a time. Pohlhaus argues that feminist standpoint
theory requires a social conception of the knower(s)—the knower
should be conceived of as a knowledge community not an
individual. Such a social conception of the knower also provides a
path to a <em>political</em> conception of the knower structured by
the distribution of power and provides a fuller account of the
achievement thesis. Standpoint has been understood as achieved
primarily through struggling <em>against</em> the dominant
understanding of the social/political world. What is missing is an
account of struggling <em>with</em>. “To struggle-with would
involve building relations with others by which we may come to know
the world and understand one another, that is the project of building
knowing communities” (Pohlhaus 2002, 292). Political communities
are built on shared interests. Building such a community requires
acknowledging diversity—including diversity of interests that
arise from diversity of location—and uncovering shared interests
through which to forge community. The political nature of early
standpoint, with its roots in Marxist theory, captured this political
feature of achievement, but later versions minimize it, moving away
from the Marxist use of class struggle as a primary organizing
principle of analysis. Sharon Crasnow (2013, 2014) suggests that
Pohlhaus's insight about struggling-with can be developed into a more
nuanced account of social/political values and negotiated shared
interests. These negotiated and forged shared interests, arrived at
through struggling-with, could serve to provisionally stabilize
evidential relevance relations around a particular knowledge
project. Such an extension of feminist standpoint theory may also
point to its relationship to current research in social epistemology
(see the entry on
 <a href="../feminist-social-epistemology/">feminist social epistemology</a>).
 This is another path through which a convergence of
feminist empiricism and standpoint theory could be developed.</p>

<h2><a name="Con">7. Conclusion</a></h2>

<p>

Feminist perspectives on science reflect a broad spectrum of
appraisals and epistemic attitudes toward science. These are motivated
by a recognition that the institutions of science have traditionally
excluded women as practitioners; that issues of concern to women and
sex/gender minorities are routinely marginalized in scientific inquiry,
or are treated in ways that reproduce gender-normative stereotypes; and
that scientific authority often rationalizes social roles and
institutions that feminists call into question.</p>

<p>

Feminists are skeptical of both the presumption that the sciences are
an inherently masculine domain—that women are unfit for science,
or science unfit for women—and the conviction that the
institutions of science are a model of gender-neutral
meritocracy. This skepticism has led to feminist equity critiques
(discussed in the section on
 <a href="#FemEquCri">Feminist Equity Critiques</a>).
 Feminist historians of science document entrenched
historical patterns of exclusion of women but, at the same time, they
recover evidence of women's active participation in the
sciences. Although by mid-nineteenth century women were admitted to
institutions of higher education and slowly gained access to
scientific training, since the 1980's it has become clear that these
gains in science training have not translated into comparable
improvements in their representation in faculties of science and in
“leadership positions” in the sciences.</p>

<p>

Conventional explanations of these persistent inequalities typically
invoke the talents, drive, and preferences of women. But other
explanations note that while intentional discrimination still exists,
gender discrimination also takes the form of diffuse but persistent
differences in the recognition and reward of women's
achievements. These differences in treatment arise in part from
cognitive schemas and other heuristics that operate below the
threshold of conscious awareness, generating patterns of evaluation
bias that track not only gender but also race/ethnicity and a range of
other markers by which social inequality is constituted. Although
feminists have different perspectives on science in which they work,
feminists share a concern to understand and to change conditions of
oppression that operate along lines of gender difference.  These goals
require an accurate understanding of the nature and sources of
oppression, and the sciences offer powerful tools for providing this
understanding. As we saw in Section 3, some feminist scientists call
for attention to neglected questions with the aim of improving the
sciences in their own terms; those who are more methodologically and
epistemically conservative do not challenge the background
assumptions, methodological commitments, standards and practices of
existing programs of scientific research. We can think of this
approach as the selective appropriation of the tools of scientific
inquiry for application in feminist-directed research. </p>

<p>

But even epistemically conservative feminist interventions—those
focused on correcting errors of omission and on investigating
neglected problems—often generate more deeply challenging
questions. Thus, many feminist scientists are more critical of the
standards and practices of existing research programs and pursue
constructive programs aimed at transforming the methodologies,
ontological commitments, framework assumptions, and epistemic ideals
that animate their fields. As we see from the many examples presented
in Section 3, interventions that intend to be remedial or corrective
often expose patterns of omission or gender-normative distortion that
compromise not just the details but the framework assumptions of the
sciences examined and the epistemic ideals that inform scientific
practice.</p>

<p>

The recognition that established scientific methodologies frequently
reproduce or generate androcentric and sexist biases has led feminists
to ask how to improve their methods. Feminists have articulated
guidelines for research that sought to avoid the pitfalls of sexist
and androcentric practice exposed by feminist critique (Section
4). These guidelines include addressing questions relevant to women
and others oppressed by gendered systems; grounding research in the
situated experience of women, i.e., ensuring that women's experience
gives rise directly to the questions asked and undertaking to treat
gendered experience and self-understanding as a critical resource at
all stages of research (though not as epistemically foundational);
adhering to ethical and pragmatic norms specifying that practitioners
be accountable to research subjects in various senses; and being
reflexive. Strong reflexivity means taking into account the ways in
which their own socially defined angle of vision, interests, and
values influence the research process. In short, feminist research
aims to prevent gender from being “disappeared.”</p>

<p>

All the issues discussed in this essay, from equity critiques to
philosophical analysis, are among those included in the field known as
“feminist sciences studies.” Generally, this
interdisciplinary field, discussed in Section 5, encompasses feminist
work in anthropology, cultural studies, economics, feminism, history,
philosophy, political science, and sociology, and aims to show that and
how science is a social activity. Across these disciplines, feminist
science scholars contribute gender analyses that address such issues as
power and inequality, differences among knowers, subjectivity and
objectivity, embodiment, work, and the distinction between scientific
experts and lay-people. And most feminist analyses pay attention to the
relationships among science, gender, race, class, sexuality, disability
and colonialism and how science constructs and applies these
differences. Section 5 briefly summarizes past work in feminist science
studies, but we note that recent work increasingly turns to the role of
gender and science in developing nations and in the processes of
development; the intersection of gender, science and culture
outside of western cultures holds promise. Although race is more
likely to be addressed within feminist than mainstream science studies,
much work remains to be done; and finally, feminist disabilities
studies now appear with increasing prominence.</p>

<p>

Feminist science studies often expose instances in which gendered
social values compromise scientific results. But often, feminist
science studies reveal that such contextual/non-epistemic values can
improve science. This recognition flies in the face of the traditional
philosophical view of contextual/non-epistemic values when it comes to
matters of theory justification, evidence, and objectivity. Thus,
feminist philosophies of science, exemplified in Section 6, undertake
to determine whether and how social values and interests play a
positive role in the scientific knowledge production. Science is
conventionally understood as objective in the sense that scientific
work and the results of that work are free of contextual/non-epistemic
values, i.e., moral, social, or political values. Feminist
philosophers of science have offered alternative accounts of
objectivity in order to explain how science that incorporates feminist
values can be better, more objective, science. They do so with the aim
of giving accounts that are empirically adequate to the case studies
as they stand, without excessive rational reconstruction. This focus
on case studies also calls for alternative analyses of how objectivity
is understood. We have reviewed a variety of alternative approaches
that use feminist empiricism and feminist standpoint theory. In
summary, feminist perspectives on science arise from concerns to
improve the lives of all who are affected by gender inequity by
encouraging and using better understandings of the natural and social
worlds.</p>
