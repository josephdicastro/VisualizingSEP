<h1>Structuralism in the Philosophy of Mathematics</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Mon Nov 18, 2019</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
Two related slogans for structuralism in the philosophy of mathematics 
are that “mathematics is the general study of
structures” and that, in pursuing such study, we can
“abstract away from the nature of objects instantiating those
structures”. (As such, structuralism stands in contrast with
several other general views about mathematics, including: the
traditional view that mathematics is the science of number and
quantity; the view that it is an empty formalism used
primarily for calculation; and the view that it is the study of a
basic set-theoretic universe.) As the present survey aims to show,
these slogans, while suggestive, are ambiguous and in need of
clarification. Indeed, they have been interpreted in various
different, even conflicting ways.</p>

<p>
The introduction of structuralist views in the philosophy of
mathematics is often assumed to have happened in the 1960s, in works
by Paul Benacerraf and Hilary Putnam; the trend picked up steam in the
1980s–90s, when Michael Resnik, Stuart Shapiro, 
Geoffrey Hellman, Charles Parsons, and others entered the fray; and these
debates have been reshaped again during the last 20 years, by
several philosophical challenges to structuralism and by the
introduction of further variants, including category-theoretic forms
of structuralism. Besides introducing the reader to the general topic of 
“structuralism in the philosophy of 
mathematics”, a second main goal of the 
present essay will be to provide a novel, broader, and 
relatively comprehensive taxonomy for the varieties of
structuralism on offer today. </p>

<h3 id="Begi1960BenaPutn">1.1 Beginnings of the Structuralism Debate in the 1960s</h3>

<p>
The discussion of structuralism, as a major position in
English-speaking philosophy of mathematics, is usually taken to have
started in the 1960s. A central article in this connection was Paul
Benacerraf’s “What Numbers Could Not Be” (1965; cf.
also Benacerraf 1996, a later follow-up). The background and foil for
this article was the position, dominant at the time, that axiomatic
set theory provides the foundation for modern mathematics, including
allowing us to identify all mathematical objects with sets. For
example, the natural numbers 0, 1, 2, … can be identified with
the finite von Neumann ordinals (starting with <span class="MathJax_Preview" style="color: inherit; display: none;"></span><span class="MathJax" id="MathJax-Element-1-Frame" tabindex="0" data-mathml="&lt;math xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot;&gt;&lt;mi mathvariant=&quot;normal&quot;&gt;&amp;#x2205;&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/math&gt;" role="presentation" style="position: relative;"><nobr aria-hidden="true"><span class="math" id="MathJax-Span-1" style="width: 0.591em; display: inline-block;"><span style="display: inline-block; position: relative; width: 0.53em; height: 0px; font-size: 103%;"><span style="position: absolute; clip: rect(1.229em, 1000.49em, 2.432em, -1000em); top: -2.177em; left: 0em;"><span class="mrow" id="MathJax-Span-2"><span class="mi" id="MathJax-Span-3" style="font-family: MathJax_Main;">∅</span></span><span style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; height: 2.177em;"></span></span></span><span style="display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; vertical-align: -0.141em; border-left: 0px solid; width: 0px; height: 0.997em;"></span></span></nobr><span class="MJX_Assistive_MathML" role="presentation"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mi mathvariant="normal">∅</mi></math></span></span><script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-1">\emptyset</script> for 0 and

similarly, the real numbers can be identified with Dedekind cuts
constructed set-theoretically. Arithmetic truths are then 
truths about these set-theoretic objects; and this generalizes 
to other mathematical theories, all of whose objects are
taken to be sets as well.</p>

<p>
According to Benacerraf, such a set-theoretic foundationalist position
misrepresents the structuralist character of arithmetic in particular
and of mathematics more generally. To begin with, instead of working
with the finite von Neumann ordinals, we can equally well work with
the finite Zermelo ordinals (starting again with <span class="MathJax_Preview" style="color: inherit; display: none;"></span><span class="MathJax" id="MathJax-Element-3-Frame" tabindex="0" data-mathml="&lt;math xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot;&gt;&lt;mi mathvariant=&quot;normal&quot;&gt;&amp;#x2205;&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/math&gt;" role="presentation" style="position: relative;"><nobr aria-hidden="true"><span class="math" id="MathJax-Span-16" style="width: 0.591em; display: inline-block;"><span style="display: inline-block; position: relative; width: 0.53em; height: 0px; font-size: 103%;"><span style="position: absolute; clip: rect(1.229em, 1000.49em, 2.432em, -1000em); top: -2.177em; left: 0em;"><span class="mrow" id="MathJax-Span-17"><span class="mi" id="MathJax-Span-18" style="font-family: MathJax_Main;">∅</span></span><span style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; height: 2.177em;"></span></span></span><span style="display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; vertical-align: -0.141em; border-left: 0px solid; width: 0px; height: 0.997em;"></span></span></nobr><span class="MJX_Assistive_MathML" role="presentation"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mi mathvariant="normal">∅</mi></math></span></span><script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-3">\emptyset</script> for 0

\{x\})</script>; and there are infinitely many other choices that are
equivalent. Similarly, instead of working with a set-theoretic
construction of the real numbers in terms of Dedekind cuts, we can
work with a construction based on equivalence classes of Cauchy
sequences on the rational numbers as suggested by Cantor and
others. This basic observation is hard to deny, and even set-theorist
foundationalists can agree with it (more on that below). But
Benacerraf draws some further, more controversial conclusions from
this basic observation. </p>

<p>
Benacerraf argues, in particular, that the natural numbers should not
be identified with any set-theoretic objects; in fact, they should not
be taken to be objects at all. Instead, numbers should
be treated as “positions in 
structures”, e.g., in
“the natural number structure”,
“the real number structure”, 
etc. All that matters about such positions are their
structural properties, i.e., those “stem[ming]
from the relations they bear to one another in virtue of being
arranged in a progression” (1965: 70), as opposed to further
set-theoretic properties of the von Neumann ordinals, Dedekind cuts,
etc. What we study and try to characterize in modern mathematics,
along such lines, are the corresponding “abstract
structures”. It is in this sense that Benacerraf 
suggests a structuralist position concerning mathematics. The
details of the position are left open and somewhat vague, however,
including how we should think about Benacerraf’s 
abstract structures in the end, except that they are not to be
identified with set-theoretic relational systems
(consisting of sets as domains, with set-theoretic relations and
functions defined on them). </p>

<p>
A second article from the 1960s that was influential in the rise of
structuralism is Hilary Putnam’s
“Mathematics without Foundations” 
(1967). Like in
Benacerraf’s case, for Putnam the foil was a set-theoretic
foundationalist position. This position is sometimes, although not
always, understood in a realist sense (e.g., by Gödel), 
i.e., as the description of an independent realm of
abstract objects, namely the universe of sets characterized by the
Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms. In opposition to that position, Putnam suggests 
a form of “if-then-ism” 
(which can be traced back to Russell).
That alternative can again be illustrated in terms of the natural
numbers. How should an arithmetic theorem, say

real numbers (see Reck &amp; Price 2000 for details).</p>

<p>
Instead of talking about if-then-ism in this connection,
one can describe Putnam’s position also as a kind of
“universalist structuralism” 
(see again Reck &amp; Price
2000), since it involves universal quantification over relevant
systems and since our two structuralist slogans above seem satisfied.
Often an objection to this position is the “non-vacuity
problem”. It is based on the observation that if-then statements
of the given form are vacuously true if there is nothing that
satisfies the antecedent, e.g., if there is no model of the
Dedekind-Peano axioms. (As this would also be the case for, say,
“<span class="MathJax_Preview" style="color: inherit; display: none;"></span><span class="MathJax" id="MathJax-Element-10-Frame" tabindex="0" data-mathml="&lt;math xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot;&gt;&lt;mn&gt;2&lt;/mn&gt;&lt;mo&gt;+&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mn&gt;3&lt;/mn&gt;&lt;mo&gt;=&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mn&gt;6&lt;/mn&gt;&lt;/math&gt;" role="presentation" style="position: relative;"><nobr aria-hidden="true"><span class="math" id="MathJax-Span-64" style="width: 4.181em; display: inline-block;"><span style="display: inline-block; position: relative; width: 4.06em; height: 0px; font-size: 103%;"><span style="position: absolute; clip: rect(1.335em, 1004.02em, 2.436em, -1000em); top: -2.177em; left: 0em;"><span class="mrow" id="MathJax-Span-65"><span class="mn" id="MathJax-Span-66" style="font-family: MathJax_Main;">2</span><span class="mo" id="MathJax-Span-67" style="font-family: MathJax_Main; padding-left: 0.222em;">+</span><span class="mn" id="MathJax-Span-68" style="font-family: MathJax_Main; padding-left: 0.222em;">3</span><span class="mo" id="MathJax-Span-69" style="font-family: MathJax_Main; padding-left: 0.278em;">=</span><span class="mn" id="MathJax-Span-70" style="font-family: MathJax_Main; padding-left: 0.278em;">6</span></span><span style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; height: 2.177em;"></span></span></span><span style="display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; vertical-align: -0.145em; border-left: 0px solid; width: 0px; height: 0.892em;"></span></span></nobr><span class="MJX_Assistive_MathML" role="presentation"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mn>2</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>3</mn><mo>=</mo><mn>6</mn></math></span></span><script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-10">2+3=6</script>”, 
the overall result is clearly not desirable.) In response, 
one can invoke axiomatic set theory as providing the needed models. 
But from Putnam’s point of view this has two
drawbacks: First, it relies on a realist and foundationalist view
about set theory, it would seem, thus undermining the thrust 
of if-then-ism. Second and more basically, it forces us to
treat set theory differently from other mathematical
theories, on pain of circularity. As a way out of these dilemmas,
Putnam suggests to employ modal logic. However, the details are again
left open and largely unexplored, especially for the case of set
theory.</p>

<h3 id="Cons1980ResnShapHellEtc">1.2 Consolidation and Further Discussions in the 1980s</h3>

<p>
One way to understand Benacerraf’s discussion in his 1965
article is that he proposes to treat the natural number
structure as a new kind of abstract entity, different from
set-theoretic objects and systems of objects. All depends then on what
exactly that amounts to, including whether one should treat such
structures as objects themselves, 
thus reifying them in some substantive and still to be worked
out way, or not. Benacerraf himself was reluctant to do the latter, in
line with his overall hesitancy to talk about mathematical
objects. </p>

<p>
One subsequent writer who picked up on Benacerraf’s ideas in the
early 1980s and tried to spell them out further, while still
refraining from treating structures as full-fledged
objects, is Michael Resnik (cf. Resnik 1981, 1982, 1988, and, most
systematically, 1997). For him too, modern mathematics involves a
“structuralist perspective”. 
This includes a kind of pattern recognition; 
and one of Resnik’s main
goals is to spell out the corresponding epistemology further. Along
Benacerraf’s lines, mathematical objects are
viewed as “positions” 
in corresponding patterns; and this
is meant to allow us to take mathematical statements 
“at face value”,
in the sense of seeing ‘0’, 
‘1’,
‘2’, etc. as 
singular terms referring to such positions.
At the same time, doing so is not supposed to require
reifying the underlying structures, which would mean
specifying precise criteria of identity for them, something Resnik
avoids intentionally. (He presents himself as a Quinean on this point,
in the sense of adopting Quine’s slogan: 
“No entity
without identity!”)</p>

<p>
Stewart Shapiro is a second philosopher of mathematics who, in the
early 1980s, attempts to build on Benacerraf’s 
paper (see Shapiro 1983, 1989, and most systematically, 
Shapiro 1997). By focusing more on metaphysical questions and leaving behind
hesitations about structures as objects, Shapiro’s
goal is to defend a more thoroughly realist version of
mathematical structuralism, thus rejecting nominalist and
constructivist views (more on that below). Such realism includes the
semantic aspect mentioned above (taking mathematical statements
at face value); but Shapiro also wants to clarify the talk about 
“positions in structures” further. 
He distinguishes two perspectives on them. According to the first, the
positions at issue are treated as 
“offices”,
i.e., as slots that can be filled or occupied 
by various objects (e.g., the position
“0” 
in the natural number structure is occupied by
<span class="MathJax_Preview" style="color: inherit; display: none;"></span><span class="MathJax" id="MathJax-Element-11-Frame" tabindex="0" data-mathml="&lt;math xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot;&gt;&lt;mi mathvariant=&quot;normal&quot;&gt;&amp;#x2205;&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/math&gt;" role="presentation" style="position: relative;"><nobr aria-hidden="true"><span class="math" id="MathJax-Span-71" style="width: 0.591em; display: inline-block;"><span style="display: inline-block; position: relative; width: 0.53em; height: 0px; font-size: 103%;"><span style="position: absolute; clip: rect(1.229em, 1000.49em, 2.432em, -1000em); top: -2.177em; left: 0em;"><span class="mrow" id="MathJax-Span-72"><span class="mi" id="MathJax-Span-73" style="font-family: MathJax_Main;">∅</span></span><span style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; height: 2.177em;"></span></span></span><span style="display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; vertical-align: -0.141em; border-left: 0px solid; width: 0px; height: 0.997em;"></span></span></nobr><span class="MJX_Assistive_MathML" role="presentation"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mi mathvariant="normal">∅</mi></math></span></span><script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-11">\emptyset</script> in the series of finite von Neumann ordinals). 
According to the second perspective, the positions are treated as
“objects”
themselves; and so are the abstract
structures.</p>

<p>
For Shapiro, the structures at issue thus have a dual nature: they are 
“universals”, 
in the sense that the natural number structure, say, can be instantiated
by various relational systems (the system consisting of the finite von
Neumann ordinals, or of the Zermelo ordinals, etc.); but they are also
“particulars”, 
to be named by singular terms and treated as objects 
themselves. To defend the latter further, Shapiro develops a general structure 
theory, i.e., an axiomatic theory that specifies which structures exist. While
modeled on set theory, this theory is justified independently (more on
how below). As such, it is meant to underwrite 
“<em>ante
rem</em> structuralism”. 
Shapiro’s terminology of
“<em>ante rem</em> versus <em>in 
re</em>” involves an
explicit reference to Medieval discussions of universals.  The crucial
point in our context is that the structures specified in his theory
are meant to be ontologically independent of, indeed
<em>prior to</em>, any instantiations of them. In other
words, the structures do not just exist 
<em>in</em> their instantiations, but separate to and 
<em>before</em> them. </p>

<p>
While Resnik’s and Shapiro’s 
structuralist positions are
sometimes identified, this is somewhat misleading given the
differences already mentioned. Nevertheless, there is significant
overlap. Both recognize mathematical structures as certain patterns with 
positions in them etc. (whether these patterns are then treated as 
full-fledged objects, in a realist sense, or not). And
for both Resnik and Shapiro, the notion of isomorphism
is crucial (or some related, more general notion of equivalence; 
see Resnik 1997 and Shapiro 1997). That is
to say, for both a relevant structure/pattern can be instantiated by
any of a relevant class of isomorphic relational systems. This
corresponds to the fact that the axiomatic systems at issue, for the
natural numbers, the real numbers, and similar cases, are all
categorical (or quasi-categorical in the case of set theory). Not
every mathematical axiom system has that feature, of course, e.g., the
axiom systems for group or ring theory allow for non-isomorphic
instances or models. For Resnik as well as Shapiro, such
“algebraic” 
theories are to be treated in a different,
more derivative way; their structuralist point of view is meant to
apply primarily to “non-algebraic” 
theories, paradigmatically arithmetic.</p>

<p>
There is another structuralist position from the 1980s that is quite
different and explicitly not realist, namely that
introduced by Geoffrey Hellman (cf. Hellman 1989, 1996, and later
articles). While for Resnik and Shapiro the inspiration was
Benacerraf’s 1965 article, the starting point 
for Hellman is Putnam’s 1967 article. In fact, 
Hellman’s “modal
structuralism” is meant to be a systematic 
development of Putnam’s modalized if-then-ism. 
The modal aspect is now spelled out in detail and with real 
ingenuity, including for the case of set theory (building on work 
by Zermelo etc.). For Hellman, a sentence such as

To avoid the non-vacuity problem, he adds the following
assumption:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Possibly, there exists an <i>M</i> such
that <i>M</i> is a model of the Dedekind-Peano axioms. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>(We will come back to its justification below.)</p>

<p>
As Hellman makes clear, his goal is to develop a form of
“structuralism without structures” 
(Hellman 1996), since the existence of abstract structures, postulated 
by Resnik and Shapiro, is replaced by the modal aspects of his position
(and corresponding assumptions about necessity and possibility). In
fact, Hellman’s position is meant to be a form of
nominalism, i.e., to eliminate the appeal to any kind of abstract entity 
(not only abstract structures but also sets etc.). Yet it is also 
not meant to rely on <em>possibilia</em>, i.e., possible objects 
existing in some shadowy sense. This leads Hellman to a specific
understanding of the modalities at issue. They are meant to be basic,
i.e., the relevant possibilities and necessities are not reducible to
anything further. On the other hand, they are specified precisely in
terms of laws of modal logic (those of the system S5).</p>

<h3 id="TowaFirsTaxoCharParsDist">1.3 Towards a First Taxonomy of Structuralist Positions</h3>

<p>
From the late 1980s on, Shapiro’s and 
Hellman’s positions
have often been treated as the two main structuralist options. 
(This is still reflected in Hellman &amp; Shapiro 2019.) 
As they are quite different, this already indicates that it
is wrong to see “structuralism in the philosophy of
mathematics” as a unique position or a unified perspective, even
though certain general slogans are shared. Beyond that, other versions
of structuralism started to play a role in the late 1980s and early
1990s (including forms of “set-theoretic 
structuralism”
that go back further in time than the 1960s, as we will
see). Consequently, the discussions about structuralism
have become both richer and more complex.</p>

<p>
To clarify this situation, Charles Parsons suggested a first taxonomy,
or at least a distinction between two main kinds of positions (Parsons
1990). Namely, there are 
“eliminative” forms of
structuralism, as illustrated paradigmatically by Hellman; and there
are “non-eliminative” 
forms of structuralism, like Shapiro’s. (The 
elimination at issue concerns the postulation, or avoidance thereof, of 
structures as abstract objects.) Or put in Hellman’s 
slightly later terminology, there is 
“structuralism without structures”, 
on the one hand, and 
“structuralism with structures”, 
on the other hand. Besides Shapiro and Resnik (with the qualifications above),
another proponent of the non-eliminative form is Parsons himself 
(see Parsons 1990, 2004, and, most systematically, 2008); and another proponent 
of the eliminative form of structuralism is Charles Chihara (cf. Chihara 2004). </p>

<p>
Nevertheless, it seems to have been tempting, and has remained fairly
widespread in the literature, to identify non-eliminative
structuralism with Shapiro’s position, 
i.e., with his realist and <em>ante rem</em> version. In
fact, critics sometimes dismiss “philosophical
structuralism” generally as a misguided form 
of metaphysics, thereby identifying such structuralism with 
Shapiro’s realist form. (This seems especially tempting 
for mathematicians and for philosophers rooted deeply in mathematical
practice; cf. Awodey 1996 and Carter 2008 for related discussions.) A
further consideration of Parsons’ form of 
non-eliminative structuralism can help to show that this is too quick 
and inadequate in the end. </p>

<p>
Unlike Shapiro, Parsons does not offer a novel, philosophically
motivated structure theory as the backing for his
position. For him, we should remain closer to mathematical practice
(as it developed in the late nineteenth and the twentieth
centuries). In fact, structuralism should be seen as
growing out of that practice, rather than being imposed on it from
outside. For Parsons this means, among others, taking abstract
structures to be introduced directly by categorical axiom
systems, a practice he spells out further in a
“meta-linguistic” 
way inspired by Quine (see Parsons
2008). It also means that we should refrain from
“cross-structural 
identifications” (as they can be found
in Shapiro’s early works), e.g., from identifying 
the natural number 1 and the real number 1. Such putative identities
should be left indeterminate, as is done in mathematical practice.</p>

<p>
As should be evident, Parsons’ structuralist position, like
Resnik’s, is less realist than Shapiro’s. 
Moreover, he is explicit that adopting a “structuralist view of
mathematical objects” should be seen as separable from, and
orthogonal to, the realism/nominalism dichotomy. Consequently, for Parsons one 
can be a non-eliminative structuralist without being a realist in any strong sense; 
his own position is a case in point. 
Yet Parsons’ version of structuralism is still meant
to allow taking mathematical statements at face value (as characterized above), 
so that it remains realist in
this minimal semantic sense.</p>

<h2 id="FurtDeveBroaTaxo">2. Later Developments and a Broader Taxonomy</h2>

<h3 id="MetaEpisChalStru">2.1 Metaphysical and Epistemological Challenges</h3>

<p>
So far we have traced the development of structuralism 
in the philosophy of mathematics from Benacerraf and Putnam, 
in the 1960s, to Resnik, Shapiro, Hellman, Chihara, and Parsons, in the
1980s–90s. During the last 20 years, a number of further
philosophers have started to address this topic. We now turn to
the corresponding discussions, starting with certain
epistemological and metaphysical challenges to structuralism. Some of
these concern non-eliminative structuralism alone,
especially Shapiro’s position. (This again reflects the
prominence of Shapiro’s position, to the point that it is often
identified, misleadingly, with “philosophical
structuralism”.) Others are broader, including
comparing the basic commitments of various forms of structuralism. In
what follows, we will not try to be comprehensive, but provide a
number of illustrative examples.</p>

<p>
Non-eliminative structuralism, in Shapiro’s and
other versions, involves the thesis that all that matters about
mathematical objects are their structural properties (as
opposed to further intrinsic properties). In fact, such
properties are taken to determine the 
objects’ identities. But
then, objects that are indistinguishable in this
respect—“structural 
indiscernibles”—should be
identified, it seems. As several critics pointed out around the year
2000, this leads to the 
“identity problem” for
structuralism (cf. Keränen 2001, earlier Burgess 1999). 
It arises prominently for systems or structures that are non-rigid, i.e., 
allow for non-trivial automorphisms. In
such cases, there are supposedly distinct objects that are
indistinguishable in the relevant sense. A widely known case is the
system of complex numbers (with the conjugate numbers <i>i</i> and
−<i>i</i>); but geometry and graph theory, among others, 
provide further examples. The simplest example is probably an unlabeled
2-element graph with no edges, whose two vertices are
structurally indiscernible. </p>

<p>
How can such cases be handled from a structuralist point of view? Is
structuralism (of this kind) simply incoherent, as some
of its critics charge? Or is it at least not applicable to non-rigid
cases, which would limit its reach significantly? Several responses to
the identity problem  have been offered in the literature. One suggestion is to 
“rigidify” such
structures by enlarging the vocabulary that is used, e.g., by adding
the constant symbol ‘<i>i</i>’ 
for the complex numbers (either into the original language or into the language for 
the “setting” used in 
the background, cf. Halimi 2019). But
this still seems problematic in the case of many indiscernibles,
perhaps even uncountably many. Another suggestion is to treat identity
as a primitive notion, as is arguably part of mathematical
practice. But in that case too a number of questions remain (see
Ladyman 2005, Button 2006, Leitgeb &amp; 
Ladyman 2008, Shapiro 2008, Ketland 2011, and Menzel 2018, 
among others).</p>

<p>
A second, more basic problem for structuralism starts
again with the idea that all that matters about mathematical objects
are their structural properties. With respect to
non-eliminative structuralism, this is sometimes 
strengthened to the thesis that the positions in
mathematical structures, as well as the abstract structures themselves, 
“only have structural
properties”. But if not formulated more carefully, 
this leads to counterexamples (cf. Reck 2003). For instance, does
the natural number structure not have the property that
it is a favorite example in many debates about structuralism?  And
isn’t it a property of the number 9 to have long been 
taken to be the number of planets in the Solar System? Both seem clearly
non-structural properties.  Once again, structuralism 
appears incoherent or, at the very least, in need of
further clarification.</p>

<p>
A natural response to this challenge is to refine the original
structuralist thesis, e.g., by saying that abstract structures only have 
structural properties
“essentially”, 
that only such properties are
“constitutive” 
for them, or something similar, while
admitting that they have other properties too (see Reck 2003,
Schiemer &amp; Wigglesworth forthcoming). This leads to questions
about how exactly to make this distinction. But even if it is taken to
constitute a satisfactory response, another problem remains: How can
we distinguish “structural” from
“non-structural” 
properties in the first place? Several answers to that question 
have been proposed in turn, e.g., that structural properties are 
those definable in a certain way, or that they are those preserved 
under relevant morphisms.  Yet no consensus on that issue has been
reached either (see Korbmacher &amp; 
Schiemer 2018, also for further
references).</p>

<p>
A third challenge directed again especially, or even exclusively, at
non-eliminative structuralism concerns the
following. From a structuralist point of view, positions
are always “positions in a 
structure”; i.e., the structure
is primary and the positions are secondary. Hence, a particular
mathematical object, such as the natural number 2, seems
“ontologically 
dependent” on the background structure,
here the structure of the natural numbers. (The fact that for a
structuralist it is misguided to consider the number 2 as
existing in itself reflects this aspect. It also
illustrates a main difference between structuralism and logicism or
set-theoretic foundationalism.) But how should this ontological
dependence be understood? Are there perhaps connections to
“grounding” 
or related notions in current analytic
metaphysics? In this context too, many open questions remain and a
lively debate has started (cf. Linnebo 2008, also, e.g., MacBride 2005
and Wigglesworth 2018). </p>

<p>
A fourth basic challenge for structuralism, mostly again in its non-eliminative 
form, is how we can have “access” 
to structures seen as abstract objects (cf. Hale 1996, among others). To some degree, 
this revives an older, more general debate about such objects. An initial
response, by Resnik, Shapiro, and Parsons (all following Quine here),
is to talk about the “positing” 
of structures, which promises to undercut the access problem.  But under what
conditions is such positing legitimate (given the threat
of paradox familiar from naïve set theory)? A plausible 
answer points to the “coherence” 
of the relevant theories (which,
after Gödel’s 
incompleteness results, is seen as taking the
place of provable consistency). Yet what exactly does such
coherence amount to? An interesting outcome of the
debate about this issue is that Shapiro and Hellman, coming from very
different directions, have arrived at views that are very close to
each other (see Hellman 2005). Thus, in terms of some basic
commitments—ultimate conditions for existence in
Shapiro’s case and for possibility in
Hellman’s case—their 
approaches converge in surprising ways. (This may 
be seen as providing support for both sides, but also
as undermining the realism/nominalism dichotomy.)</p>

<p>
There are more challenges to structuralism in
mathematics that one can find in the literature of the last 20
years. While usually connected to the problems just surveyed, sometimes
these challenges go further. For example, additional questions about
the semantics involved in structuralism have been raised, typically
again for the non-eliminative variant (cf. Button &amp;
Walsh 2016, Assadian 2018, etc.). Instead of summarizing these challenges too, we
hope our survey so far provides enough illustration
of the kinds of debates that have occurred in the recent
literature already.</p>

<h3 id="AddiVariBurgFefeLinnPettEtc">2.2 Several Additional Variants of Structuralism</h3>

<p>
As mentioned earlier, in many discussions of structuralism, 
from the 1980s to the early 2000s and
beyond, a few positions have taken center stage: Shapiro’s,
Hellman’s, sometimes Parsons’, 
and occasionally Resnik’s. But other forms of 
structuralism have been around for decades too. These deserve, and are starting 
to get, more attention as well. Without any claim to comprehensiveness, we
want to mention several noteworthy examples. A major one, whose origins
can be traced back to before the 1960s, is “set-theoretic
structuralism” (cf. Reck &amp; 
Price 2000, also Reck &amp;
Schiemer forthcoming). To introduce it, let us reconsider the example
central to Benacerraf’s 1965 paper: the natural 
numbers. </p>

<p>
As Benacerraf argued, there is something wrong with identifying
“the natural numbers” 
with a particular set-theoretic
system; or at least, it seems wrong to do so in any absolute sense.  
Benacerraf’s conclusion was that
numbers are not sets, nor objects of any kind, but positions in
a structure. Now, one can agree with almost everything
Benacerraf says and still want to identify “the natural
numbers” with some set-theoretic system in a less
absolute sense.  In doing so, one can admit that any
other model of the Dedekind-Peano axioms “would do as
well”, i.e., could have been chosen instead (except perhaps for
pragmatic reasons, e.g., the ability to generalize to the
transfinite). This means that what we identify as 
the natural numbers depends on an initial, provisional, 
and somewhat arbitrary choice. For most mathematical purposes, such a
pragmatic identification is sufficient; in fact, this is
exactly what one does in standard axiomatic set theory. The resulting
position deserves again to be counted as a form of structuralism, 
as its defenders insist. What makes it structuralist is the 
“indifference to identify” 
the natural numbers in any more absolute sense
(cf. Burgess 2015). </p>

<p>
The core of set-theoretic structuralism, as just
described, is to choose one of several isomorphic systems as the
pragmatic referent for “the natural
numbers” (similarly for the real numbers etc.). In a sense, 
our talk of “the natural numbers”, 
then also of “the
number 0”, “the number 
1”, etc., is relative to this
initial choice. This is seen as unproblematic because, no matter how
we choose, we will get the same arithmetic theorems (because of the
categoricity of the axiom system, which implies its semantic
completeness). As background, we can again employ Zermelo-Fraenkel set
theory. But we can also broaden the approach slightly by allowing for
“atoms” or “urelements”, i.e., objects that
are not sets. Thus, we can include Julius Caesar or some beer
mug in our domain, with the consequence that either of them can
“be” the number 2, 
say, in the sense of taking up the
“2-position” 
in the model for arithmetic we choose to
work with. Because of this feature, we will use
“relativist structuralism” 
for this approach (cf. Reck 
&amp; Price 2000). It also seems fair to say that this
position, particularly in its set-theoretic version, is accepted by
many mathematicians, explicitly or implicitly.  In fact, it may be the
most widely favored form of structuralism.</p>

<p>
In set-theoretic structuralism, and in relativist
structuralism more broadly, the only mathematical objects at
play are those that axiomatic set theory, possibly with urelements,
allows us to introduce. We do not need to postulate abstract
structures in addition. For that reason, the position is
another form of eliminative structuralism (while it is
not fully eliminative insofar as it countenances sets).
In fact, set-theoretic relational systems (the set-theoretic 
models of theories) are themselves taken to be the relevant structures 
here. (It is exactly such relational systems that are called 
“structures” in many 
mathematics textbooks.) However, there is another option in 
connection with the latter. Namely, we can also identify
the structure of the natural numbers, say, with the
(higher-order) concept defined by the Dedekind-Peano axioms; similarly
for other (categorical) axiom systems. This leads to yet another
eliminative form of structuralism: “concept
structuralism” (cf. Isaacson 2010,
Feferman 2014, also Ketland 2015, Other Internet Resources).</p>

<p>
According to concept structuralism, what matters in 
modern axiomatic mathematics aren’t really
objects, especially not problematic abstract objects.  Rather, crucial are 
mathematical concepts, e.g., the concept “natural 
number system” (or “model 
of the Dedekind-Peano axioms”,
“progression”); 
similarly for the concept “complete
ordered field” etc. (In Ketland 2015, Other 
Internet Resources, such concepts are explicated further in terms of intensional
propositional functions, while Isaacson and Feferman leave their
nature more open.) More precisely, what matters in the end is what
follows from those concepts, in the sense of what can be derived from
the corresponding axioms. It is true, as concept structuralists might 
admit, that often the way in which we reason in mathematics involves talking 
about objects falling under the relevant concepts. But as they would add, 
such talk can be explained away in the end (e.g., by taking up a formalist
position). In this or similar forms, concept structuralism seems again a 
fairly widespread view among mathematicians and logicians, even though 
it has not been very prominent in the structuralism debates until 
recently.</p>

<p>
For the sake of a more comprehensive survey, we want to go even further.
As the next step, we will introduce two forms of structuralism that 
are closely related to relativist structuralism and
concept structuralism but not identical with either. (Both are 
forms of “abstractionist 
structuralism”, as we will see.) 
Let us start again with a higher-order concept
defined by an axiom system, such as “natural 
number system”, together with 
the set-theoretic systems falling under it. However, instead of 
identifying the corresponding structure either with that concept or with some
pragmatically chosen system falling under it, we focus on
the whole equivalence class determined by the concept.</p>

<p>
At this point, we can go down one of two 
“abstractionist”
paths. First, we can simply identify the relevant structure with 
that equivalence class (with the “concept in 
extension”, as it is sometimes put). Thus,
corresponding to the concept “natural number
system” and set-theoretic systems falling 
under it, like the finite von Neumann ordinals, there is the 
entire equivalence class of corresponding models
as a third entity. (Our primary focus is again on categorical axiom
systems, but the approach can be generalized.) It is this class that
is now called “the natural number 
structure”. It is not a set, to be sure, 
but a proper class; but it can still be studied logico-mathematically. 
Looked at from a “relativist”
perspective, the new approach can also be described as follows: Its
core is to go from a particular, arbitrarily chosen system falling
under a higher-order concept to the related equivalence class, i.e.,
the class of all systems isomorphic to it (in the categorical case).
And we can think of this move as involving a kind of 
“abstraction”, 
specifically in the sense of the “principle of 
abstraction” in Russell (1903; also adopted
by Rudolf Carnap and others). The result is a first form of
“abstractionist 
structuralism”.</p>

<p>
There is a second path we can take, resulting in a second form of
abstractionist structuralism.  It too has played a role
in the recent structuralism debates; but, like the first, it can also
be traced back further in time. Let us start again from a relevant
higher-order concept, or from the axiom system that defines it,
together with an arbitrarily chosen relational system falling under it
(a set-theoretic system, say, possibly with urelements). The new suggestion
is to proceed as follows: We “abstract away 
from the particular nature of its elements” 
so as to arrive at a novel, distinguished relational system that deserves 
to be called “the natural numbers” 
(cf. Dedekind 1888, especially as interpreted in Reck 2003). The intention is that the 
objects introduced by such abstraction only have structural properties, or better,
only have these essentially. Also, together these
objects form a system isomorphic to the one from which we started
(unlike the equivalence class we just considered). Finally, it is the
latter we now consider the relevant abstract structure.
</p>

<p>
In several respects, this second abstractionist
alternative is close to Shapiro’s 
<em>ante rem</em> structuralism (who occasionally appeals to
“abstraction” himself, 
e.g., in Shapiro 1997); it is also close to Parsons’ 
form of non-eliminative structuralism. Yet it neither involves a separate 
structure theory à 
la Shapiro nor an appeal to Parsons’
meta-linguistic procedure. Instead, abstract structures are introduced 
“by abstraction” from
more concrete systems, e.g., from set-theoretic relational systems.
The relevant abstraction can be explicated further in
terms of an “abstraction 
operator” and a corresponding
“abstraction principle”. 
Another comparison that suggests itself then is with the use of 
abstraction principles in contemporary neo-logicism. In fact, that 
connection has already been explored in Linnebo &amp; 
Pettigrew (2014) and Reck (2018a). What we arrive at along such lines is an
abstractionist form of non-eliminative structuralism. In contrast, the first 
alternative mentioned above is an abstractionist form of eliminative
structuralism. (Given their historical roots, these positions
might be labeled “Russellian abstractionist 
structuralism”
and “Dedekindian abstractionist 
structuralism”,
respectively; cf. Reck 2018a.)</p>

<p>
The list of additional variants of structuralism does
not end here either. Let us mention five further examples very
briefly, without going into any details (and there may
undoubtedly be more). 
First, Uri Nodelman and Edward Zalta have introduced
a form of non-eliminative structuralism, parallel to
Shapiro’s, which uses an 
“object theory” inspired 
by Meinong to account for the abstract structures (Nodelman
&amp; Zalta 2014). Parallel to that, one can use other 
fundamental theories for the introduction of abstract structures, leading to
further forms of non-eliminative structuralism. As
a second example, Hannes Leitgeb has described how to adapt graph
theory for this purpose (Leitgeb forthcoming). Third, Leon Horsten has
built on Kit Fine’s theory of 
“arbitrary objects” to
construct a parallel form of “generic 
structuralism” (Horsten forthcoming). 
Fourth, above we already mentioned Charles Chihara’s 
“eliminative”
form of structuralism, which is not identical with 
Hellman’s (see Chihara 2004).  And fifth, 
there is a whole family of “categorical 
forms of structuralism”, based on a variety
of axiom systems from category theory, that has become prominent
recently. </p>

<p>
We will postpone our discussion of categorical structuralism to
<a href="#CateTheoStru">section 3</a>,
both because it is important mathematically, thus deserving treatment
in a separate section, and because it is harder to compare to the other
forms of structuralism. Before that, we want to offer a richer, more 
comprehensive taxonomy for structuralist positions.
This taxonomy will be wide enough to encompass all the positions
mentioned so far. But it will also point beyond them, starting with
the introduction of a basic dichotomy between
“metaphysical” and 
“methodological” 
structuralism.</p>

<h3 id="TowaRichInclTaxoForStru">2.3 A Broader Taxonomy of Structuralist Positions</h3>

<p>
All the variants of structuralism described up to this point are forms
of “philosophical structuralism”, 
or more precisely, of
“metaphysical structuralism”. 
What that means is that these positions are intended to provide answers 
to questions about what mathematical structures are (even when this
involves an eliminative stance), including views about their
existence, abstractness, identity, dependence, etc.  Now, one can
distinguish this whole variety of philosophical positions from what is
sometimes called “mathematical 
structuralism”, or again more precisely, 
“methodological structuralism” 
(cf. Reck &amp; Price 2000, earlier Awodey 1996). 
In fact, we suggest that recognizing this basic
dichotomy—“metaphysical 
versus methodological”—to 
is crucial with respect to both systematic
and historical discussions of structuralism.  (Among others, it allows
us to connect more naturally with categorical
structuralism; see, e.g., Corry 2004 and Marquis 2009.) </p>

<p>
As its name suggests, methodological structuralism
concerns the methodology of mathematics, thus mathematical practice.
Or as one might also put it, it concerns a certain 
“style” of
doing mathematics. That style consists in studying whole
systems or structures of objects in terms of their global, relational, or
structural properties, while neglecting the intrinsic nature of the objects 
involved. This can be done in two main ways, often intertwined in practice: 
by proceeding axiomatically, i.e., by deriving theorems from basic axioms for the
systems at issue; and by considering morphisms between them
(homomorphisms, isomorphisms, etc.), together with invariants under those
morphisms. As such an approach typically involves infinite sets,
non-decidable properties, and classical logic, it tends to be opposed
to more “computational”
and “constructivist”
ways of doing mathematics (cf. Reck &amp; Schiemer 
forthcoming for extensive historical background).</p>

<p>
Such a structuralist methodology, or corresponding forms of methodological 
structuralism, tends to be tied to a general assumption about the 
subject matter of mathematics, namely: mathematics is the study structures.  
But accepting that assumption does not, in itself, involve any further views 
about the nature of those structures, at least not in any detailed and 
philosophically loaded way. In contrast, all the forms of metaphysical
structuralism considered earlier are meant to provide such
views.  This is exactly how they go beyond methodological
structuralism (often by building on it).
</p>

<p>
With respect to such metaphysical positions, Parsons’
“eliminative versus non-eliminative”
distinction remains helpful (although a more positive label for the latter kind of 
views, along the lines of 
“structuralism with structures”, 
might be better). However, the differences among metaphysical forms of structuralisms
do not stop there. In fact, only working with Parsons’
distinction obscures some important differences. As already mentioned, 
Shapiro’s <em>ante rem</em>
structuralism is far from the only version of non-eliminative structuralism; 
nor is Hellman’s the only form of eliminative structuralism.  
We now want to suggest some more fine-grained distinctions so as to introduce more
order and clarity into the debates.</p>

<p>
Let us first look again at non-eliminative versions of
structuralism. Some positions falling under that label introduce
abstract structures by means of a basic theory. This
includes Shapiro’s structure theory, but also,
e.g., Nodelman &amp; Zalta’s object
theory and Leitgeb’s adaptation of graph
theory. All of them are forms of <em>ante rem</em>
structuralism, but significantly different ones. In addition,
there are forms of non-eliminative structuralism that
are based on abstraction principles instead, which we called
“abstractionist forms 
of structuralism” above. We
distinguished two variants of those, the Russellian
and the Dedekindian variant, which involve different kinds 
of structures as the outcome of the abstraction process.  (If we 
reconstruct such abstraction as mathematical operations or functions,
their arguments are the same but their values are different.)
And as this shows, there are abstractionist and non-abstractionist 
versions of non-eliminative structuralism.</p>

<p>
If we reflect on these alternatives more, the role of a further 
basic dichotomy becomes apparent (within the category of
non-eliminative structuralism): that between
<em>ante rem</em> positions and either <em>in
re</em> or <em>post rem</em> positions.
Shapiro’s position is explicitly a form of 
<em>ante rem</em> structuralism. In contrast, Russellian
abstractionist structuralism can be seen as a form of
<em>post rem</em> structuralism, because the equivalence
classes used as the relevant structures are “built
out of” their elements as classes, to which they 
are thus <em>posterior</em>. In Dedekindian abstractionist
structuralism, there is a form of posteriority
involved as well. Here too, we start with more concrete relational
systems, usually systems of sets or urelements, and we introduce
abstract structures on that basis. But the
prior versus posterior relation is different now. (It is not
based on the element-class relation, but on a more basic
argument-function-value relation.) We also end up with abstract
structures that are neither standard sets nor classes.</p>

<p>
On the side of eliminative structuralism, further
sub-divisions should be made as well. Again, there are fully
eliminative positions, which avoid commitment to any kind of
abstract objects.  Hellman’s modal
structuralism is designed to be of this sort. But there are
also semi-eliminative positions, which avoid commitment
to abstract structures in addition to more usual,
relatively concrete mathematical objects, which are
accepted.  Set-theoretic structuralism is a good
illustration; universalist structuralism is another, at least 
when backed by set theory.  Should relativist
structuralism in general, and set-theoretic
structuralism in particular, be seen as cases of
<em>in re</em> structuralism, in the sense that
abstract structure exist “in” 
their more concrete instantiations? Perhaps; but this thesis does
not seem to be forced on us (cf. Leitgeb forthcoming for more on this
issue). Note also that we would end up with a form of
non-eliminative structuralism then instead. The same
question arises for <em>in re</em> forms of structuralism 
more generally; the details will matter. (For more on such 
approaches—sometimes labeled 
“Aristotelian” as opposed to 
“Platonist”—see Pettigrew 2008 and
Franklin 2014.) </p>

<p>
Yet another version of eliminative structuralism that
has started to attract more attention in the literature 
is concept structuralism.  In cases where this position is
meant to do without any appeal to abstract objects
(e.g., by basing itself on formalism), it amounts to a fully
eliminative view. Various questions remain, however, about 
the appeal to concepts in it, i.e., about their existence,
nature, and identity (cf. Parsons 2018).  Depending on the answers, 
a strict nominalist might still find this position unacceptable, 
since concepts may be seen as another problematic kind of
abstract entities.  If a concept structuralist allows for abstract
objects, such as sets, to play a secondary role, this 
becomes a semi-eliminative position. Structures
conceived of as abstract objects are still eliminated (by 
reconceiving them as concepts), but relational systems remain. 
Alternatively, we might be dealing with a particular form 
of methodological structuralism here, where additional
metaphysical questions are brushed aside.</p>

<h2 id="CateTheoStru">3. Category-Theoretic Structuralism</h2>

<h3 id="CateTheoStudMathStru">3.1 Category Theory as the Study of Mathematical Structures</h3>

<p>
Over the past two decades, different proposals have been made to
formulate a theory of mathematical structuralism based
on category theory, thus a theory, or theories, of 
“categorical structuralism”.  
We are now in a better position to consider
these proposals, although we will still proceed indirectly, starting
with more background. Category theory was first
introduced as a branch of abstract algebra in Eilenberg &amp; 
Mac Lane’s famous article, 
“General Theory of Natural
Equivalences” (1945). It subsequently developed into an
autonomous mathematical discipline, in work by Mac Lane, Grothendieck,
Kan, Lawvere, and many others, with important, wide-ranging
applications in algebraic topology and homological algebra and, more
recently, in computer science and logic (cf. Landry &amp; 
Marquis 2005, also the 
 <a href="../category-theory/">entry on category theory</a>
in this encyclopedia).</p>

<p>
Building on these developments, the philosophical discussion of categorical 
structuralism was initiated by Awodey, Landry, Marquis, and McLarty in the 1990s. 
To understand their contributions better, it helps to go back to our distinction 
between “metaphysical” and 
“methodological structuralism”, 
which is drawn explicitly in Awodey (1996).  Or rather, 
Awodey distinguishes between the use of category theory as a
framework for “mathematical” 
and for “philosophical
structuralism”. He describes 
mathematical structuralism as a general way of 
“pursuing a structural
approach to the subject“, 
i.e., a particular style of practicing mathematics 
that employs structural concepts and methods. 
He then argues that category theory provides the best way of
capturing structural mathematics in this sense. However, he also
presents it as a framework for philosophical
structuralism, i.e., “an approach to 
the ontology and epistemology of mathematics”. 
Let us first consider the former
argument. (We will return to the latter in
 <a href="#CateStruAwodMcLaLandEtc">section 3.3</a>).</p>
 

<p>
Category theory, understood as a branch of pure mathematics, has
frequently been described as a “general theory of 
mathematical structures”, e.g., by Mac Lane 
(1986, 1996). But what exactly is meant by 
“structure” here?  
At least two relevant notions are mentioned in the literature. First, a 
structure can be understood in the set- and model-theoretic sense, i.e., 
as a tuple consisting of a domain and an ordered sequence of relations,
functions, and distinguished elements used for the interpretation of a
formal language. (This is the notion of “relational
system” we appealed to above more informally.)  
Such structures are often called 
“Bourbaki structures” 
in this context. Their properties are usually defined axiomatically, e.g., 
by the group axioms or the Dedekind-Peano axioms for arithmetic.</p>

<p>
Second and alternatively, there is a categorical notion of
structure based on the primitive concept of morphisms
between mathematical objects. Typically, a category consists of two
types of entities, namely objects and morphisms between them, i.e.,
mappings represented by arrows that preserve some of the internal
structural composition of the objects. An axiom system that defines
the general concept of a category, along such lines, was first
introduced by Eilenberg and Mac Lane (1945). It describes a suitable
composition operation on arrows, its associativity, as well as the
existence of an identity morphism for each object (cf. Awodey 2010 for
a textbook presentation of category theory).</p>

<p>
Why might category theory be considered a more adequate framework 
for a mathematical structuralism than other disciplines, in
particular traditional (Cantorian, Zermelo-Fraenkel) set theory? It is
helpful to consult Awodey (1996) on this issue. According to him, 
the Bourbaki notion of structure is a direct result of the 
modern axiomatic tradition of Dedekind, Hilbert, 
and the Bourbaki group. This tradition eventually led to a 
structuralist perspective on mathematics. Yet set theory is not an ideal 
framework for capturing a structuralist understanding of mathematical
objects. To begin with, set theory is closely tied to a
model-theoretic conception of mathematical theories, including the
view that such theories study their models only “up to
isomorphism”. But central to a 
structuralist point of view is the principle (more on which below) to
“identify isomorphic objects”; 
and this principle is well motivated from a category-theoretic viewpoint, 
but less so if mathematical objects are represented set-theoretically. </p>

<p>
A second advantage of category theory over set theory, also mentioned
in Awodey (1996), is that the categorical notion of structure is
“syntax invariant”.  
That is to say, unlike in standard
model theory the categorical specification of objects in terms of
their mapping properties is independent of the choice of a 
particular signature used for their description (a choice
of basic relations, functions, and distinguished elements). Third and
most importantly, characteristic for category theory is its
focus on morphisms and transformations between mathematical objects
that preserve (some of) their internal structure. It is the
emphasis on structure-preserving mappings in the specification of
objects that is often viewed as a central feature of the
structuralist turn in modern mathematics. As such, it
was present in various parts of nineteenth- and early
twentieth-century mathematics, including Galois theory, 
Klein’s Erlangen program, 
Dedekind’s foundational writings, as well as
in work on abstract algebra by the Noether school (cf. again Reck
&amp; Schiemer forthcoming).</p>

<p>
Category theory was first developed, against the background of these
developments, as a unifying framework for the study of the relations
between different mathematical structures (cf.  Landry &amp; 
Marquis 2005, Marquis 2009). Different types of mappings were introduced for
this task. One type involves the morphisms between the objects of the
same category, e.g., group homomorphisms in the category of groups, or
linear maps in the category of vector spaces. Another important type of mappings
are “functors” between 
different categories. (Roughly, a functor between two categories 
is a mapping of objects to objects and arrows to arrows that preserves 
the categorical properties in question.) It is such functors that are the 
central tools in category-theory for comparing the objects of different mathematical
categories, and thus, to “relate structures of different
kinds” (Awodey 1996).  As such, they are central to
categorical structuralism.</p>

<h3 id="CateFounDebaAbouThem">3.2 Categorical Foundations and Debates About Them</h3>

<p>
As has been argued repeatedly in the literature along the lines
just summarized, category theory provides a more natural
framework than traditional set theory for mathematical or 
methodological structuralism in mathematics. But what
about its prospects as a form of philosophical
structuralism, i.e., an alternative to the theories 
of Resnik, Shapiro, Hellman, etc.?  We already mentioned that Awodey (1996) 
also presents it as such; but this has led to ongoing controversies.
Hellmann (2003) contains a first critical discussion of philosophical
claims such as Awodey’s. That is to say, 
Hellman’s article
raises several objections against the view that category theory
provides an adequate framework for a structuralist account of
mathematics in the philosophical sense. As we will see,
these objections are closely related to the status of category 
theory as a foundational discipline.</p>

<p>
Recently there has been much debate on which criteria a theory 
has to meet in order to serve as a proper 
“foundation” for
mathematics. According to a helpful proposal in Tsementzis (2017), 
a foundational system has to consist of three items, namely: </p>

<ol type="i">

<li> a formal language; </li>

<li> an axiomatic theory expressed in that language; and </li>

<li> a rich universe of objects, described by the theory, in which all
mathematical structures can be located, represented, or encoded. </li>
</ol>

<p>
Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory clearly represents a foundational system
in this sense.  The axioms of ZFC are usually formulated in a formal
first-order language; and they describe a comprehensive universe, the
cumulative hierarchy of sets, in which mathematical objects such as
number systems, groups, rings, topological spaces, etc. can be
represented.</p>

<p>
In research on category theory from the 1960s onward, several
axiomatizations of specific categories have been proposed as
alternative foundations for mathematics.  This includes
the axiom systems describing the category of sets and functions, on
the one hand, and the category of categories, on the other hand, as first
presented in Lawvere (1964, 1966). Both were explicitly introduced as
foundational systems, and thus, as alternatives to
Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory. More recently, elementary typos theory
has been developed as a form of categorical set theory that can serve
as a foundational system in the above sense (cf.
Landry &amp; Marquis 2005, Marquis 2013).</p>

<p>
This puts us in a position to return to Hellman’s 
2003 challenge. The question of whether category theory can be 
used to formulate a version of philosophical structuralism is,
in his view, directly related to the presumed autonomy of these new
approaches from traditional set theory. Building on Feferman (1977),
he formulates two general objections. Following Linnebo &amp;
Pettigrew (2011), we can call the first the “logical
dependence” objection. Its core is the argument that 
category theory, general topos theory, etc. are not autonomous of set theory 
in the end. The reason is that the axiomatic specification of categories 
and topoi presupposes the primitive concepts of operation,
collection, and function, and the latter need to 
be defined in a set theory such as ZFC. Categorical
foundations are therefore dependent on non-structural 
set theory.</p>

<p>
The second argument against the autonomy of categorical 
foundations has been called the 
“mismatch objection”. 
It concerns the general status of category theory or topos theory; and it is 
based on the distinction between two ways of understanding mathematical axioms,
namely as “structural”, 
“algebraic”,
“schematic” or 
“Hilbertian”, on the one hand,
and as “assertoric” or 
“Fregean”, on the other
hand. As Hellman argues, foundational systems such as classical set
theory need to be assertoric in character, in the sense that their
axioms describe a comprehensive universe of objects used for the
codification of other mathematical structures. Zermelo-Fraenkel 
set theory is an assertoric, 
“contentual” theory in 
this sense. Its axioms (e.g., the power set axiom or the axiom of choice)
make general existence claims regarding the objects in the universe of
sets.</p>

<p>
In contrast, category theory represents a branch of abstract algebra,
as its origin reveals. Thus it is, by its very nature, non-assertoric
in character; it lacks existence axioms conceived as truths about an
intended universe. For example, the Eilenberg-Mac Lane axioms of category
theory are not “basic truths 
simpliciter”, but
“schematic” or 
“structural” in character. 
They function as implicit definitions of algebraic structures, similar 
to the way in which the axioms of group theory or ring theory are
“defining conditions on types of 
structures”. This point is related 
to another argument against the autonomy of category theory
that Hellmann calls the “problem of the 
‘home
address’: where do categories come from 
and where do they live?” (2003: 136). 
Given the “algebraic-structuralist
perspective” underlying category theory and general 
typos theory, its axioms make no assertions that particular categories or
topoi actually exist. Classical set theories, such as ZFC with its
strong existence axioms, have to step in again in order to secure the
existence of such objects.</p>

<p>
Hellman’s and Feferman’s 
arguments against the foundational character of category theory have been 
examined from various angles in the subsequent literature. One can distinguish
between two main types of responses, namely:</p>

<ol type="i">

<li> by proponents of “categorical 
foundations”, who aim
to defend the autonomous character of category theory relative to
classical set theory; and</li>

<li> by “non-foundationalists”, 
who call into question that category theory should be viewed as a foundational 
discipline.</li>
</ol>

<p>
A series of articles by McLarty represent the first line of response
well (e.g., McLarty 2004, 2011, 2012). Roughly speaking, his reply to
Hellman is the following: Whereas category theory and general topos
theory did originate as algebraic theories and are,
thus, not feasible as foundational systems, certain theories of
particular categories and toposes have been introduced as alternative
foundations. McLarty’s central examples are 
Lawvere’s
axiomatizations of the category of categories and his
“Elementary Theory of the Category of 
Sets” (ETCS).</p>

<p>
According to McLarty, these theories should be understood as
assertoric in Hellman’s sense. That is to say,
their axioms are not merely implicit definitions, but general
existential claims about categories, sets, and functions. ETCS, for
instance, presents a function-based set theory, where sets and
mappings between them form a topos. In contrast to ZFC, with its
primitive membership relation, in ETCS a set is not specified in terms
of its internal composition, but rather in terms of its mapping
properties with respect to other sets, which are formulated independently 
of ZFC. McLarty’s response to the two objections
mentioned above is then that categorical set theories such as ETCS
do provide a foundation for mathematics that is logically autonomous
from traditional, non-structural set theories. Moreover, given that
mathematical structures can only be encoded in ETCS as objects up to
isomorphism, such categorical set theories provide a more adequate
foundation for modern structural mathematics than ZFC.
(We will return to this point below.)</p>

<p>
The second, quite different line of response to Hellman’s
objections is represented in Awodey (2004; cf. Landry 1999). In that
article, Awodey outlines a category-theoretic form of structuralism
that is decidedly anti-foundationalist.  He holds, in agreement 
with Hellman and McLarty, that both the Eilenberg-Mac Lane
axioms for category theory and the axioms of general topos theory 
are schematic.  But he then argues that category theory in
general does not, and should not be taken to, provide a
foundation for mathematics, either in a logical or
ontological sense. Rather, it presents a general and unifying
framework or language for structural mathematics.  He
thus rejects Hellman’s assumption that the 
success of categorical structuralism is in any form dependent on
whether category theory is usable as a foundational enterprise 
or not.</p>

<p>
In fact, according to Awodey the central motivation for a
category-theoretic approach to mathematics is to sidestep
foundational issues concerning the nature of mathematical 
objects or the study of a single comprehensive universe
in which all structures can be represented. While topos theory, 
say, might well serve as a structural foundation for
mathematics, for Awodey such a foundational approach runs
against the structuralist perspective embodied in category-theory. In
his own words, “the idea of ‘doing 
mathematics categorically’ involves a different 
point of view from the customary foundational one” 
(Awodey 2004: 55). In light of such fundamental, ongoing debates about 
categorical foundations for mathematics, what are the implications for 
categorical structuralism in the philosophical sense, along 
Awodey’s lines and more generally? 
This is what we turn to next.</p>

<h3 id="CateStruAwodMcLaLandEtc">3.3 Distinctive Features of Categorical Structuralism</h3>

<p>
Beyond the issue of methodological structuralism, the
literature on categorical structuralism during the last
20 years centers around two questions that have already been
mentioned. First, in what sense does category theory provide a
framework for philosophical structuralism? Second, why
is it better suited for that task than other frameworks, such as set
theory, Shapiro’s structure theory, 
and Hellman’s modal logic, 
as has been claimed?  In recent work on these topics, one can
find three related philosophical assumptions that characterize
categorical structuralism and distinguish it from the
versions of structuralism surveyed earlier. We will
treat each of them in turn, starting again with 
Awodey’s
writings.</p>

<p>
A first characteristic assumption is that all mathematical theorems
are schematic statements that have a conditional form. This point is
explicit in Awodey (2004). We already saw that according to Awodey a
category-theoretic approach is non-foundational in
character. This includes that mathematical axioms and theorems, as
expressed in category theory, should be understood as schematic
statements. They do not express truths about the specific nature of
mathematical objects, but rather, about their respective
properties and relations. In addition, mathematical theorems are, at
least in principle, all of hypothetical form. They can be
reconstructed as if-then statements. Note that this view of the
logical form of mathematical theorems is <em>prima facie</em> similar
to the if-then-ism one can find in Putnam’s works, 
and earlier in Russell’s, as mentioned
in <a href="#ElimVsNonElimStru">section 1</a>.
 </p>

<p>
However, there is also an important difference between standard
if-then-ism and a category-theoretic approach in terms of the
ontological commitments involved, as Awodey points out. According to
standard if-then-ism, any mathematical statement can be translated
into a universally quantified conditional statement, where the
quantifiers are effectively meta-theoretic in nature, ranging over all
set-theoretic systems of the right type. As such, the approach
presupposes a rich ontology of sets in which such systems can be
constructed. In contrast, along category-theoretic lines mathematical
theorems do not involve such ontological commitments. There is no
implicit generalization over the Bourbaki structures of
a theory, e.g., over all groups, rings, or number systems. Rather, a
mathematical theorem is “a <em>schematic</em> 
statement about a <em>structure</em> […] which 
can have various <em>instances</em>” (Awodey 2004: 57). 
These instances remain undetermined on purpose, unless a further specification 
of them is needed for the proof of the theorem in question.</p>

<p>
A second distinctive feature of categorical
structuralism, not only for Awodey, concerns a certain
“top-down” 
conception of mathematical objects characteristic for 
category theory. According to standard
set theory, mathematical objects are constructed from the
“bottom up”, 
in successive steps starting from some ground
level (the empty set or also a domain of urelements). Every
object is thus determined, as a set, in terms of its members. In
contrast, mathematical objects in category theory are characterized in
a top-down fashion, starting with the Eilenberg-Mac Lane
axioms and using the notion of morphism. Hence, the objects in a given
category, such as that of rings or topological spaces,
are not considered independently of the relevant morphisms. They are
fully determined by their mapping properties, as expressible in the
language of category theory. Nothing further is assumed about their
inner constitution. In particular, questions about their
set-theoretic nature are considered redundant (see also Landry 
&amp; Marquis 2005.)</p>

<p>
Third, arguably the most important feature of categorical
structuralism is that it verifies a version of the
“structuralist thesis” 
(hinted at earlier). Recall here Benacerraf’s 
argument in his 1965 paper that numbers should
not be identified with particular sets, but rather, with positions in
an abstract structure. Benacerraf also emphasizes
that only certain properties are relevant in arithmetic. 
For him, these are the number-theoretic properties, such as 
“being prime” or 
“being even”, 
that can be defined in terms of the primitive relations 
and functions of the theory at issue.  The general 
structuralist thesis holds, then, that all (relevant) 
properties of the objects treated by a mathematical theory
should be structural in a specified sense. (The question
what “structural” 
means also came up earlier.)</p>

<p>
Categorical structuralists typically argue that category theory
presents the most adequate framework for a structuralist
understanding of mathematical objects given that all the properties
expressible in its language turn out to be structural
(see, e.g., McLarty 1993, Awodey 2004, and Marquis 2013). This is so
because the category-theoretic study of mathematical objects, such as
rings or topological spaces, allows us to express just the
right kind of “structural 
information”, namely information
about the structural properties of these objects. In

<p>
We saw above that the representation of mathematical 
objects in traditional set theory (proceeding 
“bottom up”) brings
with it the possibility to express all sorts of properties about their
set-theoretical constitution that are not isomorphism invariant in
this sense. The central advantage of category theory over classical
set theory (and similar approaches) is, according to this argument,
that such non-structural properties are simply ruled out
in the categorical framework. This point was first stressed in
McLarty’s “Numbers 
Can Be Just What They Have To”
(1993), which, as the title suggests, presents a rejoinder to
Benacerraf (1965). McLarty’s central thesis 
in this article is that Benacerraf’s 
structuralist program is most successfully realized if one 
considers numbers to be represented in categorical set theory 
(such as in ETCS or a subsystem thereof), and
not in orthodox set theory. </p>

<p>
To elaborate this advantage further, number systems of basic
arithmetic can be characterized in such categorical frameworks as
“natural number objects”, as was 
first shown by Lawvere. In contrast to their ZFC-based representation, such objects
are not just isomorphic but share “exactly the same
properties”, namely those expressible in the language of the
category of sets. In other words, any two natural number
objects are “provably 
indiscernible”, in the sense
that they “provably have the same 
properties” (McLarty
1993). Moreover, all of these properties are structural
in the above sense. As a consequence, Benacerraf’s 
dilemma of isomorphic numbers systems with different set-theoretic properties
does not arise in the context of categorical set theory. The
conclusion is that numbers can, after all, be identified with sets,
but with structural ones as defined in ETCS.</p>

<p>
As McLarty and others have argued, this observation generalizes from
numbers to all other mathematical objects studied in category theory.
The claim is that any property of the objects in a given category that
is expressible in the language of category theory is
structural in the sense of being isomorphism
invariant. The main consequence for a structuralist conception
of mathematical objects is summarized by Awodey as
follows: </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Since all categorical properties are thus structural, the only
properties which a given object in a given category may have, qua
object in that category, are structural ones. (Awodey 1996: 214) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This would seem to illustrate a main advantage of
categorical forms of structuralism over set-theoretic
and similar ones.</p>

<p>
A rejoinder should be added, however. McLarty’s and
Awodey’s claim that all mathematical properties 
expressible in categorical set theory are isomorphism invariant has been 
contested, e.g., in Tsementzis (2017). In fact, Tsementzis argues that 
neither ZFC nor ETCS provide fully structuralist foundations for
mathematics, since their respective languages do not, after all,
exclusively allow for the formulation of invariant properties. Then
again, both Makkai’s FOLDS system (Makkah 1995, 
Other Internet Resources, 1998) and the Univalent Foundations program 
developed in Homotopy Type Theory (Univalent Foundations Program 2013) 
seem to meet this condition. Here we have reached another ongoing debate 
in the literature.</p>

<p>
The technical results just mentioned are clearly relevant for
our discussion, but we cannot explore them further in this general survey.
(Cf. Awodey 2014 for more on the relation between structuralism and
the Univalent Foundations project.) We also have to leave a further,
more definite evaluation of the philosophical claims and arguments
concerning categorical structuralism to another occasion, interesting
and important as that debate is. Instead, we now conclude with some
more general remarks about structuralism, even beyond the philosophy
of mathematics.</p>

<h2 id="Conc">4. Conclusion</h2>

<h3 id="VariMathStru">4.1 The Varieties of Mathematical Structuralism</h3>

<p>
We had two main goals in this essay. The first was to introduce our
readers to the general discussion of structuralism in contemporary
philosophy of mathematics.  Second, we tried to provide a richer,
more inclusive taxonomy for that discussion, including
making evident that a much larger variety of structuralist
positions has played a role in it than is usually acknowledged. 
To be sure, a certain amount of variety has been recognized
before, as reflected in the distinction between
eliminative and non-eliminative positions, 
with Shapiro’s <em>ante rem</em>
structuralism and Hellman’s 
modal structuralism as paradigms; and categorical
structuralism has been acknowledged as a third main
alternative. But the range of positions at play is much 
greater than that, especially in the recent literature. 
“Mathematical structuralism” 
is not the name of a single position, but of a multifaceted family of them.</p>

<p>
There are two main reasons for promoting our more inclusive taxonomy.
The first is that, while numerous versions of structuralism 
for mathematics have been proposed, several of them have not
received much attention yet, partly because their relationships to
Shapiro’s, Hellman’s, 
and category-theoretic positions have remained unclear. 
Along the way, we tried to build some corresponding
bridges. The second reason is that several important variants played a
role already before the 1960s, i.e., before the publications by
Benacerraf and Putnam that are often seen as the starting point for
debates about structuralism in philosophy. This concerns both
methodological and metaphysical structuralism, a basic 
distinction  we highlighted; but we only hinted at the relevant 
“pre-history” 
of our topic in the present survey (We refer the reader to 
Reck &amp; Schiemer forthcoming
for more on it.)</p>

<h3 id="StruBeyoMath">4.2 Structuralism Beyond Mathematics</h3>

<p>
Another relevant aspect we did not explore in the present essay,
although it should be mentioned at least briefly before closing,
consists of debates about 
“structuralism” outside the
philosophy of mathematics. There are two main areas in which one can
find such debates (although they have reverberated further). The first
is the philosophy of physics, where structuralist positions 
have played a significant role as well (including one called
“structural realism”, which comes in both an
“ontic” and an “epistemic” form).  The second
consists of several parts of the humanities and social sciences,
primarily linguistics and anthropology, but also psychology,
sociology, etc. There too, 
“structuralism” (and
“post-structuralism”) 
has been a major topic, indeed for a relatively long period. In both 
cases, there are ties to mathematical structuralism, although 
sometimes these ties are only loose.</p>

<p>
At a basic level, the debate about structuralism in the
philosophy of physics concerns how to think about the
“objects” 
of modern physics, given the revolutionary
changes quantum mechanics and relativity theory have brought with
them. More particularly, it concerns the suggestion to refer to
“structures” 
in this connection (cf. French 2014, Layman
2007 [2019], etc.), in a way that is closely related to the philosophy
of mathematics. At another level, this debate concerns how to conceive
of what, if anything, remains constant through theory changes in the
ontology of physics (cf. Worrall 1989, and see the
 <a href="../physics-structuralism/">entry on structuralism in physics</a>
in this encyclopedia). Third, there are debates about representation 
in science that are related to structuralism (cf. van Frassen 2008). While 
there are several points of contact one could pursue further (e.g., concerning
“structural indiscernibles” 
and versions of “set-theoretic versus 
category-theoretic structuralism” in the context 
of physics), we refrain from doing so here.</p>

<p>
The structuralism  introduced into linguistics by
Ferdinand de Saussure and Roman Jakobson, then adopted by other
thinkers in the humanities and social sciences—most 
prominently by Claude Levi-Strauss in anthropology and by Jean Piaget in
psychology (cf.  Levi-Strauss 1958 [1963], Piaget 1968 [1970], also
Caws 1988)—does have ties to mathematical
structuralism as well. However, they are looser than in the
case of the philosophy of physics. In addition, the kind of
psychological determinism often associated, or even identified, with
structuralism in the humanities and social sciences (and criticized in 
post-structuralism) has no analogue on the side of mathematical (or physics). 
Still, these connections are not totally uninteresting (starting with 
contacts between Levi-Strauss and mathematicians in the Bourbaki group, cf. Dosse
1991–92 [1997]). Hence they might be worth exploring 
further too, in this case not so much to derive benefits for the philosophy 
of mathematics, but to understand the history of structuralism 
in human thought more fully. </p>
