<div id="preamble">

<p>

Logics of programs are modal logics arising from the idea of
associating with each computer program α of a programming
language a modality [α].  This idea stems from the line of works
by Engeler [1967], Hoare [1969], Yanov [1959], and others who
formulated and studied logical languages in which the properties of
program connectives can be expressed.  The algorithmic logic (AL)
first developed by Salwicki [1970] and the dynamic logic (DL)
elaborated by Pratt [1976] are proper continuations of these works. We
will here concentrate on DL. The numerous papers devoted to DL and its
variants as well as its multifarious applications in program
verification and data structures show that it constitutes a useful
tool in studying properties of programs. Pratt chose to depict DL on
what one might call the first-order level, and it was his work that
triggered Fischer and Ladner [1979] to define the propositional variant
of DL a couple of years later. This article presents an introduction
to PDL, the propositional variant of DL.</p>

<h2><a name="Int">1. Introduction</a></h2>

<p>
Dynamic Logics (DL) are modal logics for representing the states and
the events of dynamic systems. The language of DLs is both an
assertion language able to express properties of computation states,
and a programming language able to express properties of system
transitions between these states. DLs are <em>logics of programs</em>,
and permit to talk and reason about states of affairs, processes,
changes, and results.
</p>

<p>
Pratt’s original dynamic logic of programs was a <em>first-order</em>
modal logic. <em>Propositional Dynamic Logic</em> (PDL) is the
propositional counterpart of it. It was presented as a logic in its
own right in Fischer and Ladner [1979]. Being propositional, the
language of PDL makes no use of terms, predicates, or functions. Thus
in PDL, there are two syntactic categories: propositions and programs.
</p>

<p>
To give meaning to statements in PDL, we typically work with an
abstract semantics in terms of Labeled Transition Systems (LTS). LTSs
can be seen as a generalization of Kripke models, where transitions
between worlds, or states, are “labeled” by names of
atomic programs. A valuation indicates for every state what
<em>propositions</em> are true in it. A transition labeled π from
one state <em>x</em> to a state <em>y</em>—noted
<em>x</em><em>R</em>(π)<em>y</em>, or
(<em>x</em>,<em>y</em>) ∈ <em>R</em>(π)—indicates
that starting in <em>x</em>, there is a possible execution of the
program π that finishes in <em>y</em>. If the proposition
<em>A</em> is true in <em>y</em>, then the formula
&lt;π&gt;<em>A</em> is true in <em>x</em>: i.e., in the state
<em>x</em> there is a possible execution of the program α that
ends in a state satisfying <em>A</em>. One recognizes in &lt;π&gt;
a modality reminiscent of the modality of possibility (often noted
◊) of modal logic. Unsurprisingly, there is also a corresponding
notion of necessity (whose modality is often noted □). The
formula [π]<em>A</em> will be true in the state <em>x</em> if
<em>A</em> is true in every state reachable from <em>x</em> by a
transition labeled π.
</p>

<p>
The possible executions of complex programs can be next defined
compositionally. For instance, a program “first α, then
β” is a complex program, more specifically a
<em>sequence</em>. A possible execution can be represented in an LTS
by composing a two-step transition —hence a transition which can
be signified by <em>R</em>(α;β)—between the states
<em>x</em> and <em>x</em>′: there is a possible execution in
<em>x</em> of the program α that finishes in a state <em>y</em>
and there is a possible execution in <em>y</em> of the program β
that finishes in <em>x</em>′. If the proposition <em>A</em> is
true in <em>x</em>′, then the formula
&lt;α;β&gt;<em>A</em> will be true in the state
<em>x</em>. The programs α and β could be complex program
themselves. Yet more programs can be expressed with more constructs
that we will present in due time.
</p>

<p>
A program is then seen in an extensional way: it is a binary relation
between pairs of states of an LTS. Precisely, it is the set of pairs
of the form (<em>x</em>,<em>y</em>) such that the program can be
executed in the state <em>x</em> and can lead to the state
<em>y</em>. On the other hand, a proposition is a statement about a
state; it is either true or false in a state. A proposition can thus
also be seen in an extensional way: the set of states of the LTS where
it is true.
</p>

<p>With the acronym PDL, here we refer precisely to the propositional
dynamic logic with the following program constructs: sequence,
non-deterministic choice, unbounded iteration, and test. We present it
in <a href="#SynSem">section 2</a>, together with some properties and
fundamental results. In particular, we will address its axiomatization
and its decidability.</p>

<p>The Hoare calculus from Hoare [1969] is a landmark for logics of
programs. It concerns the truth of statements of the form
{<em>A</em>}α{<em>B</em>}—meaning that with the
precondition <em>A</em> the program α always has <em>B</em> as a
post-condition—and is defined axiomatically. It comes from a
want of rigorous methods to reason about the properties of programs,
and thus giving to the activity of programming a certain place in the
realm of science. Burstall [1974] saw the analogy between modal logics
and reasoning about programs, but the actual work on it started with
Pratt [1976] when it was suggested to him by R. Moore, a student of
his at the time. PDL comes from Pratt’s interpretation of Hoare’s
calculus in the formalism of modal logic. An introduction to the
genesis of PDL can be found in Pratt [1980b]. The Hoare-triple
{<em>A</em>}α{<em>B</em>} is captured by the PDL formula
<em>A</em> → [α]<em>B</em> meaning literally that if
<em>A</em> is true, then every successfully terminating execution of
α will end with <em>B</em> being true. With this connection
realized, it is a routine to prove the initial rules of Hoare’s
calculus using exclusively the axiomatization of PDL. This is
something we will do in detail in <a href="#CorStr">section 3</a>
which concentrates on the reasoning about the correctness of
structured programs.
</p>

<p>
Additional topics related to PDL include results concerning
comparative power of expression, decidability, complexity, and
completeness of a number of interesting variants obtained by extending
or restricting PDL in various ways.

Since its inception, many variants of PDL have received
attention. These variants may consider deterministic programs,
restricted tests, non-regular programs, programs as automata,
complementation and intersection of programs, converse and infinite
computations, etc. We will present some of them
in <a href="#Var">section 4</a>, providing some pointers regarding
their relative expressivity, their axiomatizations, and their
computational complexity.
</p>

<p>
We conclude in <a href="#Con">section 5</a>.
</p>

<h2><a name="DefFunRes">2. Definitions and fundamental results</a></h2>

<p>We present the syntax and semantics of PDL
in <a href="#SynSem">section 2.1</a>.  The proof theory of PDL is
presented in <a href="#AxiCom">section 2.2</a> with axiomatizations
and pointers to the literature on completeness. We address the problem
of decidability and complexity in <a href="#DecCom">section
2.3</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="SynSem">2.1 Syntax and semantics</a></h3>

<p>Propositional dynamic logic (PDL) is designed for representing and
reasoning about propositional properties of programs. Its syntax is
based upon two sets of symbols: a countable set Φ<sub>0</sub> of
atomic formulas and a countable set Π<sub>0</sub> of atomic
programs. Complex formulas and complex programs over this base are
defined as follows:</p>

<ul>

<li>Every atomic formula is a formula</li>

<li>0 (“false”) is a formula</li>

<li>If <em>A</em> is a formula then ¬<em>A</em> (“not <em>A</em>”)
is a formula</li>

<li>If <em>A</em> and <em>B</em> are formulas then
 (<em>A</em>∨<em>B</em>)
 (“<em>A</em> or <em>B</em>”) is a formula</li>

<li>If α is a program and <em>A</em> is a formula then
[α]<em>A</em> (“every execution of α from the present
state leads to a state where <em>A</em> is true”) is a formula</li>

<li>Every atomic program is a program</li>

<li>If α and β are programs then (α;β) (“do
α followed by β”) is a program</li>

<li>If α and β are programs then (α∪β) (“do
α or β, non-deterministically”) is a program,</li>

<li>If α is a program then α* (“repeat α a finite,
but non-deterministically determined, number of times”) is a
program.</li>

<li>If <em>A</em> is a formula then <em>A</em>? (“proceed if
<em>A</em> is true, else fail”) is a program</li>

</ul>

<p>The other Boolean connectives 1,
 ∧, →, and ↔ are used as abbreviations in the standard way. In
addition, we abbreviate ¬[α]¬<em>A</em> to
&lt;α&gt;<em>A</em> (“some execution of α from the present
state leads to a state where <em>A</em> is true”) as in modal
logic. We write α<sup><em>n</em></sup> for α;…;α with
<em>n</em> occurrences of α. More formally:</p>

<ul>
<li>α<sup>0</sup> =<sub>df</sub> 1?</li>

<li>α<sup><em>n</em>+1</sup> =<sub>df</sub>
α;α<sup><em>n</em></sup></li>
</ul>

Also:
<ul>
<li>α<sup>+</sup> =<sub>df</sub> α;α*</li>
</ul>

<p>
is often useful to represent an iteration that is unbounded but occurs
at least once.  Finally, we adopt the standard rules for omission of
parentheses.
</p>

<p>Formulas can be used to describe the properties that hold after the
successful execution of a program. For example, the formula
[α∪β]<em>A</em> means that whenever program α or
β is successfully executed, a state is reached where <em>A</em>
holds, whereas the formula &lt;(α;β)*&gt;<em>A</em> means
that there is a sequence of alternating executions of α and
β such that a state is reached where <em>A</em>
holds. Semantically speaking, formulas are interpreted by sets of
states and programs are interpreted by binary relations over states in
a transition system. More precisely, the meaning of PDL formulas and
programs is interpreted over Labeled Transition Systems (LTS)
<em>M</em> = (<em>W</em>, <em>R</em>,<em>V</em>)
where <em>W</em> is a nonempty set of worlds or states, <em>R</em> is
a mapping from the set Π<sub>0</sub> of atomic programs into binary
relations on <em>W</em> and <em>V</em> is a mapping from the set
Φ<sub>0</sub> of atomic formulas into subsets of
<em>W</em>.</p>

<p>Informally, the mapping <em>R</em> assigns to each atomic
program π ∈ Π<sub>0</sub> some binary
relation <em>R</em>(π) on <em>W</em> with intended meaning
<em>x</em><em>R</em>(π)<em>y</em> iff there exists an execution of
π from <em>x</em> that leads to <em>y</em>, whereas the mapping
<em>V</em> assigns to each atomic formula
<em>p</em> ∈ Φ<sub>0</sub> some subset
<em>V</em>(<em>p</em>) of <em>W</em> with intended meaning
<em>x</em> ∈ <em>V</em>(<em>p</em>) iff <em>p</em>
is true in <em>x</em>. Given our readings of 0, ¬<em>A</em>,
<em>A</em>∨<em>B</em>,
[α]<em>A</em>, α;β, α∪β, α* and
<em>A</em>?, it is clear that <em>R</em> and <em>V</em> must be
extended inductively as follows to supply the intended meanings for
the complex programs and formulas:</p>

<ul>

<li><em>x</em><em>R</em>(α;β)<em>y</em> iff there exists a
world <em>z</em> such that <em>x</em><em>R</em>(α)<em>z</em> and
<em>z</em><em>R</em>(β)<em>y</em></li>

<li><em>x</em><em>R</em>(α∪β)<em>y</em> iff
<em>x</em><em>R</em>(α)<em>y</em> or
<em>x</em><em>R</em>(β)<em>y</em></li>

<li><em>x</em><em>R</em>(α*)<em>y</em> iff there exists a
non-negative integer <em>n</em> and there exist worlds
<em>z</em><sub>0</sub>, …, <em>z</em><sub><em>n</em></sub> such
that <em>z</em><sub>0</sub> = <em>x</em>,
<em>z</em><sub><em>n</em></sub> = <em>y</em> and for all
<em>k</em> = 1..<em>n</em>,
<em>z</em><sub><em>k</em>−1</sub><em>R</em>(α)<em>z</em><sub><em>k</em></sub></li>

<li><em>x</em><em>R</em>(<em>A</em>?)<em>y</em> iff
<em>x</em> = <em>y</em> and
<em>y</em> ∈ <em>V</em>(<em>A</em>)</li>

<li><em>V</em>(0) = ∅</li>

<li><em>V</em>(¬<em>A</em>) = <em>W</em> \<em>V</em>(<em>A</em>)</li>

<li><em>V</em>(<em>A</em>∨<em>B</em>) = <em>V</em>(<em>A</em>) ∪ <em>V</em>(<em>B</em>),</li>

<li><em>V</em>([α]<em>A</em>) = {<em>x</em>: for
all worlds <em>y</em>, if <em>x</em><em>R</em>(α)<em>y</em> then
<em>y</em> ∈ <em>V</em>(<em>A</em>)}</li>

</ul>

<p>If <em>x</em> ∈ <em>V</em>(<em>A</em>) then we
say that <em>A</em> is satisfied at state <em>x</em> in <em>M</em>, or
“<em>M</em>, <em>x</em> sat <em>A</em>”.</p>

<p>
One interesting notion concerns the amount of information, expressed
with PDL formulas, that is contained in an LTS. The behavior of a
system described as an LTS is indeed often slightly hidden in its
form. For instance, on simple inspection, it is easy to convince
oneself that the two LTSs depicted above have the same behavior, and
satisfy the same PDL formulas. To finish this section on syntax and
semantics we give the theoretical foundation of these claims.
</p>

<p>
Given two LTSs, one may ask whether they satisfy the same formulas.
The notion of bisimulation has become the standard measure for
equivalence of Kripke models and Labeled Transition
Systems. A <em>bisimulation</em> between the LTSs
<em>M</em> = (<em>W</em>, <em>R</em>,<em>V</em>)
and <em>M</em>′ = (<em>W</em>′,
 <em>R</em>′, <em>V</em>′) is a binary relation
<em>Z</em> between their states such that for all worlds <em>x</em> in
<em>M</em> and for all worlds <em>x</em>′ in <em>M</em>′,
if <em>xZx</em>′ then</p>

<ul>
 <li>for all atomic formulas <em>p</em> ∈
 Φ<sub>0</sub>, <em>x</em>∈<em>V</em>(<em>p</em>) iff
<em>x</em>′∈ <em>V</em>′(<em>p</em>)</li>

 <li>for all atomic programs π ∈
 Π<sub>0</sub> and for all worlds <em>y</em> in <em>M</em>,
if <em>x</em><em>R</em>(π)<em>y</em> then there exists a world
<em>y</em>′ in <em>M</em>′ such that <em>yZy</em>′
and <em>x</em>′<em>R</em>′(π)<em>y</em>′</li>

 <li>for all atomic programs π ∈
 Π<sub>0</sub> and for all worlds <em>y</em>′ in
<em>M</em>′, if <em>x</em>′ <em>R</em>′(π)<em>y</em>′ then
there exists a world <em>y</em> in <em>M</em> such
that <em>yZy</em>′ and <em>x</em><em>R</em>(π)<em>y</em></li>
</ul>

<p>
We say that two LTSs are <em>bisimilar</em> when there exists a
bisimulation between them.  It is known since the beginning of PDL
that in two bisimilar LTSs <em>M</em> and <em>M</em>′,
for all worlds <em>x</em> in <em>M</em> and for all
worlds <em>x</em>′ in
<em>M</em>′, if <em>xZx</em>′ then for all PDL formulas
<em>A</em>, <em>x</em>  ∈ <em>V</em>(<em>A</em>)
iff <em>x</em>′ 
∈ <em>V</em>′(<em>A</em>). Thus when two LTSs are
bisimilar under the definition of bisimulation above, it is the
case that, if <em>xZx</em>′ then</p>

<ul> 

 <li>for all programs α and for all worlds <em>y</em> in <em>M</em>,
if <em>x</em><em>R</em>(α)<em>y</em> then there exists a world
<em>y</em>′ in <em>M</em>′ such that <em>yZy</em>′
and <em>x</em>′<em>R</em>′(α)<em>y</em>′</li>

 <li>for all programs α and for all worlds <em>y</em>′ in
<em>M</em>′, if <em>x</em>′<em>R</em>′(α)
<em>y</em>′ then there exists a world <em>y</em> in <em>M</em>
such that <em>yZy</em>′ and <em>x</em><em>R</em>(α)<em>y</em></li>

</ul>

<p>Hence one can simply compare the behaviors of two LTSs by
inspecting solely the atomic programs and safely extrapolate on the
comparative behavior of these LTSs even for complex programs. We say
that the program constructs of PDL are <em>safe for bisimulation</em>. See Van
Benthem [1998] for precise characterizations of program constructs
that are safe for bisimulation.</p>

<p>
It is readily seen that the two instances of LTSs above are
bisimilar. A bisimulation <em>Z</em> between <em>M</em> and
<em>M</em>′ can be given as: <em>Z</em> =
{(<em>x</em><sub>1</sub>,<em>y</em><sub>1</sub>),
(<em>x</em><sub>1</sub>,<em>y</em><sub>2</sub>),
(<em>x</em><sub>2</sub>,<em>y</em><sub>3</sub>),
(<em>x</em><sub>2</sub>,<em>y</em><sub>4</sub>)}. The states
<em>x</em><sub>1</sub> and <em>y</em><sub>1</sub> satisfy exactly the
same PDL formulas. So do the states <em>x</em><sub>1</sub> and
<em>y</em><sub>2</sub>, etc.

<h3><a name="AxiCom">2.2 Axiomatization and completeness</a></h3>

<p>The purpose of the proof theory is to provide the characterization
of the property ⊨ <em>A</em> in terms of axioms and rules of
inference. In this section, we define a deducibility predicate ⊢
inductively by operations on formulas that depend only on their
syntactic structure in such a way that for all formulas
<em>A</em>,</p>

<blockquote>
 ⊢
 <em>A</em> iff
 ⊨
 <em>A</em>.
 </blockquote>

<p>Of course, PDL is an extension of classical propositional logic. We
first expect that all propositional tautologies hold, and all
propositional reasoning is allowed. In particular, modus ponens is a
valid rule: from <em>A</em> and <em>A</em> → <em>B</em>
infer <em>B</em>. For any program α, restricting an LTS to the
relation <em>R</em>(α) we obtain a Kripke model in which the
logic of the modality [α] is the weakest propositional normal
modal logic, namely, the logic K. Thus, PDL contains every instance of
the familiar distribution axiom schema:</p>

<blockquote>
(A0)   [α](<em>A</em> → <em>B</em>) →
([α]<em>A</em> → [α]<em>B</em>)
</blockquote>

<p>and it is closed under the following rule of inference
(<em>necessitation</em> rule):</p>

<blockquote>
(N)    from <em>A</em>  infer  [α]<em>A</em>.
</blockquote>

<p>A modal logic is normal if it obeys (A0) and (N). Important
properties for all α, are that [α] distributes over the
conjunction ∧, and the rule of <em>monotony</em>, which permits
from <em>A</em> → <em>B</em> to infer [α]<em>A</em> →
[α]<em>B</em>, can be proven. Finally, PDL is the least normal
modal logic containing every instance of the following axiom schemas
</p>

<blockquote>

(A1)   [α;β]<em>A</em> ↔
[α][β]<em>A</em> <br />

(A2)   [α∪β]<em>A</em> ↔ [α]<em>A</em>
 ∧
 [β]<em>A</em><br />

(A3)   [α*]<em>A</em> ↔ <em>A</em>
 ∧
 [α][α*]<em>A</em><br />

(A4)   [<em>A</em>?]<em>B</em> ↔ (<em>A</em> →
<em>B</em>)

</blockquote>

<p>and closed under the following rule of inference (<em>loop
invariance</em> rule):</p>

<blockquote>
 (I) from <em>A</em> → [α]<em>A</em> infer <em>A</em>
→ [α*]<em>A</em>
 </blockquote>

<p>If <em>X</em> is a set of formulas and <em>A</em> is a formula then we
say that <em>A</em> is
 ⊢-deducible
 from  <em>X</em>, or “<em>X</em>
 ⊢
 <em>A</em>”, if there exists a sequence <em>A</em><sub>0</sub>,
<em>A</em><sub>1</sub>, …, <em>A</em><sub><em>n</em></sub> of
formulas such that
<em>A</em><sub><em>n</em></sub> = <em>A</em> and for all
<em>i</em>≤<em>n</em>, <em>A</em><sub><em>i</em></sub> is an
instance of an axiom schema, or a formula of <em>X</em>, or comes from
earlier formulas of the sequence by a rule of inference. Further,
 ⊢
 <em>A</em> iff ∅
 ⊢
 <em>A</em>; in this case we say that <em>A</em> is
 ⊢-deducible.
 <em>X</em> is said to be
 ⊢-consistent
 iff not <em>X</em>
 ⊢
 0. It is easy to establish that (I) can be replaced by the following
axiom schema (<em>induction</em> axiom schema):</p>

<blockquote>
 (A5)   [α*](<em>A</em> → [α]<em>A</em>) →
(<em>A</em> → [α*]<em>A</em>)
 </blockquote>

<p>Let us first establish that (I) is a derived rule of the proof
system based on (A1), (A2), (A3), (A4) and (A5):</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The axiomatization of PDL based on axiom schemas (A1), (A2), (A3),
(A4) and (A5) has been proposed in Segerberg [1977]. It is immediate
from the definitions above that ⊢ is sound with respect to
⊨, i.e.</p>

<blockquote>
 For all formulas <em>A</em>, if ⊢<em>A</em>, then
 ⊨<em>A</em>
 </blockquote>

<p>The proof proceeds by induction on the length of <em>A</em>’s
deduction in  ⊢.
 
The question of the completeness of ⊢  with respect to
⊨,  i.e.,</p>

<blockquote>
 For all formulas <em>A</em>, if ⊨<em>A</em>, then
 ⊢<em>A</em>
</blockquote>

<p>was pursued by several logicians. The line of reasoning presented
in Segerberg [1977] was the first attempt to prove the completeness of
⊢. Soon, Parikh came up with a proof, too. When early 1978
Segerberg found a flaw in his argument (which he repaired eventually),
Parikh published what can be considered the first proof of the
completeness of ⊢ in Parikh [1978]. Different proofs of
completeness of ⊢ have been published since, e.g. Kozen and
Parikh [1981].</p>

<p>Different alternative proof theories of PDL have also been sought
after. Even early on, notably in Pratt [1978]. Let us then also
mention the completeness of related theories by Nishimura [1979] and
Vakarelov [1983].</p>

<p>
An alternative formulation of a deducibility predicate for PDL permits
the use of an infinitary rule of inference, as for instance in
Goldblatt [1992a]. (An infinitary rule of inference takes an infinite
number of premises.) Let ⊢′ be the deducibility predicate
corresponding in the language of propositional dynamic logic to the
least normal modal logic containing every instance of the axiom
schemas (A1), (A2), (A3) and (A4) and closed under the following
infinitary rule of inference:</p>

<blockquote>
 (I′) from {[β][α<sup><em>n</em></sup>]<em>A</em>:
<em>n</em> ≥ 0} infer [β][α*]<em>A</em>
 </blockquote>

<p>It can be proved that
 ⊢′
 is both sound and complete with respect
 ⊨,
 i.e.,</p>

<blockquote>
 For all formulas <em>A</em>,
 ⊢′
 <em>A</em> iff
 ⊨
 <em>A</em>
 </blockquote>

<p>In other words, as far as generating the set of all valid formulas
is concerned, the proof systems
 ⊢
 and
 ⊢′
 are equivalent.</p>

<h3><a name="DecCom">2.3 Decidability and complexity</a></h3>

<p>
The aim of the complexity theory is to establish the computability of
the property sat <em>A</em> in terms of resources of time or
space. The complexity of a logic <em>L</em> is often identified with
the problem of deciding the satisfiability of its formulas, defined
as:</p>

<blockquote>
 (L-SAT) Given a formula <em>A</em> of <em>L</em>, is <em>A</em> satisfiable?
</blockquote>

<p>In this section, we investigate the complexity of the following
decision problem:</p>
<blockquote>
 (PDL-SAT) Given a formula <em>A</em> of PDL, is <em>A</em> satisfiable?
</blockquote>

<p>The complete axiomatization of PDL is a recursive definition of the
set of valid PDL formulas, or in other words, of the set of formulas
whose negation is not satisfiable. Hence, concerning the problem
(PDL-SAT), we have a sub-procedure that would answer “no” if
the PDL formula <em>A</em> were not satisfiable. The sub-procedure
(SP1) consists in enumerating all the formulas ⊢-deducible,
starting from the axioms and inferring other theorems with the help of
the inference rules. Given enough time, if a formula is
⊢-deducible, the sub-procedure would find it eventually. Thus,
if <em>A</em> is not satisfiable, (SP1) must eventually find
¬<em>A</em>, and answer “no” when it does.</p>

<p>However, if the formula <em>A</em> is satisfiable, then (SP1) would
never find ¬<em>A</em>. It would run forever, and one could not be
sure about it at any time. But there is a way out of this
uncertainty. We can also think of a second sub-procedure that answers
“yes” if a PDL formula is satisfiable. Indeed, one of the
earliest results on PDL was the proof that PDL has the <em>finite
model property</em>, i.e.,</p>

<blockquote>
For all formulas <em>A</em>, if sat <em>A</em> then there exists a
finite model <em>M</em> such that <em>M</em> sat <em>A</em>.
</blockquote>

<p>
The finite model property offers a basis for a sub-procedure (SP2)
that consists in enumerating one by one the finite models of PDL and
testing whether one of them satisfies the formula. (For all
formulas <em>A</em> and for all finite models <em>M</em>, it is easy
to test if <em>M</em> sat <em>A</em> by applying the definition
of <em>V</em>(<em>A</em>).)  Thus, if <em>A</em> is satisfiable, it
must eventually find a model
<em>M</em> such that <em>M</em> sat <em>A</em>, and answer
“yes” when it does. Symmetrically to the first sub-procedure
(SP1), if the formula <em>A</em> is not satisfiable, then (SP2) will
never find a model satisfying it, it will run forever, and one could
not be sure about it at any time.
</p>

<p>
Now, combining (SP1) and (SP2) together we have a way of deciding
whether a PDL formula <em>A</em> is satisfiable. It suffices to run
them in parallel: if <em>A</em> is satisfiable then (SP2) will
eventually answer “yes”, if <em>A</em> is not satisfiable
then (SP1) will eventually answer “no”. The procedure
halts when either (SP1) or (SP2) provides an answer.</p>

<p>If the procedure that is obtained is sufficient to conclude that
the problem (PDL-SAT) is decidable, it is very ineffective in
practice. There is a result—due to Fischer and Ladner [1979] and
Kozen and Parikh [1981]— stronger than the finite model
property, that is <em>small model property</em>:</p>

<blockquote>For all formulas <em>A</em>, if sat <em>A</em> then there
exists a finite model <em>M</em> of size exponential in <em>A</em>
such that <em>M</em> sat <em>A</em>. 
</blockquote>

<p>This means that we would now know when to stop looking for a model
satisfying a formula in the procedure (SP2). Hence, we can use (SP2)
to test whether a formula is satisfiable, but once we have exhausted
all small models, we can conclude that the formula is not
satisfiable. This yields a procedure that runs non-deterministically
in exponential time (NEXPTIME): guess a model of size at most singly
exponential, and check whether it satisfies the formula.

But the key results in the complexity theory of PDL come from Fischer
and Ladner [1979] and Pratt [1980a]. Observing that a formula of PDL
can efficiently describe the computation of a
linear-space–bounded alternating Turing machine, Fischer and
Ladner [1979] first established the lower bound of exponential time of
(PDL-SAT). The EXPTIME upper bound of (PDL-SAT) has been obtained by Pratt
[1980a], who used the equivalent for PDL of the method of
tableaux. Thus, (PDL-SAT) is EXPTIME-complete. (An algorithm more
efficient in practice, although still running in deterministic
exponential time in the worst case, is proposed in De Giacomo and
Massacci [2000].)
</p>

<h2><a name="CorStr">3. Structured programming and correctness of programs</a></h2>

<p>
Historically, logics of programs stem from the work in the late 1960s
of computer scientists interested in assigning meaning to programming
languages and finding a rigorous standard for proofs about
the programs. For example such proofs may be about the correctness of a
program with respect to an expected behavior, or about the
termination of a program. A seminal paper is Floyd [1967] which
presents an analysis of the properties of structured computer programs
using <em>flowcharts</em>.  Some early work such as Yanov [1959] or
Engeler [1967] had advanced and studied formal languages in which the
properties of program connectives can be expressed. The formalism of
Hoare [1969] was a milestone in the advent of PDL. It was proposed as
a rigorous axiomatic interpretation of Floyd’s flowcharts. We often
talk about Hoare logic, or Floyd-Hoare logic, or Hoare calculus when
referring to this formalism. Hoare calculus is concerned with the
truth of statements (“Hoare triples”), such as
{<em>A</em>}α{<em>B</em>} which establishes a connection between
a precondition <em>A</em>, a program α, and a
post-condition <em>B</em>. It indicates that whenever <em>A</em> holds
as a precondition of the execution of α, then <em>B</em> holds
as a post-condition after the successful execution of α.</p>

<p>
It was true some decades ago, and it is still the case: validating a
program is more often than not done by testing it on a reasonable
variety of inputs. When an input does not yield the expected output,
the “bug” is fixed. If eventually for every tested input
we obtain the expected output, one has a reasonable belief that the
program has no error. However, this is a time consuming method of
validation, and it leaves place for untested inputs that would fail.
Finding these errors after the program has been implemented and gone
into use is even more costly in resources.  Reasoning about program
correctness with formal methods is crucial for critical systems since
it offers a way of proving exhaustively that a program has no
errors.</p>

<h3><a name="HoaCal">3.1 Hoare calculus</a></h3>

<p>To illustrate the sort of principles of programs captured by the
rules in the Hoare calculus it is enough to consult some of
them. (N.B.: the rules mean that if all the statements above the rule
line hold—the premises—then also the statement under the
rule line—the conclusion— holds.)</p>

<blockquote>
<table style="border-collapse:collapse;">
<tbody><tr><td style="padding:0px;border-bottom:1px solid black; text-align:center;">
  {<em>A</em>} α<sub>1</sub> {<em>B</em>}  {<em>B</em>} α<sub>2</sub> {<em>C</em>}
</td><td rowspan="2"> (rule of composition)
</td></tr>
<tr><td style="text-align:center;">
  {<em>A</em>} α<sub>1</sub> ; α<sub>2</sub> {<em>C</em>}
</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</blockquote>

<p>The rule of composition captures the elementary sequential
composition of programs. As premises, we have two assumptions about
the partial correctness of two programs α<sub>1</sub> and
α<sub>2</sub>. The first assumption is that when
α<sub>1</sub> is executed in a state satisfying A, then it will
finish in a state satisfying <em>B</em>, whenever it halts. The second
assumption is that when α<sub>2</sub> is executed in a state
satisfying <em>B</em>, then it will finish in a state satisfying
<em>C</em>, whenever it halts. The conclusion of the rule is about the
partial correctness of the program
α<sub>1</sub>;α<sub>2</sub> (i.e., α<sub>1</sub>
sequentially composed with α<sub>2</sub>), that follows from the
two assumptions. Namely, we can conclude that if
α<sub>1</sub>;α<sub>2</sub> is executed in a state
satisfying <em>A</em>, then it finishes in a state satisfying
<em>C</em>, whenever it halts.
</p>

<p>
The rule of iteration is an important one because it captures the
essential ability of programs to execute some portion of code
repeatedly until a certain condition ceases to hold.</p>

<blockquote>
<table style="border-collapse:collapse;">
<tbody><tr><td style="padding:0px;border-bottom:1px solid black; text-align:center;">
  {<em>A</em> ∧ <em>B</em>} α {<em>A</em>} 
</td><td rowspan="2"> (rule of iteration)
</td></tr>
<tr><td style="text-align:center;">
  {<em>A</em>} <strong>while</strong> <em>B</em> <strong>do</strong> α {¬<em>B</em> ∧ <em>A</em>}
</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</blockquote>

<p>Finally, the two rules of consequence are fundamental to give a
formal basis to intuitively clear reasoning involving weaker
post-conditions and stronger preconditions respectively.</p>

<!--
<blockquote>

<tr><td style="padding:0px;border-bottom:1px solid black; text-align:center;">

</blockquote>

<p>From the formalism presented in Hoare [1969], we leave out its
axiom schemas as it would require a first-order language. Finally, in
subsequent work on Hoare logic, more rules are also often added. See
Apt [1979] for an early overview.</p>

<h3><a name="HoaPDL">3.2 Hoare calculus and PDL</a></h3>

<p>Dynamic logics come from Pratt’s interpretation of Hoare triples
and Hoare calculus in the formalism of modal logic. With the modality
[α], we can express formally that all states reachable by
executing α satisfy the formula <em>A</em>. This is done by
writing [α]<em>A</em>. Thus, the Hoare triple
{<em>A</em>}α{<em>B</em>} is simply captured by the PDL
formula</p>

<blockquote><em>A</em> → [α]<em>B</em></blockquote>

Thus, it seems that with PDL we are well-equipped to logically prove
the correctness of structured programs. Beyond this rather hand-waving
connection between PDL and Hoare calculus, perhaps it is not yet clear
how they relate formally. PDL is in fact a generalization of Hoare
calculus in the sense that all the rules of the Hoare calculus can be
proven in the axiomatic system of PDL. (Rigorously, the Hoare calculus
contains axioms that would require the extended language of
first-order Dynamic Logic.) This is quite remarkable, so we will show
here the two above rules to serve as examples.</p>

<p>
The proofs start by assuming the premises of the rules. Then by using
these assumptions, axioms and rules of PDL, and nothing else, the
objective is to establish that the conclusion of the rules logically
follows. Hence, for the rule of composition, we start by assuming
{<em>A</em>}α<sub>1</sub>{<em>B</em>}, that is <em>A</em> →
[α<sub>1</sub>]<em>B</em> in its PDL formulation, and by
assuming {<em>B</em>}α<sub>2</sub>{<em>C</em>}, that is
<em>B</em> → [α<sub>2</sub>]<em>C</em>. The objective is to
prove that
{<em>A</em>}α<sub>1</sub>;α<sub>2</sub>{<em>C</em>}. Precisely,
we want to establish that <em>A</em> →
[α<sub>1</sub>;α<sub>2</sub>]<em>C</em> is
⊢-deducible from the set of formulas {<em>A</em> →
[α<sub>1</sub>]<em>B</em>, <em>B</em> →
[α<sub>2</sub>]<em>C</em>}.</p>

<p>In the context of PDL, the two rules of consequence are in fact
special cases of the rule of composition. To obtain the first rule,
substitute α<sub>1</sub> with α and α<sub>2</sub>
with <strong>skip</strong>. To obtain the second rule, substitute
α<sub>1</sub> with <strong>skip</strong> and α<sub>2</sub>
with α. It suffices to apply the axiom schema (A4), and to
remark that [α;<strong>skip</strong>]<em>A</em> ↔
[α]<em>A</em> and [α;<strong>skip</strong>]<em>A</em>
↔ [α]<em>A</em> are also ⊢-deducible for
all <em>A</em> and all α.

<h3><a name="TotCor">3.3 Total correctness</a></h3>

<p>
By Hoare’s own admission in Hoare [1979], his original calculus was
merely a starting point and suffered quite a few
limitations. Particularly, it only allows one to reason about
<em>partial</em> correctness. That is, the truth of a statement
{<em>A</em>}α{<em>B</em>} only makes sure that all executions of
α starting in a state satisfying <em>A</em> will end in a state
satisfying <em>B</em>, <em>or will not halt</em>. That is, a partially
correct program may have non-terminating executions. (In fact, a
program that has no terminating execution will always be partially
correct. This is the case for example of the program
<strong>while</strong> 1 <strong>do</strong>
<strong>skip</strong>. The formula <em>A</em> →
[<strong>while</strong> 1 <strong>do</strong>
<strong>skip</strong>]<em>B</em> is deducible for all formulas
<em>A</em> and <em>B</em>.) The calculus offers no basis for a proof
that a program terminates. It can be modified so as to account for
<em>total</em> correctness of programs: partial correctness plus
termination. It is achieved by amending the rule of iteration. We do
not present it here and refer the interested reader to Apt [1981].</p>

<p>Let us first observe that for <em>deterministic</em> programs, one
can already capture total correctness via formulas of the kind</p>

<blockquote><em>A</em> → &lt;α&gt;<em>B</em></blockquote> 

<p>The expression &lt;α&gt;<em>B</em> means that there is an
execution of α that terminates in a state that satisfies
<em>B</em>. Moreover, if α is deterministic, this possible
terminating execution is the unique execution of α. Thus, if one
first manages to prove that a program is deterministic, this trick
works well enough to prove its total correctness.</p>

<p>A general solution to the problem of total correctness exists in
the realm of PDL. But we need to extend it a little. Pratt had already
alluded in Pratt [1980b] that PDL is not expressive enough to capture
the infinite looping of programs. In reaction, PDL with repeating
(RPDL) was introduced by Streett [1982]. It contains, for all programs
α, the expression Δα standing for a new proposition
with semantics</p>

<blockquote>
 <em>V</em>(Δα) = {<em>x</em>: there exists an
infinite sequence <em>x</em><sub>0</sub>, <em>x</em><sub>1</sub>,
… of states such that
<em>x</em><sub>0</sub> = <em>x</em> and for all
<em>n</em> ≥ 0,
<em>x</em><sub><em>n</em></sub><em>R</em>(α)<em>x</em><sub><em>n</em>+1</sub>}
 </blockquote>

<p>Streett [1982] conjectured that RPDL can be axiomatized by adding to the
proof system of PDL precisely the following axiom schemas.</p>
<blockquote>
(A6)   Δα → &lt;α&gt;Δα<br />

(A7)   [α*](<em>A</em> → &lt;α&gt;<em>A</em>)
→ (<em>A</em> → Δα)
</blockquote>

<p>The proof of the conjecture was provided in Sakalauskaite and
Valiev [1990]. (A version of the conjecture in the variant of
combinatory PDL was also proved in Gargov and Passy [1988].)</p>

<p>It is easy to see that in the Hoare calculus presented above, non
termination can only come from the rule of iteration. Analogously,
non termination of a PDL program can only come from the use of the
unbounded iteration. The expression Δα indicates that
α* can diverge, and this is just the kind of notion we need. We
can now inductively define a predicate ∞ such that for a program
α, the formula ∞(α) will be true exactly when
α can enter a non-terminating computation.</p>

<blockquote>
∞(π) := 0    where
π ∈ Π<sub>0</sub> <br />

∞(φ?) := 0 <br /> 

∞(α ∪ β) := ∞(α) ∨ ∞(β)
<br /> 

∞(α ; β) := ∞(α) ∨
&lt;α&gt; ∞(β) <br /> 

∞(α*) :=
Δα ∨ &lt;α*&gt; ∞(α) </blockquote>

<p>Finally, the total correctness of a program can be expressed via
formulas of the kind</p>

<blockquote>
<em>A</em> → (¬∞(α) ∧ [α]<em>B</em>)
</blockquote>

<p>which means literally that if <em>A</em> is the case, then the
program α cannot run forever and every successful execution will
end in a state satisfying <em>B</em>.</p>

<h2><a name="Var">4. Some variants</a></h2>

<p> Results concerning comparative power of expression, decidability,
complexity, axiomatization and completeness of a number of variants of
PDL obtained by extending or restricting its syntax and its semantics
constitute the subject of a wealth of literature. We can only say so
much and we will address just a few of these variants leaving out
big chunks of otherwise important work in dynamic logic.</p>

<h3><a name="PDLWitTes">4.1 PDL without tests</a></h3>

<p>The axiom schema [<em>A</em>?]<em>B</em> ↔ (<em>A</em> →
<em>B</em>) seems to indicate that for every formula <em>C</em>, there
exists an equivalent test-free formula <em>C</em>′—i.e.,
there is a test-free formula <em>C</em>′ such that
 ⊨ <em>C</em> ↔
<em>C</em>′. It is interesting to observe that this assertion is
untrue. Let PDL<sub>0</sub> be the restriction of PDL to test-free
regular programs, i.e. programs which do not contain tests. Berman and
Paterson [1981] considered the PDL formula
&lt;(<em>p</em>?;π)*;¬<em>p</em>?;π;<em>p</em>?&gt;1, which
is</p>

<blockquote>
 &lt;<strong>while</strong> <em>p</em> <strong>do</strong> π&gt;&lt;π&gt;<em>p</em>
</blockquote>

<p>and proved that there is no PDL<sub>0</sub> formula equivalent to
it. Hence, PDL has more expressive power than PDL<sub>0</sub>. Their
argument actually can be generalized as follows. For all
<em>n</em> ≥ 0, let PDL<sub><em>n</em>+1</sub> be the
subset of PDL in which programs can contain tests <em>A</em>? only if
<em>A</em> is a PDL<sub><em>n</em></sub> formula. For all
<em>n</em> ≥ 0, Berman and Paterson considered the
PDL<sub><em>n</em>+1</sub> formula <em>A</em><sub><em>n</em>+1</sub>
defined by</p>

<blockquote>
 &lt;<strong>while</strong> <em>A</em><sub><em>n</em></sub>
<strong>do</strong> π<sub><em>n</em></sub>&gt;&lt;
π<sub><em>n</em></sub>&gt;<em>A</em><sub><em>n</em></sub>
 </blockquote>

<p>where <em>A</em><sub>0</sub> = <em>p</em> and
π<sub>0</sub> = π and proved that for all
<em>n</em> ≥ 0, there is no PDL<sub><em>n</em></sub>
formula equivalent to <em>A</em><sub><em>n</em>+1</sub>. Hence, for
all <em>n</em> ≥ 0, PDL<sub><em>n</em>+1</sub> has
more expressive power than PDL<sub><em>n</em></sub>.</p>

<h3><a name="PDLCon">4.2 PDL with converse</a></h3>

<p>CPDL is the extension of PDL with converse. It is a construct that
has been considered since the beginning of PDL. For all programs
α, let α<sup>-1</sup> stand for a new program with
semantics</p>

<blockquote>
 <em>x</em><em>R</em>(α<sup>-1</sup>)<em>y</em> iff
<em>y</em><em>R</em>(α)<em>x</em>.
 </blockquote>

<p>The converse construct allows us to express facts about states
preceding the current one and to reason backward about programs. For
instance, [α<sup>-1</sup>]<em>A</em> means that before executing
α, <em>A</em> had to hold.
<!-- The expression
&lt;&alpha;<sup>-1</sup>&gt;<em>A</em> can also be interpreted as
the <em>strongest post-condition</em> to hold after the termination of
a program &alpha; started in a world satisfying <em>A</em>.--> 
We have</p>

<blockquote>
 ⊨
 <em>A</em> → [α]&lt;α<sup>-1</sup>&gt;<em>A</em>, 
 <br />
 ⊨
 <em>A</em> → [α<sup>-1</sup>]&lt;α&gt;<em>A</em>. 
 </blockquote>

<p>The addition of the converse construct does not change the
properties of PDL in any significant way. By adding every instance of
the following axiom schemas:</p>

<blockquote>

(A8)   <em>A</em> →
[α]&lt;α<sup>-1</sup>&gt;<em>A</em><br />

(A9)   <em>A</em> →
[α<sup>-1</sup>]&lt;α&gt;<em>A</em>

</blockquote>

<p>to the proof system of PDL, we obtain a sound and complete
deducibility predicate in the extended language. See Parikh [1978]
for details. CPDL has the small model property and (CPDL-SAT) is
EXPTIME-complete.</p>

<p>It is easy to remark that CPDL has more expressive power than PDL. To see this,
consider the CPDL formula &lt;π<sup>-1</sup>&gt;1 and the LTSs
<em>M</em> = (<em>W</em>, <em>R</em>, <em>V</em>)
and
<em>M</em>′ = (<em>W</em>′, <em>R</em>′, <em>V</em>′)
where <em>W</em> = {<em>x</em>,<em>y</em>},
<em>R</em>(π) = {(<em>x</em>,<em>y</em>)},
<em>W</em>′ = {<em>y</em>′},
<em>R</em>′(π) = ∅
 and <em>V</em>(<em>x</em>) = <em>V</em>(<em>y</em>)
 = <em>V</em>′(<em>y</em>′) =
 ∅. Since <em>M</em>, <em>y</em> sat &lt;π<sup>-1</sup>&gt;1,
 not <em>M</em>′, <em>y</em>′ sat
 &lt;π<sup>-1</sup>&gt;1, and because for all PDL
 formulas <em>A</em> it is the case that
<em>M</em>, <em>y</em> sat <em>A</em> iff <em>M</em>′,
<em>y</em>′ sat <em>A</em>, then it is clear that no PDL formula is
equivalent to &lt;π<sup>-1</sup>&gt;1.</p>

<h3><a name="PDLInfCycRep">4.3 PDL with repeating and looping</a></h3>

<p>We have already exposed the power of repeating in
<a href="#TotCor">section 3.3</a> by introducing RPDL. Here, we
summarize more results about RPDL and its connection with other
variations on the notion of repeating programs.</p>

<p>Concerning the complexity theory of RPDL, Streett [1982] had
already established that RPDL had the finite model property; precisely
that every RPDL satisfiable formula <em>A</em> is satisfiable in
a model of size at most triply exponential in the length
of <em>A</em>. An automata-theoretic argument permitted to conclude
that the problem (RPDL-SAT) can be solved in deterministic triple
exponential time (3-EXPTIME). The gap between this upper bound for
deciding (RPDL-SAT) and the simple exponential-time lower bound for
deciding (PDL-SAT) was thus open. The problem found itself greatly
connected to the growing interest of computer scientists in
establishing the complexity of temporal logics, and more specifically
of the (propositional) modal μ-calculus (MMC) due to Kozen [1983],
because RPDL has a linear blow-up translation to MMC. Moreover,
Streett’s argument somewhat set a precedent in the now pervasive use
of automata techniques in proving computational properties of logics
of programs and of temporal logics. In Vardi and Stockmeyer [1985], an
upper bound in non-deterministic exponential time was shown. In
Emerson and Jutla [1988] and in its final form in Emerson and Jutla
[1999], it was shown that (MMC-SAT) and (RPDL-SAT) are
EXPTIME-complete. If we add the converse operator
of <a href="#PDLCon">section 4.2</a> one obtains CRPDL. The complexity
of (CRPDL-SAT) remained open for a few years but it can be shown to be
EXPTIME-complete, too. This is achieved by combining the techniques of
Emerson and Jutla [1988] and Vardi [1985], as in Vardi [1998].</p>

<p>In <a href="#TotCor">section 3.3</a> we have defined a predicate
∞, where ∞(α) means that α can have
non-terminating computation. We call LPDL the logic obtained by
augmenting PDL with the predicate ∞. Clearly, RPDL is at least
as expressive as LPDL; The inductive definition of ∞(α) in
the language of RPDL is witness of it. RPDL is in fact strictly more
expressive than LPDL. This was shown in Harel and Sherman [1982].

As it can be suspected, both RPDL and LPDL have more expressive power
than PDL. It is established by proving that some formulas of RPDL and
of LPDL have no equivalent expression in PDL.

The proof involves the technique of <em>filtration</em> which is
designed to collapse an LTS to a finite model while leaving invariant
the truth or falsity of certain formulas. For some set of PDL
formulas <em>X</em>, it consists in grouping into equivalence classes
the states of an LTS that satisfy exactly the same formulas
in <em>X</em>. The set of equivalence classes of states thus obtained
becomes the set of states of the filtrate model, and a transition is built
appropriately over them.</p>

<p>
With a carefully chosen set FL(<em>A</em>) that depends on a
PDL formula <em>A</em> (the so-called Fischer-Ladner closure of the
set of sub-formulas of <em>A</em>), a filtration of an LTS <em>M</em>
yields a finite filtrate <em>M</em>′, such that <em>A</em> is
satisfiable at a world <em>u</em> in <em>M</em> if and only if it is
satisfiable in the equivalence class containing <em>u</em> in the
filtrate. (See Fischer and Ladner [1979].)
</p>

<p>We can now consider the filtrations of the
LTS <em>M</em> = (<em>W</em>, <em>R</em>,<em>V</em>)
where</p>

<ul>

<li><em>W</em> = {(<em>i</em>,<em>j</em>) : <em>j</em> and <em>i</em>
positive integers, 0 ≤ <em>j</em> ≤ <em>i</em>} ∪ { u
}</li>

<li>(<em>i</em>,<em>j</em>)<em>R</em>(π)(<em>i</em>,<em>j</em>-1)
when 1 ≤ <em>j</em> ≤ <em>i</em></li>

<li><em>u</em><em>R</em>(π)(<em>i</em>,<em>i</em>) for every <em>i</em></li>

<li><em>V</em>(<em>p</em>) = ∅ for every <em>p</em> ∈
Φ<sub>0</sub></li>

</ul>

<p>In one sentence, what goes on in <em>M</em> is that from the
world <em>u</em>, there is an infinite number of finite π-paths of
growing length. We have both <em>M</em>, <em>u</em> sat
¬Δπ and <em>M</em>, <em>u</em> sat
¬∞(π*). Yet, for every PDL formula <em>A</em>, we
will have both Δπ and ∞(π*) that are satisfied at
the equivalence class of <em>u</em> in the model obtained by
filtration of <em>M</em> with FL(<em>A</em>). Indeed, the filtration
must collapse some states of <em>M</em> and create some loops. Thus,
there exists no PDL formula that can express either Δπ or
∞(π*).

and yet, we will have both Δπ and ∞(π*) that are
satisfied at the equivalence class of <em>u</em> in any finite
filtrate of <em>M</em>. Thus, neither Δπ nor ∞(π*)
can be expressed in PDL.</p>

<p>There are other ways of making possible the assertion that a
program can execute forever. For instance, Danecki [1984a] proposed a
predicate <strong>sloop</strong> to qualify programs that can enter in
strong loops, that is:</p>

<blockquote>
<em>V</em>(<strong>sloop</strong>(α)) = {<em>x</em>:
<em>x</em><em>R</em>(α)<em>x</em>}
</blockquote>

<p>Let us call SLPDL the logic obtained by augmenting PDL
with <strong>sloop</strong>(α). RPDL and SLPDL are essentially
incomparable: the predicate Δ is not definable in SLPDL, and the
predicate <strong>sloop</strong> is not definable in RPDL. SLPDL does
not possess the finite model property. For example, the formula</p>

<blockquote>
 [π*](&lt;π&gt;1
 ∧
 ¬<strong>sloop</strong>(π<sup>+</sup>))
</blockquote>

<p>is satisfiable in infinite LTSs only. Nonetheless, Danecki [1984a]
established the decidability of (SLPDL-SAT) formulas in
deterministic exponential time.</p>

<h3><a name="PDLInt">4.4 PDL with intersection</a></h3>

<p> Another construct has been studied: the intersection of programs.
By adding intersection of programs to PDL, we obtain the logic
IPDL. In IPDL, for all programs α, β, the expression
α∩β stands for a new program with semantics</p>

<blockquote>
 <em>x</em><em>R</em>(α∩β)<em>y</em> iff
<em>x</em><em>R</em>(α)<em>y</em> and
<em>x</em><em>R</em>(β)<em>y</em>
 </blockquote>

<p>For instance, the intended reading of
&lt;α∩β&gt;<em>A</em> is that if we execute α and
β in the present state then there exists a state reachable by
both programs which satisfies <em>A</em>. As a result, we have</p>

<blockquote>
 ⊨
 &lt;α∩β&gt;<em>A</em> → &lt;α&gt;<em>A</em>
 ∧
 &lt;β&gt;<em>A</em>
 </blockquote>

<p>but, in general, we have</p>

<blockquote>not
 ⊨
 &lt;α&gt;<em>A</em>
 ∧
 &lt;β&gt;<em>A</em> → &lt;α∩β&gt;<em>A</em>
 </blockquote>

<p>Although intersection of programs plays an important role in
various applications of PDL to artificial intelligence and computer
science, the proof theory and the complexity theory of PDL with
intersection remained unexplored for several years. Concerning the
complexity theory of IPDL, difficulties appear when one considers the
finite model property.

In fact the construct <strong>sloop</strong>(α) can be
expressed in IPDL. In propositional dynamic logic with intersection it is
equivalent to &lt;α∩1?&gt;1. We can thus adapt the formula of  
IPDL of <a href="#TotCor">section 4.3</a>, and we have that</p>

<blockquote>
 [π*](&lt;π&gt;1
 ∧
 [π<sup>+</sup>∩1?]0)
 </blockquote>

<p>is satisfiable in infinite LTSs only. In other words, IPDL does not
possess the finite model property. Danecki [1984b] investigated the
complexity theory of IPDL and showed that deciding (IPDL-SAT) can be
done in deterministic double exponential time. (A modern proof
is presented in Göller, Lohrey and Lutz [2007].) The complexity
gap between this double exponential-time upper bound for deciding
(IPDL-SAT) and the simple exponential-time lower bound for deciding
(PDL-SAT) obtained by Fischer and Ladner [1979] remained open for more
than twenty years. In 2004, Lange [2005] established the lower bound
of exponential space of (IPDL-SAT). In 2006, Lange and Lutz [2005]
gave a proof of a double exponential-time lower bound of the
satisfiability problem for IPDL without tests by a reduction from the
word problem of exponentially space-bounded alternating Turing
machines. In this reduction, the role of the iteration construct is
essential since, according to Massacci [2001], the satisfiability
problem for iteration-free IPDL without tests is only
PSPACE-complete. Adding the converse construct to IPDL, we obtain
ICPDL. The satisfiability problem of ICPDL has been proved to be
2-EXPTIME-complete by Göller, Lohrey and Lutz [2007].</p>

<p>Concerning the proof theory of IPDL, difficulties appear when we
realize that no axiom schema, in the language of PDL with
intersection, “corresponds” to the semantics
 <em>x</em><em>R</em>(α∩β)<em>y</em> iff
<em>x</em><em>R</em>(α)<em>y</em> and
<em>x</em><em>R</em>(β)<em>y</em> of the program
α∩β. That is, not in the same way for example, that the
axiom schemas (A1) and (A2) respectively “correspond” to
the semantics of the programs α;β and
α∪β.  For this reason, the axiomatization of PDL with
intersection was open until the complete proof system developed in
Balbiani and Vakarelov [2003].</p>

<p>In another variant of PDL, due to Peleg [1987] and further studied
by Goldblatt [1992b], the expression α∩β is interpreted
“do α and β in parallel”. In this context, the
binary relations <em>R</em>(α) and <em>R</em>(β) are no
longer sets of pairs of the form (<em>x</em>,<em>y</em>) with
<em>x</em>, <em>y</em> worlds, but rather sets of pairs of the form
(<em>x</em>,<em>Y</em>) with <em>x</em> a world and <em>Y</em> a set
of worlds. It was inspired by the Game Logic of Parikh [1985], an
intepretation of PDL with “programs as games”. Game Logic
provides an additional program construct that dualizes programs, thus
permitting to define the intersection of programs as the dual of the
non-deterministic choice between programs.</p>

<h2><a name="Con">5. Conclusion</a></h2>

<p>This article has focused on propositional dynamic logic and some of
its significant variants.

There are by now a number of books—Goldblatt [1982], Goldblatt
[1992a], Harel [1979] and Harel, Kozen and Tiuryn [2000]—and
survey papers—Harel [1984], Kozen and Tiuryn [1990], Parikh
[1983] —treating PDL and related formalisms.

The body of research on PDL is certainly instrumental in developing
many logical theories of system dynamics. However, these theories are arguably out
of the scope of the present article.

Van Eijck and Stokhof [2006] is a more recent overview of topics
making use of dynamic logic, addressing various themes that are of
certain interest for philosophers: e.g., dynamics of communication, or
natural language semantics.

Recent books are going in much details on newer topics, such as
dynamic logic of knowledge (dynamic epistemic logic) in Van Ditmarsch,
Van Der Hoek and Kooi [2007], and the dynamic logic of continuous and
hybrid systems (differential dynamic logic) in Platzer [2010].

PDL was conceived primarily for reasoning about programs. There are
many other applications of modal logic to reasoning about
programs. Algorithmic logic is closer to PDL since it allows one to
talk explicitly about programs. The reader is invited to consult the
work studied in Mirkowska and Salwicki [1987]. Temporal logics are now
the chief logics in theoretical computer science and have a close
connection with logics of programs. They allow one to express the
temporal behavior of transition systems with a language that abstracts
away from the labels (hence the programs). See for instance Schneider
[2004] for an overview of the foundations in this research area.</p>
