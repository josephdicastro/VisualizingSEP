<h1>Impartiality</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Mon Mar 25, 2002; substantive revision Mon Feb 6, 2017</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
Impartiality is sometimes treated by philosophers as if it were
equivalent to <em>moral</em> impartiality. Or, at the very least, the
former word is often used, without the qualifying adjective
‘moral’, even when it is the particularly moral concept
that is intended. This is misleading, since impartiality in its
broadest sense is best understood as a formal notion, while moral
impartiality in particular is a substantive concept – and one
concerning which there is considerable dispute. This entry will be
predominantly concerned with moral impartiality – the sort of
impartiality, that is, that commonly features in normative moral and
political theories. However, we will begin by addressing the broader,
formal concept, and we will end with a brief discussion of issues
raised by epistemic, rather than moral, impartiality.</p>

<h2><a name="ConImp">1. The concept of impartiality</a></h2>

<p>
It is all too easy to assume that the word impartiality must denote a
positive, unitary concept – presumably a concept closely linked with,
if not identical to, morality. This, however, is simply not the case.
Rather, there are various sorts of behavior that may be described as
‘impartial,’ and some of these obviously have little or nothing to
do with morality. A person who chooses an accountant on the basis of
her friends’ recommendations may be entirely impartial between
the various candidates (members of the pool of local accountants) with
respect to their gender, their age, or where they went to school. Yet
if her choice is motivated solely by rational self-interested
considerations then it is clear that the impartiality she manifests is
in no way a form of moral impartiality. To take a more extreme case,
consider an insane serial killer who chooses his victims on the basis
of their resemblance to that some celebrity. The killer may be
impartial with respect to his victims’ occupations, religious
beliefs, and so forth, but it would be absurd to regard this as a form
of moral impartiality.</p>

<p>
It is also worth noting that some types of impartiality may in
themselves be immoral or morally questionable. Suppose that I decide
to pass along a treasured family heirloom to one of my two sons, Bill
and Phil. Flipping a coin would constitute one type of impartial
procedure for choosing between the two. But suppose that I have
already promised the heirloom to Phil on several occasions. In this
case it would be quite wrong to allow a coin toss to determine whether
he gets it. Deciding by means of a coin toss would be an impartial
procedure, but it would be the wrong sort of impartiality here, for it
would ignore the moral obligation created by my previous promises.</p>

<p>
The word ‘impartiality’, then, picks out a broad concept that need
not have anything to do with morality. In this broad sense,
impartiality is probably best characterized in a negative rather than
positive manner: an impartial choice is simply one in which a certain
sort of consideration (i.e. some property of the individuals being
chosen between) has no influence. An analysis along these lines has
been proposed by Bernard Gert, who holds that “<i>A</i> is impartial
in respect <i>R</i> with regard to group <i>G</i> if and only if
<i>A</i>’s actions in respect <i>R</i> are not influenced at all
by which member(s) of <i>G</i> benefit or are harmed by these
actions” (Gert 1995, p.104). Thus, for Gert, impartiality is a
property of a set of decisions made by a particular agent, directed
toward a particular group.</p>

<p>
Gert’s analysis captures the important fact that one cannot
simply ask of a given agent whether or not she is impartial. Rather,
we must also specify with regard to whom she is impartial, and in what
respect. Gert’s analysis, then, permits and indeed requires that
we make fairly fine-grained distinctions between various sorts of
impartiality. This is necessary, since one and the same agent might
manifest various sorts of partiality and impartiality towards various
groups of persons. Consider, for instance, a university professor who
is also a mother of five children, and who is currently acting as a
member of a hiring committee. Such an agent might be impartial between
her children with respect to the care they receive (while preferring
her own children over others in this respect), and also impartial
between the various job candidates; but it is clear that these two
uses of the word ‘impartial’ denote very different
practices. In particular, the idea of merit applies in one case but
not the other: to be impartial between job candidates is presumably to
select between them on the basis of merit, whereas to be impartial
between one’s children is <em>not</em> to think of merit at all,
but rather to provide equal protection and care to all.</p>

<p>
Many attempts to characterize impartiality fail to respect the
distinction between the broadest, most formalistic sense of the
notion, and a more specifically moral impartiality. To say, for
instance, that an impartial choice is one that is free of bias or
prejudice is to presuppose that we are dealing with a certain sort of
impartiality, that which is required or recommended by morality, or at
least worthy of moral approbation. ‘Bias’ and ‘prejudice’ are
loaded terms, suggesting not only that some consideration is being
excluded, but also that the exclusion is appropriate and warranted.
Similarly, the idea that impartiality requires that we give equal
and/or adequate consideration to the interests of all concerned
parties goes well beyond the requirements of the merely formal notion.
(In the coin toss case, it is quite clear that Phil’s claims to
the heirloom are not being given equal or adequate consideration.) As
a characterization of moral impartiality, however, this suggestion is
perhaps more promising, at least in some contexts.</p>

<h2><a name="MorImp">2. Morality and impartiality</a></h2>

<h3><a name="ImpPoiVie">2.1 The impartial point of view</a></h3>

<p>
It is characteristic of modern moral thought to see impartiality as a
requirement of, if not a fundamental component of, morality. However,
the precise nature of this connection remains disputed. As Brad Hooker
has pointed out, there are at least three levels at which assessments
of moral impartiality may be made. First, one may ask whether moral
rules are being impartially applied. Second, impartial benevolence may
be used as a direct guide to practical decisions. And third, the
content of first-order moral rules may be assessed from an impartial
standpoint. (Hooker 2010).</p>

<p>
Let’s begin with the idea that to act morally is to act from the
standpoint of impartial benevolence. Many writers have simply assumed
that to assert the importance of impartiality in the context of
morality just is to accept the idea of acting from such a perspective.
It is generally agreed that some sort of close connection obtains
between morality and impartiality. Indeed, the phrases ‘moral
point of view’ and ‘impartial (or
‘impersonal’) point of view’ are sometimes used
interchangeably to refer to the imagined impersonal perspective from
which, it is supposed, moral judgments are to be made (Baier 1958,
chapter 8; Harsanyi 1982; Scheffler 1982, 1985; Smith 1976 [1759];
Wolf 1992; see also Blum 1980, Chapter 3). As noted above, however,
the word ‘impartial’ is a general term with many
particular species; it follows that the phrase ‘impartial point
of view’ is itself ambiguous. At most, it might be that the
moral point of view constitutes one sort of impartial point of
view.</p>

<p>
It is not clear, however, that the demands of impartial benevolence
are sufficient to exhaust those of morality. Treating a person
appropriately and respectfully may well require certain sorts of
emotional and/or cognitive responses: sensitivity to her needs and
values, empathy for her suffering, and the like. But if these
responses are pictured as the results of <em>positive</em> traits or
attributes (and not simply as, say, the result of a lack of bias or
prejudice), then it is not clear that merely being impartial between
persons is sufficient to guarantee that one will possess and display
the necessary sensitivities. Indeed, characterizations of impartial
agents which proceed in negative terms (that is, by defining various
preferences, emotions or bits of information that she does not possess
or that do not move her) often risk picturing the impartial agent as
impersonal and even indifferent (Henberg 1978; Brandt 1954).</p>

<p>
A second problem for the claim that the moral point of view is
identical with (some version of) the impartial point of view – or
indeed, for any view which identifies morality and impartiality in the
direct sense – is that it seems plausible to regard some forms of
moral partiality as morally admirable, and perhaps even morally
required (Blum 1980; Cottingham 1983, 1986, 1996; Jeske &amp; Fumerton
1997; Jollimore 2001; Kapur 1991; Kekes 1981; Keller 2013; MacIntyre
1984; Oldenquist 1982). Loyalty to one’s family, community or
country, for instance, is commonly regarded as a virtue. Yet such an
attitude is a clear and indeed paradigmatic example of partiality,
requiring that an agent feel and act differently toward one set of
persons than she does toward humanity in general. Similarly, certain
specific moral duties arising from certain particular relationships
seem to involve partiality in an irreducible manner. Parents, for
example, are thought to be morally obliged to take special care of
their own children; to regard one’s child as merely one among
millions would be regarded as highly eccentric if not monstrous. Of
course, some moral duties do require that an agent be impartial in
performing them. But on common sense moral views at least,
impartiality seems mostly to be required in the context of specific
roles – such as when a person is acting as a judge, an umpire, a
journalist, or a representative of some public institution; or,
perhaps, when we are evaluating and selecting first-order moral rules.
(Baron 1991; Blum 1980; Cottingham 1983). The idea that impartiality
is a pervasive and universal moral requirement that should be directly
manifested in our thoughts and practices during daily life seems to
contradict our ordinary moral intuitions.</p>

<p>
Whether there exists such a thing as morally admirable partiality is
the main issue that separates the so-called <em>partialists</em> from
the <em>impartialists</em>. Partialists, in general, tend to claim
that morally admirable partiality does exist, that it cannot be
reduced to any form of impartiality at a more fundamental level, and
that these facts pose a serious problem for those who claim that
morality and (some form of) impartiality are identical, or even
closely related. Impartialists, by contrast, either deny the existence
of morally admirable partiality altogether, or hold that any apparent
cases are in fact ultimately reducible to impartial standards (see
section 6). Thus impartialists hold that – contrary, perhaps, to
appearances – impartiality is, indeed, a pervasive and universal
requirement of morality.</p>

<h3><a name="IdeObsThe">2.2 The ideal observer theory</a></h3>

<p>
Rather than being put in terms of an impartial point of view, the
relation between morality and impartiality is sometimes made out in
terms of an impartial agent or observer – a person who makes moral
judgments without being influenced by the sort of contaminating biases
or prejudices that tend to arise from the occupation of some
particular point of view. (Smith 1976 [1759]; Hume 1978 [1740]; Firth
1952; Brandt 1954; Hare 1989.) The observer may also be defined as
‘ideal’ in various other ways. It is generally stipulated that she
is in possession of all the nonmoral facts that are relevant to the
judgments she has to make (Firth 1952). It is also fairly common to
assume that she is an ideal reasoner, and thus immune to logical
fallacy or mistaken inference, etc. (Indeed, Hare goes so far as to
state that his ‘archangel’ possesses “superhuman powers of
thought, superhuman knowledge and no human weaknesses” (Hare 1989,
p. 44).) The ‘ideal observer theory’ of morality, in its most
straightforward form, states that moral judgments simply are the
judgments an ideal observer of this sort will make.</p>

<p>
Any advantage it has over the conception of morality as an impartial
point of view presumably arises from the fact that the ideal observer
is not completely defined in terms of impartiality. (If she were, the
two conceptions would simply coincide.) Yet many ideal observer
theorists seem to accept a characterization of the ideal observer
which concentrates on her impartiality and impersonality. Firth, for
example, suggests that the ideal observer is both
‘distinterested,’ in the strong sense of being ‘entirely lacking
in particular interests,’ and ‘dispassionate,’ in that she is
‘incapable of experiencing any emotions at all.’ (Firth, 1952)
Defined in this way, however, the ideal observer sounds not only
impersonal but deeply indifferent; and the idea that the moral
judgments of a person who had neither emotional responses nor
particular interests could be trusted, let alone that they might be
considered definitive of morality, strikes some critics as highly
implausible (Brandt 1979).</p>

<p>
Suppose, then, that the ideal observer theorist decides that the
definition of the ideal observer <em>must</em> include more than the
bare idea of impartiality – that in addition the observer must
be, say, compassionate (and thus not indifferent); and that she must
possess a considerable facility for proper moral judgments –
practical wisdom, in the Aristotelian sense. Such a theorist will now
face a different problem: the more we build into the definition of our
ideal observer, the less useful it becomes as a heuristic device.
Stipulating that the ideal observer is very wise, for example, is not
very helpful if we ourselves are not wise, and so have no idea what an
ideally wise observer would choose. Indeed, ideal observer analyses
that go too far in this direction seem to become circular – the
‘ideal’ observer is ideal because she always makes proper
judgments, those being defined as just those judgments the ideal
observer would make (Broad 1959, p. 263). A circularity of this sort
seems to be present in John Stuart Mill’s claim:</p>

<blockquote>
Impartiality, in short, as an obligation of justice, may be said to
mean, being exclusively influenced by the considerations which it is
supposed ought to influence the particular case in hand; and resisting
the solicitation of any motives which prompt to conduct different from
what those considerations would dictate. (Mill 1861/1992, p. 154; see
also Firth 1952, p. 336)
</blockquote>

<p>
The ideal observer, then, to be useful, must be given some independent
definition, and not simply defined as ‘an agent who always gets it
right.’ The challenge is to find such a definition. Here, as with
the conception of morality as defined by an impartial point of view,
the phenomenon of morally admirable partiality proves a particularly
difficult issue. Should we define the ideal observer as being loyal to
her country, or as being above loyalty? If the former, can she serve
as an adequate moral example to people who do not share her
allegiances? If the latter, how can she serve as an adequate example
to anyone? Any process of idealization of the sort required to make
such a conception work seems likely to result in an individual so
removed from the concrete lives and concerns of actual human moral
agents, that her moral judgments will turn out to be in large part
irrelevant to the question of how such agents ought to live (see
Walker 1991).</p>

<h3><a name="MorImpEqu">2.3 Moral impartiality and equality</a></h3>

<p>
The plausibility of identifying the moral point of view with the
impartial point of view, or of defining morality in terms of an
impartial observer, presumably lies in the thought that such views
capture the idea that morally speaking, every person is equally
important. Whatever such conceptions may get wrong, then, one thing
they seem to get right is the idea that there is a close and important
connection between moral impartiality and equality (see especially
Nagel 1991, Chapter 7).</p>

<p>
Some clarification, however, is required. To say that from the
impartial point of view, no one is seen as intrinsically more
significant than anyone else, is not to say that there is no reason
whatsoever for which a person might demand more moral attention or
better treatment than others. Many moral theorists, after all, will
suppose that from the impartial point of view, properly conceived,
some individuals will count as more significant, at least in certain
ways. William Godwin (Godwin 1793) provides an influential and
infamous example. Fenelon, the archbishop of Cambrai, Godwin writes,
may be supposed to be more significant than a mere chambermaid; so in
an emergency (Godwin imagines a building on fire) the archbishop ought
to be rescued first. The reason, however, is not that the archbishop
is intrinsically more significant; rather, the claim is grounded on
the fact that the archbishop makes greater contributions to society:

[T]hat life ought to be preferred which will be most conducive to the
general good. In saving the life of Fenelon, suppose at the moment
when he was conceiving the project of his immortal
<em>Telemachus</em>, I should be promoting the benefit of thousands
who have been cured by the perusal of it of some error, vice and
consequent unhappiness. Nay, my benefit would extend further than
this, for every individual thus cured has become a better member of
society and has contributed in his turn to the happiness, the
information and improvement of mankind. (Godwin 1793, 41–42)
</blockquote>

<p>
Thus, viewing persons from an impartial point of view need not imply
that we view them equally, in every sense of the word; and it
certainly does not imply that everyone must receive <em>equal
treatment</em>. (In Godwin’s Archbishop Fenelon case, if we
assume that only one person can be saved, the only way to give the
archbishop and the chambermaid equal treatment would be to let them
both perish in the flames.) What impartiality seems to require is not
that everyone receive equal treatment, but rather that everyone be
<em>treated as an equal</em> (Dworkin 1977, p. 227). While the
distinction between equal treatment and treatment as equals is
difficult to make out with precision, the main idea is fairly clear:
treatment as equals requires that persons are <em>not</em> treated
equally, but rather treated in accordance with what rights they
possess, what legitimate claims they put forward, and, in general,
with what they deserve. Thus, to inflict a one year jail sentence on
all accused persons, regardless of whether they are guilty or
innocent, is to provide equal treatment to members of that group; but
it is not to treat them as equals.</p>

<blockquote>
Supposing the chambermaid had been my wife, my mother or my
benefactor. That would not alter the truth of the proposition. The
life of Fenelon would still be more valuable than that of the
chambermaid; and justice – pure, unadulterated justice –
would still have preferred that which was most valuable. Justice would
have taught me to save the life of Fenelon at the expense of the
other. What magic is there, in the pronoun ‘my’ to
overturn the decisions of everlasting truth? My wife or my mother may
be a fool or a prostitute, malicious, lying or dishonest. If they be,
what consequence is it that they are mine? (Godwin 1793, pp.
41–42)
</blockquote>

<p>
Of course, since his thought experiment concerns an unusual emergency
case, it might be suggested that, since we are not frequently faced
with the choice of who to pull from a burning building, Godwin’s
position, as radical as it is, has few implications for everyday moral
decision-making. But as Singer (1972) has argued, those of us who live
in economically privileged countries can, by choosing to donate some
of our incomes to charity, prevent people elsewhere on the planet from
dying of hunger, easily preventable diseases, etc.; and this seems to
imply that we are always in the situation of choosing who lives and
who dies – whether or not we explicitly acknowledge the fact. (See
also Unger 1996 and Singer 2009.) </p>

<p>

Singer’s work has given rise to the movement popularly known as
‘effective altruism,’ composed of people who attempt to
dedicate their lives to doing as much practical good as possible.  One
popular strategy is to donate as much as possible to those charitable
organizations judged to be most effective. Such views, like
Godwin’s, adhere to the view that we owe as much moral attention
and effort to those who are distant and unrelated to us as to our
neighbors, close friends, and even family. </p>

<p>
Many have resisted the extreme position defended by Godwin, Singer,
etc. If nothing else, such positions are quite clearly incompatible
with the apparent existence of morally admirable partiality. (Williams
(1981) holds that even to consider sacrificing one’s wife for
the sake of impersonal justice constitutes a kind of moral error in
its own right.) Moreover, despite the fact that the ultimate
evaluation is made on the grounds of perfectly general properties, it
is not entirely clear that the objects of the evaluation really are
being treated as equals, in the relevant sense – the fact that the
chambermaid’s life is to be sacrificed for the overall good at
least suggests that her standing as a moral being is not really being
taken into account, and that the suggested understanding of moral
impartiality is therefore deficient.</p>

<p>
Indeed, John Taurek (1977) has famously argued that the various goods
of individual persons cannot be added up to a total ‘overall’ good
in any meaningful sense, and that the traditional consequentialist
conception of right action as maximizing the overall good is
incoherent; indeed, Taurek claims, such decision-making actually fail
to show equal respect for all persons concerned. (Taurek’s
denial that one can aggregate various individual goods can be regarded
as a strong version of the Rawlsian claim that morality must respect a
‘distinction between persons.’) Suppose a lifeguard must choose
between saving one drowning person or saving five; whomever she
chooses not to save will drown, and she cannot save both groups. Most
consequentialists (and many others) would take it as obvious that, at
least in the absence of very special circumstances (the solitary
drowner’s being the potential author of Telemachus, for
instance) the five should be saved rather than the one. But to assume
this, Taurek argues, would be to fail to show the one the same respect
one shows the five: after all, this response leaves the single victim
no chance at all of being rescued. Taurek’s controversial
suggestion is that the lifeguard would show equal respect by flipping
a coin, as this would offer every person involved an equal chance
(fifty percent) of being rescued. Not surprisingly, Taurek’s
argument has engendered a substantial amount of discussion and
criticism (see for instance Kamm 1993 Chapters 5 &amp; 6, Kavka 1979,
Otsuka 2000, Parfit 1978.) </p>

<h2><a name="MorImp1ConMorThe">3. Moral impartiality I: Consequentialist moral theories</a></h2>

<h3><a name="NatConImp">3.1 The nature of consequentialist impartiality</a></h3>

<p>
Consequentialist moral theories hold that moral evaluations and
justifications must ultimately be grounded in the value of the
consequences of the actions, rules, policies, strategies, character
traits, etc. that are being evaluated (Hooker 1994). That is, the
ultimate question to be asked of any action, rule, or character trait
under evaluation is, “Does it [the action, rule, or trait in
question] promote the good?” For the purposes of this entry, three
important assumptions will be made regarding consequentialist
theories. First, consequentialist theories will be assumed to hold
that the overall values of sets of consequences can be determined, and
thus ranked, independently of the identity of any particular agent.
Second, such theories will be assumed to hold that the impersonal good
is largely if not entirely composed of the interests of individual
persons, and that the interests of each person count for just as much
as those of every other person. Finally, it will be assumed that we
are dealing with act consequentialist theories – theories, that is,
which hold that the consequentialist standard is to be applied
directly to the actions of agents, and that what is required is that
every action (or overall pattern of action) maximize the impersonal
good. Such a theory, then, requires that every agent always choose an
action that will bring about consequences at least as good as those
that would be brought about by any other available action. </p>

<p>
In so characterizing consequentialism I am defining it as operating on
the second level identified by Brad Hooker in (Hooker, 2010): the
level, that is, of direct action. One might instead adhere to a theory
according to which first-order moral rules should be chosen in
accordance with their tendency to promote the overall good,
impartially conceived. Such theories typically go by the name
‘rule consequentialism’, though there has been some debate
as to whether they constitute genuinely consequentialist theories at
all (Howard-Snyder 1993). For the purposes of understanding
impartiality, at any rate, it is most useful to group rule
consequentialist theories not with act consequentialist theories but
with deontological theories, which are more similar in terms of their
underlying normative structure. </p>

<p>
As we are understanding it, then, consequentialism seems to place each
agent under a pervasive obligation to be strictly impartial between
all persons, by requiring her always to exclude from her practical
deliberations (almost) all considerations that do not bear directly on
the ways in which people’s interests might be advanced or
injured by her actions.</p>

<p>
The consequentialist standard, then, is strictly impartial in a very
direct manner and in a very rigorous sense. A consequentialist agent
is not permitted to prefer herself, nor any of her loved ones, in
choosing a distribution of benefits and burdens. She may not accept a
pleasure for herself if doing so involves passing up the opportunity
to bring about a slightly larger pleasure for a stranger. Nor is she
permitted to feed her own children if she could do more good by
feeding hungrier strangers instead. She must sacrifice the life of a
spouse, parent or child if, by doing so, she would save more lives, or
even (as in Godwin’s Archbishop Fenelon case) save the life of one
other person whose contribution to the overall good would be greater
than that of the person sacrificed. It is for reasons such as this
that consequentialist impartiality is accused of being too demanding.
By refusing to allow the agent’s personal concerns to play a
special role in her practical deliberations, it is claimed,
consequentialism threatens her integrity and alienates her from
herself and others (Kapur 1991, Scheffler 1982, Stocker 1976, Williams
1973, 1981). As Brian Barry has written, the effect of
consequentialist impartiality “is, in effect, to extend to the whole
of conduct the requirements of impartiality that on the common-sense
view are restricted to judges and bureaucrats acting in their official
capacities.” (Barry 1995, p. 23) </p>

<h3><a name="ConImpTooDem">3.2 Is consequentialist impartiality too demanding?</a></h3>

<p>
The fact that consequentialist impartiality turns out to have such
strict and demanding implications is, for the consequentialist, a
double-edged sword. On the plausible and popular assumption that a
moral theory must be deeply impartial, consequentialism meets this
criterion with flying colors. And consequentialists have typically
been adept at exploiting this fact with powerful rhetoric
(Godwin’s famous query, ‘what magic is there in the pronoun
‘my’?’ being a noteworthy example.) On the other hand, the
impartial demands of consequentialism are so strict and so extreme
that many critics have found them unacceptable: consequentialism, they
claim, simply demands too much and must therefore be rejected
(Scheffler 1982, Slote 1985, Williams 1981).</p>

<p>
Essentially, this worry is a version of what we referred to above as
the problem of morally admirable partiality. The common-sense view is
that it is permissible for an agent to be partial toward herself; that
is, to treat her own projects and concerns as if they had special
significance (Scheffler, 1982). (From her point of view, of course,
they do have special significance.) This sort of self-concern, then,
constitutes a form of partiality which seems, from the vantage point
of common sense, to be morally endorsed. Similarly, certain sorts of
partiality directed toward other people – friends, family members,
and the like – are also forbidden by consequentialist impartiality,
but regarded as justifiable, and in many cases admirable, from the
standpoint of common sense (Blum 1980, Cottingham 1983, Kekes 1981,
Keller 2013, Slote 1985).</p>

<p>
Defenders of consequentialism generally respond in one of three ways.
First, a consequentialist might argue that <em>any</em> genuinely
impartial moral theory will make extreme demands of agents. Second,
they might argue that the view that consequentialism is excessively
demanding depends on a false theory of practical reasoning, which
accords too much significance to morality. Third, they might argue
that in fact, the demands of consequentialism are not as extreme as
have been supposed.</p>

<p>
The first strategy faces a severe difficulty: namely, it at least
seems to be the case that certain non-consequentialist moral theories
– in particular, deontological theories – also incorporate impartial
elements in a fundamental manner, and yet make demands on the moral
agent which are considerably less extreme than those of
consequentialism. Thus, while some consequentialists (e.g. Brink 1989)
have argued that the truth of consequentialism can be logically
derived more or less directly from the requirement that morality be
impartial, this seems to be a mistake (Scheffler 1992, pp. 105-109).
Of course, it is open to the consequentialist either to deny that
deontological moral theories are genuinely impartial (Kagan 1989;
Scheffler 1982, 1985), or to argue that, properly understood, any
plausible ethical theory will be seen to make demands comparable to
those made by consequentialism (Brink 1989, Ashford 2000). Both of
these strategies, however, face difficulties; as we will see in
section 4, there is in fact a very strong case in favor of viewing at
least some deontological theories as genuinely and fundamentally
impartial – a case which nevertheless does not prohibit us from
viewing such theories as less demanding than their consequentialist
rivals.</p>

<p>
The second strategy is to argue that those who object to
consequentialism on the grounds that it is too demanding are placing
too much importance on the role of morality in practical reasoning
(Brink 1989; Wolf 1982, 1992). If moral considerations dominated
practical reasoning – if, that is, they were the only or at any rate
by far the most significant considerations in determining our actions
– then consequentialism would be untenable, on account of its
demanding too much. But when put in their proper place then in the
larger scheme of practical reasons and requirements, the extreme
demands of consequentialist morality will no longer seem threatening.
To borrow a pair of phrases from David Brink, what appear to be
‘moral worries’ about the tendency of consequentialism to make
excessive moral demands, might really be ‘worries about morality’
– worries, that is, about whether or not we have reason to act as
morality requires. Whether the view of morality presupposed by this
strategy is true, however, is questionable; at the very least, it does
not seem to be the case that the majority of those who have defended
consequentialism as a normative theory of ethics have intended it to
be viewed as a theory that could be frequently or easily overridden or
ignored (see Railton 1984, Miller 1992 Chapter 10, Jollimore 2001
Chapter 3).</p>

<p>
The third strategy is perhaps the best known and most frequently
employed. It is argued that, given a reasonable and accurate view of
human nature and the abilities of agents, it will be seen that what
consequentialism requires is <em>not</em> a radically different sort
of life from the one most of us currently live; rather,
consequentialism will require (in most cases, at least) only
reasonable, and relatively minor, adjustments in our current
lifestyles. In particular, it is argued that consequentialism permits
the agent both to give preference to her own projects and concerns,
and to favor particular other individuals (friends, family members,
etc.), and that all this is consistent with the agent’s having
as her overriding project the maximizing of the good. The <em>locus
classicus</em> of this argument is found in Mill’s
<em>Utilitarianism:</em></p>

<blockquote>
The objectors to utilitarianism cannot always be charged with
representing it in a discreditable light. On the contrary, those among
them who entertain anything like a just idea of its disinterested
character, sometimes find fault with its standard as being too high
for humanity. They say it is exacting too much to require that people
shall always act from the inducement of promoting the general
interests of society. But this is to mistake the very meaning of a
standard of morals, and to confound the rule of action with the motive
of it […] The great majority of good actions are intended, not
for the benefit of the world, but for that of individuals, of which
the good of the world is made up; and the thoughts of the most
virtuous man need not on these occasions travel beyond the particular
persons concerned, except so far as is necessary to assure himself
that in benefiting them he is not violating the rights – that
is, the legitimate and authorized expectations – of any one
else. The multiplication of happiness is, according to the utilitarian
ethics, the object of virtue: the occasions on which any person
(except one in a thousand) has it in his power to do this on an
extended scale, in other words, to be a public benefactor, are but
exceptional; and on these occasions alone is he called on to consider
public utility; in every other case, private utility, the interest or
happiness of some few persons, is all he has to attend to. (Mill 1992
[1861], pp. 64–66.)
</blockquote>

<p>
Even Godwin (1801 [1968]) endorses a version of this argument, writing
that</p>

<blockquote>
True wisdom will recommend to us individual attachments […]
since it is the object of virtue to produce happiness; and since the
man who lives in the midst of domestic relations will have many
opportunities of conferring pleasure, minute in the detail, yet not
trivial in the amount. (Quoted in Cannold, <em>et al</em>., 1995)
</blockquote>

<p>
(This position, it will be noted, appears to be in some amount of
tension with the more extreme consequentialist position attributed to
Godwin in section 2.3). </p>

<p>
More recent versions of this argument follow Mill’s basic
strategy. Peter Railton (1984) argues that a ‘sophisticated’
consequentialist will develop patterns of decision-making that do not,
except on rare occasions, refer explicitly to consequentialist aims
and goals, and that both the psychology and the outward behavior of
such an individual will be similar to that of the typical
non-consequentialist. Similarly, Frank Jackson (1991) argues that the
most efficient strategy for a dedicated consequentialist is to
concentrate on small groups of particular persons, rather than trying
to promote the well-being of humanity at large, and that this will
involve the formation of close personal relationships with other
individuals. Others who have deployed versions of this argument
include Bales (1971), Brink (1989), and Pettit &amp; Brennan
(1986).</p>

<p>
The evaluation of this consequentialist strategy is a difficult issue.
Consequentialists are surely correct to point out that obsessive
consequentialist strategizing is likely, at a certain point, to turn
counter-productive, and that a consequentialist agent is therefore
well-advised to develop more moderate approaches. On the other hand,
Mill and many other consequentialists seem to underestimate the amount
of good that a dedicated consequentialist agent might be able to
contribute, and thus, to underestimate the amount of good that she
will be required to contribute. Moreover, our powers to influence the
lives of strangers have increased considerably since Mill’s day.
As Susan Wolf writes, “[T]his argument is simply unconvincing in
light of the empirical circumstances of our world. The gain in
happiness that would accrue to oneself and one’s neighbors by a
more well-rounded, richer life than that of the moral saint would be
pathetically small in comparison to the amount by which one could
increase the general happiness if one devoted oneself explicitly to
the care of the sick, the downtrodden, the starving, and the
homeless” (Wolf 1982, p. 428; see also Singer 1972). This thought is
borne out by the empirical facts. If we look at the lives of actual
‘effective altruists,’ who are motivated by a commitment to make
as great a contribution to general well-being as possible, we find
that such people have indeed found it necessary to transform their
lives in fairly radical ways and to make large sacrifices in terms of
time, money, and comfort, and often in terms of relationships and
personal happiness (see examples in MacFarquhar 2015).</p>

<p>
Moreover, even if a theory such as Railton’s sophisticated
consequentialism can allow a sophisticated consequentialist agent to
sometimes knowingly bring about less than maximally good consequences,
such a theory must nonetheless insist that each particular act of
doing so is indeed morally wrong – an insistence which seems contrary
to our moral intuitions (Jollimore 2001). It is not clear, then, that
an appeal to the limits of human powers can succeed in converting what
is a fundamentally radical moral theory into a comfortably
conservative one.</p>

<h3><a name="ConImpJus">3.3 Consequentialist impartiality and justice</a></h3>

<p>
In addition to claiming that consequentialist impartiality is too
demanding, many critics have also argued that it is too permissive.
Since consequentialism makes the permissibility of an action entirely
dependent on the value of that action’s consequences, it follows
that there is no <em>type</em> of action that can be prohibited on
consequentialist grounds (except, of course, for that
‘type’ which is defined explicitly in terms of sub-optimal
consequences.) Thus instances of torture, premeditated murder, rape,
and other violations of fundamental human rights are at least
potentially justifiable on a consequentialist basis; no such action
can be ruled out, morally speaking, until the comparative value of the
state of affairs it will bring about has been determined.</p>

<p>
The effect of this complaint, like the previous one, is not to deny
the claim that consequentialism is a deeply impartial moral theory,
but rather to suggest that it incorporates the wrong sort of
impartiality. Suppose, to take an example common in the literature,
that consequentialism recommends that an man be convicted of, and
punished for, a crime he did not commit, in order to prevent the
public from rioting (Nielsen 1972). Such an action would, according to
common intuitions, constitute a gross violation of justice; and it
seems a weak reply to point out that the recommendation was arrived at
through an impartial calculation – a calculation that took the
interests of every individual (including the framed man) into equal
account. For while the claim is, strictly speaking, true, there is
nevertheless a clear and compelling case in favor of concluding that
the framed man was <em>not</em> treated impartially, in the sense that
ought to matter here. We expect a judicial system to allocate
punishments in accordance with degree of guilt, not in accordance with
the expected value to society of the consequences in each case; and
the fact that both methods constitute forms of impartial
decision-making does not imply that they are equally morally
acceptable.</p>

<p>
Again, the classic response to this objection dates back to
Mill’s Utilitarianism (1992 [1861]). If institutions of justice
are to be given a general justification, Mill argues, this
justification must find its ultimate grounding in utility to society;
for what else could explain why justice is valued at all, other than
the fact that it serves and protects our interests? But since a
justice system will only succeed in this role if it is governed by
common principles of justice – principles including, for instance,
that only the guilty should be punished, and that the punishment ought
to be proportional to the crime – it follows that such principles are
not opposed to consequentialism at all. Rather, at the deepest
justificatory level, consequentialism and the demands of justice
coincide. (See also Neilsen 1972) </p>

<p>
The claim that such a coincidence generally obtains is probably easy
to establish. The challenge for Mill, and for other consequentialists,
arises in those particular cases in which the coincidence fails.
Assuming that the possibility of such cases does not move one to
simply abandon consequentialism in favor of some more justice-friendly
conception (such as the rule consequentialism Mill himself sometimes
seems to find attractive), there are two general defense strategies
for consequentialists to employ. The first strategy argues that there
are good consequentialist reasons for being the sort of agent who
respects the dictates of justice even in cases in which the
coincidence between the demands of justice and those of
consequentialism fails (Pettit 1997; cf. Railton 1986). The second
strategy admits that there are cases in which unjust actions can be
given a consequentialist justification, but holds that when so much as
it stake, justice must give way to consequentialism’s demands
(Smart 1973; Kagan 1989; Pettit 1997). Whether either approach is
sufficient, given the apparent depth and force of our common
intuitions about the requirements of justice, is a matter of ongoing
debate.</p>

<h2><a name="MorImp2DeoMorThe">4. Moral impartiality II: Deontological moral theories</a></h2>

<h3><a name="DeoImpPerPoiVie">4.1 Deontological impartiality and the personal point of view</a></h3>

<p>
In section 3.2 we noted that while consequentialist impartiality is
one possible interpretation of the demand that morality be impartial,
it is not by any means the only available interpretation; nor is it
clearly the most plausible. The considerations related to justice
discussed in section 3.3 may help us to appreciate this. For consider
once more the position of the framed innocent, whose fundamental
interests have been sacrificed for the sake of the greater good. Such
a person may well complain that he has <em>not</em> been treated
impartially, in the appropriate sense; for, while it is true that his
interests were counted in determining the nature of the overall good,
it is nevertheless also true that ultimately, he became the victim of
a form of abuse that was both harsh and undeserved. The framed
innocent might also back up his complaint by making the plausible
claim that, had he been in a position to choose, he would never have
consented to a moral system that allowed <em>anyone</em> to be
accorded such treatment. Thus, while there is a sense in which his
interests were counted equally, there is another and very important
sense in which his interests – and perhaps more importantly, his
claims and rights – do not seem to have received full or
adequate consideration at all.</p>

<p>
Many deontologists insist that consequentialism errs by failing to
accord proper significance to the moral agent as an individual; in
John Rawls’ words, consequentialism “does not take
seriously the distinction between persons” (Rawls 1971, section
5). (Rawls has utilitarianism in particular as his target, but the
point applies more widely.) Similarly, Samuel Scheffler has suggested
that “for human beings as creatures with values, the normative
force of certain forms of partiality is nearly unavoidable. If that is
right, then for morality to reject partiality in a general or
systematic way would be for it to set itself against our nature as
valuing creatures. And that, I believe, would make morality an
incoherent enterprise” (Scheffler 2010).)</p>

<p>
Thus, the fact that consequentialist impartiality makes extraordinary
and, to many, unreasonable demands on the individual (section 3.2)
might be taken to indicate that consequentialism fails to take
individuals seriously as <em>agents</em>. At the same time, the fact
that consequentialist impartiality permits the individual to be used
as a mere means when doing so promotes the greater good (section
3.3)might indicate that consequentialism fails to take individuals
seriously as <em>patients</em>. The conception of impartiality that
tends to be favored by deontologists avoids such implications by
refusing to view impartial action simply as a matter of maximizing
interests (or some other version of the impersonally determined good.)
Indeed, deontologists take <em>the right</em> rather than <em>the
good</em> to be fundamental to ethics, and tend to see moral action in
terms of acting in accordance with principles that are rationally
acceptable to all.</p>

<p>
Exactly what these principles are, and exactly what method should be
used to determine them, are matters of some disagreement among
deontological theorists. But there does seem to be a general consensus
among deontologists that moral impartiality does <em>not</em> require
that an agent be strictly neutral between her own good and the good of
other people in ordinary decision-making contexts. Rather, an agent is
permitted on deontological views to give special attention to her own
projects and interests. An important distinction can be drawn here
between first-order and second-order impartiality (Barry 1995; see
also Hooker 2010). First-order impartiality is that displayed by an
agent in ordinary choice situations – choosing how to spend
one’s day, who to spend time with, and so forth. Second-order
impartiality, by contrast, operates only in a certain, special sort of
context: contexts in which the rules, principles and institutions
which govern first-order behavior are evaluated and selected. Thus a
moral rule granting individuals complete freedom of association, and
thus allowing them to display first-order partiality by spending time
with whomever they please regardless of whether doing so promotes the
greater social good in any particular case, might be given a
second-order impartialist justification by demonstrating that such a
rule would promote the impersonal good, or that it would be selected
by a group of impartial persons who were choosing the moral rules that
were to govern society.</p>

<p>
The fact that deontological theories generally permit (some degree of)
first-order partiality – that is, that agents are permitted to
pay special attention to their own interests, projects, and loved ones
– should not, then, be taken to imply either that the
agent’s interests are <em>objectively</em> more valuable than
those of other persons, or that the agent is justified in viewing them
as such. Rather, the deontologist will claim, it reflects the fact
that it is morally legitimate (perhaps, again, because justifiable in
second-order impartialist terms) for an agent to regard her own goals
and interests as especially important <em>to her</em>. Thus,
deontological moral systems tend to incorporate an irreducible element
of agent-relativity of a sort that consequentialist theories cannot
embody (Nagel 1986; McNaughton &amp; Rawling 1992, 1993, 1998;
Jollimore 2001; Kamm 2007 ).</p>

<p>
The incorporation of agent-relativity of this sort into deontological
theories allows such theories to escape the most straightforward
versions of the claim that they demand too much of moral agents.
Nevertheless, various versions of that objection have been leveled
against deontological theories. It has been claimed, for instance,
that Kantianism, by insisting that only actions performed out of the
motive of duty have moral worth, delegitimizes or even forbids the
type of motives which typically (and perhaps necessarily) operate in
the context of close personal relationships (Stocker 1976; Williams;
1981). Typically, Kantians have responded by distancing themselves
from the view that <em>only</em> actions motivated by duty have value,
and acknowledging instead that a commitment to duty need only function
as a limiting condition, rather than as the primary source of
motivation in all cases (Baron 1995). The Kantian account of moral
value, of course, is not essential to deontological theories; and
those theories which eschew it may well be able to avoid the
demandingness objection altogether.</p>

<h3><a name="ImpUni">4.2 Impartiality and universalizability</a></h3>

<p>
On many deontological views, particularly Kantian ones, the
significance of moral impartiality is seen as arising from the fact
that a core role is given to the concept of universalizability (Gert
1998; Hare 1981; Kant 1964 [1785]; Kohlberg 1979). The requirement
that moral judgments be universalizable is, roughly, the requirement
that such judgments be independent of any particular point of view.
Thus, an agent who judges that <em>A</em> ought morally to do
<em>X</em> in situation <em>S</em> ought to be willing to endorse the
same judgment whether she herself happens to be <em>A</em>, or some
other individual involved in the situation (someone who, perhaps, will
be directly affected by <em>A</em>’s actions), or an entirely
neutral observer. Her particular identity is completely irrelevant in
the determination of the correctness or appropriateness of the
judgment.</p>

<p>
Universalizability, thus formulated, does imply at least one sort of
impartiality: an agent whose judgments are universalizable will be
morally consistent, in the sense that she will judge her own actions
by the same standards she applies to others. Such an agent will not
make an exception of herself by allowing herself to break a rule she
regards as binding for others, or to perform any other action which
she would not accept if performed by another agent. Impartiality of
this sort, however, does not necessarily imply any sort of
impartiality with respect to other individuals’ interests,
rights, or claims. On a minimally demanding interpretation of the
universalizability requirement, the judgments made by a person whose
conception of the good was intrinsically racist – that is, a
person who held that the well-being of members of some one particular
race mattered more (or less), objectively speaking, than the
well-being of members of other races – could very well turn out
to be universalizable, so long as the racist held that his judgments
were objectively correct, and so ought to be assented to by all
individuals – including those individuals who would be
disadvantaged by the general adoption of those views (cf. Gewirth
1978, p. 164; Gert 1998, Chapter 6; Wiggins 1978; Williams 1985, p.
115).</p>

<p>
However, the conclusion that the racist’s judgments are
universalizable presupposes a very minimal account of what
universalizability requires. On this account, it requires only that an
agent be sincerely committed to the objectivity of his judgments, in
the sense that he views them (from his current perspective) as correct
from all perspectives, and thus as calling for everyone’s assent
(whether or not that assent is actually given.) There are two ways of
making the universalizability requirement more demanding. The first is
to appeal to certain counterfactual claims about what the agent
<em>would</em> endorse if he actually <em>did</em> occupy various
perspectives. On this view, a particular judgment by <em>A</em> is
universalizable if and only if <em>A</em> endorses that judgment from
his current perspective, <em>and would endorse the same judgment from
any other perspective</em>. Given this understanding of
universalizability, it is much less likely – indeed,
extraordinarily unlikely – that racist views will turn out to be
universalizable; for it is not generally true of individuals that they
would endorse the view “The well-being of members of race
<em>R</em> matters less than the well-being of members of other
races” if they themselves were members of race <em>R</em>.
However, such a view may well require too much, for there are few if
any moral judgments or principles that would be endorsed from
<em>every</em> perspective any given agent might occupy.</p>

<p>
A different approach to universalizability eschews the appeal to
psychological facts altogether, and holds that whether or not a
particular judgment is universalizable is a logical fact rather than a
psychological one. Kant’s categorical imperative test, for
example, holds that universalizability is the distinguishing feature
of correct moral judgments, and that a judgment is universalizable if
and only if it can, without contradiction, be willed as a universal
practical law (Kant 1964 [1785]). Since the test hinges on whether the
willing of a judgment as a universal law results in a
<em>contradiction</em>, it follows that whether or not a judgment
<em>is</em> universalizable in this way is a matter of practical
reason, and does not depend on which particular individual’s
will happens to be involved.</p>

<p>
The types of impartiality implied by both of these more demanding
versions of the universalizability requirement are likely to be
considerably more substantial than the formal consistency required by
the minimal version. Kant, for instance, seems to hold that
universalizability implies a certain level of altruism or charity, in
the form of the imperfect duties we owe towards other individuals.
There are problems, however, with Kant’s argument for this. In
particular, it is not clear just how the universal willing of a maxim
such as “When others are in need of help, I always ignore their
needs” give rise to any sort of <em>contradiction</em>. It is
true, of course, that, were we actually in a position to choose the
universal maxims on which all rational persons would act, this would
be a poor choice, for we might someday be in need of assistance from
another. But to say that the willing of this maxim as a universal law
would be <em>imprudent</em> is not to say that doing so is
<em>contradictory</em>. Moreover, as David Wiggins (1978) points out,
certain other actions that seem as if they ought to be morally
permissible – the act, for instance, of releasing a debtor from
his debt out of generosity – have maxims that seem to fail the
universalizability test so conceived. These examples may point to a
general problem with the attempt to derive impartiality from
universalizability: whereas the latter, at least on a Kantian
interpretation, is a formal property of moral judgments, moral
impartiality, as we have seen, is a substantive rather than a formal
concept. (See Herman 1993 and Korsgaard 1996 for attempts to respond
to these problems.)</p>

<p>
It should be mentioned that some moral theorists have attempted to
derive various versions of consequentialist impartiality more or less
directly from the universalizability requirement (Hare 1981, Pettit
2000; see also Harsanyi 1982). However, the claim that a conception of
impartiality that is not only substantive but also extraordinarily
demanding can be derived from a requirement which, as just pointed
out, is essentially a formal one, continues to strike a majority of
moral philosophers as dubious.</p>

<h3><a name="ConModDeoImp">4.3 Contractualist models of deontological impartiality</a></h3>

<p>
The requirement that moral judgements be universalizable seems to
reflect two fundamental moral insights: first, that morality is
objective, and not simply a matter of personal opinion or expression
of interest and desire; and second, that from the standpoint of
morality, each person matters just as much as, and no more than, any
other person. The <em>contractualis</em>t approach to moral theorizing
provides one method of giving expression to these fundamental ideas
about morality.</p>

<p>
Contractualism borrows from the social contract tradition the idea
that morality may be viewed as the result of an agreement between
those who are to be bound by its dictates. Two variants of this
approach can be distinguished. The former, sometimes referred to as
<em>contractarianism</em>, identifies the participants in the
bargaining process with actual individuals, and thus is broadly
historical. The latter approach, by contrast, appeals to what agents
<em>would</em> choose under various, quite possibly unrealizable
conditions, and is thus <em>hypothetical</em> rather than historical.
It is the latter approach that will concern us here.</p>

<p>
The hypothetical contractualist model, then, regards moral principles
as the result of a bargaining process among a group of agents, subject
to certain restrictions that are specified so as to guarantee that the
chosen principles will meet the demands of second-order impartiality.
The most famous example of this approach is John Rawls’
‘veil of ignorance’, as described in (Rawls 1971).
According to Rawls, the principles of a just society are those that
would be chosen by self-interested rational agents in the
‘original position’ – a position in which agents
possess broad knowledge about human history and the nature of the
world they live in, but are denied specific information regarding
their own particular identities or prospects in the society in
question, the nature of that society, and, crucially, the nature of
their own particular conception of the good. Since nobody knows who
they will be or what social position they will occupy, there is no
opportunity for anyone in an advantaged position to take advantage of
that position in order to force a less privileged party to concede to
an otherwise unacceptable outcome. It is this fact that allows Rawls
to claim that principles chosen under the veil of ignorance are
guaranteed to be impartially acceptable to all – and thus,
guaranteed not to be unjust.</p>

<p>
It should be noted that Rawls does not intend that morality in its
entirely be derived from the original position. Rather, the function
of the original position is limited to the choice of the most general
principles of social justice in a well-ordered society (Rawls 1971,
section 2; 2001, section 12). Nevertheless, Rawls’ mechanism is
intended to draw the broad outlines of what many see as the most
important part of morality: its public or political aspect. By viewing
political morality as the result of an agreement between contractors
limited by the strictures of the veil of ignorance, Rawls intends to
develop a political philosophy that reflects his commitment to the
idea of liberal neutrality: the idea, that is, that each person has a
private right to her own conception of the good, and that particular
conceptions of the good therefore ought not to be legislatively
instituted, nor legislated against.</p>

<p>
An especially difficult task attending a project of this sort is that
of determining what shape this political morality will take –
that is, determining which principles would be chosen by agents in the
original position. On Rawls’ account, the contractors settle on
principles that guaranteed as much liberty as possible for all and,
within the limits set by this guarantee, a roughly egalitarian
distribution of goods in which inequalities are allowed only if they
are to the benefit of the worst off (Rawls 1971, section 11; 2001,
Part II). The claim that such principles would recognize all persons
as equals – and thus, their claim to reflect the demands of
moral impartiality – is supported by several considerations, of
which three are perhaps most significant: first, that all persons are
guaranteed equal (and substantial) civil liberties; second, that the
resulting allocation of resources is broadly egalitarian, and in
particular, ensures, so far as is possible, that the fundamental needs
of all persons are met; and third, that since the only inequalities
that are permitted are those that would benefit the least advantaged,
it can presumably be assumed that the least advantaged would give
their assent to the existence of such inequalities (they would not,
even if they could, veto the system.)</p>

<p>
In Rawls’ scheme, the function of the veil of ignorance is
necessary to prevent rational self-interested persons from using their
knowledge of their own positions to win unfair advantages over others.
(Whether such an approach can provide genuine impartiality between
competing conceptions of the good is a difficult question that will be
further considered in section 5.) An alternative approach abandons
both the veil of ignorance and the assumption that the bargaining
parties are primarily self-interested. This is the strategy favored by
T.M. Scanlon, whose contractors are motivated not by self-interest but
by ‘the desire for reasonable agreement’ (Scanlon 1982, p.
115 n. 10; see also Scanlon 1978, 1998; Barry 1995). On the resulting
account of moral permissibility, “an act is wrong if its
performance under the circumstances would be disallowed by any system
of rules for the general regulation of behavior which no one could
reasonably reject as a basis for informed, unforced general
agreement.” (Scanlon, 1982, p. 110) The requirement of
impartiality is captured here by the basic fact that the question is
whether <em>everyone</em> who is to live under the selected rules can
reasonably accept them. As in Rawls’ theory, however, the
principles of second-order impartiality accepted at the contract level
allow for considerable first-order partiality at the level of
agent-choice.</p>

<p>
Harsanyi (1977) argues that a version of utilitarianism can be
defended on the basis of an ‘equiprobability model,’
according to which an agent ought to choose between social systems
“under the assumption that, in either system, he would have the
same probability of occupying any one of the available social
positions” (Harsanyi 1982, p. 45; cf. Hare 1981). Gert (1998)
argues for a list of moral rules which “all impartial rational
persons would favor including […] as part of the moral
system” (p. 158). Gauthier (1986) defends a contemporary version
of contractarianism.</p>

<h2><a name="ObjTraConMorImp">5. Impartiality: Its demands and scope</a></h2>

<h3><a name="CogImpImp">5.1 The cognitive impossibility of impartiality</a></h3>

<p>
In addition to objections directed specifically toward
consequentialist or deontological conceptions of impartiality, there
are also objections aimed at the very idea that impartiality ought to
be viewed as fundamental to morality. Some would argue that
impartiality, as conceived by traditional ethical theories, makes
extraordinary and unreasonable cognitive demands on moral agents. This
worry must be distinguished from the objection to consequentialist
impartiality considered earlier, which claimed that the
<em>sacrifices</em> demanded by consequentialist impartiality were
unreasonable and excessive. The objection now being considered is not
that impartiality asks the agent to give up too much, but rather that
the cognitive feats demanded by these moral theories will exceed the
capacity of the typical moral agent. Indeed, one popular version of
this objection alleges that an agent will require an unreasonable
amount of knowledge or cognitive ability simply to be able to identify
what the demands of impartiality <em>are</em> (Friedman 1989; Walker
1991). Given the conception of the impartial point of view as a
‘God’s eye’ point of view, for example (Baier 1958),
it seems questionable whether it is ever reasonable to expect a human
moral agent to be able to occupy such a perspective. God, quite
obviously, possesses far more knowledge than does any human being;
moreover, God’s point of view is both objective and impersonal
in ways that an individual human’s perspective cannot be. (As
Margaret Urban Walker points out, it is often said that human beings
have to live with their decisions, but it sounds very odd to say that
of God (Walker 1991, p. 765).) </p>

<p>
Similar remarks apply to the conception of the impartial point of view
as ‘the point of view of the universe’ (Sidgwick 1907), to
Hare’s conception of the ideal moral agent as a so-called
‘archangel’ (Hare, 1981), and, Walker claims, to
Firth’s conception of the ideal impartial observer (Firth,
1952.) Similarly, Marilyn Friedman points out that even if a person
did manage to occupy such a point of view for a period of time –
supposing such a thing to be possible – there would be no way to
be certain that she had successfully done so: standard conceptions of
impartiality, she claims, prescribe “methods of normative
thinking [which] represent psychological and epistemic feats, the
achievement of which we have no independent way to confirm”
(Friedman 1991, p. 645).</p>

<h3><a name="ImpImpInd">5.2 Impartiality, Impersonality, and Indifference</a></h3>

<p>
A second objection to traditional conceptions of moral impartiality
finds fault with the traditional tendency to define impartiality in
negative or abstract terms – in terms, that is, of which
elements must be <em>absent</em> from the psychology of the agent, or
which we must <em>pretend</em> are absent in the process of
idealization. M.C. Henberg, for instance, claims that most if not all
procedural accounts of impartiality confuse it with distinterest or
impersonality, and thus, ultimately, with indifference. (It should be
noted that many impartialists are quite explicit about the link
between morality, impartiality, and the lack of emotion; Baier (1958),
for instance, writes that “the moral point of view [is] that of
an independent, unbiased, impartial, objective, dispassionate,
disinterested observer” (p. 201; see also Firth 1952).)
Similarly, Richard Brandt argues that it is a mistake to define moral
impartiality with reference to an ideal observer who is defined as
(among other things) distinterested; for after all, “it is not
clear that a purely disinterested being would support a moral system
at all” (Brandt 1979, p. 227). While Brandt’s complaint is
particularly directed at the ideal observer theory of (Firth 1952),
this objection seems to apply much more broadly; it is obvious, for
instance, that Rawls’s veil of ignorance is designed precisely
to prevent the contractors from acting in an interested manner.</p>

<p>
The problem is not only that impersonal persons of this sort are
likely to suffer from massive indifference, but also that there is
alleged to be a conceptual difficulty with the very idea of conceiving
impartiality in such terms. An abstract or impersonal evaluator, it is
argued, could not possibly make reliable judgments about substantive
moral matters (whether or not he was motivated to), since he would be
unable to appreciate the particular concerns of the contesting
parties. Both of these difficulties – the motivational and the
cognitive – are well expressed by Iris Marion Young, who rejects
altogether the idea that morality is primarily a matter of
impartiality:</p>

<blockquote>
The ideal of impartiality is an idealist fiction. It is impossible to
adopt an unsituated point of view, and if a point of view is situated,
it cannot stand apart from and understand all points of view. It is
impossible to reason about substantive moral issues without
understanding their substance, which always presupposes some
particular social and historical context; and one has no motive for
making moral judgments and resolving moral dilemmas unless the outcome
matters, unless one has a particular and passionate interest in the
outcome […] when class, race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, and
age define different social locations, one subject cannot fully
empathize with another in a different social location, adopt her point
of view; if that were possible then the social locations would not be
different. (Young 1990, pp. 104–5; cf. Benhabib 1987, p. 90)
</blockquote>

<p>
However, one could endorse certain forms of skepticism about naive
interpretations of impartiality without wholeheartedly rejecting
impartiality as either unrealistic or undesirable. The literature on
implicit bias, which has received considerable attention in the past
few years, has important implications for this set of issues. On the
one hand, empirical investigations into implicit bias strongly suggest
that, given how deep our biases tend to run (and how unaware we often
are of the strength and nature of those biases), absolute impartiality
must be viewed as an unattainable ideal.  (Indeed, people may often
believe, with some justification, that they are being impartial when
in fact they are not. They may, for instance, consciously adhere to a
set of principles, procedures, or categories, that are themselves
impartial in nature, while failing to realize that in judging how
those principles are to be applied, who is to be assigned to which
category, etc., they are under the influence of unconscious
prejudice.) At the same time, however, making people more aware of the
nature and influence of implicit bias tends to increase, rather than
decrease, concern with impartiality. Although perfect impartiality is
indeed an impossible ideal, it seems highly plausible that it
nonetheless represents, at least in those contexts in which implicit
bias can lead to unfair or undesirable results, an ideal worth
striving for.</p>

<h3><a name="OpeCloImp">5.3 Open and Closed Impartiality</a></h3>

<p>
A further issue involves the scope of impartiality: who gets included
in the community with respect to which we are attempting to judge
impartially? As noted above, liberal theorists often tend to
conceptualize impartiality using the model of a social contract. If
society is pictured as the result of a hypothetical agreement between
persons, each of whom is equally empowered to revoke the agreement,
then it stands to reason that the resulting set of rules must in some
sense be acceptable to all, and must embody, in some deep way, the
ideal of equal respect. Some have complained, however, that this
approach risks leaving those not party to the contract out in the
cold. But surely it is plausible to think that a society, in order to
be just, must not only treat (and avoid treating) <em>its own</em>
citizens in certain ways, but must also respect certain rules
regarding its behavior towards members of other societies. As Charles
Jones (1999) writes, “Unlike Rawls … I see no reason to
restrict our moral focus to the basic structure of any particular
nation-state; on the contrary, if one’s concern is with the
justifiability of the institutions which determine people’s life
chances, there are compelling grounds for taking a wider view.”
</p>

<p>
Amartya Sen (2002) draws a distinction between ‘open’ and
‘closed’ impartiality, which “turns on whether or
not the exercise of impartial assessment is confined … to a
fixed group.” Since the contractors behind the veil of ignorance
are aware that they are part of a certain society (and do not see
themselves in any sense as representing the world as a whole), the
veil of ignorance represents an impartial system only in the closed
sense. Therefore, Sen complains that “As a device of structured
political analysis, the procedure is not geared to addressing the need
to overcome group prejudices.” By contrast, open impartiality,
which Sen finds recommended in the works of Adam Smith (see Smith
1759), demands “that the viewpoints of others, whether or not
belonging to some group of which one is specifically a member, receive
adequate attention.”</p>

<p>
There are various responses open to Rawlsian theorists. Rawls himself
suggests that we imagine a second veil of ignorance behind which
representatives of various societies can meet in order to set fair and
impartial ground rules for international relations. Much like justice
within states, Rawls writes, “Justice between states is
determined by the principles that would be chosen in the original
position so interpreted. These principles are political principles,
for they govern public policies toward other nations.” (Rawls
1971) Such a position, of course, will not satisfy everyone, and some
critics worry that reiterating the veil of ignorance on the
international level will simply reiterate its more problematic
elements in a wider scale. Nonetheless, it is important to keep in
mind that the objection, here, is not to impartiality itself, but to a
particular version of it. Indeed, what critics such as Sen and Jones
are really claiming, of course, is that the framework Rawls provides
is not impartial <em>enough</em>.</p>

<h3><a name="LibNeuJusImp">5.4 Liberalism, Neutrality, and the Justification of Impartiality</a></h3>

<p>
If genuine impartiality is an illusion, as Young alleges, then
impartialists may be suspected in smuggling in their own substantive
moral positions and biases under the guise of neutrality.
Rawls’s use of the veil of ignorance, for example, has been
criticized by Thomas Nagel and others on the basis that, by requiring
that agents lack knowledge of their conceptions of the good (a
necessary stipulation of the bargainers are to achieve a consensus),
the veil of ignorance excludes from the original position information
that is morally relevant, and indeed may put some of the bargainers at
a disadvantage. “The original position,” Nagel writes,
“seems to presuppose not just a neutral theory of the good, but
a liberal, individualistic conception according to which the best that
can be wished for someone is the unimpeded pursuit of his own path,
provided it does not interfere with the rights of others” (Nagel
1973; see also Teitelman 1972; Schwartz 1973; Sandel 1982; Benhabib
1987). Such a conception, it is held, clearly does favor some
conceptions of the good over others: in particular, atomic,
individualistic conceptions focusing on personal fulfillment
(constituted, perhaps, through the acquisition of consumer goods) are
privileged over more communal or social ideals that focus on
solidarity and mutual interaction between persons (Sandel 1982; cf.
O’Neill 1997, Chapter 1).</p>

<p>
Feminist critics have paid particular attention to the ways in which
liberal conceptions of neutrality and impartiality presuppose and
reinforce traditional male-dominated, individualistic approaches to
moral theory, and in doing so reinforce the social status quo
(Gilligan 1982; Noddings 1984; Benhabib 1987; Young 1990). As Benhabib
has pointed out, “Universalistic moral theories in the Western
tradition from Hobbes to Rawls are <em>substitutionalist</em>, in the
sense that the universalism they defend is defined surreptitiously by
identifying the experiences of a specific group of subjects as the
paradigmatic case of the human as such. These subjects are invariably
white, male adults who are propertied or at least professional.”
(Benhabib 1987, p. 81) As a result, the dominant social positions of
such parties tend to be protected and even enhanced in the social and
political theories resulting from such allegedly neutral liberal
theories.</p>

<p>
The problem of neutrality is a pressing one for liberals: given the
importance to their view of the thought that an impartial government
must be neutral between various moral conceptions (it must, that is,
respect what Rawls calls ‘the fact of pluralism’), it is
essential to show that liberal impartialism does not simply represent
another such moral conception (or ‘sectarian view’) in its
own right. Liberal impartialism, then, must turn out to be a framework
that can be agreed to by all relevant parties, even as they continue
to disagree regarding particular substantive moral issues.</p>

<p>
How is the liberal to establish this? Nagel (1987) endorses what he
calls ‘epistemological restraint,’ which holds that it can
be reasonable for an individual to hold certain beliefs yet
simultaneously unreasonable to attempt to decide matters of public
policy on the basis of such beliefs. Such beliefs, which tend to be
moral or religious in nature, are said to be viewed differently from
the inside (from which standpoint they have perfect authority) than
from the outside (from which standpoint they are regarded as
questionable). The difficulty, as Barry (1995) and Raz (1990) have
pointed out, is to explain why doubts visible from the outside would
not infect the internal point of view, thus weakening these
beliefs’ internal authority as well. (It should be noted that
Nagel himself has expressed doubts about this argument in Nagel
1991.)</p>

<p>
Rawls’s view appears to be similar to Nagel’s (and thus,
subject to the same difficulty). According to Rawls, to endorse a view
of justice is not to claim that it is true; moreover, the
acceptability of liberal impartialism is not to be derived from its
truth; rather, such a view will be accepted (it is to be hoped)
because, in societies of the relevant sort, it will form a common
element (an ‘overlapping consensus’) in the various
competing conceptions of the good that occupy the public sphere (Rawls
1993). (Again, the criticisms contained in Raz 1990 are especially
trenchant.)</p>

<p>
While both Nagel and Rawls explicitly reject the idea that liberal
impartialism is to be justified on the basis of skepticism toward
various conceptions of the good, Barry (1995) explicitly endorses this
form of justification. (Barry emphasizes that the relevant form of
skepticism does not involve eschewing one’s moral and religious
beliefs, but rather rejecting the claim to be <em>certain</em> of the
truth of those beliefs.) This approach has been criticized on the
basis that such skepticism itself constitutes a sectarian view, and
therefore is not neutral (Larmore 1987, Mendus 2002) However, as Barry
points out, the decisive issue is not whether some people would reject
skepticism, but whether it can <em>reasonably</em> be rejected –
and given Barry’s definition of skepticism, its claim to resist
being so rejected seems considerably stronger than the claims of the
various conceptions of the good themselves, which must indeed be
excluded from the public sphere.</p>

<h2><a name="ParImp">6. Partiality and Impartiality</a></h2>

<h3><a name="JusPar">6.1 The Justification of Partiality</a></h3>

<p>
While some philosophers reject the moral significance of partiality
altogether, holding that morality is both fundamentally and thoroughly
impartial, many agree with Nagel (1991) that morality includes both
partial and impartial elements. A good deal of recent philosophical
discussion has concerned the following question: where partiality is
justified, what justifies it?</p>

<p>
One influential account of partiality’s justification appeals to
the value of personal projects. Since personal projects and/or the
ability to pursue personal projects are important, and since agents
who were required to be completely impartial in every aspect of life
would be unable to pursue such projects, we should allow that people
are not required to be absolutely impartial in every aspect of
life. Bernard Williams (1981) famously argues that at least some of an
agent’s projects – he calls them “ground
projects” – are fundamental components of the
agent’s identity, and an agent who gives them up, because she is
required to do so by morality, or for any other reason, will find
herself with no reason to be moral, to go on living, or to do anything
at all. Other philosophers, including Wolf (1992; see also 1982),
MacIntyre (1984), Sandel (1982), and Stroud (2010) also base the
justification of partiality on the value and significance of personal
projects and commitments. (For Sandel and MacIntyre this means,
largely, commitments to the political community that has formed
one’s identity and to which one owes one’s
allegiance.)</p>

<p>
A second possible account sees our personal relationships as the
source of partiality’s justification. Kolodny (2003) argues that
personal relationships bear “final value” and that this grounds
special obligations toward those people to whom we are related.
Similarly, Scheffler (2004), argues that valuing a relationship
non-instrumentally necessarily involves seeing it as giving rise to
certain reasons that will be partial in nature. A variation on this
sort of view agrees that relationships are significant but suggests
that we should view reasons, rather than value, as fundamental. On
such views our reasons for giving preferential treatment to those to
whom we are related are not grounded in the value of those
relationships and indeed need not be reduced to or grounded in
anything else at all; they carry inherent and irreducible normative
significance. Views of this sort are put forward by Scanlon (1998) and
Jeske (2008).</p>

<p>
Keller (2013) criticizes both the projects-based view and the
relationship-based view, and argues instead for a third alternative,
which he calls “the individuals view.” According to the
individuals view, reasons that justify the special treatment of those
to whom we are related “arise from facts about the individuals with
whom our special relationships are shared” (79). Rather than acting
as reasons for treating those persons better than others, our
relationships act as enablers –that is, background conditions that
explain why some facts count as reasons for a given agent. (Keller
borrows the idea of an enabler, and the term, from Jonathan Dancy; see
especially Dancy (2004). For similar views, which also draw on
Dancy’s work, see Jollimore (2011) and Lord (2016).)</p>

<h3><a name="ParImpDeb">6.2 The Partialist-Impartialist Debate</a></h3>

<p>
Although many people continue to speak of a ‘partialist vs.
impartialist debate,’ it should by now be clear that neither
‘partialism’ nor ‘impartialism’ unambiguously
denote any single moral position; at best, they designate two poles of
a continuum, one of which attributes no moral significance to the
demands of (any sort of) impartiality, the other of which sees
morality as exhausted by (some version of) impartiality. While a
somewhat general distinction can be usefully maintained, it is
misleading to think of the partialist-impartialist debate as a dispute
between two clearly defined, and clearly opposed, camps (Deigh 1991;
Barry 1995, pp. 191–5). Maximillian de Gaynesford goes so far as
to argue that “debates about partialism and impartialism thrive
on tacit assumptions about the way each relates to the first person.
These assumptions rest on mistakes and confusions …” (de
Gaynesford 2010).</p>

<p>
Thus, any general claim beginning with the words ‘partialists
(or impartialists) think that…’ is bound to be both
misleading and contentious. In particular, there is good reason to be
wary of objections to impartialism which claim that all impartialists
endorse extreme moral demands, or that they require that practical
reasoning be completely expunged of every vestige of the partial. It
is true, of course, that at least some impartialists, such as Godwin,
have endorsed such claims. But many do not. Deontologists, as we have
seen, hold impartiality to be a deep and significant element of
morality, but they also tend to allow for a considerable degree of
first-order partiality. And even many consequentialists are prepared
to admit the legitimacy of partial reasoning in some contexts, if only
on an instrumental basis. It is useful, then, to draw a distinction
between two sorts of impartialist moral theory. Impartialist theories
which require all agents to display first-order impartiality at all
times (Godwin’s, for example) might be referred to as <em>strict
impartialist theories</em>. Impartialist theories which allow for some
first-order partiality, but which nevertheless insist that all such
behavior be justified in second-order impartialist terms, might be
referred to as <em>fundamentally impartialist</em> moral theories. The
class of fundamentally impartial theories will include not only
contractualist, Kantian, and rule consequentialist theories, but also
certain act consequentialist theories (e.g. Railton 1986) which allow
the practice of first-order partiality as a means of promoting the
impersonal good. Such theories allow for partiality that is
permissible, justifiable, and perhaps even admirable in moral terms.
At the same time, however, they insist that all such partiality is
ultimately reducible – that is, justifiable in impartialist
terms at some deeper level.</p>

<p>
Within the partialist camp, a <em>strict partialist</em> might be
defined as holding that no sort of impartiality plays any moral role
whatsoever – a logically possible, but uncommon, position. A
<em>moderate partialist</em>, by contrast, would admit that
impartiality of some sort plays a moral role, but deny that this role
encompasses, or grounds, all of morality; in particular, such a figure
would be committed to the existence, in some contexts at least, of
irreducible morally admirable partiality. A virtue theorist, for
instance, might make a significant place for impartiality by selecting
it as one of the virtues; but a virtue of this sort would presumably
have to compete with other deeply partialist virtues such as loyalty,
which would override impartiality in at least some contexts.</p>

<p>
To the extent that a deep issue between partialists and impartialists
can be identified, it is presumably the question of whether
(irreducible) morally admirable partiality does indeed exist; and it
is along this line of dispute that the debate seems likeliest to
continue. (Whether this debate is identical to the so-called
‘justice-care’ debate, as contended in Cannold, <em>et
al</em> (1995), is questionable, though it is undeniable that there
are important parallels.) However, this way of classifying the
disputants, and of characterizing the issue itself, is meant to be
suggestive rather than definitive. The fact remains that there are
many types of partialist theories, and many types of impartialist
ones, and that continuing to speak of the
‘partialist-impartialist debate’ in loose and imprecise
terms is more likely to obscure than to illuminate.</p>

<h2><a name="EpisPar">7. Epistemic partiality and impartiality</a></h2>

<p>
Commonsense morality agrees with most deontological theories that
personal relationships involve various forms of morally admirable
partiality. Until now most philosophers who have examined this
phenomenon have focused on practical obligations: the ways in which we
are obligated to treat our friends and relatives better than we treat
people whom we do not know and to whom we are not significantly
related. Disagreements regarding the extent and nature of such
practical obligations have dominated the partialist-impartialist
debate. </p>

<p>
Recently, however, a number of philosophers have focused their
attention on a second sort of obligation we seem to have to friends
and relatives. In addition to treating them differently, commonsense
thought seems to hold that we ought to adopt different patterns of
belief formation and evaluation with respect to them – patterns of
belief formation and evaluation that make it more likely that we will
think highly of them and regard them in a positive light. Thus, it has
been suggested that friendship and similar relationships involve
epistemic partiality: there are forms of epistemic bias which are
recommended and possibly required by such relationships. As Simon
Keller has written, “when good friends form beliefs about each
other, they sometimes respond to considerations that have to do with
the needs and interests of their friends, not with aiming at the
truth, and that this is part of what makes them good friends”
(Keller 2004, p. 333). </p>

<p>
Similarly, Sarah Stroud has argued that when it is a friend’s
behavior that is in question, rather than that of a stranger,
“we tend to devote more energy to defeating or minimizing the
impact of unfavorable data than we otherwise would. … [A]t the
end of the day we are simply less likely to conclude that our friend
acted disreputably, or that he is a bad person, than we would in the
case of a nonfriend” (Stroud 2006, pp. 505–6).</p>

<p>
As both Keller and Stroud point out, these are not simply descriptions
of typical friendship behavior; rather, they seem to be generally
accepted as requirements of friendship. If so – and if it really
is true that epistemic partiality makes us less likely to form true
beliefs (but see Jollimore 2011 for a challenge to this
claim) – then we seem to face a difficult choice: we must either
accept that forming true beliefs is not the only goal with respect to
which epistemic standards should be evaluated, or else accept that the
requirements of friendship and other forms of love can conflict with
the requirements of epistemic rationality: being an ideal epistemic
agent, that is, is not always compatible with being an ideal
friend.</p>

<p>
As always, the issue is complicated by the effects of context. Whether
they are motivational or epistemic (or some combination of the two),
partial biases that are entirely appropriate in some contexts, such as
friendship, will be deeply inappropriate in others, such as the making
of hiring or sentencing decisions. (This assumes, of course, that we
are rejecting the consequentialist view that the requirements of
strict impartiality are pervasive in all aspects of our lives.) As
mentioned above, empirical research on implicit bias strongly suggests
that even when we recognize that we are acting in the latter sort of
context, and believe ourselves to be acting in a thoroughly impartial
and unbiased manner, we may well be fooling ourselves. Thus,
formulating a correct theoretical understanding of the scope and
demands of partiality and impartiality, as difficult as that task is
in itself, may not be sufficient for acting as a truly good or
virtuous agent. The more practical task of training our perceptions,
inclinations, and motivations in order to see and respond to the
world, at least where appropriate, in an impartial way – or, if
this is not possible, then to see and act in ways that take into
account and correct for our inherent biases – would also seem to
be necessary. </p>
