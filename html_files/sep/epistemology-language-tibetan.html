<h1>Tibetan Epistemology and Philosophy of Language</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Wed Feb 2, 2011; substantive revision Wed Mar 11, 2015</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>

The birth of the Tibetan epistemological tradition (Tib. <em>tshad
ma</em>) follows the reception in Tibet of the central works on the
subject by the Indian Buddhist forefathers, principally
Dharmakīrti and his commentators. Tibetan epistemology evolved to
a large extent in the framework of a commentarial tradition, which did
not prevent it from developing into an indigenous system with its
specific terminology and formal features, a system that involves issues
that add to the themes inherited from the Indian tradition, at the core
of which is the discussion on “reliable cognition” (Skt.
<em>pramāṇa</em>, Tib. <em>tshad ma</em>). The present entry
focuses on questions linked with the theory of knowledge and the
philosophy of language, but the scope of Tibetan epistemological works
extends also to the domain of logic and argumentation and involves, as
Indian epistemological treatises do, discussions that relate to
religiously oriented themes, such as the question of scriptural
reliability, omniscience, etc.</p>

<p>

The currently available works, written in Tibetan, range from the
11<sup>th</sup> c. to the present days. This abundant literature has
for the most part not been studied outside the Tibetan framework of
monastic studies; the majority of works has never been edited, only a
few are translated, sometimes only partially.</p>

<p>

The Tibetan tradition is by no means monolithic. Although Tibetan
epistemologists address common themes of inquiry and can in part be
situated within lineages sharing tendencies of interpretation, the
individual compositions reveal a diversity that would make any attempt
at grouping them into rigid categories prone to oversimplification.</p>

<p>

Individual entries will hopefully be devoted to the respective
thinkers in the future. This article will merely scratch the surface of
this rich tradition by sketching out some key topics of inquiry and
conflicting models representative of mainstream interpretative
orientations.</p>

<h2><a name="Per">1. Periodization</a></h2>

<p>

Attempts at periodizing the Tibetan tradition of epistemology rely
on the one hand on the Indian sources taken as focus of interpretation
by Tibetan scholars (Dharmakīrti's
<em>Pramāṇaviniścaya</em> or his
<em>Pramāṇavārttika</em>), on the other on the type of
scholarly activity involved (translation, composition of commentary or
of independent treatises).</p>

<p>

Following van der Kuijp (1989) one can distinguish: (i) the ancient
period, corresponding to the time of the First Diffusion of Buddhism in
Tibet (8<sup>th</sup> c.), marked mainly by the translation of some
Indian treatises on the subject; (ii) the pre-classical period,
starting with the Later Diffusion of Buddhism in Tibet in the late
10<sup>th</sup> c., in which scholars focused on the translation of and
commentaries on Dharmakīrti's
<em>Pramāṇaviniścaya</em> and started composing
independent works—typical of this period are the so-called
Summaries of epistemology (<em>tshad maʼi bsdus pa</em>); (iii)
the classical period, starting with Sakya Paṇḍita
Kün-ga-gyay-tsen (<em>Sa skya Paṇḍita Kun dgaʼ
rgyal mtshan</em>, 1182–1251), where the focus shifts to
Dharmakīrti's <em>Pramāṇavārttika</em>; (iv)
a post-classical period starting in the 15<sup>th</sup> c.
characterized by a reappraisal of ideas developed in the pre-classical
period, criticism of Sakya Paṇḍita's work and,
respectively, defense of the latter.</p>

<p>

The pre-classical period is marked by the lineage of epistemology
initiated by Ngok Lo-den-shay-rab (<em>rNgog Blo ldan shes rab</em>,
1059–1109) at the Ga-dam-ba (<em>bKaʼ gdams pa</em>) monastery of
Sang-pu-ne-u-tok (<em>gSang phu Neʼu thog</em>). Ngok himself and
his successors, among whom Cha-ba Chö-gyi-seng-gay (<em>Phya pa
Chos kyi seng ge</em>, 1109–1169) and Tsang-nak-pa
Tsön-drü-seng-gay (<em>gTsang nag pa brTson ʼgrus seng
g</em>e, ?–after 1195) are major influential figures, represented the
mainline interpretative stream up to the 13<sup>th</sup> century, when
Sakya Paṇḍita, advancing the need to treat the Indian
sources more faithfully and more exhaustively, embarked on a
generalized critique of his predecessors and contemporaries. Many
features of the dividing line thus set by Sakya Paṇḍita
remain points of dissent between authors whose lineage goes back to
this author (this includes thinkers such as Go-ram-ba
Sö-nam-seng-gay [<em>Go rams pa bSod nams seng ge</em>,
1429–1489] and Say-dok Paṇ-chen Śākya Chok-den
[<em>gSer mdog paṇ chen Śākya mchog ldan</em>,
1428–1508]) and authors belonging to the Ga-den-ba (<em>dGaʼ ldan
pa</em>) and subsequent Ge-luk (<em>dGe lugs</em>) traditions (both
referred to as “Ge-luk” here for simplicity's sake).
While the latter prolonged, to some extent, ideas found in the early
Ga-dam-ba manuals, one should however avoid hasty claims of continuity.
Representative for the Ge-luk tradition are the works of Tsong-ka-ba
Lobsang-drak-ba (<em>Tsong kha pa Blo bzang grags pa</em>
(1357–1419)'s disciples—Kay-drub-jay Gelek-pel-sang
(<em>mKhas grub rje dGe legs dpal bzang</em>, 1385–1438), Gyel-tsap-jay
Dar-ma-rin-chen (<em>rGyal tshab rje Dar ma rin chen</em>, 1364–1432),
Ge-dün-drup (<em>dGe ʼdun grub</em>, 1391–1474)—and
the manuals known as “Collected topics” (<em>bsdus
grwa</em>), of which the oldest available instance is the <em>Rwa stod
bsdus grwa</em> composed by Jam-yang Chok-hla-ö-ser
(<em>ʼJam dbyangs mChog lha ʼod zer</em>, 1429–1500).</p>

<h2><a name="Epi">2. Epistemology</a></h2>

<p>

The examination of “reliable cognition” (<em>tshad
ma</em>) is the core subject of Tibetan epistemological works. It is
subsumed under the broader enterprise of classification of
“mind” or “mental events” (Tib. <em>blo</em>)
and involves the determination of the objects which the respective
cognitions bear on.</p>

<h3><a name="Obj">2.1 Objects</a></h3>

<h4>2.1.1 Ontological framework</h4>

<h5>a. The scope of reality</h5>

<p>

Tibetan epistemologists are primarily Buddhist thinkers who follow
the Madhyamaka views. A pertinent question for them is whether
cognitions of the kind dealt with in epistemological works, namely, the
so-called “reliable cognitions,” bear on objects pertaining
to conventional reality and/or ultimate reality.</p>

<p>

While some authors seek to include knowledge of the ultimate within
the scope of reliable cognitions, the view of the majority is that
reliable cognitions concern the conventional realm. The definition of
an ontological position in epistemological works thus concerns
conventional reality; the ultimate is beyond the reach of reasoning.
Tibetan authors define their position—in some cases a
provisional one adopted as a mere interpretative tool for dealing with
Dharmakīrti's texts—on the basis of models
associated with Indian Buddhist schools. Among the options are: an
idealist model (Vijñānavāda) and two external-realist
models. The last two agree in positing the existence of extra-mental
entities, but differ in their account of the way that a cognition of
such objects takes place; these are associated with the
Vaibhāṣika and the Sautrāntika schools respectively.
According to the first, extra-mental entities exist simultaneously to
their cognition and are cognized directly by the latter. According to
the second, extra-mental entities are the cause of their cognition but,
being momentary, they have ceased to exist at the time cognition
arises.</p>

<p>

Early treatises attest to various choices among these models. For
instance, Cha-ba refutes the idealist and the Sautrāntika
external-realist models and settles for a Vaibhāṣika-like
position, whereas Chu-mik-ba Seng-gay-pel (<em>Chu mig pa Seng ge
dpal</em>, 13<sup>th</sup> c.) opts for an idealist framework. Sakya
Paṇḍita's position, shared by Ge-luk authors, is to
arrange these positions along a gradual ascending scale; the lowest,
the Vaibhāṣika model is refuted in favor of the adoption of
the Sautrāntika model, which is itself replaced by an idealist one
on a higher scale of analysis.</p>

<h5>b. The extension of the real</h5>

<p>

While real particulars (what Dharmakīrti calls
“<em>svalakṣaṇa</em>”), characterized by their
capacity to bring about an effect, are allotted conventional existence,
Tibetan scholars are divided as to the spatial and temporal extensions
of such particulars.</p>

<p>

The spatial options range from an infinitesimal particle (the atom
being considered the smallest size unit) to a macroscopic object up to
a commonsense object; the temporal ones from a momentary entity to a
continuum of indeterminate (although not infinite) duration. The
adoption of extended objects is subject to the criticism brought
forward by Dharmakīrti against Indian philosophers who admit
wholes as distinct from their parts, and would, in a general way,
conflict with the Buddhist idea that compounds only have nominal
existence. On the other hand, the infinitesimalist view has
difficulties to account for the fact that macroscopic objects appear
to our cognition rather than individual atoms. The latter difficulty
leads, in Dharmakīrti's works, to the refutation of extra-mental
reality in favor of an idealist position. An intermediate view is to
grant reality to objects that have some spatial extension: not
commonsense objects, but aggregations of atoms within the scope of a
specific sense-sphere (Skt. <em>āyatana</em>, Tib. <em>skye
mched</em>), such as, for the visual sense-sphere, patches of
color.</p>

<p>

Regarding the temporal extension of real particulars, momentary
entities pose a challenge to transactional usage: once known, they have
already ceased and hence cannot be used nor acted upon. Transactional
usage is better grounded in objects that have some duration. Continua,
however, bring about the same critique as macroscopic objects: what
really exists is a particular at each moment, but the chain of causally
related moments, even though it may appear to the ignorant mind as an
object having duration, only exists nominally. A limited temporal
extension is not an option, for, in difference to aggregated atoms, the
different moments in a series do not co-exist—only the present
one exists and is causally efficient; they hence cannot be considered
to contribute collectively to the cognition of an object.</p>

<p>

Few Tibetan authors, among them Tak-tsang Lo-tsa-wa
Shay-rap-rin-chen (<em>sTag tshang Lo tsā ba Shes rab rin
chen</em>, b. 1405), adopt the infinitesimal-momentary view. The
intermediate view is prescribed by Sakya Paṇḍita and
adopted, for instance, by Lo-wo-ken-chen Sö-nam-lhün-drup
(<em>Glo bo mkhan chen bSod nams lhun grub</em>, 1456–1532), while
Ge-luk authors and some Sakya ones such as Ngak-wang-chö-drak
(<em>Ngag dbang chos grags</em>, 1572–1641) extend their view of
reality to commonsense objects and continua, which are held to possess
their own causal capacity. They are described as collections, but
distinguished from the partless wholes distinct from their parts
advocated by the more extreme realist Indian philosophers which are the
target of Dharmakīrti's criticism.</p>

<h4>2.1.2 Typologies</h4>

<p>

Objects (Tib. <em>yul</em>) are primarily considered in relation to
cognition (Tib. <em>blo</em>). In the common vocabulary of Tibetan
epistemology, several sorts of objects are distinguished:</p>

<ol type="i">

<li>the “appearing object” (<em>snang yul</em>)</li>

<li>the “grasped object” or “apprehended
object” (<em>gzung yul</em>)</li>

<li>the “object of determination” or “conceived
object” (<em>zhen yul</em>)</li>

<li>the “object of application” (<em>ʼjug
yul</em>)</li>

</ol>

<p>

While the terminology, which reflects different kinds of mental
operations, is shared among Tibetan epistemologists, they disagree in
their definitions of each sort and on the equivalence of some of them,
in particular of the appearing object and the grasped object.</p>

<h5>a. The appearing and grasped objects</h5>

<p>

Regarding the appearing object and the grasped object, a major cause
of dissention lies in the model adopted to account for the process of a
cognition of an object. Two options are in competition: (i) direct
realism (associated with the Vaibhāṣika model) advocates a
direct contact with reality; in this model the object and its cognition
exist simultaneously, albeit distinctly; (ii) a causal theory
(associated with the Sautrāntika model) according to which an
object acts as a cause for the emergence of its cognition but, being
momentary, has ceased to exist once this cognition arises.</p>

<p>

(i) For an adherent of the first model such as Cha-ba, the appearing
object, the object that manifests itself in cognition, and the grasped
object, what cognition apprehends, are one and the same thing. Each
cognition has its appearing object, and a threefold typology of mind is
established on the basis of three sorts of appearing objects: the
particular, the hallucinated object (i.e., something that appears while
being inexistent) and the concept (<em>don spyi</em>). These three are
distinguished and paired with three sorts of mental events by relying
on two corresponding sets of criteria: (a) The characteristic of
existence (associated with the notion of causal efficacy) separates
real entities on the one hand and concepts and hallucinated objects on
the other; it matches the identification of the corresponding mental
events as “correct” and “erroneous”
respectively. (b) The characteristic of vividness, associated with that
of specificity, separates real entities and hallucinated objects from
concepts, and is the ground for the distinction between non-conceptual
and conceptual mental events. The correspondence plays out as
follows:</p>

<td valign="top">concept (<em>don spyi</em>)</td>

<td valign="top">conceptual<br />
(erroneous by its very nature)</td>

<td valign="top">any conceptual cognition</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>

(ii) For an adherent of the causal model such as Sakya
Paṇḍita, a mental event for the arising of which no real
entity acted as a direct cause must be held to have, strictly speaking,
no object, or at least, no “grasped object” (<em>gzung
yul</em>). In other words, only non-conceptual correct cognitions
(namely, perceptions) have a grasped object.</p>

<p>

The causation-model further has the consequence that the grasped
object cannot be identical with the appearing object: the grasped
object has ceased at the time of the arising of its effect, a cognition
in which an object manifests itself. Additionally, Sakya
Paṇḍita understands “appearance” in the
restricted sense of the mode of operation proper to non-conceptual
cognitions. There can be no “appearance” in the case of a
conceptual cognition, for the latter does not apply to reality by way
of an appearance reflecting real objects, but by way of exclusion,
namely by determinations that consist in eliminations of the opposite.
Thus, according to Sakya Paṇḍita, the distinction between
non-conceptual and conceptual amounts to a difference in the mode of
operation of the respective cognitions, namely, via appearance (or
vivid appearance) for the first, via exclusion for the second, while
the distinction between correct and incorrect relies on the existence
of a grasped object, namely, of a real object causing this
cognition.</p>

<p>

Adherents of the first model are thus criticized by those of the
second for admitting improper, non-existent grasped object (namely, the
concept and the hallucinated object), and for blurring the difference
between the respective modes of operation of non-conceptual and
conceptual cognitions. In return, the second model is criticized in
that it does not enable direct access to real objects; those can, at best,
be inferred.</p>

<p>

Although later Ge-luk authors, who take causality and the time-gap
problem it involves seriously, adopt the causation model, they mostly
preserve Cha-ba's typology, together with the identification of
grasped object and appearing object. This leaves them in a difficult
situation as they adopt a typology of objects whose goal was precisely
to avoid a model in which the object grasped by cognition would be
different from the object that appears to it. Their solution is to
invoke the notion of “aspect”: a cognition caused by an
object takes a form similar to its cause. This aspectualism differs
from a representationalist view in that it does not involve, strictly
speaking, a representation which would stand as a curtain between
cognition and the object. Cognition still cognizes its object directly
by taking its aspect.</p>

<h5>b. The conceived object</h5>

<p>

While “appearance” is passive, the “conceived
object” is associated with an intentional operation of
determination (<em>zhen pa</em>) that involves the (involuntary)
blurring of the distinction between the mental appearance and an
extra-mental particular by way of an unconscious error inherent to the
thought process of ordinary beings. Such operation is restricted to
conceptual cognitions, and is what allows action based on concepts.</p>

<h5>c. The object of application</h5>

<p>

The “object of application” is usually identified with
the object of reliable cognition, and hence understood differently
according to the definition of reliable cognition adopted by each
author. In some versions, the “object of application”
stands out as a real, extra-mental particular considered to be the
object that is likely to be acted upon at the outcome of a reliable
cognition (for instance, a fire when perceiving a fire or when
inferring that there is a fire on a hill as one perceives smoke on a
hill). According to other authors, such as Cha-ba, the object of
application is the “object with regard to which opposite
superimpositions have been eliminated,” without reference to any
transactional “application.”</p>

<p>

One can identify, at the source of this typology, the need to
specify the scope of reliability for reliable cognitions, an issue
already dealt with by Dharmottara, who paved the way for the typology
of objects developed in Tibet. A problematic case is that of inference:
inference qualifies as a reliable cognition, but it is strictly
speaking “erroneous” due to its conceptual nature. Namely,
the thought-content of an inferential mental event is a universal,
which bears no correspondence whatsoever with extra-mental reality.
Nevertheless, inference is held to be “reliable,” and its
reliability to have reality for its scope. This difficulty resolves
itself when distinguishing between the apprehended object and the
object of application (one could say, between the object from the point
of view of the “input” and from the point of view of the
“output”): inference is erroneous with regard to its
grasped object (for those that admit that it has one), or just
erroneous qua conceptual thought; on the other hand, inference is
reliable with regard to its object of application—it give us a
potential access to a real particular. The object of application is
thereby identified as being the “object of reliable
cognition.”</p>

<h3><a name="Cog">2.2 Cognitions</a></h3>

<p>

Typical of Tibetan epistemology is the classification of mental
events, which gives rise to the specialized literature of
“Lo-rik” (<em>blo rigs</em>), “types of mental
events.” The typologies adopted depend on the authors'
respective views on objects, the model adopted to account for their
cognition, and the definition of reliable cognition.</p>

<p>

The threefold typology met with above, which distinguishes between
conceptual and non-conceptual mental events,
and—among the latter—between
correct and incorrect ones, is generally accepted, but not its
correspondence with a three-fold typology of appearing objects.</p>

<p>

More fundamental in view of the focus of epistemological works is
the distinction between reliable and non-reliable cognitions. There is
agreement as to which cognitions are reliable
cognitions—precisely those prescribed by Dharmakīrti,
namely, perception and inference—although not as to
what defines them as reliable cognitions. As for non-reliable
cognitions, one finds an opposition between a fivefold typology, which is
the trademark of the Sang-pu school, and a more basic threefold
typology prescribed by Sakya Paṇḍita. As the five cases of
non-reliable cognitions (<em>tshad min</em>) are for the most part
better explained as failures to fulfill one or more requirements of a
reliable cognition, this opposition will be dealt with after the
section on reliable cognition.</p>

<h4>2.2.1 Reliable cognition (<em>tshad ma</em>)</h4>

<p>

Following Dharmakīrti, Tibetan epistemologists restrict the
number of reliable cognitions to two sorts: perception and inference.
The first is defined as “non-erroneous and devoid of
conceptualization,” the second as the “understanding coming
from a triply characterized logical reason.” Both share the
status of being “reliable cognitions” (<em>tshad ma</em>),
a status that Dharmakīrti defined in his
<em>Pramāṇavārttika</em> with the characteristics of
being (1) “non-belying” and (2) “revealing an unknown
object.” In addition to a prolongation of the commentarial
dispute on the verses in which these characteristics are given, a
notable confrontation is found in the Tibetan tradition between two
models that can be distinguished in view of the understanding of
perception that they entail: (i) a model in which perception retains a
passive status insofar as, being devoid of conceptualization, it cannot
itself achieve a determination of its object, and (ii) a model that
seeks to give a more active role to perception without however stepping
back on its characterization as “non-conceptual.”</p>

<h5>a. The “passive perception” model</h5>

<p>

The “passive perception” model can also be termed the
“classic” model in that it claims to offer a more literal
reading of Dharmakīrti. This model, adopted for instance by Sakya
Paṇḍita, takes “non-belying,” combined with
“novelty,” as definiens of reliable cognition. Without
giving a pragmatic view of reliability, this model involves the
capacity to fulfill a goal, or to have some causal efficacy, as a
criterion for the non-belying character of cognition. Although being
non-belying and novel is sufficient to qualify as reliable, in a
transactional context, conventional reliable cognitions are expected to
lead to an ascertainment (<em>nges pa</em>). While inference ascertains
its object by itself, perception is unable to do so, because
ascertainment—a conceptual operation, equivalent to the
elimination of opposite superimpositions—is incompatible with
its being “devoid of conceptualization.” Such an
ascertainment, should it occur (this requires a number of
circumstantial elements), must be performed by a conceptual cognition
that follows perception. In other words, perception is reliable in
itself, but has to rely on a subsequent conceptual mental event for
ascertainment. This “two-tier” way of accounting for both
reliability and determination keeps a strict division as to the role
and capacity of non-conceptual and conceptual cognitions, which Sakya
Paṇḍita compares respectively by way of illustration to
“a seeing mute” and “a speaking blind.”</p>

<h5>b. The “active perception” model</h5>

<p>

Some interpreters, already in India, were dissatisfied with this
“passive” status of perception. The new model, which was
first propounded by Cha-ba, brings revolutionary changes to the classic
model, first by introducing in the definition of reliable cognition the
notion of “elimination of opposite superimpositions,” then
by claiming that perception itself (not a subsequent conceptual
cognition) performs such a function.</p>

<p>

Cha-ba formulates a new definition of reliable cognition in terms of
the “understanding of a true object” (<em>don bden
rtogs</em>). The object considered here is the “object of
application,” and truth is explained as a correspondence to the
status of reality supported by the absence of opposition. The long
version of this definition brings to the fore elements that are
systematized by later authors in a threefold list:</p>

<ol type="i">

<li>novelty</li>

<li>the mode of apprehension—to be reliable, a cognition
must depend on its object in a way that it does not occur when the
object is absent</li>

<li>the elimination of opposite superimpositions.</li>

</ol>

<p>

In the later Ge-luk tradition, which draws on this model, the
definition whose short version is formulated in terms of “newly
non-belying” also includes the requirement of “eliminating
superimpositions.”</p>

<p>

In the Dharmakīrtian system, the “elimination of
superimpositions” is tantamount to ascertainment (<em>nges
pa</em>). This is to be understood in the framework of the so-called
“<em>apoha</em>” (lit. “exclusion”) theory:
any positive determination proceeds via the elimination of what is
other. For instance, determining a patch of colour as
“blue” does not consist in identifying some blue property
or some blueness shared by blue things, but in differentiating this
patch from the “other,” namely from things that are
not-blue. Determination as “blue” amounts to eliminating
actual superimpositions of “non-blue” (for instance, if
one thought that the patch was yellow), or potential ones; in the
former case, the determination eliminates an erroneous judgment and
replaces it by a correct one, in the latter it prevents the subsequent
arising of an erroneous judgment.  Both sides of the process,
superimposition and its elimination, are, for Dharmakīrti,
exclusively conceptual operations.</p>

<p>

According to Cha-ba, however, “elimination” is not
limited to the kind of conceptual operation that follows a
determination (<em>zhen pa</em>). Perception, although it does not
perform any intentional determination, is however capable of
eliminating superimpositions via a causal process: perception gives
rise, at the next moment, to another non-conceptual mental event in
which the potential of the wrong superimposition to arise has been
neutralized, thus preventing its subsequent arising. Insofar as it, by
this means, eliminates opposite superimpositions, perception is held to
ascertain (<em>nges pa</em>) its object, without involving any
conceptual element.</p>

<p>

A further specificity worth noting is that the “elimination of
opposite superimpositions” can bear on an object which is not the
appearing object. For instance, a perception which has a patch of blue
as its appearing object can eliminate the superimposition
“non-blue” and thereby ascertain “blue,” but it
can also eliminate the superimposition “presence of a patch of
yellow” and thereby ascertain “absence of a patch of
yellow” even though the absence of yellow does not appear to this
perception. The first process is termed “direct
realization” (<em>dngos rtogs</em>), the second “indirect
realization” (<em>shugs rtogs</em>).</p>

<p>

The main criticism addressed by advocates of the
“passive” model to the “active” model is that
it attributes to perception an operation that is restricted to
conceptual cognitions; in their view indeed, “elimination of
superimpositions” amounts exclusively to the “exclusion of
what is other,” the mode of operation of conceptual
cognitions.</p>

<p>

Another issue is the possibility to account for the
non-ascertainment of some aspects of an appearing object (typically,
its impermanence). Advocates of the “passive” model claim
that all aspects appear to perception, but that a conceptual
determination spontaneously arises subsequently only with regard to
some aspects, according to the circumstances (nature of the aspect,
competence and mindfulness of the cognizer, visibility, etc.).
Advocates of the “active” model, they argue, would have to
concede that if ascertainment relies merely on appearance, everything
that appears should be ascertained. Actually, partisans of the
“active” model invoke the same set of circumstances as
their opponents to explain why not all superimpositions are eliminated
by a perception even though there is no partial appearance of the
object. In their case, however, since the elimination of
superimposition is what characterizes a reliable cognition, they are
led to admit that a perception, although being a single mental event,
is both a reliable cognition with regard to some aspects of the
appearing object and a non-reliable cognition with regard to other
aspects. In opposition to the “passive” model in which every
perception is reliable, this system thus leaves room for both
“reliable perception” and “non-reliable
perception,” and furthermore for mental events that are both
reliable and non-reliable.</p>

<p>

The adoption of the criteria of “eliminating
superimpositions” in the definition of reliable cognition does
not affect inference. Regarding inference, the divergences of
interpretation concern the logical domain rather than the
epistemological one. There are however different answers to the
question how inference, being a conceptual process, can successfully
relate to reality. This question will be dealt with in the section on
universals.</p>

<p>

As hinted at in the last discussion, the fundamental disagreement
between advocates of the respective models with regard to perception
and more generally with regard to the definition of reliable cognition
has consequences for their understanding of non-reliable
cognitions.</p>

<h4>2.2.2. Non-reliable cognitions</h4>

<h5>a. Fivefold typology</h5>

<p>

Early Sang-pu scholars, by embedding the discussion of reliable
cognition within a general examination of mental events, were led to
develop a typology of non-reliable cognitions. This typology, which is
mostly adopted in later Ge-luk textbooks, includes the following five
types:</p>

<ol>

<li>Unascertained appearance (<em>snang la ma nges pa</em>). These
are typically cases of non-conceptual cognitions that fail to eliminate
opposite superimpositions with regard to their appearing object. This
failure can result from a lack of attention, of wit, of familiarity, or
can be due to the nature of an appearing aspect; the latter might be
too “subtle.” Such cognitions do not qualify as reliable
since an elimination of opposite superimpositions does not take place,
but still qualify as perceptions insofar as they are non-erroneous and
devoid of conceptualization.</li>

<li>Redundant ascertainment (<em>bcad paʼi yul can</em>). Such
cognition, either conceptual or non-conceptual, applies to an object
with regard to which opposite superimpositions have already been
eliminated. It thereby fails to fulfill the criterion of
“novelty.”</li>

<li>Presumption (<em>yid dpyod</em>). Such a conceptual cognition
correctly ascertains an object, but not via a proper inferential
process. Although it is novel and eliminates opposite superimposition,
it does not qualify as reliable in view of its mode of apprehension.
Indeed, presumption is held to entail truth, while still not depending
on its object either via a relation of causality or identity.</li>

<li>Error (<em>log shes</em>). A cognition can be erroneous from the
point of view of its appearing object or of its conceived object. In
both cases, the error consists in not apprehending—respectively,
not conceiving—in concordance with reality. Any
cognition in which something that is not real, i.e., not causally
efficient, appears is “erroneous.” This includes perceptual
errors such as hallucinations and dreams, as well as all conceptual
cognitions since their appearing object is a concept, i.e., something
that is merely superimposed. Determination (<em>zhen pa</em>) is in
itself erroneous in that it confuses what is conceived and what is
real. More restrictively, “erroneous with regard to the conceived
object” indicates that a determination is faulty in that it does
not relate to a state of affairs, for instance, if one determines sound
as permanent whereas it is in reality impermanent.</li>

<li>Doubt (<em>the tshom</em>). Doubt occurs when one fails to choose
between two alternative possibilities, leaving both options open.
According to Cha-ba, doubt is a conceptual cognition. Although an
intentional operation of determination (<em>zhen pa</em>) occurs, doubt
is opposed to ascertainment (<em>nges pa</em>) insofar as this
determination does not bring about a conclusive ascertainment. What is
eliminated is merely the impossibility of either option. This case thus
appears as the conceptual pendent of unascertained appearance.</li>

</ol>

<h5>b. Threefold typology and critique of the fivefold typology</h5>

<p>

Opponents to the new definition of reliable cognition and the
“active perception” model, starting with Sakya
Paṇḍita, instead adopted a threefold typology of
non-reliable cognitions: i. non-understanding (<em>ma rtogs</em>), ii.
false cognition (<em>log shes/log rtog</em>) and iii. doubt (<em>the
tshom</em>). These share as definiens the failure of being
“non-belying” and can be ultimately reduced to the unique
category of non-understanding.</p>

<p>

The critique of the fivefold typology of non-reliable cognition
relies first on the understanding of perception as a passive cognition
which does not itself ascertain its object, but whose reliability is
actually independent of this subsequent ascertainment.</p>

<p>

The category of “unascertained appearance” is thus
denied the status of independent category: according to proponents of
the “passive perception” model, every perception is an
unascertained appearance; ascertainment is always the deed of a
subsequent conceptual cognition. There is thus no such thing as an
“ascertained appearance” if what is implied is
ascertainment by perception itself. Cases that are classified as
“unascertained appearance” in the fivefold typology merely
differ from other perceptions in that they are not immediately followed
by the arising of an ascertaining conceptual cognition, but this does
not affect their reliability.</p>

<p>

Redundant cognition is also rejected as a distinct category.
Redundant non-conceptual cognition is in particular held to be
impossible. Indeed, any subsequent perception necessarily has a new
object since the object of the previous perception, being a momentary
particular, has already ceased to exist when the subsequent perception
arises. More generally, a redundant cognition would have no cognitive
role, for its object would not be something that is to be understood;
it is accordingly judged to amount to non-understanding.</p>

<p>

Cases of presumption are subsumed under the category of doubt. Doubt
should not be understood here in the sense of “hesitation,”
but as the lack of decisive ascertainment. Indeed, that the presumption
is actually correct—which can only be ascertained
extrinsically—does not amount to its constituting a
decisive ascertainment. If no evidence at all is adduced, such
“lucky guesses” are not worth any certitude, and if faulty
evidence is adduced, they are to be interpreted as
pseudo-inferences.</p>

<h3><a name="Uni">2.3 Universals</a></h3>

<p>

An important issue at the crossing of ontology and epistemology that
also has consequences for the philosophy of language is that of
universals. Two main trends can be distinguished among Tibetan authors:
The first, which is termed below “antirealism,” is a
literal interpretation of Dharmakīrti's thought denying
reality to universals and properties. The second, which one can
describe as “moderate realism,” holds that not all
universals are non-existent. In particular, it concedes some reality to
predicates, thereby granting reality to the universals that are their
referents.</p>

<h4>2.3.1  Antirealism</h4>

<p>

The antirealist position, held by Sakya Paṇḍita and his
epigones, insists on the radical distinction between the conceptual
domain and reality, between universals and particulars. Only
particulars are real—the criterion for reality being
causal efficiency. Universals are mere mental constructions; they are
superimpositions that do not reflect reality, but veil the
individuality of particulars under the cover of an imagined shared
property. Conversely, the distinct properties that one ascribes to a
particular are equally not part of the fabric of reality, but mental
constructions that veil the unity of that particular.</p>

<p>

The question of the why and the how of concept formation is dealt
with within the framework of the theory of <em>anyāpoha</em>
(“exclusion of the other,” Tib. <em>gzhan sel</em>)
propounded by Dharmakīrti. According to Dharmakīrti,
conceptual thought proceeds by applying distinctions among particulars
in a way that reflects some subjective intention and beginningless
habits acquired in countless past lives. One accordingly ends up
grouping things by excluding them from other things. What is implied by
the term “exclusion” is that what particulars apprehended
under the cover of a universal have in common is merely that they are
all excluded from a complementary domain. In short, what xs have in the
common is that they are not non-xs. By subsuming a particular under an
imagined universal, or by ascribing a property to it, mentally or
verbally, one is not identifying a real feature of this object, but
merely distinguishing it from other particulars.</p>

<p>

Although universals and properties are conceptual constructions, we
mistakenly identify them as something real. This mistaken conflation of
the conceptual and reality that we spontaneously apply when forming or
using concepts provides a bridge between the two domains, prompting
practical action, interaction with reality, based on fictions. The
success of such interaction is accounted for by the causation involved
in the process of concept formation which guarantees an indirect link
between universals and the particulars they are taken to stand for:
concepts are formed as the result of experiences involving causally
active particulars; however, only the individual causal capacities of
particulars are involved, not any shared potential that would determine
natural kinds. Thus, for instance, the universal “fire” is
conceived following experiences of particulars that one excludes from
other particulars that are held not to burn. By acting on the basis of
the inference that there is “fire” on the hill when one
perceives smoke on the hill, although the object of this inference is
the universal “fire,” not a real fire, when one acts on the
basis of this inference one obtains a particular that fulfills the
expected function of burning, as the previously experienced particulars
that one excluded from non-fire did.</p>

<h4>2.3.2 Moderate realism</h4>

<p>

The Ge-luk tradition as well as some Sakya thinkers instead adopted
a moderate realist position with regard to universals. Their argument
is that if universals were not real, reasoning based on universals
would not apply to reality. In other words, reasoning cannot lead to
practical success by relying on mere fictions. Moderate realism thus
presents itself as an attempt to account for the soundness of
conceptual cognitions, and to do so in a way that is more intuitive
than the antirealist model.</p>

<p>

In Ge-luk textbooks, universals and specific instances are defined
in terms of each other: a universal is something instantiated by its
instances, the instances are what is subsumed by a kind, or universal.
To qualify as an instance, three criteria must be satisfied, namely, <i>x</i>
is a specific instance of <i>y</i> if</p>

<ol>

<li><i>x</i> is <i>y</i></li>

<li><i>x</i> has a relation of essential identity with <i>y</i></li>

<li>there are other instances of <i>y</i> different from <i>x</i>.</li>

</ol>

<p>

There is thus no intrinsic difference between particular and
universal, those are relative notions. For instance, “pen”
is a universal with regard to “red pen,” which is its
particular (a red pen is a pen, and is essentially identical with pen,
and there are other instances of pen, such as a blue pen, that are not
a red pen). But “pen” is also a particular with regard to
“impermanence,” and “red pen” is a universal
with regard to “plastic red pen.”</p>

<p>

Further, the instantiation of a universal by its specific instance
is taken to be a relation that obtains in reality, rather than
amounting to a constructed superimposition. The red pen really is a
pen; it is not merely apprehended under the superimposed universal
“pen” due to its being excluded from non-pen.</p>

<p>

The relation between the instance and the universal is expressed by
the formula “one nature and distinct exclusions” (or
“distinct distinguishers for one nature,” Tib. <em>ngo bo
gcig la ldog pa tha dad</em>). The term “exclusion” brings
us back to the theory of
<em>apoha</em>. When proponents of antirealism use this formula, they
mean that various conceptual distinctions can be made with regard to a
unique particular, by distinguishing it from various complementary
domains; for instance, one can conceive of a particular as excluded
from non-blue, from non-impermanent, from non-material, etc. For the
moderate realist, however, this distinction is not a mere conceptual
one, it extends to reality, although it does not entail a distinction
pertaining to the substance. There are thus real properties that can be
predicated, but they are not intrinsically distinct from their subject.
If one accepts real predicates, then the universals that are the
referents of the corresponding expressions must also be accepted.</p>

<p>

Both models attempt to bridge the gap between universals and
particulars by grounding universals in reality, the antirealist one by
involving causality in the process of concept formation, the moderate
realist one by implying a correspondence in reality to our conceptual
distinctions. The second model, although it provides a more intuitively
acceptable explanation, meets with difficulties. If taking conceptual
divisions as actual divisions is not without tensions, the mere fact of
positing real universals is problematic in the commentarial tradition
of an antirealist author. A key move in this regard is to distinguish
the idea of a universal qua mental construct, and a universal qua a
phenomena common to several instances. In the second sense, a universal
needs not be unreal.</p>

<p>

Other models of moderate realism were developed in the Sakya
tradition, that also invoke the necessity for the existence of a real
shared property without which our thinking would be
arbitrary. U-yuk-ba Rik-bay-seng-gay (<em>ʼU yug pa Rigs
paʼi seng ge</em>, 13<sup>th</sup> c.), who adopts such a line of
interpretation, explains Dharmakīrti's refutation of real
universals as referring to a “mental universal,” the
mistaken conflation of distinct things under a unitary appearance. His
view of an “objective universal” involves the theory
of <em>apoha</em>, in a way that takes the exclusion from non-x as a
fact rather than as a mental construct.</p>

<p>

Another Sakya author who adopts moderate realism is Po-dong
Chok-lay-nam-gyal (<em>Bo dong Phyogs las rnam rgyal</em>, 1376–1451).
He qualifies as a realist insofar as he distinguishes between universal
qua construct and universal qua common phenomena, and accuses the
antirealists of nihilism. He nonetheless criticizes other Tibetan
versions of moderate realism, which he considers to be prone to
Dharmakīrti's critique against real universals. His
solution, akin to U-yuk-ba's, is to reformulate the universal
negatively as a real elimination; a solution which, however, does not
escape the faults he himself addressed against the positive version of
real universals.</p>

<p>

Moderate realism is traditionally ascribed to Cha-ba and the Sang-pu
school in general. The earliest occurrence of explicit arguments in
favor of real universals identified so far is in the works of
Chu-mik-ba.</p>

<h2><a name="Lan">3. Philosophy of language</a></h2>

<h3><a name="ObjWor">3.1 The object of words</a></h3>

<p>

Language is dealt with in Tibetan epistemological treatises in terms
of the relationship between “what expresses” (<em>rjod
byed</em>) and “what is expressed” (<em>brjod
bya</em>)—two notions that come quite close to the Saussurian
distinction between “signifier” and
“signified.”</p>

<p>

According to the basic presuppositions of Buddhist ontology,
“words” consist in singular sound emissions uttered at a
specific place and time, and the “objects” that are
interacted with as a consequence of language use are momentary and
unique particulars. Although words and objects appear to be what
expresses and what is expressed, the success of language cannot rely on
a relation between particular words and particular objects, for this
would not provide the generalizability necessary for language to have
any practical utility. Particular words express particular objects only
in virtue of the conventional relation established, within a linguistic
community, between generic words and meanings.</p>

<p>

Accordingly, Tibetan models distinguish between (i) a “direct
signifier” and a “directly signified”—a
generic word (<em>sgra spyi</em>) and a generic object, identified as a
“<em>don spyi</em>” (the term was previously translated as
“concept” when discussing the appearing object of
conceptual cognition)—and (ii) a “conceived
signifier” and a “conceived signified,” the
particular sound emission and the particular object.</p>

<blockquote>

<table border="1" cellspacing="0">
<tbody><tr>
<td>
direct signifier<br />
(<em>dngos kyi rjod byed = sgra spyi</em>)</td>

<td>directly signified<br />
(<em>dngos kyi brjod bya = don spyi/sgra don</em>)</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>conceived signifier<br />
(<em>zhen paʼi rjod byed = sgra [rang gi mtshan nyid]</em>)</td>

<td>conceived signified<br />
(<em>zhen paʼi brjod bya = don [rang gi mtshan nyid]</em>)</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

</blockquote>

<p>

There are two main issues with this model, one is the relation
between the direct signifier and signified and the conceived ones, the
other is the understanding of what is the “directly
signified.”</p>

<p>

(a) The question of establishing relations between generic words and
meaning whereas there exist, in reality, only particular sound
utterances and objects, and of interaction with these particulars
relying on generic words and meanings echo the issue already met with
in the context of conceptual processes and actions relying on them,
namely, bridging the gap between the conceptual realm and reality. The
expression “conceived” (<em>zhen pa</em>) is here also
indicative of a process of intentional determination that involves the
mistaken identification of the conceptual fiction with extra-mental
reality. Sakya Paṇḍita distinguishes the context of
“explanation,” where one differentiates between
“direct” and “conceived” signifier and
signified, between generic and specific words and objects, and the
context of “action,” that is, practical language use. In
the context of “action”—this includes
convention-setting and application of
conventions—these differences are blurred for
speakers and hearers. The double articulation of the conceptual and
reality thus holds together thanks to spontaneous mistaken
identifications that take place while learning and applying linguistic
conventions.</p>

<p>

The divergences discussed in the section on universals between
antirealists and moderate realists are reflected when it comes to
language: while antirealists hold that language, just like conceptual
thought, merely deals with fictions, moderate realists argue that
language captures real features of the world, even if only in a
distorted fashion. They thereby admit real properties shared by
discrete instances. These properties are (due to commentarial
requirements) presented in negative terms, as “objective
exclusions.” For later Ge-luk authors, the “not being
non-x” (some authors do not bother with the double negation)
shared by several instances is the main object of the convention, while
the corresponding concept, the <em>don spyi</em>, is its
secondary object.</p>

<p>

For a justification of the success of language, antirealists can
appeal to the theory of <em>apoha</em> and the explanation involving
causality in concept formation. Indeed, words reflect conceptual
distinctions that can also be understood as constructed universals;
language can only occur within a system of concepts. In
Dharmakīrti's system, which is here presupposed, words are
associated via conventions not with an object, but with a
“distinction” which requires a bipartition of particulars
in two complementary domains. A word can be associated to this
distinction of xs from non-xs at the time of an agreement.
Subsequently, any use of an utterance that is a token of this word
indicates nothing else than the elimination of non-xs, but can lead to
obtain a particular excluded from non-xs. The causal process involved
in the process of concept formation is what ensures success, provided
that conventions are established and learned successfully.</p>

<p>

(b) The identification of the “directly signified”
prompts divergences among Tibetan scholars.</p>

<p>

For most authors who accept that conceptual cognition has an
appearing, or grasped object, this object (the <em>don
spyi</em>) is also what is directly signified by a word. A word
utterance triggers the emergence of such an appearing object in the
mind of the hearer. The distinction between “direct” and
“conceived” signified supports a distinction between sense
and reference. Distinct words trigger the emergence of distinct
“generic objects”—there are distinct
“directly signified.” The corresponding “conceived
signified” can be distinct as well (for instance for the
emergence of the generic objects “pot” and
“pillar”) or the same (for instance a particular blue pot
is the conceived signified for both the generic objects
“pot” and “blue”). Early Sang-pu authors
contend that some distinct words—true
synonyms—generate the apparition of the same generic
object, thus parting with the ultra-intensionality that reigns in
Dharmakīrti's system, where each word is ascribed a unique
way of excluding something from what it is not.</p>

<p>

Note that the generic object is not unanimously accepted as the
signified even among authors that admit that it is the appearing object
of conceptual thought. Chu-mik-ba for instance prescribes as signified
“a generic object mixed with a generic word.” Accordingly,
what appears in conceptual cognition upon hearing a particular word is
a mixed aspect of the corresponding generic word and generic object.
The extra-mental entity is obtained via an operation of determination
pertaining to the generic object, which is the appearing object of
conceptual thought.</p>

<p>
That conceptual cognitions have an appearing object is not admitted by
all Tibetan scholars, and, as seen above, is criticized in particular
by Sakya Paṇḍita. The latter nevertheless adopts the same
basic model, using for the “directly signified” the more
Dharmakīrtian expression “verbal object” (Tib.
<em>sgra don</em>, Skt. <em>śabdārtha</em>) alternatively to
the expressions “generic object” (<em>don spyi</em>).
However, the point of contention discussed in the context of the
threefold typology of objects re-emerges, as this author insists that
such a signifier actually does not exist (it is not a causally
efficient particular) and is not even properly speaking an
“object.” Sakya Paṇḍita adopts,
phenomenologically speaking, a view that is quite similar to the one he
criticizes: while his opponents speak of a “generic object
appearing to conceptual thought,” Sakya Paṇḍita
accepts that there is the emergence of an “image” or
“reflection” (Tib. <em>gzugs brnyan</em>, Skt.
<em>pratibimba</em>/<em>pratibhā</em>) in conceptual thought. But
as far as meaning is concerned, Sakya Paṇḍita holds the
more radical view that words actually do not signify anything: a word
does not have any object, because nothing qualifies as such. One can
speak, but only metaphorically, of the extra-mental particular as being
“signified” insofar as it is what one obtains when acting
upon the determination in which generic and specific, conceptual and
real, are confused. This extra-mental particular alone can provide the
basis for intersubjective agreement about the object of words. The
generic object could not play this role: being private, it would in any
case not be able to play any epistemic role.</p>

<p>

This model is constructed as a way to bridge the gap between
conceptual processes and reality, and, consequently, focuses on
language use in transactional usage involving real entities. If the use
of words expressing non-entities can be accounted for, it however turns
out to be problematic, in a model where meaning is only acquired
indirectly through a mistaken process of conflating a conceptual
fiction and reality, to talk about abstract entities, such as first- or
second-order properties. For instance, the word “red” could
only acquire a meaning in the sense of a red particular, i.e., as
“something red,” but not as the “property red.”
As a consequence, heterological predicates are ruled out, for both the
word for the subject and the word for the property are related to the
same particular in the process of mistaken identification with an
extra-mental entity. For instance, expressing the idea that “(the
particular) sound is audible but (the property) audible is not
audible” would be problematic if “audible” only means
“what is audible.”</p>

<h3><a name="TheDef">3.2 The theory of definition</a></h3>

<p>

A significant contribution of Tibetan epistemology which can be
included within the philosophy of language is the discussion of
definition and the related issue of predication. The specificity of the
Tibetan theory of definition is that it takes into account not two
elements—a definiens and a
definiendum—but three elements—the
definiens, the definiendum, and the definitional
basis—along a model which bears many similarities
with that of inference. “Defining” thus relies on the
relation between the definiens and the definiendum, but actually
consists in the establishment that some definiendum is fit to be
applied to some definitional basis on account of the relevant
definiens; for instance, that “John is fit to be called
“man” because he is a rational animal,” or to take a
more indigenous example, that “the white calf is fit to be called
“cow” because it has a hump and a dewlap.”</p>

<p>

Discussions on definition focus on the identification of the
instances of each of the three elements (what can be a definiens, a
definiendum, or a definitional basis) and on their respective
definition, leading in particular to the question whether a definiens
requires a definiens. Another issue is that of the nature of the
distinction between the three elements.</p>

<p>

The evaluation of a definition relies on three criteria that a
correct definiens must fulfill: (i) the definiens applies to the
definitional basis, (iii) the definiens can be understood without
relying on an extrinsic motive, and (iii) the definiens has the same
connotation and denotation as the definiendum.</p>

<p>

The second requirement underlines a difference between the definiens
and the definiendum, expressed in Tibetan in terms of the first being
“substantially existent,” the second “nominally
existent.” The latter thus depends on the understanding of
something else—here the definiens. According to the third
requirement, definiens and definiendum must be co-extensive, but only a
single definiens provides the specific denotation of the definiendum.
For instance, “causally efficient” is not the definiens of
“impermanent” even though everything that is causally
efficient is impermanent and vice-versa, because it is not held to be
directly contradictory to “permanent,” the way “not
remaining for a second moment” (the accepted definiens of
“impermanent”) is.</p>
