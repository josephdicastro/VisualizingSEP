<p>

In Germany, the eighteenth century was the age of enlightenment, the
age, that is, that called for the independence of reason. Although the
ethos of this age found its clearest (and certainly its most famous)
articulation towards the end of the century with Immanuel Kant and his
critical philosophy, he was not the first to issue this call. Instead,
that task fell to Christian Thomasius (Thomas) at the end of the
seventeenth century. It was then taken up and further developed in a
theological (pietist) direction by a number of minor figures, the
Thomasians, and reissued in a rationalist direction in the early and
middle part of the eighteenth century by Christian Wolff and his
followers. The development of their position(s) as well as their
philosophical (dis)agreements took place by and large at the University
of Halle and against the context of pietism.</p>

<h2><a name="1">1. Christian Thomasius (1655–1728)</a></h2>

<p>

Although Thomasius is now largely forgotten, he was a pivotal figure
in early eighteenth century enlightenment thought. In this context,
however, he was also a somewhat ambiguous figure. On the one hand, he
was clearly an innovator. Both a lawyer and a philosophy professor, he
advocated the independent use of healthy reason, fought against
prejudice, against belief in any of the then prevailing superstitions,
against any form of (religious) persecution, against the witch-hunt and
the use of torture, and in general, against any form of intolerance. He
took issue with dependence on authority and the school philosophy's
dependence on the syllogism. He lectured in German rather than the
traditional Latin or the then fashionable French and was the first
person, in Germany, to found a popular monthly journal, written by and
large in German, devoted to book reviews, the
<em>Monatsgespräche</em> (<em>Monthly Conversations</em>). On the
other hand, especially when it came to matters of morality, he was more
of a traditionalist. Here he retained distinctly non-Enlightenment
ideas, particularly the belief in an evil will and the belief in the
necessity of God's salvation.</p>

<h3><a name="1.1">1.1 Biography/Work</a></h3>

<p>

By way of background to both Thomasius's and Wolff's life it is
important to note that the Germany of the eighteenth century was a
country split into numerous states, each of which had its own
government. There was no central government. Reeling from the effects
of the Thirty Years War, many of its states did not have freedom of
speech, freedom of religion, or, for that matter, a
‘national’ culture, though, given the variety of state
governments, some states had relatively more freedom than others. It
may seem surprising, therefore, that Christian Thomasius was able to
issue the call to the enlightenment at the end of the seventeenth
century, though not at all surprising that both Thomasius and Wolff
were subject to arbitrary political power.</p>

<p>

The son of jurist and philosopher Jakob Thomasius, Christian
received his education at the University of Leipzig and his law degree
at the University of Frankfurt an der Oder (in Eastern Germany) in
1679. He spent the early part of his career in his hometown Leipzig (in
the state of Saxony), as a lawyer and (private) lecturer at the
university there, but his controversial views and manner of expressing
them, in particular, in the monthly journal
<em>Monatsgespräche</em>, led to the prohibition to publish and
hold lectures (private and academic) in Leipzig (and Saxony) in 1690.
He was, however, welcome in the neighboring and comparatively more
open-minded Halle (in the state of Brandenburg/Prussia), and was
instrumental in founding the university there in 1694. He remained in
Halle for the rest of his life, refusing an invitation to return to
Leipzig in 1709.</p>

<p>

Thomasius's body of work can be roughly divided into three parts. In
his early Leipzig years, he was primarily interested in matters of law,
particularly, following his father, in Pufendorf's natural law theory.
This period ends around 1688 with the publication of <em>Institutiones
jurisprudentiae divinae</em> (<em>Institutions of Divine
Jurisprudence</em>) in which he sought to complete Pufendorf's project
of divorcing natural law from theology. This year, as well, saw the
publication of <em>Introductio ad philosophiam auliam</em>
(<em>Introduction to Court Philosophy</em>), a text that is somewhat
misnamed since it has less to do with proper conduct or even thought at
court than with the proper use of reason, a topic that Thomasius would
take up in greater detail in his 1691 <em>Introduction to the Doctrine
of Reason</em>.</p>

<p>

In general, 1687–8 seems to have marked an endpoint of sorts and the
beginning of the second major stage, the more clearly philosophical
one, of Thomasius's life. Even though he would remain in Leipzig for
another two years, he had clearly broken with tradition by 1687, when
he began lecturing and publishing in German. In 1688, he began the
publication of the controversial <em>Monatsgespräche</em> (which
appeared monthly until April 1690) and turned his attention to matters
of theoretical and practical philosophy. Here two sets of books, the
<em>Einleitung</em> and <em>Ausübung der Vernunftlehre</em>
(<em>Introduction</em> and <em>Application of the Doctrine of
Reason</em>), and the <em>Einleitung</em> and <em>Ausübung der
Sittenlehre (Introduction</em> and <em>Application of Moral
Theory</em>) that appeared in Halle between 1691 and 1696 mark the
second part of his career. Written by and large in German with a
minimum of technical terminology, these books were intended not for an
audience of experts, but instead, as the subtitle to the
<em>Introduction to the Doctrine of Reason</em> specifies, for a
general audience of “all rational persons of whatever social
standing and sex…”</p>

<p>

During the late 1690s (and after a religious crisis that led to an
at least temporary (re)affirmation of his pietist beliefs), Thomasius
produced two works on metaphysics that endorsed a mystical variety of
vitalism. In subsequent years, his interests shifted back to matters of
law. This was the third part of his life and will not be further
considered in this context.</p>

<h3><a name="1.2">1.2 Philosophy</a></h3>

<p>

Thomasius's philosophical stance was an empiricist one, not the
rationalism that we find in much of the philosophical tradition and
with Wolff. It is true that his belief in natural human reason and its
capacity to find truth suggests a mild rationalism, but Thomasius
abhorred innate ideas and maintained that all knowledge, all thought,
begins with sense perception. This strong sensationism (which has
similarities with Locke's position) was coupled, as has already been
noted, with an enlightenment stance, in the sense that it was governed
by the conviction that knowledge, truth and morality are the purview of
everyone, not merely the elect few. The latter is particularly evident
in the differentiation between <em>Gelehrtheit</em> and
<em>Gelahrtheit</em> that he drew at the outset of the <em>Introduction
to the Doctrine of Reason</em>.<em>Gelehrtheit</em> or academic
learning is the domain of experts who are familiar with syllogistic
logic, metaphysics, epistemology, and theology, but
<em>Gelahrtheit</em> or practical learning is available to everyone
with a healthy reason who pursues knowledge not for its own sake but
for the use-value it has in daily life.</p>

<p>

Thomasius's enlightenment convictions are similarly evident in his
eclecticism. Though generally deemed a negative stance, this is not
the case for Thomasius. He considers it positively as a corrective to
any form of sectarian dogmatism. By his own account, he was influenced
by several of his predecessors, notably, by Grotius in the Dutch
Republic and Pufendorf in Germany, and by Hobbes and Locke in England,
and he appropriated those aspects of their theories that he found
conducive to his overall aim: the spread of the Enlightenment ethos,
understood here as the project of ensuring a healthy reason, one that
can discover truth, that can lay open contradictions and fight
prejudices.</p>

<p>

Given Thomasius's basic presuppositions of where knowledge is likely
to be found (in daily life rather than abstract speculation) and who is
most likely to attain it (the person who has a healthy reason, not one
corrupted by prejudices), it is likely not surprising that his
epistemology was not a theoretical one. His two books on theoretical
philosophy, the <em>Introduction to the Doctrine of Reason</em> and the
<em>Application of the Doctrine of Reason</em>, are books on truth.
They are not, however, books on truth in the traditional sense.
Thomasius did not develop a philosophical conception of truth or of the
condition of its possibility. He seems to have simply adopted a
correspondence theory of truth and to have taken the harmony of thought
and thing as a given. Certainly, this harmony was not the problem for
him that it was for 17<sup>th</sup> century thought and that it would
be again in the later part of the 18<sup>th</sup> century (with Wolff,
Knutsen and Kant). What mattered to Thomasius is the enlightenment
optimism that truth is possible and, moreover, accessible to everyone.
His <em>Introduction</em>, accordingly, was presented, as specified by
the book's subtitle, as providing the means by which “all rational
persons, of whatever social standing and sex, are shown in an
understandable manner, and without the aid of syllogisms, how to
differentiate between the true, the probable and the false, and to find
new truths.” It is a book of instruction in proper or correct use of
healthy reason.</p>

<p>

His <em>Application</em> continued this theme, though this time by
providing people with the means of avoiding error. Avoiding error
involves the eradication of prejudices, which are among the causes of
the corruption of reason. That, in turn, is accomplished through what
he identifies as dogmatic doubt, not the Cartesian doubt that deems
everything false so as to find a first indubitable principle, a useless
enterprise, according to Thomasius. Dogmatic doubt is the doubt about
particular things, beliefs, and opinions, and this he found healthy and
conducive to preventing error.</p>

<p>

Thomasius's enlightenment convictions are not, however, as
straightforward as might appear. He did believe in natural reason's
capacity to overcome corruption, but even as he adhered to this view,
he held that an evil will is at the root of this corruption, and that
we require God's grace. This conflict is particularly evident in his
moral philosophy. While his initial presentation was an optimistic
affirmation of the viability of a moral position he identified as one
involving “rational love” (<em>vernünftige Liebe</em>) as the only
means to a “happy, courteous and cheerful life,” as indicated by the
subtitle of the <em>Introduction to Moral Theory</em>, by 1696, he had
become disenchanted with this view. Human self-interest and an evil
will stand in its way.</p>

<p>

Thomasius's moral theory is a theory of the will. He held that in
moral matters, the will dominates reason. Though human beings have free
choice if not externally constrained, the will is not free. Rather, it
is dominated by human affects; our passions, impulses, and desires.
Like Hobbes, Thomasius believed that even though subject to such inner
(psychological) constraints, the will still chooses (with the aid of
reason); it consciously wills. And a conscious choice is precisely what
is required for a (good) action to be considered moral, a good instinct
or good inclinations may make us good, may even be desirable, but by
itself this is not enough to make us moral. Morality requires a
conscious act of will. The trouble with morality arises because the
will is determined by evil desires, in particular, lust, ambition, and
avarice. Although there are noble sentiments as well, which similarly
influence the will, they are in conflict with the negative
dispositions. The conflict can be brought to a positive conclusion only
by appeal to divine grace (God's salvation).</p>

<p>

This ambivalence and return to theology aside, Thomasius's moral
position is an interesting one. The theory of rational love is based on
the fundamental equality of human beings as well as on their ability to
think and choose independently (of authority). Ultimately, Thomasius's
ethics is a social ethics. The theory is other-directed, and given the
absence of laws and principles, constitutes a nice contrast to the
formalist universalist ethics Kant would develop by the end of the next
century. At the same time, the lack of any way of making this theory
applicable in a context governed not by similar but instead by
conflicting interests, makes something like a fomalist ethics an
inevitability. By the end of the <em>Introduction to Moral Theory</em>,
even Thomasius recognises that “rational love” will
function only in relatively harmonious contexts, in others,
particularly those characterised by unequal power positions, justice
may well be required.</p>

<h2><a name="2">2. Christian Wolff (1679–1754)</a></h2>

<p>

It is without question that Christian Wolff was the most important
German philosopher in the early and middle portion of the eighteenth
century. Dissatisfied with the, to his mind, arbitrary eclecticism
advocated by Thomasius and his ‘school,’ and equally
dissatisfied with the scholastic school metaphysics which, he thought,
lacked rigour, he produced a systematic philosophical system in reply.
Indeed, his philosophy is reputed to constitute the most coherent
systematic whole produced in the 18<sup>th</sup> century prior to Kant.
As an enlightenment thinker, albeit a rationalist one, he was, like
Thomasius, committed to public education. He saw philosophy, which he
conceived as world-wisdom (<em>Welt-Weisheit</em>), as the means to
public enlightenment and, in line with the mood of the time, the
purview of everyone, not just of philosophers or experts. To make it
accessible, he wrote in German, at least during his Halle years, and
introduced much of the German philosophical terminology that is still
used (the concepts of <em>Bewußtsein</em>, <em>Vorstellung</em>,
and <em>Begriff</em> have their origin here).</p>

<h3><a name="2.1">2.1 Biography/Work</a></h3>

<p>

Wolff's birthplace was Breslau (then in Eastern Germany, now in
Poland). At an early age, dissatisfied with orthodox theology, he
turned to the study of mathematics as offering the best means to
certainty. He studied theology and mathematics at the University of
Jena and gained his Master's degree in Leizpig in 1702. Influenced by
von Tschirnhaus and while working in Leipzig as a private lecturer, he
wrote a dissertation seeking to apply the mathematical method to
problems in practical philosophy. This drew Leibniz's attention to him.
They began a correspondence that continued until Leibniz's death in
1716. Sponsored by Leibniz and von Tschirnhaus, he was appointed
Professor of Mathematics and Natural Science at the University of Halle
in 1707.</p>

<p>

Since his position in Halle was predominantly as a teacher of
mathematics — a task at which he excelled — Wolff did not begin
lecturing and writing on philosophical matters until 1710. In
mathematics, he produced textbooks, a four volume history of
mathematics in 1710 and a mathematical dictionary in 1711. His
philosophical lectures were in the first instance expositions of
Leibniz's philosophy, which led his opponents (the representatives of
the Thomasius ‘school’) to identify his philosophy as the
Leibniz-Wolffian philosophy, a designation that remained despite his
objection. He began an extensive series of publications, in German and
often identified as his German works, on philosophical topics — the
“German Logic” in 1713, the “German
Metaphysics” in 1719, the “German Ethics” in 1720,
the “German Politics” in 1721, the “German
Cosmology” in 1723, and the “German Theology” in
1724, along with numerous short essays. Given his success as a teacher
and fame as an author, he gained increasing prominence in Halle, much
to the dismay of the “Thomasians” who had dominated
philosophical instruction there. It did not contribute to a smooth
collegial relationship that Wolff did not like Thomasius's eclectic
philosophy and did not hide his dislike. Matters came to a head in 1721
when some political maneuvering on the part of his opponents (the
“Thomasians” and the pietists) likely prompted by his own
increasing fame and popularity with the students combined with his
apparently difficult personality, brought him to the attention of the
emperor in Berlin, Friedrich Wilhelm I, who expelled him from Prussia
in 1723 on threat of hanging.</p>

<p>

Having earlier been invited to the University of Marburg, he took up
the position there. At the time Marburg was a more cosmopolitan place
than Halle, and Wolff now had students from other countries. He saw
himself as speaking to Europeans, not merely Germans, and began writing
in Latin. In fact, he produced a second series of books, in Latin and
identified as his Latin works, going over the same subject matter that
he had treated in his German texts, albeit in more detail. Though even
more scholastic than the earlier German texts, these books contributed
to his fame in a much broader context (Europe rather than Germany). In
1733, Friedrich Wilhelm I invited him to return to Prussia, but Wolff
declined this invitation. He became increasingly well established, so
much so that a cabinet order of 1739 required candidates for the
ministry to study Wolff's books, particularly his logic. In short
order, Wolffians and Wolff societies could be found everywhere, even in
Prussia. In 1740, Frederick the Great recalled him to Prussia, offering
a permanent fellowship in the Berlin Academy. Rather than accept the
invitation to Berlin, he returned to Halle to great acclaim and public
approbation. To his disappointment, however, the mood in Halle had
changed, the residing Wolffians, in particular
 <a href="#4.1">Baumgarten</a>,
 had begun to develop his thought, and his
lectures were not successful. Complaining about the poor quality of the
students, he gave up lecturing but continued writing.</p>

<h3><a name="2.2">2.2 Philosophy</a></h3>

<p>

Wolff was not an original philosopher, but a modernizer and
systematiser. Rather than reject scholastic school philosophy outright,
as Thomasius had done, he modernized and systematised it (and
philosophy as a whole). Systematizing philosophy meant integrating
different ideas from the philosophical tradition — Descartes's concept
of substance, for instance, and Leibniz's theory of pre-established
harmony. But while eclectic in this sense, unlike Thomasius's thought,
Wolff's was anything but arbitrary. Rather, he combined those
ingredients into a comprehensive system on the model of mathematics.
Mathematics was, for Wolff, a systematic science operating by
definition and syllogistic proof, and this was the method he strove to
make applicable to philosophy. In philosophy, the method was cashed out
in a combined analytic/synthetic manner. Definitions were arrived at
analytically — the analysis was to be of empirical matters and was to
convey simple ideas through a process of clarification, abstraction,
and analysis. These were then combined into definitions. The
definitions were to function as ingredients in the syllogisms that
returned, synthetically, to the empirical starting point, though it is
presumably now understood why things are as they are, an understanding
that was, for Wolff, the goal of philosophy.</p>

<p>

The first philosophy text Wolff produced was his “German
Logic” (<em>Vernünfftige Gedancken von den Kräften des
menschlichen Verstandes und ihrem richtigen Gebrauche in Erkenntnis der
Wahrheit</em>). Logic is of central importance to Wolff because it sets
out the rules for thought, which is understanding's ability to forge
connections, according to Wolff a uniquely human ability. All human
beings have natural understanding, but by itself this is not
sufficient. Logic or the “art of demonstration” serves to
refine this natural capacity and functions, as well, as the condition
of science. From the point of view of the enlightenment, it is
instructive here that Wolff insisted, as Thomasius had before him, that
book and memory learning is not the same as knowledge. That requires
the use of the powers of the understanding, and above all, much
practice in the art of thought. While innate, the powers of
understanding have to be honed through practice/experience.</p>

<p>

Wolff's second philosophical treatise, the “German
Metaphysics” (<em>Vernünfftige Gedancken von Gott, der Welt
und der Seele des Menschen, auch allen Dingen überhaupt</em>)
appeared some seven years after the “German Logic”. Just as
that had vindicated the discipline of logic against the early
enlightenment attacks, so this vindicated the discipline of
metaphysics, understood as the “science of the possible as
possible.” After a brief introductory chapter identifying his
Cartesian stance by linking existence to consciousness (we must exist
because we are conscious of ourselves), the “German
Metaphysics” treats ontology, empirical psychology, cosmology,
rational psychology and natural theology. In the second chapter Wolff
sets out the two (Leibnizian) principles governing his philosophical
thought: the principle of contradiction (“something cannot both
be and not be at the same time” §10, 6) and the principle of
sufficient reason (“everything that is must have a sufficient
reason why it is” §30, 17). These are significant not only
from the point of view of Wolff's thought but also in light of the role
they would play in early Kant-criticism. In the chapter on rational
psychology (chapter 5), he defends the Leibnizian conception of
pre-established harmony (§765, 478-9) and, in the final chapter on
natural theology, he tells his readers that the world mirrors God's
perfection (§1045, 648). These are aspects of Wolff's position
with which the (pietist) Thomasians would take issue.</p>

<p>

After the “German Metaphysics” appeared, Wolff published
about a book a year dealing with and integrating into his system other
central philosophical matters: ethics in 1720, politics in 1721,
physics in 1723, teleology in 1724 and biology in 1724.</p>

<p>

The ethics (<em>Vernünfftige Gedancken von der Menschen Thun
und Lassen, zu Berförderung ihrer Glückseligkeit</em>) is
composed of four parts, a theoretical part that treats the foundation
of practical philosophy and three practical parts that present a
doctrine of duties that human beings have to themselves, to God, and to
others. Not surprisingly, given that Wolff believes the world to mirror
God's perfection, the issue in the ethics is perfection as well and
not, as with Thomasius, happiness (that is left for his politics).
Moral perfection is the guideline by which we ought to choose between
two (or more) equally possible actions. That is to say, when making a
free choice we ought to consider whether the action “promotes the
perfection of our inner and outer state” (§2, 5) and that
means considering whether the state of the soul and the body accords
with the prior state or contradicts it. The outcome has greater
perfection to the extent that it contributes to the continued
“natural human state and its harmonious preservation over
time”(§2, 5). The natural human state Wolff envisions is the
state of the soul in its manifold efforts to find truth, and everything
has to be done to maximize that state (see “German
Metaphysics” §152, 79). It so happens, that this is where
happiness lies as well, and as Wolff indicates at the end of the
ethics, it is incumbent upon human beings to ensure not only their own
perfection/happiness, but to “contribute as much as possible to
the happiness of others” (§767, 539).</p>

<p>

In the “German Politics” (<em>Vernünfftige
Gedancken von dem gesellschaftlichen Leben der Menschen und
insonderheit dem gemeinen Wesen</em>), he proceeds to investigate the
varieties of human societies and to specify how they ought to be set up
so as to “promote the uninhibited progression to the common
best” (§3, 3). A society must accord with the laws of
nature, otherwise it cannot be considered a society, and accord with
the laws of nature surely means perfection/happiness.</p>

<p>

Wolff's Latin works appeared with equal regularity in the 1730, with
the “Latin Logic” (<em>Philosophia rationalis sive
logica</em>) beginning the series in 1728. In spite of their greater
thoroughness, or perhaps because of it, they were not as widely read
either in Germany or Europe as a whole. Whereas the German texts went
through several reprints (14 for the Logic, 10 for the Metaphysics),
the “Latin Logic” was only reprinted three times, and some
of the other Latin texts perhaps twice. By the 1730s the German texts
had established Wolff's influence and the Latin texts did little to
change that. They will, accordingly, not be further considered in this
context.</p>

<h2><a name="3">3. Context, Influences and Disciples</a></h2>

<p>

Both Thomasius and Wolff had followers. In Thomasius's case this was
in spite of the fact that he claimed to have no desire to have
disciples or found a school. But given the influence he had on his
contemporaries, it would have been surprising if there had not been
anyone who saw himself as following in his footsteps and, more
importantly, taking up his cause (against Wolff). Among Thomasius's
contemporaries to do so were Franz Budde (1667–1729), Joachim Lange
(1670–1744), Andreas Rüdiger (1673–1731), and Adolf Friedrich
Hoffmann (1707–1741). Christian August Crusius (?1715–1775) was a later
follower (Hoffmann's student) who came on the philosophical scene when
Wolffianism was already starting to decline.</p>

<p>

Wolff's followers were perhaps more varied than those following and
rejecting Thomasius. Indeed, by the 1740s, Wolffianism had become the
leading German philosophy and had spread to the major German
universities: to Halle (with Wolff, A. G. Baumgarten, though he moved
on to Frankfurt an der Oder), G. F. Meier, and J. A. Eberhard, who is
known particularly for the role he played in early Kant-criticism), to
Marburg where virtually every academic was a Wolffian, to Giessen (with
J. F. Müller, and Böhm), to Tübingen (with Georg
Bernhard Bilfinger, Israel Gottlob Ganz and Gottfried Plouquet), to
Leipzig (with Gottsched and Ludovici), to Jena (with Johann Peter
Reusch and Joachim George Darjes), and to Königsberg (with
Knutsen, Kant's teacher).</p>

<p>

The reception of Wolff's philosophy is interesting not only in view
of its widespread acceptance, but also in light of the disputes it
generated and the further developments it gave rise to. Chief among
these disputes were (1) the attack by the pietists (Budde and Lange)
that led to Wolff's dismissal from Halle and (2) the attack by the
Thomasians (Hoffmann and Crusius). Further developments of the Wolffian
philosophy can be found particularly in the domain of
 <a href="#4.1">aesthetics</a>
 with Gottsched and Baumgarten.</p>

<h3><a name="3.1">3.1 Pietism</a></h3>

<p>

The development of early and even mid-enlightenment thought in
18<sup>th</sup> century Germany proceeded hand in hand with the then
relatively new (protestant) religious trend: pietism. Like the
discontent that the representatives of the early enlightenment had with
authority and, at least in the early years, intellectual life, those of
pietism took issue with the (religious) orthodoxy and its
intellectualism. Furthermore, rather than endorse obedience and
conformity to the establishment, the pietist movement emphasized the
subjective aspect of faith: a person's experience, feeling, and, above
all, personal participation in religious matters and performances. The
emphasis on the subjective and personal, and on people's actual
participation in religion made pietism an ideal companion for early
enlightenment thought. At issue here was not academic competence, not
the cognitive aspect of religion, but its affective aspect with
emphasis on devotion and practical service, just as what was at issue
in the early enlightenment was not the intellectual aspect of reason,
but its practical performance and service. And both movements were
characterized by a commitment to egalitarianism.</p>

<p>

This is not to say that the parallel development was always or even
necessarily harmonious. In Halle, the chief representative of pietism
was August Hermann Francke (1663–1722), who had been brought there by
Thomasius. But Thomasius and Francke did not see eye to eye on all
matters. While Thomasius had endorsed Francke's practical activism (he
was the founder of the Halle orphanage), he broke with Francke by 1699,
criticising his educational policies for producing “uneducated,
melancholy, fantastic, obstinate, recalcitrant, and spiteful men”
(cited in Beck, 253). It is not clear what, if any, philosophical
reasons Thomasius had for turning against Francke. However, the details
of their disagreement are not important for the development of
18<sup>th</sup> century philosophy.</p>

<h3><a name="3.2">3.2 The Thomasians</a></h3>

<p>

Budde and Lange, both ultimately Professors of Theology at Jena and
Halle respectively, developed Thomasius's thought in a theological
(pietist) direction. That is to say, both, and Lange more so than
Budde, emphasized the need for revelation to a greater extent that
Thomasius had done, as they also claimed that the source of evil was
the will and that the root cause of evil was original sin. Though
Thomasius could be found to hold these views as well, particularly
during the completion of his <em>Application of Moral Theory</em>,
their difference from Thomasius lies in the emphasis they placed on
these views. Moreover, in his major work, <em>Medicina Mentis</em>,
Lange devoted a great deal of attention to demonstrating how the ill or
corrupt will and mind might be healed.</p>

<p>

It is interesting that there were differences not just from the
theological dimension of Thomasius's thought, but also in the
philosophical respect. Here it is particularly noteworthy that in his
philosophical texts Budde sought a systematic whole and was not content
to adopt Thomasius's more eclectic style. Though he claimed to be an
eclectic, he thought this did not entail that he could not provide a
unified whole. That whole is provided by his three books in philosophy.
The theoretical philosophy can be found in the <em>Institutiones
Philosophiae Eclecticae</em> that appeared in two parts in Halle in
1703. The two parts are the “Elementa philosophiae
theoreticae,” roughly a metaphysics, and the “Elementa
philosophiae instrumentalis,” Budde's logic. Along with the
earlier work in practical philosophy, the<em>Elementae Philosophiae
Practicae</em>, originally published in 1697 but significantly revised
for the 1703 edition, these texts constitute Budde's philosophical
system.</p>

<p>

Rüdiger, Hoffmann, and Crusius were related through
teacher-student relationships with Rüdiger teaching Hoffmann who
then taught Crusius. See below
 (<a href="#3.4">Disputes</a>)
 for an
account of the role they, and Crusius in particular, played in the
disagreement of the Thomasians with Wolff.</p>

<h3><a name="3.3">3.3 The Wolffians</a></h3>

<p>

Wolff's enlightenment rationalism had made a decisive impact on the
philosophical scene in Germany in the 1720s. Over the middle years of
the 18<sup>th</sup>century, and against objections from both Thomasians
and pietism, Wolffianism took hold, at least for a time. Certainly, the
events that led to his expulsion from Halle contributed to his
notoriety and fame. Philosophers took up his cause in virtually all the
universities in Eastern and Northern Germany, occasionally developing
his philosophical system in different directions. Among the chief
representatives of Wolffianism were, in Leipzig, J. C. Gottsched
(1700–1766), in Frankfurt an der Oder, Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten
(1714–62) and H. F. Meier, who were instrumental in founding
Aesthetics, in Königsberg, Kant's teacher Martin Knutsen
(1713–51). Wolffianism also played a central role in the early
criticisms of Kant's critical philosophy. There it was represented
primarily by Eberhard, Maaß, and Schwab and in the major review
journal at the time, Nicolai's <em>Allgemeine deutsche Bibliothek</em>.
(See Allison, <em>The Kant-Eberhard Controversy</em>). There can be no
question that Wolffianism dominated German universities during the
1720s to the 1740s, though it disintegrated to some extent soon after
his death in 1754 with, among other things, the development of
aesthetics.</p>

<h3><a name="3.4">3.4 Disputes</a></h3>

<p>

Given the two radically different approaches to issuing the
enlightenment call to the independent use of reason that we find in the
18<sup>th</sup> century, it is not surprising that the age should have
its share of disputes. This was particularly evident in the
disagreements surrounding Wolff and Wolffianism. It has already been
indicated above that two attacks in particular stand out (1) the attack
that led to his expulsion from Halle and (2) the attack that was
mounted by Hoffmann and Crusius.</p>

<p>

The first attack was mounted by Thomasius's pietist followers. They,
in particular Budde and Lange, centered their opposition to Wolffianism
around the fatalism and Spinozism they thought implied by his system.
Also, Wolff's dependence on the mathematical method and the
subordination of the divine will to necessity were questioned.
Similarly, the Leibnizian doctrine of pre-established harmony of soul
and body that the critics attributed to Wolff was thought to be at odds
with the possibility of free will, and with that, responsibility for
our actions. If the interaction of soul and body has to be pre-ordained
or pre-established, then it is not possible that we could act otherwise
than we have been determined to act, and the notions of responsibility
and sin are only a chimera. It must be added here that the critique of
the belief in a free will is justified. Wolff struggled with this
possibility as much as Leibniz had done, and it is simply not clear
that given their adherence to pre-established harmony, either one
managed to resolve the conundrum on the ontological level.</p>

<p>

It is an interesting footnote to these disputes that while Thomasius
himself did not participate in these disputes, Wolff did. In 1724 he
published a detailed reply to Budde and Lange's critique of the German
Metaphysics (<em>Kleine Kontroversschriften mit Joachim Lange und
Johann Franz Budde</em>) and he also took their concerns up in the
<em>Anmerkungen</em> to the German Metaphysics.</p>

<p>

The second attack was mounted by those Thomasians who did not
foreground their pietism, Andreas Rüdiger (1673–1731), Adolf
Friedrich Hoffmann (1707–1741), and Christian August Crusius
(?1715–1775). Rüdiger and Hoffmann attacked Wolff on a number of
issues (the relation of mind and body, for instance, which they took to
constitute a unity, not two distinct substances, the difference between
the mathematical and the philosophical methods, and the question of the
will's role in ethics). At least some of these issues were taken up by
Crusius, who was the last Thomasian to take issue with Wolff.</p>

<p>

Crusius did his philosophical work in Leipzig in the 1740s before
taking on the professorship of Theology in 1751. Like earlier
Thomasians, he questioned Wolff's subordination of the will to reason,
arguing for the freedom of the former against what he takes to be
Wolff's fatalism, though he was willing to concede that the will
requires understanding. Perhaps the most significant aspect of Crusius'
thought was his differentiation between the philosophical and
mathematical methods. Whereas mathematics is said to be grounded on the
principle of contradiction, this is not the case for philosophy. That
has to do with real objects, with nature, its structures and forces,
not with the abstract and artificial concepts of mathematics. At the
same time, he also thought there was a role for mathematics in the
analysis of nature — it could provide concepts of bodies and their
relations. Of course, as his contemporaries pointed out, one wonders
why mathematics should have a role in the investigation of the
“real” world if the nature of its abstraction made it
distinct from the (concrete) real world. Crusius did not have an answer
to these questions, but it was a topic that Kant would take on in his
pre-critical project.</p>

<h2><a name="4">4. Beyond Wolff</a></h2>

<p>

With the decline of Wolffianism after 1754, German philosophy was
for a time at loose ends. The decline was prompted not only by the
criticisms offered by the Thomasians, but also by the internal
developments of Wolffianism proposed by various of Wolff's disciples.
Hermann Samuel Reimarus (1694–1768), for instance, developed a
rationalist critique of revelation, arguing that for the rational
person religion had to be based on reason (<em>Apologie oder
Schützschrift für die vernünftigen Verehrer Gottes</em>,
published posthumously). Others began to extend Wolffianism into areas
Wolff himself had not considered, thereby contributing to significant
development. Here the area of
 <a href="#4.1">aesthetics</a>
 is paramount. Moreover, by the middle of the 18<sup>th</sup> century,
French, English, and Scottish texts(particularly
Hume's <em>Inquiry</em> and Locke's <em>Essay</em>) and some of the
texts by the
 <a href="#4.2">common sense</a>
 philosophers (Beattie, Oswald, and Reid) along with others began to be
available in translation, thus offering clear alternatives to Wolffian
rationalism.  These texts were immensely influential. Recall Kant's
claim that his recollection of David Hume had awoken him from his
dogmatic slumber (<em>Prolegomena</em>, <em>Ak</em>. IV, 260). The
empiricists, for instance Feder and Garve, also played a significant
role in early Kant-criticism (see Beiser, <em>The Fate of Reason</em>
and Sassen, <em>Kant's Early Critics</em>). By and large, the period
of 18<sup>th</sup> century German philosophy after 1750 and before
1781 was a period not of any one dominant school, but of individuals
loosely associated with a number of different trends. Among
individuals who cannot be clearly assigned anywhere were Johann
Heinrich Lambert, Moses Mendelssohn and Johann Nikolaus Tetens. Not
either Thomasians or Wolffians, they must be considered in relation to
Kant's pre-critical and critical philosophy, not from the point of
view of German philosophy prior to Kant.</p>

<h3><a name="4.1">4.1 Aesthetics</a></h3>

<p>

Even though Wolff sought to integrate virtually all aspects of
philosophy into his system, he had nothing to say about the philosophy
of art. In some way this is not surprising if we consider that in the
Germany of the early Enlightenment, the arts, particularly poetry and
literature, were as good as nonexistent. The German literary greats had
not even been born when Wolff wrote his German texts (Lessing was born
in 1729, Herder in 1744, Goethe in 1749). First to develop a theory of
the arts, particularly poetry, was Johann Christoph Gottsched
(1700–1766), who published his ‘Critical Poetry’
(<em>Versuch einer critischen Dichtkunst vor die Deutschen</em>) in
1730. Treating poetry scientifically, he set out a set of rules that
were to guide the composition. Given his conception of what a poem was
(a moral fable) and given as well his idea of what was involved in its
composition (a set of rules), there was little room here for beauty and
even less for sentiment and inspiration. But sentiment and inspiration
was precisely the direction in which poetry was going by the middle of
the century. Gottsched's Wolffian philosophy of poetry, accordingly,
was quickly supplanted by Johann Jakob Breitinger's <em>Critische
Abhandlung</em> (1740), a book that emphasized the <em>a
posteriori</em> experience of poetry, not its rule-bound
composition.</p>

<p>

A quasi-Wolffian synthesis of these two approaches was brought about
by Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten (1714–1762), probably Wolff's most
famous disciple. Baumgarten produced two major texts, his metaphysics
in 1739 (<em>Metaphysica</em>), which Kant would use as a textbook,
and, in 1750 and 1758, his aesthetics <em>(Aesthetica</em>). That he
designated the term ‘aesthetics’ to identify the philosophy
of art, particularly poetry, would hardly be thought important had he
done nothing else. However, in developing the ‘field’ of
aesthetics, he also contributed significantly to the study of the
senses. Whereas Wolff had conceived of the senses merely as providing
the raw material for processing, a task performed by understanding and
governed by the rules of logic, Baumgarten thought that the senses had
their own rules and their own perfection, rules and perfection that
differ from logical rules and the knowledge generated by logical
processing. The rules of sensation are studied by the science of
perception, which Baumgarten called aesthetics. But aesthetics is also
the study of poetry. In <em>Reflections on Poetry</em> he set out the
notion of aesthetic clarity. Although poetic representations are
confused representations (§14, 42), they have sensuous clarity.
Baumgarten identified this clarity as <em>extensive</em> clarity to
differentiate it from the <em>intensive</em> clarity of logic
(§17, 43). Appealing to the senses, poetic representation can be
more illuminating than representations produced by logical processing
and reasoning. Moreover, appealing to the affects, such representations
are connected to pleasure. One cannot but see the influence that
Baumgarten likely had on Kant's critical philosophy — his vindication
of the senses reappears in an inherently Kantian way both in the
Transcendental Aesthetic of the <em>Critique of Pure Reason</em> and in
the <em>Critique of Judgment</em>.</p>

<h3><a name="4.2">4.2 Common Sense</a></h3>

<p>
Given the absence of a dominant school of thought by roughly the
middle of the century, German philosophers began to look elsewhere for
inspiration.  One of the directions in which they looked was to
Scottish common sense thought, as articulated, for instance, by Thomas
Reid (1710–1796), James Beattie (1735–1803), and James
Oswald (1703–1793).  Common sense was then not new to Germany;
the notion had first been introduced by Thomasius as
“healthy” or “common” reason, but Thomasius
had been more interested in commonsense reasoning in the practical
domain than in the epistemological and metaphysical implications of
the notion (on Thomasius, see above).</p>

<p>

Common sense philosophy appeared in Germany beginning in the 1760s.
Work by Beattie, Oswald, and Reid was translated into German and
French, then better known in Germany than English, and it was also
widely reviewed in both German and French journals (for details, see
the Bibliography).  It appealed to German thinkers at least in part
because they believed it offered a reply to scepticism. </p>

<p>

Here it is instructive that Feder, the leader of the Göttingen
empiricists, who had been responsible for the first review of the
first edition of the <em>Critique of Pure Reason</em> that was received
negatively by Kant (see <em>Kant's Early Critics</em>, 7–9,
53–58), also reviewed Reid's work, but provided a much more
positive evaluation of the latter.  Indeed, he identified
Reid's <em>Essay</em> as “one of the most important products of
speculative philosophy” (<em>Philosophische Bibliothek</em> 1, 1788,
43).  This stands in stark contrast to his evaluation of
the <em>Critique</em> where he complained that Kant had needlessly
confused language, thereby hiding the, to him, unfortunate idealist
implications of Kant's philosophy (<em>Kant's Early Critics</em>, 58).
Although there were certainly other figures in eighteenth century
Germany to discuss common sense (for instance, Eberhard, Tetens,
Mendelssohn), I single out Feder because he was an influential figure
at the time and played a central role in early Kant-criticism.</p>

<p>

In view of the availability of at least some of the texts of the
Scottish common sense philosophers and their discussion in the
literature, it is legitimate to assume that Kant would have been
familiar with the work available in translation (see also
Kuehn, <em>Scottish common Sense in Germany</em>, 167–207).
Kant did discuss common sense in the critical philosophy.  In
the <em>Prolegomena</em>, for instance, we find the well known
condemnation of Reid, Oswald, and Beattie (erroneously, along with
Priestley, who was not a common sense philosopher).  Hume, by
contrast, is considered a “deep thinker”, not one who is
content to appeal to common sense or common understanding as if that
would answer the most difficult metaphysical questions (AA IV,
260ff).</p>
