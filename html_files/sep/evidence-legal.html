<h1>The Legal Concept of Evidence</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Fri Nov 13, 2015</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>The legal concept of evidence is neither static nor universal.
Medieval understandings of evidence in the age of trial by ordeal
would be quite alien to modern sensibilities (Ho 2003–2004) and
there is no approach to evidence and proof that is shared by all
legal systems of the world today. Even within Western legal
traditions, there are significant differences between Anglo-American
law and Continental European law (see Damaška 1973, 1975,
1992, 1994, 1997). This entry focuses on the modern concept of
evidence that operates in the legal tradition to which Anglo-American
law belongs.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-1" id="ref-1">1</a>]</sup></p>

<p>It may seem obvious that there must be a <em>legal</em> concept of
evidence that is distinguishable from the ordinary concept of
evidence.  After all, there are in law many special rules on what can
or cannot be introduced as evidence in court, on how evidence is to be
presented and the uses to which it may be put, on the strength or
sufficiency of evidence needed to establish proof and so forth. But
the law remains silent on some crucial matters. In resolving the
factual disputes before the court, the jury or, at a bench trial, the
judge has to rely on extra-legal principles. There have been academic
attempts at systematic analysis of the operation of these principles
in legal fact-finding (Wigmore 1937; Anderson, Schum and Twining
2009). These principles, so it is claimed, are of a general nature. On
the basis that the logic in “drawing inferences from evidence to
test hypotheses and justify conclusions” is governed by the same
principles across different disciplines (Twining and Hampsher-Monk
2003: 4), ambitious projects have been undertaken to develop a
cross-disciplinary framework for the analysis of evidence (Schum 1994)
and to construct an interdisciplinary “integrated science of
evidence” (Dawid, Twining and Vasilaki 2011; cf. Tillers
2008).</p>

<p>While evidential reasoning in law and in other contexts may share
certain characteristics, there nevertheless remain aspects of the
approach to evidence and proof that are distinctive to law (Rescher
and Joynt 1959). Section 1 (“conceptions of evidence”)
identifies different meanings of evidence in legal discourse. When
lawyers talk about evidence, what is it that they are referring to?
What is it that they have in mind? Section 2 (“conditions for
receiving evidence”) approaches the concept of legal evidence
from the angle of what counts as evidence in law. What are the
conditions that the law imposes and must be met for something to be
received by the court as evidence? Section 3 (“strength of
evidence”) shifts the attention to the stage where the evidence
has already been received by the court. Here the focus is on how the
court weighs the evidence in reaching the verdict. In this connection,
three properties of evidence will be discussed: probative value,
sufficiency and degree of completeness.</p>

<h2><a id="ConEviWhaDoeEviRefLaw">1. Conceptions of Evidence: What does Evidence Refer to in Law?</a></h2>

<p>Stephen (1872: 3–4, 6–7) long ago noted that legal
usage of the term “evidence” is ambiguous. It sometimes
refers to that which is adduced by a party at the trial as a means of
establishing factual claims. (“Adducing evidence” is the
legal term for presenting or producing evidence in court for the
purpose of establishing proof.) This meaning of evidence is reflected
in the definitional section of the Indian Evidence Act (Stephen 1872:
149).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-2" id="ref-2">2</a>]</sup> When
lawyers use the term “evidence” in this way, they have in
mind what epistemologists would think of as “objects of sensory
evidence” (Haack 2004: 48). Evidence, in this sense, is divided
conventionally into three main
categories:<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-3" id="ref-3">3</a>]</sup>
oral evidence (the testimony given in court by witnesses),
documentary evidence (documents produced for inspection by the
court), and “real evidence”; the first two are
self-explanatory and the third captures things other than documents
such as a knife allegedly used in committing a crime.</p>

<p>The term “evidence” can, secondly, refer to a
proposition of fact that is established by evidence in the first
sense.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-4" id="ref-4">4</a>]</sup> This
is sometimes called an “evidential fact”. That the
accused was at or about the scene of the crime at the relevant time
is evidence in the second sense of his possible involvement in the
crime. But the accused’s presence must be proved by producing
evidence in the first sense. For instance, the prosecution may call a
witness to appear before the court and get him to testify that he saw
the accused in the vicinity of the crime at the relevant
time. Success in proving the presence of the accused (the evidential
fact) will depend on the fact-finder’s assessment of the
veracity of the witness and the reliability of his testimony. (The
fact-finder is the person or body responsible for ascertaining where
the truth lies on disputed questions of fact and in whom the power to
decide on the verdict vests. The fact-finder is also called
“trier of fact” or “judge of fact”.
Fact-finding is the task of the jury or, for certain types of cases
and in countries without a jury system, the judge.) Sometimes the
evidential fact is directly accessible to the fact-finder. If the
alleged knife used in committing the crime in question (a form of
“real evidence”) is produced in court, the fact-finder
can see for himself the shape of the knife; he does not need to learn
of it through the testimony of an intermediary.</p>

<p>A third conception of evidence is an elaboration or extension of
the second. On this conception, evidence is relational. A factual
proposition (in Latin, <em>factum probans</em>) is evidence in the
third sense only if it can serve as a premise for drawing an
inference (directly or indirectly) to a matter that is material to
the case (<em>factum probandum</em>)
(see <a href="#MatFacIss">section 2.2</a> below for the concept of
materiality). The fact that the accused’s fingerprints were
found in a room where something was stolen is evidence in the present
sense because one can infer from this that he was in the room, and
his presence in the room is evidence of his possible involvement in
the theft. On the other hand, the fact that the accused’s
favorite color is blue would, in the absence of highly unusual
circumstances, be rejected as evidence of his guilt: ordinarily, what
a person’s favorite color happens to be cannot serve as a
premise for any reasonable inference towards his commission of a
crime and, as such, it is irrelevant (see discussion of relevance
in <a href="#RelA">section 2.1</a> below). In the third sense of
“evidence”, which conceives of evidence as a premise for
a material inference, “irrelevant evidence” is an
oxymoron: it is simply not evidence. Hence, this statement of Bentham
(1825: 230):<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-5" id="ref-5">5</a>]</sup></p>

<blockquote> <p> To say that testimony is not pertinent, is to say
that it is foreign to the case, has no connection with it, and does
not serve to prove the fact in question; in a word, it is to say, that
it is not evidence.</p> </blockquote>

<p>There can be evidence in the first sense without evidence in the
second or third sense. To pursue our illustration, suppose it emerges
during cross-examination of the expert that his testimony of having
found a finger-print match was a lie. Lawyers would describe this
situation as one where the “evidence” (the testimony of
the expert) fails to prove the fact that it was originally produced to
prove and not that no “evidence” was adduced on the
matter.  Here “evidence” is used in the first
sense—evidence as testimony—and the testimony remains in
the court’s record whether it is believed or not. But lawyers
would also say that, in the circumstances, there is no
“evidence” that the accused was in the room, assuming that
there was nothing apart from the discredited expert testimony of a
fingerprint match to establish his presence there. Here, the
expert’s testimony is shown to be false and fails to establish
that the accused’s fingerprints were found in the room, and
there is no (other) factual basis for believing that he was in the
room. The factual premise from which an inference is sought to be
drawn towards the accused’s guilt is not established.</p>

<p>Fourthly, the conditions for something to be received (or, in
technical term “admitted”) as evidence at the trial are
sometimes included in the legal concept of evidence. (These conditions
are discussed in <a href="#ConForRecEviWhaCouEviLaw">section 2</a>
below.) On this conception, legal evidence is that which counts as
evidence in law. Something may ordinarily be treated as evidence and
yet be rejected by the court. Hearsay is often cited as an example. It
is pointed out that reliance on hearsay is a commonplace in ordinary
life. We frequently rely on hearsay in forming our factual beliefs. In
contrast, “hearsay is not evidence” in legal proceedings
(Stephen 1872: 4–5). As a general rule, the court will not rely
on hearsay as a premise for an inference towards the truth of what is
asserted. It will not allow a witness to testify in court that another
person <i>X</i> (who is not brought before the court) said
that <i>p</i> on a certain occasion (an out-of-court statement) for
the purpose of proving that <i>p</i>.</p>

<p>In summary, at least four possible conceptions of legal evidence
are in currency: as an object of sensory evidence, as a fact, as an
inferential premise and as that which counts as evidence in law. The
sense in which the term “evidence” is being used is seldom
made explicit in legal discourse although the intended meaning will
often be clear from the context.</p>

<h2><a id="ConForRecEviWhaCouEviLaw">2. Conditions for Receiving Evidence: What Counts as Evidence in Law?</a></h2>

<p>This section picks up on the fourth conception of evidence. To
recall, something will be accepted by the court as evidence—it
is, to use Montrose’s term, <em>receivable</em> as evidence in
legal proceedings—only if three basic conditions are
satisfied: <em>relevance</em>, <em>materiality</em>
and <em>admissibility</em> (Montrose 1954). These three conditions of
receivability are discussed in turn below.</p>

<h3><a id="RelA">2.1 Relevance</a></h3>

<h4><a id="LegSigRel">2.1.1 Legal Significance of Relevance</a></h4>

<p>The concept of relevance plays a pivotal role in legal
fact-finding.  Thayer (1898: 266, 530) articulates its significance
in terms of two foundational principles of the law of evidence:
first, without exception, nothing which is not relevant may be
received as evidence by the court and secondly, subject to many
exceptions and qualifications, whatever is relevant is receivable as
evidence by the court.  Thayer’s view has been influential and
finds expression in sources of law, for example, in Rule 402 of the
Federal Rules of Evidence in the United
States.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-6" id="ref-6">6</a>]</sup>
Thayer claims, and it is now widely accepted, that relevance is a
“logical” and not a legal concept;
in <a href="#LogRelVerLegRel">section 2.1.3</a>, we will examine this
claim and the dissent expressed by Wigmore. Leaving aside the
dissenting view for the moment, we will turn first to consider
possible conceptions of relevance in the conventional sense of
logical relevance.</p>

<h4><a id="ConLogRel">2.1.2 Conceptions of Logical Relevance</a></h4>

<p>Evidence may be adduced in legal proceedings to prove a fact only
if the fact is relevant. Relevance is a relational concept. No fact is
relevant in itself; it is relevant only in relation to another fact.
The term “probable” is often used to describe this
relation. We see two instances of this in the following well-known
definitions. According to Stephen (1886: 2, emphasis added):</p>

<blockquote> <p> The word “relevant” means that any two
facts to which it is applied are so related to each other that
according to the common course of events one either taken by itself or
in connection with other facts proves or renders <em>probable</em> the
past, present, or future existence or non-existence of the
other.</p></blockquote>

<p>The second definition is contained in the United States’
Federal Rule of Evidence 401 which (in its restyled version) states
that evidence is relevant if “it has a tendency to make a fact
more or less <em>probable</em> than it would be without the
evidence” (emphasis added). The word “probable” in
these and other standard definitions is sometimes construed as
carrying the mathematical meaning of
probability.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-7" id="ref-7">7</a>]</sup>
In a leading article, Lempert gave this example to show how relevance
turns on the likelihood ratio. The prosecution produces evidence that
the perpetrator’s blood found at the scene of the crime is type
A. The accused has the same blood type. Suppose fifty percent of the
suspect population has type A blood. If the accused is in fact
guilty, the probability that the blood found at the scene will be
type A is 1.0. But if he is in fact innocent, the probability of
finding type A blood at the scene is 0.5—that is, it matches
the background probability of type A blood from the suspect
population. The likelihood ratio is the ratio of the first
probability to the second—1.0:0.5 or, more simply, 2:1.
Evidence is considered relevant so long as the likelihood ratio is
other than 1:1 (Lempert 1977). If the ratio is 1:1, that means that
the probability of the evidence is the same whether the accused is
guilty or innocent.</p>

<p>The conventional view is that relevance in law is a binary concept:
evidence is either relevant or it is not. So long as the likelihood
ratio is other than 1:1, the evidence is considered
relevant.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-8" id="ref-8">8</a>]</sup>
However, the greater the likelihood ratio deviates from 1:1, the
higher the so-called probative value of the evidence (that is, on one
interpretation of probative value). We will take a closer look at
probative value in <a href="#ProValSpeIteEvi">section 3.1</a>
below.</p>

<p>While the likelihood ratio may be useful as a heuristic device in
analysing evidential reasoning, it is controversial as to whether it
captures correctly the concept of relevance. In the first place, it is
unclear that the term “probable” in the standard
definitions of relevance was ever intended as a reference to
mathematical probability. Some have argued that relevance should be
understood broadly such that any evidence would count as relevant so
long as it provides some reason in support of the conclusion that a
proposition of fact material to the case is true or false (Pardo 2013:
576–577).</p>

<p>The mathematical conception of relevance has been disputed. At a
trial, it is very common for the opposing sides to present competing
accounts of events that share certain features. To use Allen’s
example, the fact that the accused drove to a particular town on a
particular day and time is consistent with the prosecution’s
case that he was driving there to commit a murder and also with the
defence’s case that he was driving there to visit his mother.
This fact, being a common feature of both sides’ explanations of
the material events, is as consistent with the hypothesis of guilt as
with the hypothesis of innocence. On the likelihood ratio conception
of relevance, this fact should be irrelevant and hence evidence of it
should not be allowed to be adduced. But in such cases, the court will
let the evidence in (Park et al. 2010: 10). The mathematical theory of
relevance cannot account for this. It is argued that an alternative
theory of relevance better fits legal practice and is thus to be
preferred. On an explanatory conception of relevance, evidence is
relevant if it is explained by or provides a reason for believing the
particular explanation of the material events offered by the side
adducing the evidence, and it remains relevant even where, as in our
example, the evidence also supports or forms part of the explanation
offered by the opponent (Pardo and Allen 2008: 241–2; Pardo
2013: 600).</p>

<p>One possible response to the above challenge to the likelihood
ratio theory of relevance is to deny that it was ever meant to be
the <em>exclusive</em> test of relevance. Evidence is relevant if the
likelihood ratio is other than 1:1. But evidence may also be relevant
on other grounds, such as when it provides for a richer narrative or
helps the court in understanding other evidence. It is for these
reasons that witnesses are routinely allowed to give their names and
parties may present diagrams, charts and floor plans (so-called
“demonstrative evidence”) at the trial (McCormick 2013:
995). The admission of evidence in the scenario painted by Allen above
has been explained along a similar line (Park et al. 2010: 16).</p>

<h4><a id="LogRelVerLegRel">2.1.3 Logical Relevance versus Legal Relevance</a></h4>

<p>The concept of relevance examined in the preceding section is
commonly known as “logical relevance”. This is somewhat of
a misnomer: “Relevance is not a matter of logic, but depends on
matters of fact” (Haack 2004: 46). In our earlier example, the
relevance of the fact that the accused has type A blood depends
obviously on the state of the world. On the understanding that
relevance is a probabilistic relation, it is tempting to think that in
describing relevance as “logical”, one is subscribing to a
logical theory of probability (cf. Franklin 2011). However, the term
“logical relevance” was not originally coined with this
connotation in mind. In the forensic context, “logic” is
used loosely and refers to the stock of background beliefs or
generalisations and the type of reasoning that judges and lawyers are
fond of labelling as “commonsense” (MacCrimmon
2001–2002; Twining 2006: 334–335).</p>

<p>A key purpose of using the adjective “logical” is to
flag the non-legal character of relevance. As Thayer (1898: 269)
famously claimed, relevance “is an affair of logic and not of
law.” This is not to say that relevance has no legal dimension.
The law distinguishes between questions of law and questions of fact.
An issue of relevance poses a question of law that is for the judge to
decide and not the jury, and so far as relevance is defined in legal
sources (for example, in Federal Rule of Evidence 401 mentioned
above), the judge must pay heed to the legal definition. But legal
definitions of relevance are invariably very broad. Relevance is said
to be a logical, and non-legal, concept in the sense that in answering
a question of relevance and in applying the definition of relevance,
the judge has necessarily to rely on extra-legal resources and is not
bound by legal precedents. Returning to Federal Rule of Evidence 401,
it states generally that evidence is relevant if “it has a
tendency to make a fact more or less probable than it would be without
the evidence”. In deciding whether the evidence sought to be
adduced does have this tendency, the judge has to look outside the
law. Thayer was most insistent on this. As he put it, “[t]he law
furnishes no test of relevancy. For this, it tacitly refers to logic
and general experience” (Thayer 1898: 265). That the
accused’s favorite color is blue is, barring extraordinary
circumstances, irrelevant to the question of his intention to commit
theft. It is not the law that tells us so but “logic and general
experience”. On Thayer’s view, the law does not control or
regulate the assessment of relevance; it assumes that judges are
already in possession of the (commonsense) resources to undertake this
assessment.</p>

<p>Wigmore adopts a different position. He argues, against Thayer,
that relevance is a legal concept. There are two strands to his
contention.  The first is that for evidence to be relevant in law,
“a generally higher degree of probative value” is required
“than would be asked in ordinary reasoning”;</p>

<blockquote><p> legal relevance denotes…something more than
a minimum of probative value. Each single piece of evidence must have
a plus value. (cf. Pattenden 1996–7: 373)</p></blockquote>

<p> As Wigmore sees it, the requirement of
“plus value” guards against the jury “being
satisfied by matters of slight value, capable to being exaggerated by
prejudice and hasty reasoning” (Wigmore 1983b: 969,
cf. 1030–1031).  Opponents of Wigmore acknowledge that there
may be sound policy reasons for excluding evidence of low probative
value. Receiving the evidence at the trial might raise a multiplicity
of issues, take too much time and expense, confuse the jurors or
produce undue prejudice in their mind. When the judge excludes
evidence for any of these reasons, and the judge has the discretion
to do so in many countries, the evidence is excluded <em>despite</em>
it being relevant (e.g., United States’ Federal Rule of
Evidence 403).  Relevance is a relation between facts and the
aforesaid reasons for exclusion are extrinsic to that relation; they
are grounded in considerations such as limitation of judicial
resources and jury psychology. The notion of “plus value”
confuses relevance with extraneous considerations (James 1941;
Trautman 1952).</p>

<p>There is a second strand to Wigmore’s contention that
relevance is a legal concept. Relevance is legal in the sense that the
judge is bound by previously decided cases (“judicial
precedents”) when he has to make a ruling on the relevance of a
proposed item of evidence.</p>

<blockquote><p> So long as Courts continue to declare…what
their notions of logic are, just so long will there be rules of law
which must be observed. (Wigmore 1983a: 691)
</p></blockquote>

<p> Wigmore cites in support the judgment of Cushing
C.J. in <em>State v LaPage</em> where it was remarked:</p>

<blockquote> <p> [T]here are many instances in which the evidence of
particular facts as bearing on particular issues has been so often the
subject of discussion in courts of law, and so often ruled upon, that
the united logic of a great many judges and lawyers may be said to
furnish…the best evidence of what may be properly
called <em>common</em>-sense, and thus to acquire the authority of
law.  (1876 57 N.H. 245 at 288 [Supreme Court, New
Hampshire])</p></blockquote>

<p>Wigmore’s position on relevance is strangely at odds with his
strong stand against the judge being bound by judicial precedents in
assessing the weight or credibility of evidence (Wigmore 1913). More
importantly, the second strand of his argument also does not sit well
with the first strand. If, as Wigmore contends, evidence must have a
plus value to make it legally relevant, the court has to consider the
probative value of the evidence and to weigh it against the amount of
time and expense likely to be incurred in receiving the evidence, the
availability of other evidence, the risk of the evidence misleading or
confusing the trier of fact and so forth. Given that the assessment of
plus value and, hence, legal relevance is so heavily contextual, it is
difficult to see how a judicial precedent can be of much value in
another case in determining a point of legal relevance (James 1941:
702).</p>

<h3><a id="MatFacIss">2.2 Materiality and Facts-in-issue</a></h3>

<p>We have just considered the first condition of receivability,
namely, relevance. That fact <i>A</i> is relevant to fact <i>B</i> is
not sufficient to make evidence of fact <i>A</i> receivable in
court. In addition, <i>B</i> must be a “material”
fact. The materiality of facts in a particular case is determined by
the law applicable to that case. In a criminal prosecution, it depends
on the law which defines the offence with which the accused is charged
and at a civil trial, the law which sets out the elements of the legal
claim that is being brought against the defendant (Wigmore 1983a,
15–19; Montrose 1954: 536–537).</p>

<p>Imagine that the accused is prosecuted for the crime of rape and
the alleged victim’s behaviour (fact <i>A</i>) increases the
probability that she had consented to have sexual intercourse with the
accused (fact <i>B</i>). On the probabilistic theory of relevance that
we have considered, <i>A</i> is relevant to <i>B</i>. Now suppose that
the alleged victim is a minor. Under criminal law, it does not matter
whether she had consented to the sexual intercourse. If <i>B</i> is of
no legal consequence, the court will not allow evidence of <i>A</i> to
be adduced for the purpose of proving <i>B</i>: the most obvious
reason is that it is a waste of time to receive the evidence.</p>

<p>Not all material facts are necessarily in dispute. Suppose the
plaintiff sues the defendant for breach of contract. Under the law of
contract, to succeed in this action, the plaintiff must prove the
following three elements: that there was a contract between the
parties, that the defendant was in breach of the contract, and that
the plaintiff had suffered loss as a result of that breach. The
defendant may concede that there was a contract and that he was in
breach of it but deny that the plaintiff had suffered any loss as a
result of that breach. In such a situation, only the last of the
material facts is disputed. Following Stephen’s terminology, a
disputed material fact is called a “fact in issue”
(Stephen 1872: 28).</p>

<p>The law does not allow evidence to be adduced to prove facts that
are immaterial or that are not in issue. “Relevance” is
often used in the broader sense that encompasses the concepts under
discussion. Evidence is sometimes described as
“irrelevant” not for the reason that no logical inference
can be drawn to the proposition that is sought to be proved (in our
example, <i>A</i> is strictly speaking relevant to <i>B</i>) but
because that proposition is not material or not disputed (in our
example, <i>B</i> is not 
material).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-9" id="ref-9">9</a>]</sup> 
This broader usage of the term
“relevance”, though otherwise quite harmless, does not
promote conceptual clarity because it runs together different
concepts (see James 1941: 690–691; Trautman 1952: 386; Montrose
1954: 537).</p>

<h3><a id="Adm">2.3 Admissibility</a></h3>

<h4><a id="AdmRel">2.3.1 Admissibility and Relevance</a></h4>

<p>A further condition must be satisfied for evidence to be received
in legal proceedings. There are legal rules that prohibit evidence
from being presented at a trial even though it is relevant to a
factual proposition that is material and in issue. These rules render
the evidence to which they apply “inadmissible” and
require the judge to “exclude” it. Two prominent examples
of such rules of admissibility or rules of exclusion are the rule
against hearsay evidence and the rule against character evidence. This
section considers the relation between the concept of relevance and
the concept of admissibility. The next section
(<a href="#AdmExcRul">section 2.3.2</a>) discusses general arguments
for and against exclusionary or admissibility rules.</p>

<p>Here, again, the terminology is imprecise. Admissibility and
receivability are not clearly distinguished. It is common
for <em>irrelevant</em> evidence, or evidence of
an <em>immaterial</em> fact to be described as
“inadmissible”. What this means is that the court will
refuse to receive evidence if it is irrelevant or immaterial. But,
importantly, the court also excludes evidence for reasons other than
irrelevance and immateriality. For Montrose, there is merit in
restricting the concept of “inadmissibility” to the
exclusion of evidence based on those other reasons (Montrose 1954:
541–543). If evidence is rejected on the ground of irrelevance,
it is, as Thayer (1898: 515) puts it, “the rule of reason that
rejects it”; if evidence is rejected under an admissibility or
exclusionary rule, the rejection is by force of law. The concepts of
admissibility and materiality should also be kept apart. This is
because admissibility or exclusionary rules serve purposes and
rationales that are distinct from the law defining the crime or civil
claim that is before the court and it is this law that determines the
materiality of facts in the dispute.</p>

<p>Thayer (1898: 266, 530) was influential in his view that the law of
evidence has no say on logical relevance and that its main business is
in dealing with admissibility. If the evidence is logically
irrelevant, it must for that reason be excluded. If the evidence is
logically relevant, it will be received by the court unless the
law—in the form of an exclusionary or admissibility
rule—requires its exclusion. In this scheme, the concept of
relevance and the concept of admissibility are distinct: indeed,
admissibility rules presuppose the relevance of the evidence to which
they apply.</p>

<p>Stephen appears to hold a different view, one in which the concept
of admissibility is apparently absorbed by the concept of relevance.
Take, for example, Stephen’s analysis of the rule that in
general no evidence may be adduced to prove “statements as to
facts made by persons not called as witnesses”, in short,
hearsay (Stephen 1872: 122). As a general rule, no evidence may be
given of hearsay because the law prohibits it. The question then
arises as to the rationale for this prohibition. Stephen’s
answer to this question is often taken to be that hearsay is not
“relevant” and he is criticised for failing to see the
difference between relevance and admissibility (Whitworth 1881: 3;
Thayer 1898: 266–268; Pollock 1876, 1899; Wigmore 1983a:
§12). His critics point out that hearsay has or can have
probative value and evidence of hearsay is excluded despite or
regardless of its relevance. On the generalisation that there is no
smoke without fire, the fact that a person claimed that <i>p</i> in a
statement made out-of-court does or can have a bearing on the
probability that <i>p</i>, and <i>p</i> may be (logically relevant to)
a material fact in the dispute.</p>

<p>Interestingly, Stephen seemed to have conceded as much. He
acknowledged that a policeman or a lawyer engaged in preparing a case
would be negligent if he were to shut his ears to hearsay. Hearsay is
one of those facts that are “apparently relevant but not really
so” (Stephen 1872: 122; see also Stephen 1886: xi). In claiming
that hearsay is irrelevant, Stephen appears to be merely stating the
effect of the law: the law requires that hearsay be treated as
irrelevant. He offered a variety of justifications for excluding
hearsay evidence: its admissibility would “present a great
temptation to indolent judges to be satisfied with second-hand
reports” and “open a wide door to fraud”, and
“[e]veryone would be at the mercy of people who might tell a
lie, and whose evidence could neither be tested nor
contradicted” (Stephen 1872: 124–125). For his detractors,
these are reasons of policy and fairness and it disserves clarity to
sneak such considerations into the concept of relevance.</p>

<p>Although there is force to the criticism that Stephen had
unhelpfully conflated admissibility and relevance (understood as
logical relevance), something can perhaps be said in his defence.
Exclusionary rules or rules of admissibility—at any rate, many
of them—are more accurately seen as excluding forms of
reasoning rather than prohibiting proof of certain types of facts
(McNamara 1986). This is certainly true of the hearsay rule. On one
authoritative definition of the rule (decision of the Privy Council
in <em>Subramaniam v PP</em>, (1956) 1 <em>Weekly Law Reports</em>
965), what it prohibits is the use of a hearsay statement to prove
the truth of the facts asserted
therein.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-10" id="ref-10">10</a>]</sup>
The objection is to the drawing of the inference that <i>p</i>
from <i>X</i>’s out-of-court statement that <i>p</i>
where <i>X</i> is not available to be examined in court. But the
court will allow the evidence of <i>X</i>’s hearsay statement
to be admitted—it will allow proof of the statement—
where the purpose of adducing the evidence is to persuade the court
that <i>X</i> did make the statement and this fact is relevant for
some other purpose. For instance, it may be relevant as to the state
of mind of the person hearing the statement, and his state of mind
may be material to his defence of having acted under duress. Hence,
two writers have commented that “there is no such thing as
hearsay <em>evidence</em>, only hearsay <em>uses</em>” (Roberts
and Zuckerman 2010: 385).</p>

<p>Other admissibility rules are also more accurately seen as targeted
at forms of reasoning and not types of facts. In the United States,
Federal Rule of Evidence 404(a)(1) bars the use of evidence of a
person’s character “to prove that on a particular occasion
the person acted in accordance with the character” and Federal
Rule of Evidence 404(b)(1) provides that evidence of a crime or wrong</p>

<blockquote><p> is not admissible to prove a person’s
character in order to show that on a particular occasion the person
acted in accordance with the character.
</p></blockquote>

<p> It is doubtful that evidence of a person’s
character and past behaviour can have no probabilistic bearing on his
behaviour on a particular occasion; on a probabilistic conception of
relevance, it is difficult to see why the evidence is not
relevant. Even so, there may be policy, moral or other reasons for
the law to prohibit certain uses of character evidence. In declaring
a fact as irrelevant for a particular purpose, we are not necessarily
saying or implying anything about probability. We may be expressing a
normative judgment. For policy, moral or other reasons, the law takes
the position that hearsay or the accused’s character or
previous misconduct must not be used as the premise for a particular
line of reasoning. The line of reasoning might be morally
objectionable (“give a dog a bad name and hang him for
it”) or it might be unfair to permit the drawing of the
inference when the opponent was not given a fair opportunity to
challenge it (as in the hearsay situation) (Ho 2008: chs. 5, 6). If
we take a normative conception of relevance instead of a logical or
probabilistic one, it is not an abuse of language to describe
inadmissible evidence as irrelevant if what is meant is that the
evidence ought not to be taken into account in a certain way.</p>

<h4><a id="AdmExcRul">2.3.2 Admissibility or Exclusionary Rules</a></h4>

<p>On one historical account, admissibility or exclusionary rules are
the product of the jury system where citizens untrained in assessing
evidence sit as judges of fact. These rules came about because it was
thought necessary to keep away from inexperienced jurors certain types
of evidence that may mislead or be mishandled by them—for
instance, evidence to which they are likely to give too much weight or
that carries the risk of creating unfair prejudice in their minds
(Thayer 1898; Wigmore 1935: 4–5). Epistemic paternalism is
supposedly at play (Leiter 1997: 814–5; Allen and Leiter 2001:
1502).  Subscription to this theory has generated pressure for the
abolition of exclusionary rules with the decline of the jury system
and the replacement of lay persons with professional judges as triers
of fact.  There is doubt as to the historical accuracy of this
account; at any rate, it does not appear capable of explaining the
growth of all exclusionary rules (Morgan 1936–37; Nance 1988:
278–294).</p>

<p>Even if the theory is right, it does not necessarily follow that
exclusionary rules should be abolished once the jury system is
removed.  Judges may be as susceptible to the same cognitive and other
failings as the jury and there may be the additional risk that judges
may over-estimate their own cognitive and intellectual abilities in
their professional domain. Hence, there remains a need for the
constraints of legal rules (Schauer 2006: 185–193). But the
efficacy of these rules in a non-jury system is questionable. The
procedural reality is that judges will have to be exposed to the
evidence in order to decide on its admissibility. Since a judge cannot
realistically be expected to erase the evidence from his mind once he
has decided to exclude it, there seems little point in excluding the
evidence; we might as well let the evidence in and allow judge to give
the evidence the probative value that it deserves (Mnookin 2006;
Damaška 2006; cf. Ho 2008: 44–46).</p>

<p>Bentham was a strong critic of exclusionary rules. He was much in
favour of “freedom of proof” understood as free access to
information and the absence of formal rules that restrict such access
(Twining 2006: 232, n 65). The direct object of legal procedure is the
“rectitude of decision”, by which he means the correction
application of substantive law to the true facts. The exclusion of
relevant evidence—evidence capable of casting light on the
truth—is detrimental to this end. Hence, no relevant evidence
should be excluded; the only exceptions he would allow are where the
evidence is superfluous or its production would involve preponderant
delay, expense or vexation (Bentham 1827: Book IX; Bentham 1825: Book
VII; Twining 1985: ch. 2). Bentham’s argument has been
challenged on various fronts. It is said that he overvalued the
pursuit of truth, undervalued procedural fairness and procedural
rights, and placed too much faith in officials, underestimating the
risk of abuse when they are given discretion unfettered by rules
(Twining 1985: 70–71).</p>

<p>Even if we agree with Bentham that rectitude of decision is the aim
of legal procedure and that achieving accuracy in fact-finding is
necessary to attain this aim, it is not obvious that a rule-based
approach to admissibility will undermine this aim in the long run.
Schauer has defended exclusionary rules of evidence along a
rule-consequentialist line. Having the triers of fact follow rules on
certain matters instead of allowing them the discretion to exercise
judgment on a case-by-case basis may produce the greatest number of
favourable outcomes in the aggregate. It is in the nature of a formal
rule that it has to be followed even when doing so might not serve the
background reason for the rule. If hearsay evidence is thought to be
generally unreliable, the interest of accuracy may be better served
overall to require such evidence to be excluded without regard to its
reliability in individual cases. Given the imperfection of human
reason and our suspicion about the reasoning ability of the
fact-finder, allowing decisions to be taken individually on the
reliability and admissibility of hearsay evidence might over time
produce a larger proportion of misjudgements than on the rule-based
approach (Schauer 2006: 180–185; Schauer 2008). However, this
argument is based on a large assumption about the likely effects of
having exclusionary rules and not having them, and there is no strong
empirical basis for thinking that the consequences are or will be as
alleged (Goldman 1999: 292–295; Laudan 2006: 121–122).</p>

<p>Other supporters of exclusionary rules build their arguments on a
wide range of different considerations. The literature is too vast to
enter into details. Here is a brief mention of some arguments. On one
theory, some exclusionary rules are devices that serve as incentives
for lawyers to produce the epistemically best evidence that is
reasonably available (Nance 1988). For example, if lawyers are not
allowed to rely on second-hand (hearsay) evidence, they will be forced
to seek out better (first-hand) evidence. On another theory,
exclusionary rules allocate the risks of error. Again, consider
hearsay. The problem with allowing a party to rely on hearsay evidence
is that the opponent has no opportunity to cross-examine the original
maker of the statement and is thus deprived of an important means of
attacking the reliability of the evidence. Exclusionary rules in
general insulate the party against whom the evidence is sought to be
adduced from the risks of error that the evidence, if admitted, would
have introduced. The distribution of such risks is said to be a
political decision that should not be left to the discretion of
individual fact-finders (Stein 2005; cf. Redmayne 2006 and Nance
2007a: 154–164). It has also been argued that the hearsay rule
and the accompanying right to confront witnesses promote the public
acceptance and stability of legal verdicts. If the court relies on
direct evidence, it can claim superior access to the facts (having
heard from the horse’s mouth, so to speak) and this also reduces
the risk of new information emerging after the trial to discredit the
inference that was drawn from the hearsay evidence (the original maker
of the statement might turn up after the trial to deny the truth of
the statement that was attributed to him) (Nesson 1985:
1372–1375; cf. Park 1986; Goldman 1999: 282; Goldman 2005:
166–167).</p>

<h2><a id="StrEviProWei">3. Strength of Evidence: the Property of Weight</a></h2>

<p><a href="#ConForRecEviWhaCouEviLaw">Section 2</a> above dealt with
the conditions that must be satisfied for a witness’s testimony,
a document or an object to be received as evidence in legal
proceedings. Suppose the judge decides to let the evidence be
presented at the trial. Having heard or seen the evidence, the
fact-finder now has to weigh it in reaching the verdict. Weight can
refer to any of the following three properties of evidence: (a) the
probative value of individual items of evidence, (b) the sufficiency
of the whole body of evidence adduced at the trial in meeting the
standard of proof, or (c) the relative completeness of this body of
evidence.  The first two aspects of weight are familiar to legal
practitioners but the third has been confined to academic
discussions. These three ideas are discussed in the same order
below.</p>

<h3><a id="ProValSpeIteEvi">3.1 Probative Value of Specific Items of Evidence</a></h3>

<p>In reaching the verdict, the trier of fact has to assess the
probative value of the individual items of evidence which have been
received at the trial. The concept of probative value can also play a
role at the prior stage (which was the focus
in <a href="#ConForRecEviWhaCouEviLaw">section 2</a>) where the judge
has to make a ruling on whether to receive the evidence in the first
place. In many legal systems, if the judge finds the probative value
of a proposed item of evidence to be low and substantially outweighed
by countervailing considerations, such as the risk of causing unfair
prejudice or confusion, the judge can refuse to let the jury hear or
see the evidence (see, e.g., Rule 403 of the United States’
Federal Rules of Evidence).</p>

<p>The concept of probative value (or, as it is also called, probative
force) is related to the concept of
relevance. <a href="#ConLogRel">Section 2.1.2</a> above introduced
and examined the claim that the likelihood ratio is the measure of
relevance. To recapitulate, the likelihood of an item of
evidence, <i>E</i> (in our previous example, the likelihood of a
blood type match) given a hypothesis <i>H</i> (that the accused is in
fact guilty) is compared with the likelihood of <i>E</i> given the
negation of <i>H</i> (that the accused is in fact innocent). Prior to
the introduction of <i>E</i>, one may have formed some belief
about <i>H</i> based on other evidence that one already has. This
prior belief does not affect the likelihood ratio since its
computation is based on the alternative assumptions that <i>H</i> is
true and that <i>H</i> is false (Kaye 1986a; Kaye and Koehler 2003;
cf. Davis and Follette 2002 and 2003). Rulings on relevance are
typically made in the course of the trial as and when an objection is
raised to the introduction of evidence. The relevance of an item of
evidence is supposedly assessed on its own, without consideration of
other evidence (Mnookin 2013:
1544–5).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-11" id="ref-11">11</a>]</sup></p>

<p>Probative value, as with relevance, has been explained in terms of
the likelihood ratio (for detailed examples, see Nance and Morris
2002 and Finkelstein and Levin 2003).  It was noted earlier that
evidence is either relevant or not, and, on the prevailing
understanding, it is relevant so long as the likelihood ratio
deviates from 1:1. But evidence can be more or less probative
depending on the value of the likelihood ratio. In our earlier
example, the probative value of a blood type match was 1.0:0.5 (or
2:1) as 50% of the suspect population had the same blood type as the
accused. But suppose the blood type is less common and only 25% of
the suspect population has it. The probative value of the evidence is
now 1.0:0.25 (or 4:1). In both cases, the evidence is relevant; but
the probative value is greater in the latter than in the former
scenario. It is tempting to describe probative value as the degree of
relevance but this would be misleading as relevance in law is a
binary concept.</p>

<p>There is a second way of thinking about probative value. On the
second view, but not on the first, the probative value of an item of
evidence is assessed contextually. The probative value of <i>E</i> may
be low given one state of the other evidence and substantial given a
different body of other evidence (Friedman 1986; Friedman and Park
2003; cf. Davis and Follette 2002, 2003). Where the other evidence
shows that a woman had died from falling down an escalator at a mall
while she was out shopping, her husband’s history of spousal
battery is unlikely to have any probative value in proving that he was
responsible for her death. But where the other evidence shows that the
wife had died of injuries in the matrimonial home, and the question is
whether the injuries were sustained from an accidental fall from the
stairs or inflicted by the husband, the same evidence of spousal
battery will now have significant probative value.</p>

<p>On the second view, the probative value of an item of evidence
(<i>E</i>) is not measured simply by the likelihood ratio as it is on
the first view. Probative value is understood as the degree to
which <i>E</i> increases (or decreases) the probability of the
proposition or hypothesis (<i>H</i>) in support of (or against)
which <i>E</i> is led. The probative value of <i>E</i> is measured by
the difference between the probability of <i>H</i> given <i>E</i> (the
posterior probability) and the probability of <i>H</i> absent <i>E</i>

Bayes’ theorem—that is, by multiplying the prior
probability by the likelihood ratio (see discussion
in <a href="#ObjUsiMatProIntStaPro">section 3.2.2</a> below). On the
present view, while the likelihood ratio does not itself measure the
probative value of <i>E</i>, it is nevertheless a crucial component in
the assessment.</p>

<p>A major difficulty with both of the mathematical conceptions of
probative value that we have just examined is that for most evidence,
obtaining the figures necessary for computing the likelihood ratio is
problematic (Allen 1991: 380). Exceptionally, quantitative base rates
data exist, as in our blood type example. Where objective data is
unavailable, the fact-finder has to draw on background experience and
knowledge to come up with subjective values. In our blood type
example, a critical factor in computing the likelihood ratio was the
percentage of the “suspect population” who had the same
blood type as the accused. “Reference class” is the
general statistical term for the role that the suspect population
plays in this analysis.  How should the reference class of
“suspect population” be defined? Should we look at the
population of the country as a whole or of the town or the street
where the alleged murder occurred? What if it occurred at an
international airport where most the people around are foreign
visitors? Or what if it is shown that both the accused and the victim
were at the time of the alleged murder inmates of the same prison?
Should we then take the prison population as the reference class? The
distribution of blood types may differ according to which reference
class is selected. Sceptics of mathematical modelling of probative
value emphasize that data from different reference classes will have
different explanatory power and the choice of the reference class is
open to—and should be subjected to—contextual argument and
requires the exercise of judgment; there is no a priori way of
determining the correct reference class. (On the reference class
problem in legal fact finding, see, in addition to references cited in
the rest of this section, Colyvan, Regan and Ferson 2001; Tillers
2005; Allen and Roberts 2007.</p>

<p>Some writers have proposed quantifiable ways of selecting, or
assisting in the selection, of the appropriate reference class. On one
suggestion, the court does not have to search for the optimal
reference class. A general characteristic of an adversarial system of
trial is that the judge plays a passive role; it is up to the parties
to come up with the arguments on which they want to rely and to
produce evidence in support of their respective arguments. This
adversarial setting makes the reference class problem more manageable
as the court need only to decide which of the reference classes relied
upon by the parties is to be preferred. And this can be done by
applying one of a variety of technical criteria that statisticians
have developed for comparing and selecting statistical models (Cheng
2009). Another suggestion is to use the statistical method of
“feature selection” instead. The ideal reference class is
defined by the intersection of all relevant features of the case, and
a feature is relevant if it is correlated to the matter under enquiry
(Franklin 2010, 2011: 559–561). For instance, if the amount of
drug likely to be smuggled is reasonably believed to co-vary with the
airport through which it is smuggled, the country of origin and the
time period, and there is no evidence that any other feature is
relevant on which data is available, the ideal reference class is the
class of drug smugglers passing through that airport originating from
that country and during that time period. Both suggestions have
self-acknowledged limitations: not least, they depend on the
availability of suitable data. Also, as Franklin stresses, while
statistical methods “have advice to offer on how courts should
judge quantitative evidence”, they do so “in a way that
supplements normal intuitive legal argument rather than replacing it
by a formula” (Franklin 2010: 22).</p>

<p>The reference class problem is not confined to the probabilistic
assessment of the probative value of individual items of evidence. It
is a general difficulty with a mathematical approach to legal
proof. In particular, the same problem arises on a probabilistic
interpretation of the standard of proof when the court has to
determine whether the standard is met based on all the evidence
adduced in the case. This topic is explored
in <a href="#SufEviStaPro">section 3.2</a> below but it is convenient
at this juncture to illustrate how the reference class problem can
also arise in this connection. Let it be that the plaintiff sues Blue
Bus Company to recover compensation for injuries sustained in an
accident. The plaintiff testifies, and the court believes on the basis
of his testimony, that he was run down by a recklessly driven bus.
Unfortunately, it was dark at the time and he cannot tell whether the
bus belonged to Blue Bus Company. Assume further that there is also
evidence which establishes that Blue Bus Company owns 75% of the buses
in the town where the accident occurred and the remaining 25% is owned
by Red Bus Company. No other evidence is presented. To use the data as
the basis for inferring that there is 0.75 probability that the bus
involved in the accident was owned by Blue Bus Company would seem to
privilege the reference class of “buses operating in the
town” over other possible reference classes such as “buses
plying the street where the accident occurred” or “buses
operating at the time in question” (Allen and Pardo 2007a: 109).
Different reference classes may produce very different likelihood
ratios. It is crucial how the reference class is chosen and this is
ultimately a matter of argument and judgment. Any choice of reference
class (other than the class that shares <em>every</em> feature of the
particular incident, which is, in effect, the unique incident itself)
is in principle contestable.</p>

<p>Critics of the mathematization of legal proof raise this point as
an example of inherent limitations to the mathematical modelling of
probative value (Allen and Pardo
2007a).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-12" id="ref-12">12</a>]</sup>
Allen and Pardo propose an alternative, the explanatory theory of
legal proof. They claim that this theory has the advantage of
avoiding the reference class problem because it does not attempt to
quantify probative value (Pardo 2005: 374–383; Pardo and Allen
2008: 261, 263; Pardo 2013: 600–601). Suppose a man is accused
of killing his wife. Evidence is produced of his extra-marital
affair. The unique probative value of the accused’s infidelity
cannot be mathematically computed from statistical base rates of
infidelity and uxoricides (husbands murdering wives). In assessing
its probative value, the court should look instead at how strongly
the evidence of infidelity supports the explanation of the material
events put forward by the side adducing the evidence and how strongly
it challenges the explanation offered by the opponent. For instance,
the prosecution may be producing the evidence to buttress its case
that the accused wanted to get rid of his wife so that he could marry
his mistress, and the defence may be advancing the alternative theory
that the couple was unusual in that they condoned extra-marital
affairs and had never let it affect their loving relationship. How
much probative value the evidence of infidelity has depends on the
strength of the explanatory connections between it and the competing
hypotheses, and this is not something that can be quantified.</p>

<p>But the disagreement in this debate is not as wide as it might
appear. The critics concede that formal models for evaluating evidence
in law may be useful. What they object to is</p>

<blockquote><p> scholarship arguing … that such models
establish the correct or accurate probative value of evidence, and
thus implying that any deviations from such models lead to inaccurate
or irrational outcomes. (Allen and Pardo 2007b: 308)
</p></blockquote>

<p> On the other side, it is acknowledged that there
are limits to mathematical formalisation of evidential reasoning in
law (Franklin 2012: 238–9) and that context, argument and
judgment do play a role in identifying the reference class (Nance
2007b).</p>

<h3><a id="SufEviStaPro">3.2 Sufficiency of Evidence and the Standards of Proof</a></h3>

<h4><a id="MatProStaPro">3.2.1 Mathematical Probability and the Standards of Proof</a></h4>

<p>In the <a href="#ProValSpeIteEvi">section 3.1</a> above, we
concentrated on the weight of evidence in the sense of probative value
of individual items of evidence. The concept of weight can also apply
to the total body of evidence presented at the trial; here
“weight” is commonly referred to as the “sufficiency
of evidence”. The law assigns the legal burden of proof between
parties to a dispute. For instance, at a criminal trial, the accused
is presumed innocent and the burden is on the prosecution to prove
that he is guilty as charged. To secure a conviction, the body of
evidence presented at the trial must be sufficient to meet the
standard of proof. Putting this generally, a verdict will be given in
favour of the side bearing the legal burden of proof only if, having
considered all of the evidence, the fact-finder is satisfied that the
applicable standard of proof is met. The standard of proof has been
given different interpretations.</p>

<p>On one interpretation, the standard of proof is a probabilistic
threshold. In civil cases, the standard is the “balance of
probabilities” or, as it is more popularly called in the United
States, the “preponderance of evidence”. The plaintiff
will satisfy this standard and succeed in his claim only if there is,
on all the evidence adduced in the case, more than 0.5 probability of
his claim being true. At criminal trials, the standard for a guilty
verdict is “proof beyond a reasonable doubt”. Here the
probabilistic threshold is thought to be much higher than 0.5 but
courts have eschewed any attempt at authoritative quantification.
Typically, a notional value, such as 0.9 or 0.95, is assumed by
writers for the sake of discussion. For the prosecution to secure a
guilty verdict, the evidence adduced at the trial must establish the
criminal charge to a degree of probability that crosses this
threshold. Where, as in the United States, there is an intermediate
standard of “clear and convincing evidence” which is
reserved for special cases, the probabilistic threshold is said to lie
somewhere between 0.5 and the threshold for proof beyond reasonable
doubt.</p>

<p>Kaplan was among the first to employ decision theory to develop a
framework for setting the probabilistic threshold that represents the
standard of proof. Since the attention in this area of the law tends
to be on the avoidance of errors and their undesirable consequences,
he finds it convenient to focus on disutility rather than utility. The
expected disutility of an outcome is the product of the disutility
(broadly, the social costs) of that outcome and the probability of
that outcome. Only two options are generally available to the court:
in criminal cases, it must either convict or acquit the accused and in
civil cases, it has to give judgment either for the plaintiff or for
the defendant. At a criminal trial, the decision should be made to
convict where the expected disutility of a decision to acquit is
greater than the expected disutility of a decision to convict. This is
so as to minimize the expected disutilities. To put this in the form
of an equation:</p>

<p><i>P</i> is the probability that the accused is guilty on the basis

<p>The same formula applies in civil cases except that the two
disutilities (<em>Dag</em> and <em>Dci</em>) will have to be replaced
by their civil equivalents (framed in terms of the disutility of
awarding the judgment to a plaintiff who in fact does not deserve it
and disutility of awarding the judgment to a defendant who in fact
does not deserve it).  On this formula, the crucial determinant of
the standard of proof is the ratio of the two disutilities. In the
civil context, the disutility of an error in one direction is deemed
equal to the disutility of an error in the other direction. Hence, a
probability of liability of greater than 0.5 would suffice for a
decision to enter judgment against the defendant (see Redmayne 1996:
171). The situation is
different at a criminal trial. <em>Dci</em>, the disutility of
convicting an innocent person is considered far greater
than <em>Dag</em>, the disutility of acquitting a guilty
person.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-13" id="ref-13">13</a>]</sup>
Hence, the probability threshold for a conviction should be much
higher than 0.5 (Kaplan 1968: 1071–1073; see also Cullison
1969).</p>

<p>An objection to this analysis is that it is incomplete. It is not
enough to compare the costs of erroneous verdicts. The utility of an
accurate conviction and the utility of an accurate acquittal should
also be considered and factored into the equation (Lillquist 2002:
108).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-14" id="ref-14">14</a>]</sup>
This results in the following modification of the formula for setting
the standard of proof:</p>

\frac{1}{1+\frac{\textit{Ucg}-\textit{Uag}}{\textit{Uai}-\textit{Uci}}}
</script>

<p><em>Ucg</em> is the utility of convicting the guilty, <em>Uag</em>
is the utility of acquitting the guilty, <em>Uai</em> is the utility
of acquitting the innocent and <em>Uci</em> the utility of convicting
the innocent.</p>

<p>Since the relevant utilities depend on the individual
circumstances, such as the seriousness of the crime and the severity
of the punishment, the decision-theoretic account of the standard of
proof would seem, on both the simple and the modified version, to lead
to the conclusion that the probabilistic threshold should vary from
case to case (Lillquist 2002; Bartels 1981; Laudan and Saunders
2009). In other words, the standard of proof should be a flexible or
floating one. This view is perceived to be problematic.</p>

<p>First, it falls short descriptively. The law requires the court to
apply a fixed standard of proof for all cases within the relevant
category. In theory, all criminal cases are governed by the same high
standard and all civil cases are governed by the same lower standard.
That said, it is unclear whether factfinders in reality adhere
strictly to a fixed standard of proof (see Kaplow 2012:
805-809).</p>

<p>The argument is better interpreted as a normative argument—as
advancing the claim about what the law ought to be and not what it
is. The standard of proof ought to vary from case to case. But this
proposal faces a second objection. For convenience, the objection will
be elaborated in the criminal setting; in principle, civil litigants
have the same two rights that we shall identify. According to Dworkin
(1981), moral harm arises as an objective moral fact when a person is
erroneously convicted of a crime. Moral harm is distinguished from the
bare harm (in the form of pain, frustration, deprivation of liberty
and so forth) that is suffered by a wrongfully convicted and punished
person. While accused persons have the right not to be convicted if
innocent, they do not have the right to the most accurate procedure
possible for ascertaining their guilt or innocence. However, they do
have the right that a certain weight or importance be attached to the
risk of moral harm in the design of procedural and evidential rules
that affect the level of accuracy. Accused persons have the further
right to a consistent weighting of the importance of moral harm and
this further right stems from their right to equal concern and
respect.  Dworkin’s theory carries an implication bearing on the
present debate. It is arguable that to adopt a floating standard of
proof would offend the second right insofar as it means treating
accused persons differently with respect to the evaluation of the
importance of avoiding moral harm. This difference in treatment is
reflected in the different level of the risk of moral harm to which
they are exposed.</p>

<p>There is a third objection to a floating standard of
proof. Picinali (2013) sees fact-finding as a theoretical exercise
that engages the question of what to believe about the disputed
facts. What counts as “reasonable” for the purposes of
applying the standard of proof beyond reasonable doubt is accordingly
a matter for theoretical as opposed to practical reasoning. Briefly,
theoretical reasoning is concerned with what to believe whereas
practical reasoning is about what to do. Only reasons for belief are
germane in theoretical reasoning. While considerations that bear on
the assessment of utility and disutility provide reasons for action,
they are not reasons for believing in the accused’s
guilt. Decision theory cannot therefore be used to support a variable
application of the standard of proof beyond reasonable doubt.</p>

<p>The third criticism of a flexible standard of proof does not
directly challenge the decision-theoretic analysis of the standard of
proof. On that analysis, it would seem that the maximisation of
expected utility is the criterion for selecting the appropriate
probabilistic threshold to apply and it plays no further role in
deciding whether that threshold, once selected, is met on the
evidence adduced in the particular case. It is not incompatible with
the decision-theoretic analysis to insist that the question of
whether the selected threshold is met should be governed wholly by
epistemic considerations. However, it is arguable that what counts as
good or strong enough theoretical reason for judging, and hence
believing, that something is true is dependent on the context, such
as what is at stake in believing that it is true. More is at stake at
a trial involving the death penalty than in a case of petty
shop-lifting; accordingly, there should be stronger epistemic
justification for a finding of guilt in the first than in the second
case. Philosophical literature on epistemic contextualism and on
interest-relative accounts of knowledge and justified belief has been
drawn upon to support a variant standard of proof (Ho 2008: ch. 4;
see also Amaya 2015:
525–531).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-15" id="ref-15">15</a>]</sup></p>

<p>The premise of the third criticism is that the trier of fact has to
make a finding on a disputed factual proposition based on his belief
in the proposition. This is contentious. Beliefs are involuntary; we
cannot believe something by simply deciding to believe it. The
dominant view is that beliefs are context-independent; at any given
moment, we cannot believe something in one context and not believe it
in another.  On the other hand, legal fact-finding involves choice and
decision making and it is dependent on the context; for example,
evidence that is strong enough to justify a finding of fact in a civil
case may not be strong enough to justify the same finding in a
criminal case where the standard of proof is higher. It has been
argued that the fact-finder has to base his findings not on what he
believes but what he accepts (Cohen 1991, 1992: 117–125,
Beltrán 2006; cf. Picinali 2013: 868–869). Belief and
acceptance are propositional attitudes: they are different attitudes
that one can have in relation to a proposition. As Cohen (1992: 4)
explains,</p>

<blockquote><p> to accept that <em>p</em> is to have or adopt a
policy of deeming, positing or postulating
that <em>p</em>—i.e. of including that proposition or rule
among one’s premises for deciding what to do or think in a
particular context.</p></blockquote>

<h4><a id="ObjUsiMatProIntStaPro">3.2.2 Objections to Using Mathematical Probability to Interpret Standards of Proof</a></h4>

<p>Understanding standards of proof in terms of mathematical
probabilities is controversial. It is said to raise a number of
paradoxes (Cohen 1977; Allen 1986, 1991; Allen and Leiter 2001;
Redmayne 2008). Let us return to our previous example. The defendant,
Blue Bus Company, owns 75% of the buses in the town where the
plaintiff was injured by a recklessly driven bus and the remaining 25%
is owned by Red Bus Company. No other evidence is presented. Leaving
aside the reference class problem discussed above, there is a 0.75
probability that the accident was caused by a bus owned by the
defendant. On the probabilistic interpretation of the applicable
standard of proof (that is, the balance of probabilities), the
evidence should be sufficient to justify a verdict in the
plaintiff’s favour. But all lawyers would agree that the
evidence is insufficient. The puzzle is why this is so. Various
attempts have been made to solve this puzzle (for surveys of these
attempts, see Enoch and Fisher 2015: 565–571; Redmayne 2008, Ho
2008: 135–143, 168–170). On the solution offered by
Thomson, the statistical evidence (the 75% ownership of buses) is not
causally connected with the fact sought to be proved (the accident)
and as such cannot justify belief in or knowledge of the fact (Thomson
1986). But it is questionable that the court should aim at knowledge
of the disputed fact and not simply at accuracy in its finding (Enoch,
Spectre and Fisher 2012; Enoch and Fisher 2015).</p>

<p>There is another paradox in the mathematical interpretation of the
standard of proof. This is the “conjunction paradox”. To
succeed in a civil claim (or a criminal prosecution), the plaintiff
(or the prosecution) will have to prove the material facts—or
“elements”—that constitute the civil claim (or
criminal charge) that is before the court (see discussion of
“materiality” in <a href="#MatFacIss">section 2.2</a>
above). Imagine a claim under the law of negligence that rests on two
elements: a breach of duty of care by the defendant (element <i>A</i>)
and causation of harm to the plaintiff (element <i>B</i>). To win the
case, the plaintiff is legally required to prove <i>A</i>
and <i>B</i>. For the sake of simplicity, let <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> be
mutually independent events. Suppose the evidence establishes <i>A</i>
to a probability of 0.6 and <i>B</i> to a probability of 0.7. On the
mathematical interpretation of the civil standard of proof, the
plaintiff should succeed in his claim since the probability with
respect to each of the elements exceeds 0.5. However, according to the
multiplication rule of conventional probability calculus, the
probability that <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> are both true is the product of
their respective probabilities; in this example, it is only 0.42
(obtained by multiplying 0.6 with 0.7). Thus, the overall probability
is greater that the defendant deserves to win than that the plaintiff
deserves to win, and yet the verdict is awarded in favour of the
plaintiff.</p>

<p>One way of avoiding the conjunction paradox is to take the position
that it should not be enough for each element to cross the
probabilistic threshold; the plaintiff (or the prosecution) should win
only if the probability of the plaintiff’s (or
prosecution’s) case as a whole exceeds the applicable
probabilistic threshold. So, in our example, the plaintiff should lose
since the overall probability is below 0.5. But this suggested
solution is unsatisfactory. The required level of overall probability
would then turn on how many elements the civil claim or criminal
charge happens to have. The greater the number of elements, the higher
the level of probability to which, on average, each of them must be
proved. This is thought to be arbitrary and hence objectionable. As
two commentators noted, the legal definition of theft contains more
elements than that for murder. Criminal law is not the same in all
countries. We may take the following as a convenient approximation of
what the law is in some countries: murder is (1) an act that caused
the death of a person (2) that was done with the intention of causing
the death, and to constitute theft, there must be (1) an intention to
take property, (2) dishonesty in taking the property, (3) removal of
the property from the possession of another person and (4) lack of
consent by that person.  Since the offence of theft contains twice the
number of elements as compared to murder, the individual elements for
theft would have to be proved to a much higher level of probability
(in order for the probability of their conjunction to cross the
overall threshold) than the individual elements for the much more
serious crime of murder (Allen and Leiter 2001: 1504–5). This is
intuitively unacceptable.</p>

<p>Another proposal for resolving the conjunction paradox is move away
from thinking of the standard of proof as a quantified threshold of
absolute probability and to construe it, instead, as a probability
ratio. The fact-finder has to compare the probability of the evidence
adduced at the trial under the plaintiff’s theory of the case
with the probability of the evidence under the defendant’s
theory of the case (the two need not add to 1), and award the verdict
to the side with a higher probability (Cheng 2013). One criticism of
this interpretation of the standard of proof is that it ignores, and
does not provide a basis for ignoring, the margin by which one
probability exceeds the other, and the difference in probability may
vary significantly for different elements of the case (Allen and Stein
2013: 598).</p>

<p>There is a deeper problem with the probabilistic conception of the
standard of proof. There does not seem to be a satisfactory
interpretation of probability that suits the forensic context. The
only plausible candidate is the subjective meaning of probability
according to which probability is construed as the strength of
belief. The evidence is sufficient to satisfy the legal standard of
proof on a disputed question of fact—for example, it is
sufficient to justify the positive finding of fact that the accused
killed the victim—only if the fact-finder, having considered
the evidence, forms a sufficiently strong belief that the accused
killed the victim.  Guidance on how to process evidence and form
beliefs can be found in a mathematical theorem known as Bayes’
theorem; it is the method by which an ideal rational fact-finder
would revise or update his beliefs in the light of new
evidence.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-16" id="ref-16">16</a>]</sup>
To return to our earlier hypothetical scenario, suppose the
fact-finder initially believes the odds of the accused being guilty
is 1:1 (“prior odds”) or, putting this differently, that
there is a 0.5 probability of guilt. The fact-finder then receives
evidence that blood of type A was found at the scene of the crime and
that the accused has type A blood. Fifty percent of the population
has this blood type. On the Bayesian approach, the posterior odds are
calculated by multiplying the prior odds (1:1) by the likelihood
ratio (which, as we saw in <a href="#ConLogRel">section 2.1.2</a>
above, is 2:1). The fact-finder’s belief in the odds of guilt
should now be revised to 2:1; the probability of guilt is now
increased to 0.67 (Lempert 1977).</p>

<p>The subjectivist Bayesian theory of legal fact-finding has come
under attack (see generally Amaya 2015: 82–93; Pardo 2013:
591). First, as we already saw in <a href="#ProValSpeIteEvi">section
3.1</a>, ascertainment of the likelihood ratios is highly
problematic. Secondly, the Bayesian theory is not sensitive to the
weight of evidence which, roughly put, is the amount of evidence that
is available. This criticism and the concept of weight are further
explored in <a href="#WeiEviDegEviCom">section 3.3</a>.</p>

<p>Thirdly, while the Bayesian theorem offers a method for updating
probabilities in the light of new evidence, it is silent on what the
initial probability should be. In a trial setting, the initial
probability cannot be set at zero since this means certainty in the
innocence of the accused. No new evidence can then make any
difference; whatever the likelihood ratio of the evidence, multiplying
it by zero (the prior probability) will still end up with a posterior
probability of zero. On the other hand, starting with an initial
probability is also problematic. This is especially so in a criminal
case. To start a trial with some probability of guilt is to have the
fact-finder harbouring some initial belief that the accused is guilty
and this is not easy to reconcile with the presumption of
innocence. (Tribe 1971: 1368–1372; cf. Posner 1999: 1514,
suggesting starting the trial with prior odds of 50:50, criticized by
Friedman 2000.)</p>

<p>Fourthly, we have thus far relied for ease of illustration on
highly simplified—and therefore unrealistic—examples. In
real cases, there are normally multiple and dependent items of
evidence and the probabilities of all possible conjunctions of these
items, which are numerous, will have to be computed. These
computations are far too complex to be undertaken by human beings
(Callen 1982: 10–15). The impossibility of complying with the
Bayesian model undermines its prescriptive value.</p>

<p>Fifthly, according to Haack, the Bayesian theory has it the wrong
way round. What matters is not the strength of the
fact-finder’s belief itself. The standard of proof should be
understood instead in terms of what it is reasonable for the
fact-finder to believe in the light of the evidence presented, and
this is a matter of the degree to which the belief is warranted by
the evidence. Evidence is legally sufficient where it warrants the
contested factual claim to the degree required by law. Whether a
factual claim is warranted by the evidence turns on how strongly the
evidence supports the claim, on how independently secure the evidence
is, and on how much of the relevant evidence is available to the
fact-finder (that is, the comprehensiveness of the evidence—see
further discussion in <a href="#WeiEviDegEviCom">section 3.3</a>
below). Haack is against identifying degrees of warrant with
mathematical probabilities. Degrees of warrant do not conform to the
axioms of the standard probability calculus. For instance, where the
evidence is weak, neither <i>p</i> nor not-<i>p</i> may be warranted;
in contrast, the probability of <i>p</i> and the probability of
not-<i>p</i> must add up to 1. Further, where the probability
of <i>p</i> and the probability of <i>q</i> are both less than 1, the
probability of <i>p</i> and <i>q</i>, being the product of the
probability of <i>p</i> and the probability of <i>q</i>, is less than
the probability of either. On the other hand, the degree of warrant
for the conjunction of <i>p</i> and <i>q</i> may be higher than the
warrant for 
either.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-17" id="ref-17">17</a>]</sup> 
(See Haack 2004, 2008a,b, 2012, 2014 for
the legal application of her general theory of epistemology. For her
general theory of epistemology, see Haack 1993: ch. 4; Haack 2009:
ch. 4; Haack 2003: ch. 3.)</p>

<p>Sixthly, research in experimental psychology suggests that
fact-finders do not evaluate pieces of evidence one-by-one and in the
unidirectional manner required under the mathematical model (Amaya
2015: 114–5). A holistic approach is taken instead where the
discrete items of evidence are integrated into large cognitive
structures (variously labelled as “mental models”,
“stories”, “narratives” and “theories of
the case”), and they are assessed globally against the legal
definition of the crime or civil claim that is in dispute (Pennington
and Hastie 1991, 1993; Pardo 2000). The reasoning does not progress
linearly from evidence to a conclusion; it is bi-directional, going
forward and backward: as the fact-finder’s consideration of the
evidence inclines him towards a particular verdict, his leaning
towards that conclusion will often produce a revision of his original
perception and his assessment of the evidence (Simon 2004, 2011).</p>

<p>The holistic nature of evidential reasoning as revealed by these
studies has inspired alternative theories that are of a
non-mathematical nature. One alternative, already mentioned, is the
“explanatory” or “relative plausibility”
theory advanced by Allen together with Pardo and other collaborators
(Allen 1986, 1991, 1994; Pardo 2000; Allen and Leiter 2001; Allen and
Jehl 2003; Pardo and Allen 2008; cf. Nance 2001, Friedman
2001).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-18" id="ref-18">18</a>]</sup>
They contend that fact-finders do not reason in the fashion portrayed
by the Bayesian model. Instead, they engage in generating
explanations or hypotheses on the available evidence by a process of
abductive reasoning or drawing “inferences to the best
explanation”, and these competing explanations or hypotheses
are compared in the light of the
evidence.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-19" id="ref-19">19</a>]</sup>
The comparison is not of a hypothesis with the negation of that
hypothesis, where the probability of a hypothesis is compared with
the probability of its negation. Instead, the comparison is of one
hypothesis with one or more particular alternative hypotheses as
advocated by a party or as constructed by the fact-finder himself. On
this approach, the plausibility of X, the factual account of the case
that establishes the accused’s guilt or defendant’s
liability, is compared with the plausibility of a hypothesis Y, a
specific alternative account that points to the accused’s
innocence or the defendant’s non-liability, and there may be
more than one such specific alternative account.</p>

<p>On this theory, the evidence is sufficient to satisfy the
preponderance of proof standard when the best-available hypothesis
that explains the evidence and the underlying events include all of
the elements of the claim. Thus, in a negligence case, the
best-available hypothesis would have to include a breach of duty of
care by the plaintiff and causation of harm to the defendant as these
are the elements that must be proved to succeed in the legal
claim. For the intermediate “clear-and-convincing”
standard of proof, the best-available explanation must be
substantially better than the alternatives. To establish the standard
of proof beyond reasonable doubt, there must be a plausible
explanation of the evidence that includes all of the elements of the
crime and, in addition, there must be no plausible explanation that is
consistent with innocence (Pardo and Allen 2008: 238–240; Pardo
2013: 603–604).</p>

<p>The relative plausibility theory itself is perceived to have a
number of shortcomings. First, the theory portrays the assessment of
plausibility as an exercise of judgment that involves employment of
various criteria such as coherence, consistency, simplicity,
consilience and more. However, the theory is sketchy on the meaning
of plausibility and the criteria for evaluating plausibility are left
largely unanalyzed.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-20" id="ref-20">20</a>]</sup></p>

<p>A second criticism of the relative plausibility theory is that,
despite the purported utilisation of “inference to the best
explanation” reasoning, the verdict is not controlled by the
best explanation. For instance, even if the prosecution’s
hypothesis is better than the defence’s hypothesis, neither may
be very good. In these circumstances, the court must reject the
prosecution’s hypothesis even though it is the best of
alternatives (Laudan 2007). One suggested mitigation of this criticism
is to place some demand on the epistemic effort that the trier of fact
must take (for example, by being sufficiently diligent and thorough)
in constructing the set of hypotheses from which the best is to be
chosen (Amaya 2009: 155).</p>

<p>The third criticism is targeted at holistic theories of evidential
reasoning in general and not specifically at the relative plausibility
theory. While it may be descriptively true that fact-finders decide
verdicts by holistic evaluation of the plausibility of competing
explanations, hypotheses, narratives or factual theories that are
generated from the evidence, such forms of reasoning may conceal bias
and prejudice that stand greater chances of exposure under a
systematic approach such as Bayesian analysis (Twining 2006: 319;
Simon 2004, 2011; Griffin 2013). A hypothesis constructed by the
fact-finder may be shaped subconsciously by a prejudicial
generalisation or background belief about the accused based on a
certain feature, say, his race or sexual history. Individuating this
feature and subjecting it to Bayesian scrutiny has the desirable
effect of putting the generalisation or background belief under the
spotlight and forcing the fact-finder to confront the problem of
prejudice.</p>

<h3><a id="WeiEviDegEviCom">3.3 The Weight of Evidence as the Degree of Evidential Completeness</a></h3>

<p>A third idea of evidential weight is prompted by this insight from
Keynes (1921: 71):</p>

<blockquote> <p> As the relevant evidence at our disposal increases,
the magnitude of the probability of the argument may either decrease
or increase, according as the new knowledge strengthens the
unfavourable or the favourable evidence; but <em>something</em> seems
to have increased in either case,—we have a more substantial
basis upon which to rest our conclusion. I express this by saying that
an accession of new evidence increases the <em>weight</em> of an
argument. New evidence will sometimes decrease the probability of an
argument, but it will always increase its
“weight”.</p></blockquote>

<p>At its simplest, we may think of weight in the context of legal
fact-finding as the amount of evidence before the court. Weight is
distinguishable from probability. The weight of evidence may be high
and the mathematical probability low, as in the situation where the
prosecution adduces a great deal of evidence tending to incriminate
the accused but the defence has an unshakeable alibi (Cohen 1986:
641).  Conversely, the state of evidence adduced in a case might
establish a sufficient degree of probability—high enough to
cross the supposed threshold of proof on the mathematical conception
of the standard of proof—and yet lack adequate weight. In the
much-discussed gate-crasher’s paradox, the only available
evidence shows that the defendant was one of a thousand spectators at
a rodeo show and that only four hundred and ninety nine tickets were
issued. The defendant is sued by the show organiser for gate-crashing.
The mathematical probability that the defendant was a gate-crasher is
0.501 and this meets the probabilistic threshold for civil liability.
But, according to the negation principle of mathematical probability,
there is probability of 0.499 that the defendant did pay for his
entrance. In these circumstances, it is intuitively unjust to find him
liable (Cohen 1977: 75). A possible explanation for not finding him
liable is that the evidence is too flimsy or of insufficient
weight.</p>

<p>Proponents of the mathematical conception of the standard of proof
have stood their ground even while acknowledging that weight has a
role to play in the Bayesian analysis of probative value and the
sufficiency of evidence. If a party does not produce relevant evidence
that is in his possession, resulting in the court facing an evidential
deficiency, it may draw an adverse inference against him when
computing the posterior probability (Kaye 1986b: 667; Friedman
1997). One criticism of this approach is that, in the absence of
information about the missing evidence, the drawing of the adverse
inference is open to the objection of arbitrariness (Nance 2008:
274). A further objection is that the management of parties’
conduct relating to evidence preservation and presentation should be
left to judges and not to the jury. What a judge may do to optimize
evidential weight is to impose a burden of producing evidence on a
party and to make the party suffer an adverse finding of fact if he
fails to produce the evidence. This will serve as an incentive for the
party to act in a manner that promotes the interest in evidential
completeness (Nance 2008, 2010).</p>

<p>Cohen suggests that the standard of proof should be conceived
entirely as a matter of evidential weight which, on his theory, is a
matter of the number of tests or challenges to which a factual
hypothesis is subjected to in court. He offers an account of legal
fact-finding in terms of an account of inductive probability that was
inspired by the work of writers such as Francis Bacon and J.S. Mill.
Inductive probability operates differently from the classical calculus
of probability. It is based on inductive support for the common-sense
generalisation that licences the drawing of the relevant inference.
Inductive support for a generalisation is graded according to the
number of tests that it has passed, or, putting this in another way,
by the degree of its resistance to falsification by relevant
variables.  The inductive probability of an argument is equal to the
reliability grade of the inductive support for the generalisation
which covers the argument.</p>

<p>Proof beyond reasonable doubt represents the maximum level of
inductive probability. The prosecution may try to persuade the court
to infer that the accused was guilty of burglary by producing
evidence to establish that he was found in the vicinity of the
victim’s house late at night with the stolen object on
him. This inference is licensed by the generalisation that normally
if a stranger is found immediately after a burglary in possession of
the stolen object, he intentionally removed it himself. The defence
may try to defeat the inference by showing that the generalization
does not apply in the particular case, for example, by presenting
evidence to show that the accused had found the object on the
street. The prosecution’s hypothesis is now challenged or put
to the test. As a counter-move, it may produce evidence to establish
that the object could not have been lying in the street as
alleged. If the generalisations on which the prosecution’s case
rest survive challenges by the defence at every possible point, then
guilt is proved beyond reasonable
doubt.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-21" id="ref-21">21</a>]</sup>
The same reasoning structure applies in the civil context except that
in a civil case, the plaintiff succeeds in proof on the preponderance
of evidence so long as the conclusion to be proved by him is more
inductively probable than its negation. (Cohen 1977, 1986; cf. Schum
1979.)<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-22" id="ref-22">22</a>]</sup></p>

<p>Cohen’s theory seems to require that each test to which a
hypothesis is put can be unequivocally and objectively resolved. But
usually this is not the case. In our example, we may not be entirely
convinced that the accused found or did not find the object on the
street, and our evaluation would involve the exercise of judgment that
is no less subjective as the sort of judgments required when applying
the standard probabilistic conception of proof (Nance 2008:
275–6; Schum 1994: 261).</p>
