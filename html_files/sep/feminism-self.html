<h1>Feminist Perspectives on the Self</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Mon Jun 28, 1999; substantive revision Mon Jul 6, 2015</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>

The topic of the self has long been salient in feminist philosophy,
for it is pivotal to questions about personal identity, the body,
sociality, and agency that feminism must address. Simone de Beauvoir's
provocative declaration, “He is the Subject, he is the
Absolute—she is the Other,” signals the central importance
of the self for feminism. To be the Other is to be the non-subject,
the non-person, the non-agent—in short, the mere body. In law,
in customary practice, and in cultural stereotypes, women's selfhood
has been systematically subordinated, diminished, and belittled, when
it has not been outright denied. Throughout history, women have been
identified either as pale reflections of men or as their opposite,
characterized through perceived differences from men and subordinated
as a result of them; in both cases, women have been denigrated on the
basis of these views. Since women have been cast as lesser forms of
the masculine individual, the paradigm of the self that has gained
ascendancy in U.S. popular culture and in Western philosophy is
derived from the experience of the predominantly white and
heterosexual, mostly economically advantaged men who have wielded
social, economic, and political power and who have dominated the arts,
literature, the media, and scholarship. As a result, feminists have
not merely perceived the self as a metaphysical issue but have also
drawn attention to its ethical, epistemological, social, and political
imbrication. Responding to this state of affairs, feminist
philosophical work on the self has taken three main tacks: (1)
critiques of dominant modern, Western views of the self, (2)
reclamations of female identities, and (3) reconceptualizations of the
self as both (a) a dynamic, relational individual beholden to
unconscious desires and social bonds and (b) an intersectional,
multilayered phenomenon. The feminist reconceptualizations of the self
have in turn not only challenged standard philosophical models for
their biases but also shifted the center of the discipline toward
mutlilayered models of the relational self.  This entry will survey
both critical and reconstructive feminist approaches to the self.

<h2><a name="BM1">1. Critique</a></h2>

<p>

Modern philosophy in the West championed the individual. Extending
into contemporary moral and political thought is this idea that the
self is a free, rational chooser and actor—an autonomous
agent. Two views of the self dominate this individualistic
milieu—a Kantian ethical subject and a utilitarian 'homo
economicus.' Nevertheless, these two views differ in their
emphasis. The Kantian ethical subject uses reason to transcend
cultural norms and to discover absolute moral truth, whereas homo
economicus uses reason to rank desires in a coherent order and to
figure out how to maximize desire satisfaction within the instrumental
rationality of the marketplace.  Both of these conceptions of the self
isolate the individual from personal and social relationships and from
biological and social forces. For the Kantian ethical subject,
emotional and social bonds imperil objectivity and undermine rational
commitment to duty. For homo economicus, it makes no difference what
forces shape one's desires provided they do not result from coercion
or fraud, and one's ties to other people are to be factored into one's
calculations and planning along with the rest of one's desires. Some
feminist philosophers modify and defend these conceptions of the self,
taking issue only with women's historical exclusion from them and
claiming they should be extended to include women. However, the
decontextualized individualism and the abstraction of reason from
other capacities inherent in these two dominant views trouble many
feminist philosophers who have sought alternative perspectives on the
self as a result.</p>

<p>

Modern Western philosophy's regnant conceptions of the self minimize
the personal and ethical import of unchosen circumstances and
interpersonal relationships. They eclipse family, friendship,
passionate love, and community, and they reinforce a modern binary
that divides the social sphere into autonomous agents and their
dependents. While women are no longer classified as defective selves,
the caregiving responsibilities that once defined their status as
dependents on male heads of households continue to place a special
burden on women for labor that is devalued in society. Prevailing
conceptions of the self ignore the multiple, sometimes fractious
sources of social identity constituted at the intersections of one's
gender, sexual orientation, race, class, age, ethnicity, and so
forth. Structural domination and subordination are thought not to
penetrate the “inner citadel” of selfhood. Likewise, these
conceptions deny the complexity of the dynamic, intrapsychic world of
unconscious fantasies, fears, and desires, and they overlook the ways
in which such materials intrude upon conscious life. The modern
philosophical construct of the rational subject projects a self that
is not prey to ambivalence, anxiety, obsession, prejudice, hatred, or
violence. A disembodied mind, the body is peripheral—a source of
desires for homo economicus to weigh and a distracting temptation for
the Kantian ethical subject. Age, looks, sexuality, biological
composition, and physical competencies are considered extraneous to
the self. Yet, as valuable as rational analysis and free choice
undoubtedly are, feminists argue that these capacities do not operate
apart from affective, biosocial, socio-economic and other
heterogeneous forces that orchestrate the multilayered phenomenon that
we call the self. For many feminists, to acknowledge the self's
dependency is not to devalue the self but rather to revalue
dependency, as well as to call into question the supposed free agency
of a self that implicitly corresponds to a masculine ideal. </p>

<p>

Feminist philosophers have charged that these modernist views are both
incomplete and fundamentally misleading. A political critique begins
by questioning who provides the paradigm for these conceptions as
their point of departure. Who models this free, rational self?
Although represented as genderless, sexless, raceless, ageless, and
classless, feminists argue that the Kantian ethical subject and homo
economicus mask a white, healthy, youthfully middle-aged, middle- or
upper-class, heterosexual, male citizen. On the Kantian view, he is an
impartial judge or legislator reflecting on principles and
deliberating about policies, while on the utilitarian view, he is a
self-interested bargainer and contractor wheeling and dealing in the
marketplace. It is no accident that politics and commerce are both
domains from which women have historically been excluded. It is no
accident, either, that the philosophers who originated these views of
the self typically endorsed this exclusion. Deeming women emotional
and unprincipled, these thinkers advocated confining women to the
domestic sphere where their vices could be neutralized, even
transformed into virtues, in the role of empathetic, supportive wife,
vulnerable sexual partner, and nurturant mother.</p>

<p>

Feminist critics point out, furthermore, that this misogynist heritage
cannot be remedied simply by condemning these traditional constraints
and advocating equal rights for women. Rather, these very conceptions
of the self are gendered. In western culture, the mind and reason are
coded masculine, whereas the body and emotion are coded feminine
(Irigaray 1985b; Lloyd 1992). To identify the self with the rational
mind is, then, to masculinize the self. If selfhood is not impossible
for women, it is only because they resemble men in certain essential
respects—they are not altogether devoid of rational will. Yet,
feminine selves are necessarily deficient, for they only mimic and
approximate the masculine ideal. Ancient narratives such as the
account of Eve being spawned from Adam's rib in Genesis have been used
for thousands of years to promulgate the notion that women are
derivative from men. Despite the existence of alternative narratives
throughout history, those that bolster men's claims to primacy have
dominated the global cultural landscape for millennia.</p>

<p>

The nullification of women's selfhood was once explicitly codified in
Anglo-European and American law. The legal doctrine of coverture held
that a woman's personhood was absorbed into that of her husband when
she married (McDonagh 1996).  Assuming her husband's surname
symbolizes this denial of the wife's separate identity. In addition,
coverture deprived the wife of her right to bodily integrity, for rape
within marriage was not recognized as a crime, nor was it illegal for
a husband to beat his wife. She lost her right to property, as well,
for her husband was entitled to control her earnings, and she was
barred from making contracts in her own name.  Lacking the right to
vote or to serve on juries, she was a second-class citizen whose
enfranchised husband purportedly represented her politically.</p>

<p>

Although coverture has been rescinded, vestiges of this denial of
women's selfhood can be discerned in recent legal rulings and in
contemporary culture. For example, pregnant women remain vulnerable to
legally sanctioned violations of their right to bodily integrity and
legal autonomy, often unavoidably if they lack race and class
privilege (Brown 1998). Courts have forced pregnant women to submit to
invasive medical procedures for the sake of the fetuses they were
carrying, although no court would compel any other woman or man to
undergo comparable procedures for the sake of a living individual,
including a family member (Bordo 1993). Selflessness remains the
pregnant woman's legal status. Moreover, the stereotype of feminine
selflessness still thrives in the popular imagination. Any
self-confident, self-assertive woman is out of step with prevalent
gender norms, and a mother who is not unstintingly devoted to her
children is likely to be perceived as selfish or even a welfare
“fraud” and to face severe social censure and deprivation of social
services (Sparks 2015). Despite the fact that it is no longer legally
mandatory for wives to give up their maiden names, many women adhere
to this custom and perpetuate this traditional gesture of
self-renunciation.</p>

<p>

Problematic as well is the way these gendered conceptions of the self
contribute to the valorization of the masculine and the stigmatization
of the feminine. The masculine realm of rational selfhood is a realm
of moral decency—principled respect for others and conscientious
fidelity to duty—and of prudent good sense—adherence to
shrewd, fulfilling, long-range life plans. However, femininity is
associated with a sentimental attachment to family and friends that
spawns favoritism and compromises principles. Likewise, femininity is
associated with immersion in unpredictable domestic exigencies that
forever jeopardize the best-laid plans and often necessitate resorting
to hasty retreats or charting new directions. By comparison, the
masculinized self appears to be a sturdy fortress of integrity. The
self is essentially masculine, and the masculine self is essentially
good and wise.</p>

<p>

Feminists object that this philosophical consolidation of the
preeminence of the masculine over the feminine rests on untenable
assumptions about the transparency of the self, the immunity of the
self to social influences, and the reliability of reason as a
corrective to distorted moral judgment. People grow up in social
environments saturated with culturally normative prejudice and
implicit biases, even in communities where overt forms of bigotry are
strictly proscribed (Meyers 1994). Although official cultural norms
uphold the values of equality and tolerance, cultures continue to
transmit camouflaged messages of the inferiority of historically
subordinated social groups through stereotypes and other
imagery. These deeply ingrained schemas commonly structure attitudes,
perception, behavioral habits, and judgment despite the individual's
conscious good will (Valian 1998; Sullivan 2001; Fischer 2014). As a
result, people often consider themselves objective and fair, and yet
they systematically discriminate against “different”
others while favoring members of their own social group (Piper 1990;
Young 1990). Fortified by culture and ensconced in the unconscious,
such prejudice cannot be dispelled through rational reflection alone
(Meyers 1994). In effect, then, the Kantian construct countenances
“innocent” wrongdoing and occluded reinforcement of the
social stratification that privileges an elite whom this conception
takes as paradigmatic.</p>

<p>

These oversights necessitate reconceptualizing the self in at least
two respects. To account for the residual potency of this form of
prejudice, feminists urge, the self must be understood as socially
situated and radically heterogeneous. To account for the self's
ability to discern and resist deeply ingrained and culturally
normative prejudice, the moral subject must not be reduced to the
capacity for reason.</p>

<p>

Complementing this line of argument, a number of feminists argue that
conceptualizing the self as a seamless whole has invidious social
consequences. To realize this ideal, it is necessary to repress inner
diversity and conflict and to police the rigid boundaries of a
purified self. Alien desires and impulses are consigned to the
unconscious, but this unconscious material inevitably intrudes upon
conscious life and influences people's attitudes and desires. In
particular, the feared and despised Other within is projected onto
“other” social groups, and hatred and contempt are
redirected at these imagined enemies (Kristeva 1991; Scheman
1993). Misogyny and other forms of bigotry are thus borne of the
demand that the self be decisive, invulnerable, and unitary together
with the impossibility of meeting this demand. Worse still, these
irrational hatreds cannot be cured unless this demand is repudiated,
but to repudiate this demand is to be resigned to a degraded,
feminized self.  Far from functioning as the guarantor of moral
probity, the fictive Kantian subject is the condition of the
possibility of intractable animosity and injustice.</p>

<p>

Another strand of feminist critique targets homo economicus's
preoccupation with independence and planning. In an eerie suspension
of biological reality, utilitarian selves are conceived as sufficient
unto themselves.  Challenging patriarchal culture's homo economicus
together with the anti-biological, individualist strain in Beauvoir's
feminism, feminist thinkers such as Irigaray have turned philosophical
attention to the mother-child dyad. In dominant conceptions of the
self, no one seems to be born and raised, for birth mothers and
caregivers are driven offstage (Irigaray 1985b; Baier 1987; Code 1987;
Held 1987; Benhabib 1987; Willett 1995 and 2001; Kittay 1999; LaChance
Adams and Lundquist 2012). The self appears to materialize on its own,
endowed with a starter set of basic desires, ready to select
additional desires and construct overarching goals, and skilled in
performing instrumental rationality tasks. No one's powers ever seem
to deteriorate, either, for time is suspended along with
biology. Since dependency and vulnerability are denied, no morally
significant pre-consensual or nonconsensual entanglements particularly
salient at the beginning or the end of life need be acknowledged. All
affiliations are to be freely chosen, and all transactions are to be
freely negotiated.  The repudiation of feminine caregiving underwrites
the illusion of independence, and the illusion of independence
underwrites homo economicus's voluntarism.</p>

<p>

To achieve maximal fulfillment, homo economicus must organize his
chosen pursuits into a rational life plan. He must decide which
desires are most urgent, ensure that his desires are co-satisfiable,
and ascertain the most efficient way to satisfy this set of
desires. Spontaneity and interdependent improvisation - the comic
virtues - are registered as defeats for the “Man with the Plan
” rather than as aspects of resilience and a fluid sense of
agency (Willett and Willett 2013).  Not only is this vision of a life
governed by a self-chosen plan distinctly middle- and upper-class, it
is gendered (Addelson 1994; Walker 1999). The mother responding to the
social dance of early childhood and the lover embracing the unexpected
are the antitheses of this straight man's conception of the
self. Uncertain of where they are ultimately headed and seldom sure
how to achieve the goals they embrace as they go along, yet game for
the adventure, the mother and lover transgress rigid, modernist norms
of selfhood.</p>

<p>

A further problem with the traditional modernist view from a feminist
standpoint is that it fails to furnish an adequate account of
internalized oppression and the process of overcoming it. It is common
for women to comport themselves in a feminine fashion, to scale down
their aspirations, and to embrace gender-compliant goals (Irigaray
1985a; Bartky 1990; Babbitt 1993; Cudd 2006; Beauvoir 2011).
Feminists account for this phenomenon by explaining that women
internalize patriarchal values and norms—that is, these
pernicious values and norms become integrated in the cognitive,
emotional, and conative structure of the self. Women may contribute to
their own oppression without realizing it. Once embedded in a woman's
psychic economy, internalized oppression conditions her desires. To
maximize satisfaction of her desires, then, would be to collaborate in
her own oppression. Paradoxically, the more completely she fulfills
these desires, the worse off she becomes. Advantaged as he is, homo
economicus can safely accept his desires as given and proceed without
ado to orchestrate a plan to satisfy them. But women and members of
other subordinated groups can ill-afford such complacency, and homo
economicus's instrumental reason is too superficial to serve their
interests (Irigaray 1985a; Babbitt 1993). They need a conception of
the self that renders the emancipatory transformation of one's values
and projects intelligible.</p>

<p>

Feminist critique exposes the partiality of the ostensibly universal
Kantian ethical subject and homo economicus. These conceptions of the
self are: 1) androcentric because they replicate masculine stereotypes
and ideals; 2) sexist because they demean anything that smacks of the
feminine; 3) masculinist because they help to perpetuate male
dominance; and 4) elitist because they perpetuate other associated
biases, including heterosexist, transphobic, racist, ethnocentric,
ableist, classist, and, arguably, speciesist biases (Willett
2014). While the latter dimensions of these prevalent concepts of the
self are explored more fully in other encyclopedia articles, these
problems cannot be disentangled from the larger critique and efforts
at reconceptualizing a self that do not duplicate the modernist
Anglo-European structures of dominance.
</p>

<h2><a name="BM2">2. Reclamation of Female Identities and Women's Status</a></h2>

<p>

Feminist critiques, we have seen, accuse regnant philosophical
accounts of masculinizing the self. One corollary of this masculinized
view of selfhood is that women are consigned to
selflessness—that is, to invisibility, subservient passivity,
and self-sacrificial altruism. These traditional images have a long
history and remain salient today in reductive views of the maternal as
the central axis of female identity.</p>


<p>

A tension within feminism complicates the project of reclaiming
women's selfhood, however. The claim that women are systematically
subordinated and that this subordination has a grievous impact on
women's lives is central to feminism. Yet, this key insight seems to
belie the claim that women's selfhood and agency have been overlooked.
To be unjustly subordinated, it would seem, is to be diminished in
one's selfhood and to have one's agency curtailed. Otherwise, what's
the harm? Addressing this paradox requires challenging “master
narratives” and traditional canons of philosophy, through turning
toward “slave narratives” and other subversive philosophical cultures
for alternative views of identity and selfhood (Willett 1995) and
through reasserting the identity of women in manners that transform
stereotypes into liberating modes of selfhood. </p>

<p>

Yet apart from such challenges to the master narratives and classical
binaries, feminists may risk perpetuating derogatory views of women as
victims and men as agents. Arguing that moral virtues truly have no
gender, Mary Wollstonecraft regards “feminine” virtues as
perversions of these true virtues and laments women's conscription
into a bogus ideal (Wollstonecraft 1792). Similarly but more vividly,
Simone de Beauvoir labels women “mutilated” and
“immanent” (Beauvoir 2011). Socialized to objectify
themselves, women are said to become narcissistic, small-minded, and
dependent on others' approval. Excluded from careers, waiting to be
chosen by their future husbands, taken over by natural forces during
pregnancy, busy with tedious, repetitive housework, women never become
transcendent agents. Indeed, they are content not to assume the burden
of responsibility for their own freedom. Cast in the role of man's
Other and at the mercy of feminine vices, women succumb to bad faith
and surrender their agency.</p>

<p>

This portrayal of women as abject victims of the patriarchal family
has been challenged and modulated in contemporary feminist
philosophy. We shall review three major reclamation strategies: 1)
revaluing the traditionally 'feminine' activities of mothering and
other modes for generating or maintaining vital social bonds through
the development of care ethics and eros ethics; 2) rethinking autonomy
to include women by moving beyond the two traditional models described
above; and 3) reclaiming sexual difference through a symbolic analysis
of female identity. </p>

<p>

The conventional view of pregnancy and birth classifies them as merely
biological processes, while the conventional view of mothering
classifies it as a merely instinctual activity. Feminists demonstrate
that these assessments are sorely mistaken. Revaluing the significance
of the mother and the early social bond have produced two overlapping
philosophical approaches: an ethics of care (Ruddick 1989; Kittay
1999; Held 2006; Lindemann 2014) and an ethics of eros (Collins 1990;
Irigaray 1993; Willett 1995 and 2014; Nzegwu 2006; Lorde 2007;
Rawlinson 2015). While the care tradition grows out of a critical
engagement with Anglo-American analytic and pragmatist philosophical
traditions, the eros tradition draws centrally from Africana
(including African American pragmatist), Continental, and other
sources. Both traditions emphasize that pregnancy and giving birth
engage women's agential powers. The care tradition varies among those
who aim to value dependents and dependency work and/or reconceptualize
autonomy so that autonomy and dependency are compatible.  An ethics of
eros draws from traditions of “othermothering” (Collins 1990),
emancipatory discourses of libidinal drives and generative powers
(Lorde 2007; Rawlinson 2015), and traditions of cultivating and
repairing the social bond (Willett 1995 and 2014). The social bond may
reflect a dynamic of kinship, political solidarity, or community
engagement outside of the nuclear family paradigm (Collins 1990;
Willett 1995 and 2014; Nzegwu 2006). This tradition foregrounds
complicated modes of interdependency and relationality that spiral out
of the autonomy/dependency binary to emphasize thick networks of
social belonging and the alienation or violation of social bonds.
</p>

<p>

Care ethics traditions balance second wave feminism's reproductive
rights movements and reassertions of female agency with a greater
appreciation for the value of care work and character virtues that
reflect vulnerability, while eros ethics emphasizes political
subversion, self-and-other empowerment, revitalizing affects of
preconscious energy and connectedness, and creative social roles and
communal practices. Anglo-American care ethics traditions observe that
already from the beginning of maternity, pregnancy requires difficult
decisions such as whether to have an abortion (Held 1989), and
strategies for waiting for the child and coping with routine pain
(Ruddick 1994). Black pragmatist traditions testify to the devaluation
and surveillance of black and brown bodies in state-induced abortions
and call for greater empowerment of women rather than the positive
revaluation of vulnerability (Brown 1998). In the last few decades,
medical technologies, such as sonography and fetal and neonatal
surgery, have raised new issues for pregnant women and sometimes
confront them with wrenching choices that not only test their agential
resilience and capacities to care but also challenge traditional
binaries further by acknowledging intersexual identities (Feder
2014). Even through the various challenges, the infant's development
of creative communicative skills through affect attunement and
face-to-face play explains the life-long intensity of social bonds
(Willett, 1995, 2001, and 2014). Drawing from care ethics, Hilde
Lindemann argues that caregiving exhibits key features in what she
calls the “practice of personhood – of knowing when
and how to hold and let go of various aspects of others”
identities (Lindemann 2014).  Cynthia Willett, expanding upon critical
traditions of liberatory eros, argues that the laughing mother
provides a subversive complement to the long suffering,
self-sacrificing maternal ideal.</p>

<p>In this respect, we begin to see a related feminist innovation
– one that focuses on mothering in order to to grasp its social
aims, its forms of thought, its ideal form, and its characteristic
values and disvalues. Caring for a child imposes a set of
demands—for preservation (survival), growth (development into a
healthy adult), and acceptability (enculturation that ensures fitting
into a community) (Ruddick 1989). Meeting these demands involves a
range of activities that are governed by a distinctive set of values:
protecting and caring for a fragile existence and expanding the sense
of self while acknowledging the limits of one's power and the
unpredictability of events, being sensitive to the other's very
different viewpoint, and learning to love while struggling against
traumatic social conditions, inadequate social services, and invasive
governmental and medical interventions (Collins 1990; Brown
1998). Although the practice of mothering places no premium on
independence, self-interest, free choice, power, advance planning, or
control, it clearly calls upon a wide range of interpersonal,
political, and reflective skills and enlists caregivers' agential
capacities for generating social bonds. Dumb “animal”
instinct hardly suffices for raising children often in extreme
conditions of poverty, discrimination, and failed governments.</p>

<p>

Like feminists who have reclaimed women's agency as mothers, feminists
who have developed versions of relational ethics insist on taking
women's experience seriously and use this experience as a basis for
new approaches to social ethics and public policy. The aim of the
psychological studies that first made the voice of care audible was to
recognize and understand the capacities for moral judgment of women
whose competency had been underrated. Previous research comparing
boys' and girls' moral development had concluded that girls'
development was stunted, but Carol Gilligan argues that this
assessment misconstrued the data (Gilligan 1982). According to
Gilligan, there are two paths of moral development: justice and care. Many girls and
women but almost no men follow the care trajectory (Gilligan
1987). Since earlier investigations first studied U.S. boys and men
and used these interviews to generalize about people's moral
development, researchers noticed only one path, namely, the justice
trajectory. By repudiating the assumption that the masculine is the
human norm and by studying girls and women, Gilligan discovered an
alternative mode of moral cognition—the Care
Perspective. Constituted by a distinctive set of framing concepts and
a distinctive set of reflective skills, the morality of care is not
translatable into the morality of justice that Gilligan's predecessors
had taken to be the gauge of moral development. The Care Perspective,
in Gilligan's view, is a different and equally good way to interpret
moral situations and to decide how to act. Moreover, by noticing this
alternative, we are able to recognize women's moral agency and defend
women against the age-old charge that they are morally inferior to
men.</p>

<p>

Although a number of feminist philosophers criticize Gilligan's
investigations on empirical or philosophical grounds (Fraser and
Nicholson 1990; Moody-Adams 1991; Friedman 1993; Card 1996), her
research prompted a number of feminist philosophers to develop social
ethics perspectives marked by quite different emphases from those of
traditional moral theories. The theme of human interconnectedness and
the value of intersubjectivity are prominent in contemporary feminist
ethics. In Anglo-American care traditions, emphasis is placed on a
climate of trust that forms an indispensable background for all sorts
of undertakings; no voluntaristic ethic can account for such trust
(Baier 1986). The ability to empathize with other individuals and
imaginatively reconstruct their unique subjective viewpoints is vital
to moral insight and wise moral choice, but ethics that base moral
judgment on a universal conception of the person or abstract rules
marginalize this skill (Meyers 1994). By developing narratives of
one's moral identity, one's relationships, and one's values and
sharing those narratives with one's associates, one endows one's life
with moral meaning and integrity, but rationalistic ethics overlook
this process of self-disclosure and interpersonal mediation (Walker
1998). Taking responsibility for who one is and how one shall respond
is a salient feature of informal personal relationships, yet
justice-oriented ethics focuses exclusively on being held responsible
for what one has done and the credit or blame one's actions may
deserve (Card 1996). Appreciating the inescapability of dependency and
the need for care demonstrates the poverty of conceiving justice
exclusively in terms of individual rights not to be interfered with
and the urgency of developing a liberal theory of justice that
includes provisions for care (Kittay 1999; Nussbaum 2007). In each
instance, Anglo-American feminist moral theorists revalue that which
is traditionally deemed feminine—feeling, intimacy, nurturance,
and so forth. By highlighting these contexts and values, they reclaim
the venues traditionally associated with women as morally significant
sites, and they reclaim the moral agency of the individuals whose
lives are centered in these sites.</p>

<p>

Many feminists working to transform the Anglo-American tradition seek
to rebalance autonomy with care rather than do away with autonomy
altogether. Although some feminists dismiss autonomy as an
androcentric relic of modernism (Jaggar 1983; Addelson 1994; Hekman
1995; Card 1996), others assert women's need for self-determination
(Lugones and Spelman 1983; de Lauretis 1986; King 1988; Govier
1993). In light of the history of figuring women as driven by their
reproductive biology and in need of rational male guidance, as well as
the history of women's enforced economic dependence on men or
relegation to poorly paid or abject forms of labor, feminists can
hardly ignore the topic of self-determination.  Thus, a number of
feminist philosophers take up this challenge and present accounts of
autonomy that do not devalue the interpersonal capacities and social
contributions that are conventionally coded feminine (Nedelsky 1989;
Meyers 1989 and 2000; Benhabib 1995 and 1999; Weir 1995). In feminist
accounts, autonomy is not conflated with self-sufficiency and free
will, but rather it is seen to be facilitated by supportive
relationships and also to be a matter of degree. The self has a degree
of autonomy but, once we pursue the implications of care ethics for
the nature of the self, it can no longer be considered as radically
independent.</p>

<p>

Whereas standard modernist accounts of autonomy stress rational
decision making and valorize a respect for rights, feminist accounts
accent the role of feelings in autonomous lives (Nedelsky 1989; Meyers
1989; Weir 1995) and focus on the way that subordination constrains
autonomy (Meyers 1989; Babbitt 1993; Benhabib 1995; Cudd 2006).
Feminist accounts stress the autonomous individual's need for
constructive feedback, advice, and encouragement from others (Meyers
1989; Brison 1997). A feminist view opens the space for considering
autonomy an ongoing and improvisational process of exercising
self-discovery, self-definition, and self-direction, rather than
endorsing a set of desires and goals chosen exclusively by the
individual (Meyers 1989 and 2000).  While standard accounts see
autonomy as an all-or-nothing achievement, feminist accounts note how
autonomy skills piggyback on seemingly unrelated ancillary skills, how
autonomy skills may be exercised in certain contexts yet deactivated
in others, and how different degrees of skillfulness yield varying
degrees of autonomy (Meyers 1989; Friedman 1993).</p>


<p>

Such feminist versions of autonomy strike a balance between recognizing the
injury that subordination does to women's sense of self and agency and
respecting the measure of autonomy women gain despite this
subjugation (Cudd 2006). Subordination endangers women's autonomy in a number of
ways. Not only does internalized oppression mold women's desires and
alienate them from themselves; it also offers those in subordinate positions
all sorts of incentives to minimize friction and ease
their lot by placating those with power (Card 1996). Likewise,
well-meaning friends are all too likely to counsel the course of least
resistance: namely, compliance with convention regardless of one's
personal values and aspirations. Another effect of systematic
subordination is that women's autonomy skills may be poorly developed
or poorly coordinated, and exercising them is more often discouraged than rewarded
(Meyers 1989). Deficient autonomy skills
compound the threat internalized oppression poses.</p>

<p>

Still, feminist accounts of autonomy enable us to understand why women
do not completely lack autonomy and how women's autonomy can be
augmented. The self-discovery, self-definition, and self-direction
skills that secure autonomy are commonplace (Meyers 1989). Indeed,
some of them, such as introspective attunement to feelings and
receptiveness to others' feedback, are gender-compatible for and often
promoted in women. Although others, such as rational planning and
self-assertion, are coded masculine, many women in fact have
considerable proficiency in these areas. All too often, however, they
exercise these skills only in narrowly restricted, gender-appropriate
contexts. For example, a homemaker may demonstrate remarkable
instrumental reasoning skills in running her household, or a mother may
exhibit effective self-assertion skills in dealing with a teacher who
has mistreated her child. Yet, these women may come off as inept,
helpless, and meek in other situations. Thus, augmenting women's
autonomy is often a matter of emboldening women to extend the range of
application of their existing autonomy skills and fostering the
development of weak skills. It is evident, then, why separatist
practices of various kinds are conducive to women's autonomy. By
inviting women to marshall their autonomy skills and reinforcing
women's determination to carry out their decisions, they function as
autonomy workshops.</p>

<p>
An early feminist who aimed to revise traditional, implicitly
masculinist, autonomy with a conception of freedom that incorporated
women's experience was Beauvoir. Along with fellow existentialist
Jean-Paul Sartre, Beauvoir characterized human experience in terms of
'immanence,' or one's embeddedness within one's historico-cultural, as
well as personal, situation, and 'transcendence,' or one's radical
freedom with respect to one's choices and future. This dual nature of
the human condition contests the radical independence of the rational
subject of Kantian autonomy or homo economicus by placing ambiguity at
the heart of human experience. While both men and women are immanent
and transcendent on an existentialist view, Beauvoir claims that women
have been overwhelmingly associated with immanence and thus have not
been encouraged to claim their own freedom (Beauvoir 2011). Their
selves are determined by their situations and contexts--what biology
and others claim them to be--and they have been prevented from taking
up their own lives as projects. Beauvoir, then, is in line with
feminists' reclamation of autonomy (something for which other
feminists have often critiqued her, associating this reclamation with
a reversion to the masculine ideal of independence), although this
reclamation is not at the expense of acknowledging women's
determination by their socio-cultural and personal landscape. For
Beauvoir, 'women' is a category imposed by society; women's selves,
then, are also in large part imposed on them by society, and on her
view women would do well to take hold of their claims to freedom and
choice and thus reclaim their freedom and selfhood.
</p>

<p>

Other feminists propose alternatives that are orthogonal to the
autonomy/dependency binary undergirding Anglo-American and European
modernism. Nkiru Uwechia Nzegwu emphasizes the value of dialogue over
monologic styles of narrative self-understanding and alternative
non-Western models of thinking and selfhood (Nzegwu 2006).  She
develops one such alternative model by staging a fictional
conversation between Beauvoir and Nigerian Igbo thinkers on the
maternal ethos of the consanguineal, woman-woman, matrilineal, and
dual-descent families with striking implications.  In these contexts,
a relational identity of the self`emerges in an intricate network of
family, societal, and organizational ties.  Unfolding in a
multiplicity of relationships rather than in a dyad of mother/child
and binary of autonomy/dependency, the self may exhibit vulnerability
and/or autonomy but also, more centrally, traits that play out in
complex social negotiations and struggles.  In traditions such as the
Igbo where women may be known as “fearless fighters,” the symbolic and
cultural meaning of self and mother fall outside the modern, liberal
template of dual gender systems and abstract, formal conceptions of
equality (Nzegwu 2006). If a sense of self does not develop in a
Western gendered system, issues of justice in the context of sexual
and cultural differences may require a more substantial conception of
equality than the formal rights rooted in early modern liberalism, and
drawing instead from postcolonial, ecofeminist, and socialist
transformations of liberal conceptions of rights (Willett 2008).</p>

<p>
Moreover, in these alternative and often emancipatory accounts of an
erotic self, the trajectory of self-development may vary from
prevalent Western views.  The latter conceptions of self-identity
commonly invoke a tale of early dependency upon the family and the
eventual achievement of autonomy through narratives of separation and
virtues of independence and self-determination.  Alternative
traditions of maturation may feature instead a multiplicity of social
roles, practices, and connections. Patricia Hill Collins offers
glimpses into an ethics of interconnectivity as an eros ethics in her
characterization of the fluidity of “othermothers” for African
American communities (Collins 1990).  For this tradition, she cites
Audre Lorde's distinct rendering of the term 'eros'. The erotic charge
of the self is not primarily sexual nor narrowly maternal, but is the
energy and drive that oppressive systems attempt to appropriate and
that creative, life-giving social practices regenerate. Rather than
striving for autonomy from these practices, these thinkers seek ways
to grow in their sense of power through counter-traditions and
alternative, emancipatory cultures and communities.  </p>

<p>

Some feminist thinkers of eros, most notably Luce Irigaray, draw on
the imagery of the female body to reconsider the nature of selfhood
and to provide a robust critique of implicitly masculine models of
autonomy. Irigaray demonstrates that the feminine has typically been
identified with space, or a localizable place of inertia, while the
masculine has been identified with time, especially ecstatic
projection toward the future. While the feminine represents touch, the
masculine represents vision, and the connotations of independent
observation and distance that go along with it (Irigaray 1985a, 1992,
and 1993). Playing off of these typical connotations, Irigaray uses
the image of the 'lips' to figure a mode of selfhood in which the body
is self-touching, not independent or 'one' but rather always already
'two,' or even 'four,'in a multiplication that takes into account the
labia as well as the lips of the mouth (Irigaray 1985b and
1993). Through this gesture, Irigaray reclaims the association of the
feminine with the body in the face of masculine dreams of autonomy,
separation, and independence. Her style of writing transmutes the way
that the feminine has typically been denied the subject-position in a
way that contests the traditional view of the self as autonomous
subject and instead offers a fundamentally disjointed subject that,
precisely because of its self-distance, is able to relate to others
through wonder and an enveloping that preserves the other as other
(Irigaray 1993). Through self-touching and a love of self that is a
genuine eros rather than mere narcissism, we are able to acknowledge
the alterity within us and thereby genuinely connect with others in
their difference from us.  </p>


<p>

To understanding what Irigaray offers for a feminist philosophy of the
self, it is important to dispel the specter of 'essentialism' that
beset feminist debates in the 1990s and continues to have effects
today. Irigaray and fellow feminists writing in French around the same
period (especially Julia Kristeva and Hélène Cixous) have sometimes
been criticized for their emphasis on the body, particularly on
women's organs (Sayers 1986; Poovey 1988). If Irigaray's understanding
of the feminine self is so dependent on the figure of the lips and on
difference as 'sexual difference,' many wonder, is there an implicit
biologism and/or heteronormativity in her thought of which one should
be wary? Is she inscribing her thought within traditional notions of
women's 'essence'? Indeed, while material feminists are currently
bringing a rich biologism in their thoughts on the renaturalized self
and/or sexual difference (Grosz 2011), Irigaray is not in any
straightforward way one of them (Chanter 1995; Xu 1995). Her writing
is influenced by the psychoanalytic distinction between three
orders--the symbolic, the imaginary, and the real--that are layered
and interwoven. Because language occurs within the symbolic order,
Irigaray's writing is symbolic in this particular sense, and clearly
is not a return to a reinscription of anti-feminist 'essential' sexual
differences based purely on biology or anatomy. Through her strategic
writing style of 'mimesis', which utilizes the very stereotypes that
have been used against women in order to undermine them, Irigaray
plays on the traditional conception of woman as the 'other' to the
male subject who has no agency or identity of her own. She reclaims
the very modes that have denigrated women for millennia--relegation to
the body, denial of the subject-position; woman as the 'mirror' of the
male subject--through a subversive, symbolic writing style that turns
the traditional view of selfhood on its head and opens new routes of
relationality within difference and offers a model of subjectivity
marked by self-differentiation rather than identity.</p>

<p>

These and other reclamations of female identities have prompted a
number of significant reconceptualizations of the nature of the self
as relational and multilayered.</p>
     

<h2><a name="BM3">3. Reconceptualizations</a></h2>

<h3><a name="3.1">3.1 The Nature of the Self as Dynamic and Relational</a></h3>

<p>

As we have seen, many feminist philosophers argue that it is a mistake
to hold that rationality alone is essential to the self and that the
ideal self is transparent, unified, coherent, and independent, for
they discern misogynist subtexts in the atomistic individualism of the
Kantian ethical subject and homo economicus (see Section 1). While
some feminists argue for a relational model of autonomy, others reject
the narrative of separation from the maternal sphere as an overarching
framing device for maturation. Drawing upon multicultural and global
sources, they see this narrative arc as falling short of the complex
dynamics of a multilayered, interconnected self that may grow through
sustained interactions with the mother, family, and/or community
rather than in decisive breaks (however incomplete, whether sullied or
blurred) from them. In this section, we take up new conceptions of
relational autonomy, and then turn to the more transformative views of
relationality. Both approaches agree that it is incumbent on feminist
philosophers to develop more satisfactory accounts of the self as
dynamic and relational—accounts that are compatible with respect
for women. Thus, a number of feminist philosophers have proposed
reconstructions of alternative traditions of the nature of the
self.</p>

<p>

For both relational autonomy and more transformative views, three
traditions have been especially influential for thinking a dynamic,
relationality in recent, European and Anglo-American feminist
thought—classical psychoanalysis, object relations theory, and
poststructuralism. Feminist philosophers gravitate toward these
approaches to understanding selfhood because they do not share the
drawbacks that prompt feminist critiques of the Kantian ethical
subject and homo economicus. None of these approaches regards the self
as homogeneous or transparent; none supposes that a self should be
coherent and speak in a single voice; none removes the self from its
cultural or interpersonal setting; none sidelines the body. In
appropriating these views, feminists bring out their implications in
regard to gender, incorporate feminist insights into these theories,
and modify the theories to address feminist concerns.</p>

<p>

While Kristeva maintains the separation narrative, she complicates it
by transposing the classical Freudian conception of the self and the
distinction between consciousness and the unconscious into an
explicitly gendered discursive framework (Kristeva 1980; Oliver 1993;
McAfee 2003; Miller 2014). For Kristeva, the self is a subject of
enunciation—a speaker who can use the pronoun
‘I’. But speakers are neither unitary nor fully in control
of what they say, because discourse is bifurcated. The symbolic
dimension of language, which is characterized by referential signs and
linear logic, corresponds to consciousness and control. The clear, dry
prose of scientific research reports epitomizes symbolic
discourse. The semiotic dimension of language, which is characterized
by figurative language, cadences, and intonations, corresponds to the
unruly, passion-fueled unconscious. The ambiguities and nonstandard
usages of poetry epitomize semiotic discourse. These paradigms
notwithstanding, Kristeva maintains that all discourse combines
elements of both registers. Every intelligible utterance relies on
semantic conventions, and every utterance has a tone, even if it is a
dull monotone. This contention connects Kristeva's account to feminist
concerns about gender and the self. Since the rational orderliness of
the symbolic is culturally coded masculine while the affect-laden
allure of the semiotic is culturally coded feminine, it follows that
no discourse is purely masculine or purely feminine. The masculine
symbolic and the feminine semiotic are equally indispensable to the
speaking subject, whatever this individual's socially assigned gender
may be. It is not possible, then, to be a purely masculine self or a
purely feminine self. Every subject of enunciation—every
self—amalgamates masculine and feminine discursive
modalities. Separation from the semiotic maternal realm is never
complete.</p>

<p>

Like the unconscious in classical psychoanalytic theory, the semiotic
decenters the self. One may try to express one's thoughts in definite,
straightforward language, yet because of the semiotic aspects of one's
utterances, what one says carries no single meaning and is amenable to
being interpreted in more than one way. In Kristeva's view, this is
all to the good, for accessing the semiotic—that which is
conveyed, often inadvertently, by the style of an
utterance—kindles social critique. The semiotic gives expression
to repressed, unconscious material. According to Kristeva, what
society systematically represses provides clues to what is oppressive
about society and how society needs to be changed. Thus, she discerns
a vital ethical potential in the semiotic (Kristeva 1987). Since this
ethical potential is explicitly linked to the feminine, moreover,
Kristeva's account of the self displaces “masculine”
adherence to principle as the prime mode of ethical agency and
recognizes the urgent need for a “feminine” ethical
approach. Viewing the self as a
“questionable-subject-in-process”—a subject who is
responsive to the encroachments of semiotic material into conscious
life and who is therefore without a fixed or unitary
identity—and valorizing the dissident potential of this
decentered subjectivity, Kristeva seeks to neutralize the fear of the
inchoate feminine that, in her view, underwrites misogyny. In one
respect, Nancy Chodorow's appropriation of object relations theory
parallels Kristeva's project of reclaiming and revaluing femininity,
for Chodorow's account of the relational self reclaims and revalues
feminine mothering capacities. But whereas Kristeva focuses on
challenging the homogeneous self and the bright line between reason,
on the one hand, and emotion and desire, on the other, Chodorow
focuses on challenging the self-subsisting self with its sharp
self-other boundaries. Chodorow's claim that the self is inextricable
from interpersonal relationships calls into question the
decontextualized individualism of the Kantian ethical subject and homo
economicus.</p>

<p>

Chodorow sees the self as relational in several respects (Chodorow
1981). Every child is cared for by an adult or adults, and every
individual is shaped for better or worse by this emotionally charged
interaction. As a result of feelings of need and moments of
frustration, the infant becomes differentiated from its primary
caregiver and develops a sense of separate identity. Concomitantly, a
distinctive personality emerges. By selectively internalizing and
recombining elements of their experience with other people, children
develop characteristic traits and dispositions. Moreover, Chodorow
attributes the development of a key interpersonal capacity to
nurturance. A caregiver who is experienced as warmly solicitous is
internalized as a “good internal mother” (Chodorow 1980). Children
gain a sense of their worthiness by internalizing the nurturance they
receive and directing it toward themselves, and they learn to respect
and respond to other people by internalizing their experience of
nurturance and projecting it toward others. Whereas Kristeva
understands the self as a dynamic interplay between the feminine
semiotic and the masculine symbolic, Chodorow understands the self as
linked to cultural norms of feminine
interpersonal responsiveness. For Chodorow, the rigidly
differentiated, compulsively rational, stubbornly independent self is
a masculine defensive formation—a warped form of the
relational self—that develops as a result of fathers'
negligible involvement in childcare.</p>

<p>

Feminist philosophers have noted strengths and weaknesses in both of
these views. For example, Kristeva's questionable-subject-in-process
seems to enshrine and endorse the very gender dichotomy that causes
women so much grief. The association of the mother with the unruly and
ambiguous semiotic may obscure the rich affect attunement and
preverbal dialogues between (male and female) caregivers and their
already socially-oriented infants (Willett 1995). Chodorow's
relational self seems to glorify weak individuation and scorn the
spirited independence and “fearless fighter” that women, in some
cultures and/or oppressive conditions, may reclaim as part of a
maternal ethos (Willett 1995; Nzegwu 2006; Lorde 2007). Still,
Kristeva's analyses of the psychic, social, and political potency of
gender figurations underscore the need for feminist counter-imagery to
offset culturally entrenched, patriarchal images of womanhood and the
unconscious desires and fantasies that these images buttress. And
Chodorow's appreciation of the relational self together with her
diagnosis of the damage wrought by hyperindividuation advances
feminist demands for equitable parenting practices and stronger
relational conceptions of the self. These contributions
notwithstanding, both of these views have come under attack for
heterosexist biases as well as for inattention to other forms of
difference among women.</p>

<p>

Poststructuralists and critical race theorists have been particularly
vocal about this failure to come to grips with the diversity of
gender, and they have offered accounts of the self designed to
accommodate difference. The earlier work of poststructuralist Judith
Butler maintained that personal identity—the sense that there
are answers to the questions ‘who am I?’ and ‘what
am I like?’—is an illusion (Butler 1990). The self is
merely an unstable discursive node—a shifting confluence of
multiple discursive currents—and sexed/gendered identity is
merely a “corporeal style”—the imitation and
repeated enactment of ubiquitous norms. For Butler, psychodynamic
accounts of the self, including Kristeva's and Chodorow's, camouflage
the performative nature of the self and collaborate in the cultural
conspiracy that maintains the illusion that one has an emotionally
anchored, interior identity that is derived from one's biological
nature, which is manifest in one's genitalia. Such accounts are
pernicious. In concealing the ways in which normalizing regimes deploy
power to enforce the performative routines that construct
“natural” sexed/gendered bodies together with debased,
“unnatural” bodies, they obscure the arbitrariness of the
constraints that are being imposed and deflect resistance to these
constraints. The solution, in Butler's view, is to question the
categories of biological sex, polarized gender, and determinate
sexuality that serve as markers of personal identity, to treat the
construction of identity as a site of political contestation, and to
embrace the subversive potential of unorthodox performances and
parodic identities.  Her later work continues to emphasize the
relationality of the self through its dispossession by the very
discursive structures that call the self into existence. </p>

<p>
Cressida Heyes adds to Butler's work by insisting upon one of
Foucault’s poststructuralist insights: the disciplinary power that
constrains our somatic selves at the same time enhances our capacities
and develops new skills.  To become a transsexual with a diagnosis of
Gender Identity Disorder and gain access to therapeutic and medical
techniques can for some provide a meaningful narrative and a
liberating experience.  At the same time, the new norms for a
transsexual identity may generate their own exclusionary
politics. Heyes addresses the exclusionary processes of identity
politics by returning to Foucault's incomplete thoughts on care of the
self, arguing that attentiveness to the body and its capacities to
resist norms opens possibilities for new forms of becoming (McWhorter
1999; Heyes 2007).</p>

<p>

By and large, much of recent feminist philosophy of the self troubles
the autonomy model, typically by introducing psychodynamic and
relational features.  Interpretations of Kristeva develop her views
further by expanding up the relational self as a capacity for a loving
sense of “response-ability” to otherness and difference (Oliver
1998). Kelly Oliver's post-Levinasian approach emphasizes the radical
exteriority of the other to the self, locating the origin or prompt
for the self from this radical exteriority.  Oliver uses the motif of
witnessing to explore the ways in which the othering can be
acknowledged but not known.</p>

<p>
On the other hand, some contemporary feminist philosophers express
concern that the sorts of conceptions sketched above are detrimental
to feminist aims (Benhabib 1995). Still, feminists have moved
psychoanalytic theories, object relations theories, and
poststructuralism forward to introduce new conceptions of the
relational self as not only embodied, psycho-dynamic, and social, but
also intersectional and multilayered.</p>

<h3><a name="3.2">3.2 Intersectional and Other Layered Dimensions of the Relational Self</a></h3>

<p>

Increasingly, over the past several decades, biological, biosocial,
and intersectional layers of the relational self have gained more
prominence.  Intersectional theories of the self brought forward by
African American feminists adapt aspects of poststructuralist theory
to the purposes of critical race theory (Williams 1991; Crenshaw
1993). Noting that gender, race, and class stratification do not
operate in isolation from one another but rather interact to produce
compound effects, these theorists conceive of the individual as an
intersectional subject—a site where structures of domination and
subordination but also agency converge (Moraga and Anzaldua 1981; King
1988; Crenshaw 1993; Willett 1995).  Intersectional theory does not
purport to offer a comprehensive theory of the self; rather, its aim
is to capture those aspects of selfhood that are conditioned by
membership in subordinated or privileged social groups.  Accenting the
liabilities of belonging to more than one subordinated group, Kimberlé
Crenshaw likens the position of such individuals to that of a
pedestrian hit by several speeding vehicles simultaneously, and María
Lugones likens their position to that of a stateless border-dweller
who is not at home anywhere (Crenshaw 1991; Lugones 1992). As a “world
traveler,” Lugones finds herself shifting between Latino and
Anglo-American worlds. Nevertheless, some theorists of mixed ancestry
embrace border-dwelling as a model of positive identity (Anzaldua
1987; Alarcon 1991 and 1996; Alcoff 1995) or as the locus of a
“multiplicitous self” that has access to many worlds (Barvosa 2008;
Ortega 2015). Gloria Anzaldua's groundbreaking work develops the
mestiza as a central figure for understanding a new kind of self with
an ambiguous, fluid identity. The mestiza experiences a sense of
constant displacement and in-betweenness but also modes of
meaning-making. Lorde's “sister outsider” and Collins'
“outsider-within” offer similar conceptions of the self, that, in
contrast with W.E.B. DuBois' well-established account of “double
consciousness,” develop a multitudinous identity in connection with
others. This identity is not primarily oriented around the black/white
divide prominent in DuBois, nor in modern theories of autonomy, but
instead around multiple roles and sources of energy, kinship, and
community. Moreover, proponents of the intersectional self credit
multiply oppressed people with a certain epistemic advantage (Willett
1995). In virtue of their suffering and alienation, these individuals
are well situated not only to discern which values and practices in
their heritage deserve allegiance but also to identify shortcomings in
the traditions of the groups to which they belong. Thus,
African-American women are acutely aware of racism within feminism and
sexism within the struggle for racial justice. Their intersectional
positioning and subjectivity makes such insight virtually
unavoidable.</p>

<p>
While intersectional theorists bring forward race, class, ability, and
other socio-economic markers as central to psychical-historical
locations of agency, power and connectivity, a number of feminists are
increasingly paying attention to somatic-organic factors in selfhood.
Catherine Malabou points to such mental ailments as Alzheimer's
disease to raise questions for poststructural and psychoanalytic
theories (Malabou 2012).  Diseases with an organic and physical basis
challenge any conception of a subjectivity located exclusively in the
continuities of conscious and/or unconscious life as posited by
psychoanalytic theory. She reinterprets Derrida's deconstructive self
as punctured by experiences of foreignness--of an alterity in the
self--through a non-reductive neurobiology of
trauma or brain injury.  Injured selves may experience radical
discontinuities or lose entirely aspects of their former selves. The
resulting picture of the self is a multilayered nexus of relations
with psychic-historical and somatic-organic strata. Her work makes
clear that philosophies of the self cannot ignore the biological
sciences.</p>

<p>
Willett takes up Africana, Latina, and other feminist traditions of an
interconnected self together with biological and psychological studies
of affect, social emotions, and micro and macro biosocial networks. As
a social species, the most basic drives and affects of the human self
are pro-social, not narcissistic or hedonistic. Maturity does not
require abjection, repression, or traumatizing discipline for social
cooperation.  The capacity for love, friendship, and cooperation with
social groups characterizes humans as a biological species. One
consequence of the biosocial drives, as we have seen, is the rejection
of the autonomy narrative as the primary or exclusive goal of
self-development (Willett 1995, 1998, 2001). The self matures through
enhanced capacities and desires to form social bonds, not severance
from a source of dependence (typically portrayed as the mother, the
body, and/or the animal world).</p>

<p>
Another consequence of this intermingling of the biological with the
social is that intersectionality theory is now extended to include
mixed species communities (Willett 2014).  This eco-feminist extension
of eros ethics follows from the recentering of ethics on affects and
eros (social needs and desires for connection) rather than on the
rational capacities that mark human superiority and separation from
the other animal species. Contrary to dominant metaphysical traditions
from the ancients through the moderns, there is no clear ontological
gap that separates the human from all other animal life. Willett
discerns four strata for envisioning connections across (human and
nonhuman) subjectivities. These strata correspond to modes of
sociality, and typically trace back to aspects of basic social bonds,
beginning with the affect-laden eros that connects caregivers with
infants.  These layers are: (1) Subjectless Sociality (occurring apart
from an awareness of an “I” or a sense of self): Social affects such
as laughter or fear and panic transfer from one creature to another,
spreading from an adult to her infant, prompting birds to fly away
from a threat in unison, and explaining xenophobic political
climates. (2) Affect Attunement: Caregivers communicate with the
emerging self of the child through non-verbal face-to-face
interaction. Species may depend less on the face for
communication. Monkeys use tail-wagging and birds sing duets to signal
friendship or other social dynamics.  The capacity for attunement
explains expectations for reciprocity and even a sense of fairness in
humans and various other species. (3) The Biosocial Network as a
Livable Place or Home: Creatures such as elephants, dolphins, and
humans suffer trauma when kidnapped from homelands holding ancestral
memories and group friendships.  Eros signifies also a yearning for
home and a sense of belonging for an unknown range of social
animals. (4) Compassion and the Visceral (aka Gut) Conscience:
Profound acts of moral beauty, explored by evolutionary psychologists
in altruistic care for infants and vulnerable group members, can
extend to orphans and strangers, revealing moral depth in emotions
across a number of species (Willett 2014). The gut, as a second brain,
offers a source of moral response. </p>
  

<p>
The biosocial layering of selfhood reclaims maternal relationality as
more than a dumb instinct for humans and any number of other animal
species. The affect-laden, relational self cannot transcend through
reason its social embeddedness in a complex politics of
ingroup/outgroup markers. Rational rules appealed to by autonomous
selves do not guarantee unbiased decisions free from emotional,
historical, and biological processes. Feminist critiques of the
atomized selves of utilitarian and Kantian philosophy are moving to
the center of ethics. Still, no one theory or model can capture the
self's multitudinous and multicultural manifestations. At best, the
feminist reconstructions of various traditions, ever themselves
spurring new sources of ingroups and outgroups, can serve to remind us
that the work of feminism is never done.</p>

<h2><a name="BM4">4. Conclusion</a></h2>

<p>

As this article attests, there is tremendous foment and variety within
the field of feminist work on the self. Yet, in reviewing this
literature, we have been struck by a recurrent theme—the
inextricability of metaphysical issues about the self from moral and
political theory. Feminist critiques of regnant philosophical theories
of the self expose the normative underpinnings of these theories.
Feminist analyses of women's agential capacities both acknowledge
traditional feminine social contributions and provide accounts of how
women can overcome oppressive norms and practices. Feminist
reconstructions of the nature of the self are interwoven with
arguments that draw out the emancipatory benefits of conceiving the
self one way rather than another. There is nothing surprising, to be
sure, about the salience of normative concerns in feminist
philosophizing. Still, we mention it because we believe that
feminists' attention to political concerns leads to fresh questions
that enrich the philosophical understanding of the self. Moreover, we
would urge that this forthrightness about the political viewpoint that
informs philosophy is a virtue, for overlooking the political
suppositions and implications of esoteric philosophical views has led
to considerable mischief. It is precisely the failure to acknowledge
that the question of the self is not narrowly metaphysical that has
led to philosophy's implicit modeling of the self on a male subject, a
tendency that feminist perspectives on the self seek to
remediate. </p>
