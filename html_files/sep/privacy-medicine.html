<h1>Privacy and Medicine</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Wed May 13, 2009; substantive revision Thu Aug 20, 2015</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>Individuals, institutions and governments practice, value and
protect medical privacy (Beauchamp and Childress 2008; Humber and
Almeder 2001; Englehardt 2000b). As a general rule, they try to limit
access to health information and biospecimens, respect health-related
decisions, and honor both individual and community expectations of
bodily modesty, intimacy, bodily integrity, and self-ownership (Winslade 2014). </p>

<p>First, while information-sharing has grown more common,individuals
commonly keep some health concerns to themselves, whether out of
personal taste, ethical reserve, etiquette, fear or shame (Rosenberg
2000; Buss 1980; Westin 1967). When they share sensitive health
concerns with others, most individuals employ culturally appropriate
discretion and reserve (Nissenbaum 2009; Goffman 1959, 1963). Because
of such privacy practices, families, friends, employers, researchers
and governments may not acquire all the medical information they want,
when they want it (Currie 2005; Etzioni 2000). The rise
of social media, smart phones, wearable health monitoring devices and
personal possession of electronic copies of medical records represent
diverse opportunities for intended and unintended disclosures of
health-related images and information.The practical ability of
individuals to control and protect their health privacy is partly a
function of their knowledge of contemporary medical data management
practices and their social-economic position (Marx 2007). Children,
along with adults in active military service, judged mentally
incompetent, dependent on government entitlement programs or
incarcerated, lack substantial control over medical privacy (Annas et
al. 2013). </p>

<p>Second, many medical professionals, hospitals, insurers and other
entities with access to health information regard maintaining the
confidentiality of medical communications and the security of medical
information as paramount professional responsibilities (IOM 1994,
2000).  This sensibility extends to social work, mental health and
pharmacy records. Moreover, clinical health care providers and medical
researchers generally seek to accommodate patients’ reasonable
expectations of privacy and are required to do so by state and
national laws (Allen 2011).</p>  

<p>Third, societies impose major privacy and private choice-related
legal obligations on their members (Westin 1967). Legal obligations of
privacy bind citizens to one another and also bind health care
providers, insurers, health-data processors, health researchers,
public health officials and government (CDT 2008,
in <a href="#Oth">Other Internet Resources</a>; DHHS 2015; GAO
2001). Thus in a number of legal systems, disclosing a private medical
fact or breaching medical confidentiality can result in civil
liability (Solove 2004, 2008). The law imposes obligations to respect
informational privacy (e.g., confidentiality, anonymity, secrecy and
data security); physical privacy (e.g., modesty and bodily integrity);
associational privacy (e.g., intimate sharing of death, illness and
recovery); proprietary privacy (e.g., self-ownership and control over
personal identifiers, genetic data, and biospecimens); and decisional
privacy (e.g., autonomy and choice in medical decision-making) (Allen
2011).</p>

<h2><a name="InfPri">1. Informational Privacy</a></h2>

<p>This section will highlight philosophical issues relating to
informational privacy and medicine. In medical contexts, the
“privacy” at issue is very often
“confidentiality” (DeCew 2000). Health care professionals
acknowledge ethical duties to keep medical information private (APA
2002; AAMFT 2001; APhA 1994). Physicians, nurses, hospitals,
pharmacists, and insurers are required by law and professional codes
to practice confidentiality. Since the 1990s, in policy discussions of
health policy and reform, concerns about confidentiality have often
been prominent (Sharpe 2005; Schwartz 1995).</p>

<h3><a name="Con">1.1 Confidentiality</a></h3>

<p>“Privacy” in medicine often denotes the confidentiality
of patient-provider encounters (including the very fact that an
encounter has taken place), along with the secrecy and security of
information memorialized in physical, electronic and graphic records
created as a consequence of patient-provider encounters (DeCew 2000;
Parent 1983). Confidentiality is defined as restricting information to
persons belonging to a set of specifically authorized recipients
(Allen 1997; Kenny 1982). Confidentiality can be achieved
through professional silence and secure data management (Sharpe 2005;
Baer et al. 2002. Hence Sissela Bok characterized confidentiality as
referring “to the boundaries surrounding shared secrets and to
the process of guarding these boundaries” (Bok 1982: 119).</p>

<p>Philosophers tend to agree that health is a vital component of
human flourishing (Faden et al. 2013; Moore 2005; Rössler 2004;
Rosenberg 2000; Schoeman 1984; Boone 1983). Maimonides maintained that
bodily health is among the means and ends of a good life (Weiss
1991). Modern philosophers generally hold that a just society will be
committed to securing the material and political bases of public
health (Powers and Faden 2008). Philosophers of medicine, ethicists
and bioethicists tend to agree that, with a handful of exceptions,
respecting patient confidentiality benefits both individual and public
health (Kamoie and Hodge 2004). They defend the practice of
confidentiality by diverse appeals to utility, dignity and virtue
(Easter et al. 2004).</p>

<p> Building on the 5<sup>th</sup> century BCE Hippocratic tradition
of medical caregiver secrecy, western philosophers defend
confidentiality on several utilitarian or other consequentialist
grounds (Frey 2000; Hare 1993; Freedman 1978).  They argue that
preventive medicine, early diagnosis and treatment save human lives
and money. Individuals will be more inclined to get medical attention
if they believe they can do so privately. Policy experts maintain that
the cost of health care and insurance would be considerably higher if
people avoided routine check-ups and prompt medical attention because
confidentiality was not credibly promised (Fairchild et
al. 2007a). Confidentiality practices are believed to promote both
seeking care and frank disclosures of health concerns in the context
of care.  Symptoms of illness and decline, such as incontinence,
memory loss, or hallucinations can be embarrassing to talk about, even
with sympathetic professional clinicians. In addition, promises of
confidentiality can make persons more willing to participate in health
research (Presidential Commission 2012; Easter et al. 2004).</p>

<p> Medical confidentiality promotes the individual’s medical
autonomy, by sheltering those seeking morally controversial medical
care from outside criticism and interference with decisions (Dworkin
et al. 2007; Englehardt 2000a; Feinberg 1983). Patients seeking
abortion or fertility treatments might not wish others to know their
plans. Members of the general public have from time to time attempted
to influence choices strangers make relating to the care of disabled
infants, comatose or brain dead kin, and abortions. Spouses, partners,
parents and siblings have sought involvement, with arguably greater
moral warrant. H.J. McCloskey suggested that loving personal
relationships call for mutual accountability (McCloskey 1971). Of
course some health problems—morbid obesity, scoliosis,
paralysis—simply cannot be concealed from
intimates. Bioethicists, consistent with public health considerations
and laws, commonly argue that hidden contagious conditions or
exposures should not be concealed from vulnerable associates and in
extreme cases could justify non-voluntary isolation or public health
quarantine (Presidential Commission 2015a). </p>

<p> Philosophers have also offered deontological grounds for
protecting informational privacy (Benn 1988). Centuries of
philosophical thought depict human beings as vulnerable bodies and
self-aware souls (Lackoff and Johnson 1999). Informational privacy
promotes respect for human dignity, philosophers have said. Caregivers
display concern for moral persons with rational interests and feelings
of their own when they keep information about their health and health
needs private (Freedman 1978). </p>

<p> Individuals concerned about discrimination, shame or stigma have
an interest in controlling the flow of information about their health,
and arguably the moral right to do so. Mental and other behavioral
health care consumers continue to face stigma and discrimination in a
world in which getting what they need requires a virtual surrender of
confidentiality to a bevy of other people, including family members,
doctors, social workers, teachers, hospitals, insurers, and law
enforcement (APA 2002; AAMFT 2001; Dickson 1998).  </p>

<p> Notions of moral fairness play into arguments for confidentiality.
Confidentiality is arguably required by fair relations with government
and businesses (Workplace Fairness, 2009, <a href="#Oth">Other
Internet Resources</a>).  Since “knowledge is power”,
special concerns have been raised about the manner in which government
collects and manages personal medical information. Pervasive ideals of
fair information practices require that personal data collected about
individuals be limited, accurate, secure and disclosed to
third-parties only with consent. Some patients believe they own
personal information about themselves, and that is it only fair that
they, not others, control its release. They may believe they own
medical information because they have purchased medical services
(Martin 1981: 624–25). Or they may believe they own medical
information, especially genetic information, because it reveals
information of a highly personal and unique sort (Laurie 2002; Rothstein 1997).</p>

<p> Philosophers have identified duties of welfare promotion, care,
dignity and fairness to support the case for privacy and
confidentiality (Schoeman 1984). Virtue ethics suggests its own set of
grounds for informational privacy in health care. Jennifer Radden has
argued that the special vulnerability of mental health patients and
the stigma attached to their problems turns confidentiality into a
particular brand of excellence for mental health care practitioners
(Radden 2004). She has argued that the demand for confidentiality in
psychiatric medicine is inadequately accounted for on theories that
fail to take into account the virtues of trust and reserve that are
hallmarks of mental health care.</p>

<p> In the context of health research, ethics committees and
institutional review boards impose ethical obligations on researchers
to protect the confidentiality of research subjects and their medical
information (Fisher 2006; Hiatt 2003; IOM 2000). The obligation of
confidentiality may require the use of “identifiers”
rather than names or “de-identification” procedures such
as data aggregation (Presidential Commission 2012). Researchers may
need to publish genomic data in ways calculated to obscure the
identities of whole families. Patient confidentiality can be
compromised in the setting of medical lectures and ground rounds, and
in the publication and archiving of medical lectures, scholarly
articles and personal papers.  The question of whether there are
privacy concerns when only statistical use is made of
individuals’ health data has arisen.  It has been argued that
individuals have an interest in the uses to which data sets that
include their data is put, even if they are not personally identified
by researchers (Newcombe 1994).</p>

<p>Privacy theorists caution that deprivation of privacy can amount to
injustice and inhumanity (Gandy 1993). Most privacy theorists focus on
the harms that stem from invading the privacy people value. Theorists
have begun also to consider the harms that stem from voluntary
self-disclosure (Allen 2011). Individuals freely disclose medical and
other sensitive information about themselves. They do it in published
memoirs, in social media postings and in forums devoted to illnesses,
medical procedures, prescription medications, and alternative
medicine. Women have webcast childbirth and mastectomy, citing public
health education goals (Allen 2000).</p>

<p>Privacy is not typically defended as an absolute good (Hixson 1987;
Boone 1983; Louch 1982; Pennock and Chapman 1971; Negley 1966).
Confidentiality, for example, is seldom described as an absolute good
in health care (Bok 1982). Philosophers recommend major exceptions to
the practice of confidentiality. First, all health care providers and
responsible adults should be obligated to report evidence of child
neglect and abuse, such as multiple unexplained fractures and
malnutrition (Dickson 1998). Second, mental health providers and others
have an ethical duty to warn police or potential victims of mentally
disturbed patients’ violent intentions (Gates and Arons 1999).
These exceptions reflect a belief that avoiding physical injury to
third parties is more important than invariably deferring to
patients’ preferences, sparing their feelings and preserving
their trust in relationships. Important philosophical questions arise
about the extent of “Good Samaritan” duties,
whistle-blowing obligations and the duty to warn in health care
settings. Ascribing such duties potentially infringes the liberty
persons otherwise enjoy to act and refrain from acting as they see fit
so long as they do not affirmatively harm others. Arguably the person
who declines to help or warn is not the responsible cause of the abuse
and violence that befalls others. Yet beneficence argues for low risk,
low cost interventions to prevent serious harm.</p>

<p>Third, there may be situations in which medical confidentiality
should not be protected because the public has a right to know. One
category of information which the public or public health officials
are commonly thought to have a right to know is information about
instances of contagious disease such as flu, measles or HIV/AIDS.
Another category of information deemed not suitable for
confidentiality is information the media has a right to publish as a
matter of its newsworthiness. Dramatic medical rescues of automobile
accident victims are understandably newsworthy events. It has been
argued that the public has a right to know about public
officials’ serious medical problems, perhaps more than
authorities have typically disclosed (Robins and Rothschild 1988). In
the United States, plaintiffs in personal injury lawsuits are asked to
submit to medical examination; and lawyers and grand juries have the
authority to subpoena medical information for use in legal proceedings
and investigations, placing highly sensitive medical information at
risk of public disclosure (Wolf and Zandecki 2006). Like legal process
demands, the demands of public health surveillance argue against
unqualified rights of medical confidentiality (El Emam and Moher
2013).</p>

<h3><a name="Sec">1.2 Secrecy</a></h3>

<p> Sissela Bok defined secrecy as intentional concealment (Bok
1982). Secrecy practices loom large in health care. Some people do not
share the knowledge of medical symptoms even with their closest
friends and family members. A person may secretly know he or she is
ill before he or she admits it to family members or consults a
physician. Reluctance to share knowledge of medical symptoms with
associates or kin and medical professionals may stem from fear of
disability or death; avoidance of discrimination in insurance,
employment and education; or dread of social stigma, shame,
embarrassment or rejection. Questions have arisen about the
obligations of dentists and other health care providers to refrain
from secrecy and disclose their HIV positive status to
patients. Fertility patients may want to conceal the fact of
infertility or the use of donated sperm or eggs, due to the social and
religious consequences of disclosure (Birenbaum-Carmeli et
al. 2008).</p>

<p> Paternalistic secrecy is a major feature of medical practice, more
prevalent in some countries, communities and families than others.
Moral ideals of autonomy and agency argue for informing patients of
their medical conditions, truthfully and fully. Yet, medical news is
sometimes deliberately kept from patients. The adult children of a 95
year old woman might think it unduly cruel to reveal the diagnosis of
operable bowel cancer when she would be better able to cope with the
fib that she has benign diverticulitis. The parents of a young child
might think it kind-hearted to conceal his terminal leukemia from him,
on the ground that he is too young to understand death. Some moralists
would agree. Yet if deception is categorically wrong, then secrecy
about medical adversity would surely be unethical.</p>

<p> It is common—though much less common than it once
was—to paternalistically withhold medical knowledge as the
secrets of doctors, healthy spouses and adult children. But there is
no guarantee that patients will believe medical truths or diagnoses
squarely placed before them by qualified physicians. Denial of
unpleasant truths is commonplace. Self-deception is a powerful
phenomenon.  Some people sincerely believe refusing to accept an
unwanted diagnosis by maintaining a positive attitude will shield them
from medical catastrophe. Mental disorders can trick one into thinking
one is happy and insightful, rather than the manic, delusional person
the psychiatrist may diagnose.</p>

<p> Certain medical procedures are commonly shrouded in secrecy.
People may try to keep secret the fact of their elective vanity
cosmetic procedures, medically indicated sex reassignment surgery,
abortions, fertility treatments, and sterilizations. Another kind of
secrecy practiced in medicine is the concealment of surgical wounds
and scars. Cosmetic surgeons hide scars inside hairlines and in the
creases behind the ears. Breast cancer is no longer the cause for
secrecy it once was, yet reconstruction surgery following mastectomy
is a kind of concealment. The lure of minimally invasive laparoscopic
surgery is not only that it may both reduce the length of hospital
stays and the risk of infection, but also that it leaves less
prominent and visible scars. Advances in medical imagining, such as
the X-ray, MRI, CT scan and ultrasound, allow providers to enter the
body and capture information without leaving tell-tale signs of having
done so.  </p>

<p> Neuroimaging, brain imagining technologies (BIT) generally, and
advanced lie-detection raise critical questions about whether secret
thoughts should be available for discernment, and if so under what
circumstances (Presidential Commission 2014; Farahany 2012). The issue
is one of coerced self-disclosure and,if someday criminal guilt could
be reliably discerned from imaging, self-incrimination.</p>

<h3><a name="DatProSec">1.3 Data Protection and Security</a></h3>

<p>The moral significance attached to medical privacy is reflected in
data protection and security laws adopted by local and national
authorities around the world. The point of these laws is to regulate
the collection, quality, storing, sharing and retention of health
data, including the electronic health record (EHR) (CDT 2009, in <a href="#Oth">Other Internet Resources</a>). Health privacy statutes
limit disclosure in the absence of informed consent; but typical
statutes recognize numerous exceptions for routine uses, research,
public health reporting, and legal process and law enforcement. The
policy consensus seems to be that, while medical privacy is important,
patients’ medical information may be disclosed to third-parties
for socially important purposes unrelated to their own
care. Electronically stored and produced medical information is by its
very nature mobile. Those with access can transmit EHR data across
town or across state and national borders. Patients today have
unprecedented access to their own health information. Patients may
transmit medical data over email, entrust it to third party cloud data
storage providers, or collect health data via apps and wearable
devices with little attention to third part access and use. </p>

<p>Some jurisdictions have special rules for management of certain
health information. Data regarding HIV/AIDS, mental health and
genetics are afforded special treatment in U.S. law, for
example. Philosophers ponder whether particular conditions merit such
exceptionalism. The argument for HIV/AIDS exceptionalism recalls the
early days of the global epidemic when knowledge of the illness was
poor, treatment was ineffective, and social stigma attached to
affliction. The argument for mental health exceptionalism is that
patients do and must “bare their souls” to mental and
behavioral health providers, making disclosures socially costly
(Radden 2004).  A U.S.  federal statute prohibits basing employment or
health insurance decisions on information about a person’s DNA
or genetic predispositions (GINA 2008).  The leading argument for
genetic data exceptionalism appears to be that genetic data conveys
uniquely detailed information about a person and her biological
family, information a person might have a right to know or a right not
to know (Chadwick et al. 2014). Some genetic information can foretell
a person’s health future (Laurie 2002; Rothstein 1997).</p>

<p>The use of electronic technology is described as a boon for health
care delivery and administration (Burton 2004; National Research
Council 1991). Yet heightened concerns for privacy follow increased
portability of health data (HIPAA 1996) and third-party (cloud) data
storage. The obligation to protect medical data held by the state or
private companies has taken on a new urgency as more and more health
data is being transmitted and stored electronically. It has been
argued that information managers owe it to the public to take
stringent measures to prevent data breaches and to appropriately
respond and remediate when a breach occurs. A data breach can result
from the theft of a laptop; fraudulent or accidental access to data;
sabotage by dishonest or disgruntled employees; or the loss of data
storage devices. Major hospitals, health agencies and insurers have
experienced highly publicized data breaches affecting millions of
consumers whose names, addresses, health identification numbers and
other data were compromised. (Privacy Rights Clearing House, 2009, in
<a href="#Oth">Other Internet Resources</a>). A philosophical question
raised by data breaches is how to define and morally repair
harm. Medical identity theft and public disclosure of private facts
are generally regarded as “harms” (Biegelman 2009). But it
has been argued that negligently causing increased risks of identity
theft and public disclosure of private facts are harms, too. If risk
amplification is harm, though, it is unclear what should count as fair
compensation or moral repair.</p>

<h3><a name="Ano">1.4 Anonymity</a></h3>

<p>Anonymity has value in a variety of public health and medical
research contexts. Although a number of prominent scientists and lay
people have made their genomes public, genetics research and scholarly
publication standards call for protection of the identities of
research subjects and their families. Concerns can arise about whether
particular methods of anonymization adequately shield research
subjects from invasion of privacy and breaches of confidentiality. The
use of the anonymously deployed personal diary for learning about and
assessing health-related behavior has become commonplace (Minichiello et al.
2000). Research subjects are asked to record contraception use, condom use and other
sexual practices in diaries which become research tools.  Researchers
must take care to warn research subjects about the dangers of
disclosing information which could expose them to social or legal
sanctions.</p>

<p>Anonymous HIV/AIDS testing has been controversial among
ethicists. Anonymity has been defended on the ground that it
encourages testing by individuals with concerns about when, whether
and to whom to disclose their HIV/AIDS status (Fairchild et al. 2007a)
Behavioral surveillance is recognized as a potentially useful
component of protecting public health (Fairchild et al. 2007b;
Gallagher et al. 2007); in some situations, anonymous testing could
make tracking patterns of infection more difficult. Yet the case for
individual privacy, confidentiality and anonymity in the context of a
stigmatizing illness may be exceptionally strong, counterbalanced by a
case for aggressive public health surveillance of severe illnesses
without true cures (Burr 1999). It has been suggested that anonymous
testing allows persons with AIDS to engage in dangerous, morally
irresponsible behavior without accountability. Proponents of anonymous
testing reply that policy-makers and ethicists should not assume that
men and women who learn they are HIV positive on the basis of
anonymous tests will egoistically conceal their status from sexual
partners. Some individuals have knowingly imposed serious risks on
others.  But newly informed positive test-takers may responsibly
notify past and future partners, refrain from risky behaviors, and
seek medical care. </p>

<h3><a name="Acc">1.5 Accountability</a></h3>

<p> Confidentiality thrives as a legal duty and institutional
practice, despite the emergent trend towards voluntary openness about
personal medical information. The specifics of health and medical care
have become acceptable topics of ordinary conversation outside the
family circle.  In the U.S., public figures have taken the lead,
speaking out about their AIDS, erectile dysfunction, dementia,
Parkinson’s disease, melanoma, prostate cancer and breast
cancer. Disclosures that would have been considered indelicate or
stigmatizing thirty years ago are made freely today, whether to make
conversation, share a concern, educate the public, or endorse a
non-profit or pharmaceutical product. </p>

<p>To a noteworthy degree, openness is also compelled by morals and
law.  Medical accountability is a feature of modern life. In the wake
of the AIDS epidemic, SARS, and Ebola, new levels of accountability
gained public acceptance. World-wide, people are coming to think of
minor and major contagious illnesses as conditions giving rise to
public accountability. In the United States a reemergence of measles
in 2015 renewed questions of how to balance duties to safeguard
one’s own children from perceived risk against duties to protect the wider community
affected by decisions whether to vaccinate. In Japan, it is now
expected that people with cold and flu will wear surgical face masks
to protect others from the spread of cold and flu
viruses. International travelers entering Tokyo are politely invited
to report symptoms of illness to officials. International visitors to
Taipei have their body temperatures scanned for fever automatically as
they proceed to customs. In the U.S., where hand-shaking is a common
greeting, people with colds and flu are begging off from the custom
out of regard for others’ health. </p>

<p> Many people speak openly about health matters with strangers as a
condition of receiving and paying for health care. For example, a
family needing the assistance of a regional mental health/mental
retardation agency unavoidably places reams of sensitive information
in the hands of government. The same is true of a family which needs
to apply for government benefits for aging or disabled kin. The more
disclosures a family must make, the wider the circle of
confidentiality and the lesser the medical privacy. Questions of
distributive justice are raised by mandatory disclosures to government
made as a condition of access to care. Poor and disabled persons
dependent upon medical assistance from government have substantially
less informational privacy <em>vis-à-vis</em> government than
wealthy and healthy persons.  The risks and burdens of state knowledge
of the individual are disproportionately borne by the least well off
segments of society.  </p>

<h3><a name="ProNor">1.6 Professional Norms </a></h3>

<p> The duty of confidentiality is a core consensus norm within health
care (Currie 2005). One important manifestation of this consensus in
the U.S. has been the development of the “certificate of
confidentiality” whereby researchers declare that
confidentiality is of especial interest to their subjects (Wolf and
Zandecki 2006, Wolf et al. 2004). The technological age has given rise
to the call for health care providers, even those who work alone or in
small groups, to be aggressive in the adoption of responsible
information practices. All would agree that office practices can and
should be designed to protect the identity of clients and the privacy
of conversations. Common understandings are that practitioners should
be judicious in the collection of information; they should store
treatment notes and records in a secure manner; they should share
information only with consent or as required by law; and they should
protect sensitive information in its online and off-line forms using
locks, passwords, encryption and other appropriate devices. Sensitive
information that is no longer needed should not be retained
indefinitely.</p>

<p> Health Care providers are ascribed ethical obligations to avoid
casually discussing confidential patient matters in social media or in
e-mail that may not be entirely private or secure (Chretien et
al. 2011). They must avoid discussing patient matters on mobile phones
in public places, such as in office corridors, hospital lobbies and on
trains. Confidentiality can be violated by unauthorized recordings and
disclosure of medical photographs. Photography plays a role in medical
specializations including dermatology and plastic surgery, giving
raise to concerns about ethical uses of graphic images of
patients’ faces and bodies. At a minimum informed consent would
appear to be required for making and disclosing photographs on whose
basis a person could be identified. Ethically imperative consent was
not obtained in a notorious U.S. case: it came to light in 2013 that a
physician affiliated with Johns Hopkins University Hospital secretly
videotaped hundreds of his obstetrics and gynecology patients with
pornographic intent. (Allen 2015) Videotaping has come to play a
routine role in family therapy and is not considered unethical by
typical practitioners (AAMFT 2001). Many clinicians believe the
therapeutic and training benefits of videotaping outweigh the risks of
unauthorized use or disclosure. Even if unauthorized use or disclosure
were not a concern, an ethical question would remain. Should
behavioral health clients be called upon to create recordings which
inherently sacrifice the privacy of their homes, communications and
expressions of emotions?  </p>

<p> Physicians are debating whether to increase the use of video and
audio-taping in routine clinical practice, surgery and research, and
bioethicists are weighing in (Blaauw et al. 2014; Makary 2013). Should
office visits be recorded as part of the standard medical record? On
the one hand, recordings would address the problem of faulty memory
and incomplete encounter notes. Recordings could document informed
consent procedures and provide evidence to avert or support
malpractice suits. On the other hand, recordings could inhibit
patients and increase their discomfort.  Recording practices might
encourage physicians to be less attentive to the patients in front of
them on the theory that they can always “go back to the
tape” for details. </p>

<h2><a name="PhyPri">2. Physical Privacy</a></h2>

<p>There has been relatively little attention paid by philosophers to
physical privacy concerns in medicine compared to informational
concerns. Yet typical patients bring a bevy of strong expectations of
modesty, solitude and bodily integrity to doctors’ offices,
hospitals and other health care settings.  These expectations that
they will not be needlessly touched, crowded, gawked at or imaged relate to
the need for psychological comfort, dignity and security. In the
future, the use of internet communications may make some routine
primary health care possible without patients having to venture from
home and be touched by providers (Chepesiuk
1999). “Telemedicine” will allow doctors and nurses to
evaluate common medical complaints remotely. In the meantime, health
care typically involves physical contact with others.</p>

<h3><a name="Sol">2.1 Solitude</a></h3>

<p>Solitude is a form of physical privacy of special interest to
medical ethics (Storr 2005; Barbour 2004). The sick do not want to be
lonely and abandoned, but they may want personal space and time
alone. Solitude has value as a context for quiet reflection about the
significance of illness and injury. A period of solitude after
consultation and self-education is a useful condition in which to make
up one’s mind about treatment options.</p>

<p>The sickest patients may both crave and fear solitude. When alone
they come face-to-face with the potentially cruel reality of impending
death. Yet in company they may feel patronized or guilty about the
burdens they impose on family and friends.  Whether the suffering is
the agony of injury, childbirth, recovering from major surgery or
dying, persons may feel that they should not have to deal with others
while in such a state or at such a time.  Implicit social norms
validate deferring to wishes of the sick or dying for seclusion and
solitude (Post 1989; Nissenbaum 2009). These wishes may arise and be
violated not only in hospital, hospice or nursing home settings, but
also in mental hospitals and prisons, where panoptic policies of
monitoring and surveillance prevail (Bozovic 1995; Holmes and Federman
2006: 16–17; Foucault 1977). </p>

<h3><a name="BodMod">2.2 Bodily Modesty</a></h3>

<p>Philosophers in the virtue ethics and Christian ethics traditions
have identified modesty as a moral virtue (Schueler 1999). Modesty is
a form of physical privacy of special interest to medical ethics. If
patients are to receive the best care, they must be willing to expose
their bodies to medical personnel and technicians. Removing
one’s clothing for purposes of examination and testing is
routine for most health care consumers. Busy emergency rooms and
neighborhood clinics may be unable to cloak or seclude patients at
all. Harried physicians may forget “bedside manners” and
fail sufficiently to honor patients’ modesty expectations.
In-patients in teaching hospitals are expected to adapt to diminished
physical privacy, since medical students and researchers accompany
attending physicians on rounds and participate in care. </p>

<p>Yet feelings of modesty and felt obligations of bodily modesty are
commonplace. Many individuals understand bodily modesty as a moral
virtue, and act accordingly. Under some religious traditions, such as
those of Muslims, Orthodox Jews and the Amish, bodily modesty is a
requirement of faith. Being asked to disrobe, even for a good reason,
may impose the cost of going against principle or desire (Kato and
Mann 1996).</p>

<p>Health care providers respond to the modesty values of their
patients in a number of ways. They provide special modesty garments
and sheeting to minimize nudity. They ask patients to uncover only
those portions of the body which must be exposed, and then only for
the period of time necessary. While hospitals cannot offer every
in-patient a private room, shared rooms are generally dividable by
curtains that grant patients some degree of physical seclusion (and
associational intimacy with visiting family and friends). Male
gynecologists and obstetricians help patients cope with sex-specific
modesty norms and sexual abuse concerns by working with female
assistants. Some health care providers maintain medical procedures
staffing policies sensitive to modesty and harassment concerns.
Indeed, mammograms on women are generally performed by female
technicians. On the other hand, the radiologists and radiology
technicians who deliver prolonged, intimate radiation services to
breast cancer patients are likely to be male. Patients may encounter
health institutions and providers who are unwilling to honor what they
may regard as impractical or discriminatory preferences for same-sex
or same race caregivers, preferences sometimes motivated rightly or
wrongly by modesty concerns. </p>

<h3><a name="BodInt">2.3 Bodily Integrity</a></h3>

<p>Another aspect of physical privacy is bodily integrity.  Mandatory
testing and health evaluation offend bodily integrity by forcing
persons to submit their bodies to unwanted touching and visual
inspection (Allen 2014). Policy makers and the courts have generally permitted a
great deal of nonconsensual urine testing of school children and
people in jobs tied to public safety, public service and crime
control. Drivers can be subjected to alcohol intoxication screening at
road blocks or in hospital emergency rooms after accidents to promote
highway safety. The concerns about neuroimaging and lie detection
raised earlier in this article under the rubric of secrecy could as
easily be raised here in connection with bodily integrity.
Nonconsensual uses of imaging and lie-detection to assess honesty or
character arguably demeans and disrespects autonomous moral agents and
assaults bodily integrity. The philosophical issue here is whether
there is some limit to the right of government to sidestep
persons’ preferences about the handling of their bodies, body
fluids and tissue samples. These issues arise in peace and war, and
with respect to the living and the dead. Certainly, law-based
constraints exist, but so too do principle-based and other moral
constraints (Faden et al. 1986). Western cultures respect
the integrity of a deceased’s body; however advances in
transplant medicine mean the newly dead are a garden of healthy organs
that could be used to save and extend lives. Organ harvesting with or
without consent may be defended on utilitarian moral grounds. Of particular
philosophical import is the issue of whether the bodily integrity of a
person is violated when organs and/or tissue are harvested prior to
brain death or prior to cardiac death. A related philosophical
question is whether a legal regime of opting into organ donations or
opting out of organ donation better serves the demands of justice
and morality. Post-mortem sperm donation raises important ethical
questions about bodily integrity.  Harvesting the sperm of a deceased
man raises concerns about respect for corpses; using sperm to create
embryos and ultimately to parent the children of dead men raises
concerns about parental autonomy and beneficence toward children.
</p>

<h2><a name="AssPri">3. Associational Privacy</a></h2>

<p>Respect for the intimacy of the experiences of suffering,
childbirth, recovery and dying is required by sound ethics.  People
who are in pain or grieving have an interest in including some people
and excluding others. People commonly want to reserve sharing the joys
of medical experience with friends and family, no less than the
agonies. They have what can be thought of as an associational privacy
interest in selective intimacy.</p>

<p>Injured, suffering, and dying adults may badly desire intimacy,
even sexual intimacy. A patient may wish to exclude strangers or
inessential medical personnel at times when the presence of loved ones
is welcome. Parents of newborns may regard strangers photographing
their babies as violations of family intimacy. A dying man may object
to being photographed by a physician anxious to take photographs of
the man’s surgical wounds for scientific purposes. If
associational privacy is important, a bored visitor strolling the
halls of a hospital should not maneuver to watch a randomly selected
patient give birth; and if he does, he merits criticism as a morally
offensive intruder. </p>

<p>Hospitals and hospital patients have clashed over who should be
allowed visitation and a role in decision-making or hands-on
care. Some institutions have kept extended family, paramours, gay or
lesbian partners and children away from in-patients. On the other
hand, children’s hospitals commonly encourage parents to spend
as much time as possible with sick minors, and may have sleeping sofas
near children’s beds or sleeping rooms inside the hospital for
attentive guardians.</p>

<h2><a name="ProPri">4. Proprietary Privacy</a></h2>

<p>Moral and legal theorists have offered accounts of the relationship
between “property” and “privacy”,
“property rights” and “privacy rights” (May
1988; Radin 1987; Thomson 1975). Philosophers have debated the
existence of a property right in the self, both the physical self and
the non-physical self (e.g., the mind or soul) (Lakoff &amp; Johnson
1999). One philosopher has argued that we own our selves and owe
ourselves a self-love that constrains how we ought to treat our selves
and allow others to treat us (Annas 1989).</p>

<p>John Locke famously characterized the relationship between a person
and her body as self-ownership. However, other philosophers have held
that persons are stewards of their bodies rather than owners (Honore
1961). In medical contexts, under rubrics of privacy, individuals are
sometimes ascribed rights of self-ownership and the ownership of parts
and products of their bodies (Moore 2005). In this vein, a
philosophically interesting invasion of privacy argument was advanced
in the landmark California case <em>Moore v. Regents of the University
of California</em> (1990). Without his knowledge or consent,
University of Southern California research physicians developed a
commercial cell line from tissue removed from leukemia patient John
Moore. Moore and an appellate court argued that in taking his
DNA-laden tissue for unrevealed research and development purposes
unrelated to Moore’s cancer care, UCLA doctors had appropriated
Moore’s identity in a manner analogous to advertisers using a
person’s photograph without consent for commercial gain.
Moore’s privacy claim was novel at the time, but the claims of
celebrities and others to control the attributes of their personal
identities—likenesses, voices, names, monikers, trademarks, and
Social Security numbers—are commonly styled as privacy rights
and have been since the early 20<sup>th</sup> century. John
Moore’s privacy claim was not successful in court. The
California court held that Moore’s doctors ought to have
obtained his informed consent; but the court was unwilling to
commodify human tissue or DNA as private property (Radin 1987). Nor did the court
think Moore’s injury fit the mold of traditional invasions of
privacy recognized in the law. In a related case that did not result
in tort litigation in her lifetime, cells taken from Baltimore
resident Henrietta Lacks were the basis of an important immortal cell
line, HeLa. Lacks died in 1951, but the cell line created using her
cervical cancer cells without her knowledge or consent lives on. It
has been used in the treatment and eradication of numerous conditions
and illnesses, including polio, without any financial reward to her or
her heirs. </p>

<p>But proprietary understandings of privacy continue to find
expression in health care and health research contexts. Scholars
suggest that individuals have privacy interests in their genes,
genomes and bio-banked tissue specimens.  These are sources of health
information that reflect what individuals and their biological
families are like, and what will become of them. Since most people
have only one set of DNA (the rare exception is the genetic chimera),
a person’s DNA is virtually a unique personal identifier. The
interest individuals have in controlling the use of their data and
specimens can be reconciled with researchers’ needs for
genotypical and phenotypical data, where principles of informed
consent are honored (Presidential Commission 2012).</p>

<p>Infertility medicine is a growing field, one dependent upon gamete
donation and cryopreservation of embryos. Individuals have asserted
what they describe as “privacy” interests in controlling
the fate of gametes, zygotes, and frozen embryos. The privacy
interests debated in the context of infertility medicine are twofold:
a decisional privacy interest in the decision to bear a child with the
help of reproductive technologies, and a proprietary privacy interest
in controlling the fate of the building blocks of human life and the
earliest beginnings of human life, created as a consequence of
one’s intentions or the use of one’s genetic materials.
While many courts have rejected viewing frozen embryos as property,
they have struggled over how to allocate rights over embryos in cases
of separation, divorce, death, moves and changes of heart.</p>

<p>In an entirely different vein, government regulators and the
general public characterize identity theft as a “privacy”
problem (Allen 2011). In
recent years identify theft has become a privacy problem in the
delivery of health care. Because of the high price of health care,
medical identity theft—receiving medical care using
others’ personal data for billing purposes—has become a
serious problem. Consumers must worry both about the confidentiality
of their medical records and physician encounters, and about the
possibility that someone will appropriate their personal identifiers
and then use them to defraud health care providers and insurers.</p>

<h2><a name="DecPri">5. Decisional Privacy</a></h2>

<p>In medical contexts, “privacy” is commonly used to
denote autonomy, liberty or choice in health-related decision-making
(Allen 2014; DeCew 1997;
Feinberg 1983). A patient’s active participation in
health-related decisions and control of his or her body, without the
interference of government or unauthorized persons is a decisional
variant of privacy. Women are often ascribed a “privacy
right” to use medically prescribed birth control and to elect
medically safe abortions. Men and women are ascribed a “privacy
right” to utilize <em>in vitro</em> fertilization, surrogate
gestators, and other reproductive technologies. Men and women with
terminal illnesses or in vegetative comas are ascribed a
“privacy right” to refuse life-sustaining nutrition,
respirators, and medical care (Beauchamp 2000). </p>

<h3><a name="BirCon">5.1 Birth Control</a></h3>

<p>Birth control and abortion are common practices the world
over. They were once criminalized on moral and medical grounds, but
are generally available today. Laws categorically criminalizing
contraception and abortion, were struck down in the U.S., Canada, most
of Europe, Japan and Taiwan by the final third of the 20<sup>th</sup>
century.</p>

<p>Feminist philosophers have widely debated the significance of the
use of the concepts of privacy and a “right to privacy” to
win women the capacity to control their fertility (Rössler 2004;
Boling 1996). The concept of “privacy” played
a role in confining women to traditional roles of daughter, wife and
mother under the authority of male heads of households. While
Catherine MacKinnon argued that ascriptions of rights of privacy are merely
palliative distractions from a more basic quest for gender equality, other
feminists have argued that privacy rights play a proper role in
achieving reproductive autonomy and pave the road to greater education
and employment equality (Allen 2000; MacKinnon 1984). </p>

<p> Official Roman Catholic doctrine opposes all non-natural birth
control, birth control devices and all intentional abortions (Pope
Paul VI, 1968, <em>Humanae Vitae</em>). Some regard human sexuality as having an
essentially reproductive purpose and artificial birth control as
unethically unnatural. One argument is that human life begins
“at the moment of conception” when a sperm fertilizes an
egg. Therefore, forms of birth control that may prevent the
development of a fertilized egg to grow into a baby—such as
“emergency contraceptive pills” or “menstrual
extraction” following unplanned sex or rape—are considered
“abortion”, even if no pregnancy has been confirmed.
Thomas Aquinas taught that the fetus lacks a soul until forty to sixty
days after conception (Finnis 1998: 186). Those who oppose abortion on
personal moral or religious grounds, sometimes also oppose public law
and public policies that permit abortion.</p>

<h3><a name="Abo">5.2 Abortion</a></h3>

<p>Philosophers differ on the question of the morality of abortion
(Jonsen 1998: 294ff). Advocates of abortion freedom maintain that
government should not take sides in what is irreducibly a moral
debate, and that individuals should be free to make up their own minds
about the moral status of the unborn (Richards 1986). Judith Thomson
employed the concept of a right to control the use of one’s own
body in a famous defense of abortion rights (Thomson 1971).  Some
philosophers have denied that fetuses are moral persons, stressing
that they are not self-conscious subjects of experience. Those who
oppose abortion freedom argue that it should not be left to private
choice because the unborn are equal members of the moral community,
along with newborn infants. Membership in the moral community is
conferred by human status or potential personhood, these philosophers
argue. Religious ethicists sometimes characterize the unborn as having
souls. Some moralists maintain that women’s decisional privacy
must yield if science establishes that a totally unique human life
comes into being immediately at fertilization of an ovum. Peter Singer
has argued that science proves that unique human lives do not begin at
conception. Instead, fertilization begins a process of initially
pluripotent cell development that may result in several human lives,
due, e.g., to twinning and other divisions, or in no human life, due,
e.g., to defects that result in spontaneous abortion. Philosophers
Margaret Little and Rosalind Hursthouse contributed nuance to the
ethics of abortion debate by arguing that while autonomy and privacy
concerns are important, <em>sui generis</em> considerations of
obligation and virtue are ethically relevant to decisions about
terminating a pregnancy (Little 1999; Hursthouse 1991). </p>

<p>The trend in public policy, dating back to the 1970s in the
U.S. and most of Europe, seems to be moral compromise (McDonagh 1996;
Sher 1981). The law tends to permit women to obtain abortions freely
in the first trimester and then to limit access to second and third
trimester abortions. Philosophical differences in how societies think
about abortion ethics are reflected in the four major models of
abortion regulation found around the world. The models of abortion
regulation are (1) the model of prohibition; (2) the model of
permission; (3) the model of prescription; and (4) the model of
privacy.</p>

<p> In countries characterized by the model of prohibition, most or
all abortions are prohibited by criminal laws. In the West, the
Republic of Ireland has been an example of the model of
prohibition. In countries characterized by the model of permission,
early abortions are readily available to women who meet legislated
government eligibility criteria and adhere to official procedures.
Germany and Japan are examples. In countries characterized by the
model of prescription, abortions were not only permitted, but
encouraged or required to avoid government penalties. While
liberalization may be in progress, China has been the signature
contemporary example of the troubling model of prescription,
apparently prompted by concerns about over-population and limited
resources.  Finally, in countries characterized by the model of
privacy, abortions are freely available to women who wish to obtain
them, without having to meet eligibility criteria or adhere to
detailed government procedures designed to limit access. Canada is an
example of the model of privacy. While the U.S. under <em>Roe
v. Wade</em> (1973) used to be a nation in which the model of privacy
prevailed, it has taken on some of the features of a model of
permission regime since 1989 when the U.S. Supreme Court announced it
would begin allowing restrictions. The Court has upheld restrictions
that include mandatory waiting periods and bans on specific second and
third semester abortion (so-called “partial birth”)
techniques. </p>

<h3><a name="ConCla">5.3 Conscience Clauses</a></h3>

<p> In most countries, the public relies on licensed physicians and
hospitals for medical care.  The medicines physicians recommend are
available only from professionally trained, licensed pharmacists. In
the U.S., state and federal laws have been enacted to relieve health
care providers of the obligation to perform medical services that
offend their philosophical, moral, or religious beliefs.  Some
policy-makers have argued that health care practitioners should be
free to decline to provide services for which they are professionally
trained if doing so genuinely violates personal conscience (Dresser
2005). Defenders of what have been called “conscience
clauses” and “refusal laws” see themselves as
defending the “privacy” of pharmacists and health care
providers, privacy akin to liberty of thought and freedom of religion
(White 1999). But opponents of such laws see themselves as the true
defenders of privacy, standing up for the “right to
privacy”. They stress that the call for refusal laws has been
tied to larger “pro life” strategies to limit access to
contraceptives, medical abortifacients and surgical abortions. They
say pharmacists who decline to dispense medication are placing their
personal values and autonomy above the values and autonomy of
patients.  Furthermore, pharmacists, like physicians and nurses, enjoy
the benefits of regulation and have chosen their professions
voluntarily. Private reproductive choices can be exercised only if
sufficient numbers of health care professionals are willing to perform
lawful services.</p>

<p> Should health care workers be required to dispense medications and
perform procedures that violate their personal scruples? Most
bioethicists agree that in the context of emergency medicine,
conscientious refusal has no place. A physician should not refuse to
terminate an ectopic (tubal) pregnancy threatening the life of the
mother, for example.  There is significant disagreement, however,
about whether morally-based refusal is warranted by retail
pharmacists.  Whether pharmacists can ethically refuse may depend upon
the proximity of other pharmacists willing to serve in their places.
Ethicists also disagree about whether physicians may use their
scruples as rationales for refusing to answer medical questions or
refer patients to abortion providers. A further, related, question is
whether physicians in countries where abortion is safe and legal may
ethically follow their public or private employers’ orders to
refrain from providing information about abortion services to
patients.</p>

<h3><a name="AssRepTec">5.4 Assisted Reproductive Technology and Enhancements</a></h3>

<p> Some legal commentators and philosophers have argued that
infertile men and women have a right to procreative privacy, and a
right to use technology to bear children. Assisted reproductive
technology services (“ART”) include medicines to balance
hormones, regulate ovulation, and stimulate the production of viable
eggs; and surgery to unblock Fallopian tubes or undo the damage of
endometriosis, miscarriages, ectopic pregnancies and pelvic
inflammatory disease. Reproductive services also include sperm and egg
harvesting and donation, <em>in vitro</em> fertilization, zygote and
embryo transplant, reproductive organ transplant, cryopreservation
(“freezing”) of pre-embryos, and surrogate
pregnancies.</p>

<p> It may be argued that the ability to freely choose ART, like the
ability to freely choose sterilization, abortion and birth control, is
called for by the right to privacy. But ART use raises moral concerns.
One concern is the false hopes ART creates in a world in which the
technology is expensive and the success rate low. The availability of
affordable treatments can cause conflict within families. Women report
feeling pressured by their families to undergo repeated painful
attempts to get pregnant. It may argued that adoption is a more
satisfying, affordable and socially commendable option for becoming a
parent. The use of reproductive technology has led to bioethical
concerns about the handling of the earliest beginnings of human life.
Ethical concerns surround exposing otherwise healthy women to the
uncertain health risks of repeated rounds of fertility drugs and
high-risk multiple pregnancies with twins and triplets. In a few
tragic cases children created using ART have been unwanted, raising
questions of responsibility and the just role of family law. What
should happen if the people who contract with a surrogate mother to
carry a child for them using donated egg and sperm change their minds
after a child is conceived? Should the mind-changers be deemed the
parents? Should the gestator be deemed the parent; the gamete donors?
Should parentage be assigned by a judge based on the best interest of
the child? </p>

<p> The realm of reproductive technology is surprisingly <em>laissez
faire</em> in the U.S., more regulated in the United Kingdom. Some
U.S.  constitutional lawyers argue that the right to bear and beget
children enshrined by the Supreme Court in Fourteenth Amendment
jurisprudence is a right to bear and beget by virtually any consensual
means necessary.  There is a right to reproduce, they argue, and a
right to use other people and social resources to help one
reproduce. Some have even argued that the right to procreative privacy
is a reason for government or employers to pay for fertility
services. In Israel, Germany and Taiwan, government subsidizes ART for
infertile couples. Great Britain has enacted a special statute and
created a special governing body to deal with policy and ethical
questions raised by the growing popularity of artificial reproductive
technologies. The Human Fertilization and Embryology Act 1990 created
the HFEA, an agency charged to license and monitor IVF, donor
insemination, human embryo research, and the storage of gametes and
embryos.</p>

<p> It is now possible to select the sex of one’s
offspring. Some bioethicists have argued that a “right to
privacy” countermands government placing bans on sex
selection. Supporters of sex selection sometimes argue that choosing a
child’s sex is a future parent’s moral and legal
right. Some methods of sex selection include: (1) Amniocentesis
testing to determine sex, followed by abortion if the fetus has the
undesired sex; (2) Sperm sorting to produce X rich or Y rich batches
of sperm, followed by <em>in vitro</em> fertilization or insemination
to increase chances of having a child of the desired sex; (3)
preimplantation genetic diagnosis (“PGD”) to determine the
sex of a pre-embryo, followed by implantation of one or more
pre-embryos of the desired sex. Amniocentesis and PGD were techniques
developed originally to determine whether a fetus or embryo was
affected by a genetic disorder such as Down’s syndrome or cystic
fibrosis. In some jurisdictions abortion or PGD solely for
sex-selection other than to avoid sex-linked disorders is illegal.</p>

<p> Adults who want children often prefer children of a particular
sex, or a “balance” of male and female children, perhaps
born in a particular order. Medically-assisted high-tech sex selection
raises large ethical issues. PGD involves creating human embryos, some
of which will not be used. Freezing, destroying and giving away human
embryos can seem inconsistent with respect for human dignity.  Sex
selection is arguably a kind of gender discrimination and could
heighten problems of pernicious gender discrimination. Sex selection
plays into gender stereotypes and could someday throw off the
societal, even global balance of males and females. Sex-selection is
controversial as a first step on a slippery slop toward
“designer babies”.</p>

<p> Men and women in developed countries are “designing”
their babies (Parens and Knowles 2003). In the context of fertility medicine,
patient’s select donated egg and sperm based on the race, IQ,
SAT scores, and detailed physical profiles of the donors. The capacity
to select the traits of offspring is likely to expand in the coming
years. It has been argued that a “right to privacy”
countermands government placing bans on trait selection through
genetic selection and manipulation. If women and their partners have a
right to reproductive autonomy, it arguably follows that they have a
right to use technologies that enable them to choose the precise
traits of their children. Yet using technology to achieve
“perfect” or “superior” humans may be
unethical, even if using technology to screen out tragic abnormalities
and diseases representing extremes of suffering is not (Presidential Commission 2015b).</p>

<p> Michael Sandel has argued that the quest for genetic enhancements
and other god-like mastery over the human body reflects a failure to
appreciate fully the “giftedness” of life and the ethical
value of “humility, responsibility, and solidarity”
(Sandel 2007: 12 and 86).  Ronald Green has cautioned against a
<em>status quo</em> bias that leads us to the irrational conclusion
that human beings should remain as they are (Green 2008: 9). John
Harris has moved several steps beyond Ronald Green in building a case
against preserving the status quo. Offering what he calls “the
ethical case for making people better”, Harris has argued that
society ought to leap on opportunities to create “healthier,
longer lived, and altogether ‘better’ individuals”
(Harris 2007). In the future, the notion of decisional privacy may
play a major role in building a case for allowing individuals and
families to use or refuse genetic, pharmaceutical and other forms of
enhancements. </p>

<p> The issue of biological enhancement is not limited to the context
of prenatal intervention. Concepts of health privacy may be brought to
bear on questions surrounding the ethics of electing to utilize
medical procedures or drugs to improve the motor and cognitive
capacities of people seeking to be “normal” or
“superior”. The privacy-as-autonomy argument for allowing
largely unfettered choice has been less controversial where persons
and clinicians aim to bring someone who is suffering from disease or
disability to within normal ranges, than where the aim is to enable
someone to surpass normal levels.  Thus, prescribing or taking Ritalin
to combat ADD/HD may meet with moral approval as a matter of medical
privacy, while prescribing or taking Ritalin to achieve a higher SAT
score does not (Presidential Commission 2015b).</p>

<h3><a name="MedUnhLifSty">5.5 Medically Unhealthy Life-Styles</a></h3>

<p>Should the state enact health and safety rules designed to save
people from poor private choices such as eating sugary, high fat
foods, smoking and refusing to wear motorcycle helmets? Are
individuals entitled to unfettered enjoyment of drinking, using
addictive drugs and a medication-free existence? The answer John
Stuart Mill gave to such questions in his famous essay <em>On
Liberty</em> (1869) was “yes” to the extent that these are
self-regarding behaviors that do not harm others. Mill defended
liberal tolerance of intoxicants and narcotic drugs on the ground that
liberty nets society benefits that are lost when government tells us
what to do. A libertarian perspective condemns the “nanny
state” that fails to treat citizens like conscientious adults
(Harsanyi 2007: 41).</p>

<p>A robust regard for liberty prompts adopting an extreme libertarian
perspective on the law. Yet </p>

<blockquote><p> [t]he notion of
radical individualism focuses on individual health behavior and
ignores the social preconditions of that behavior. (McGee 1999: 211)
</p></blockquote>

<p>What, on the surface, appear to be inviolate personal choices may
be straightforward products of social forces as diverse as
“media, advertising, movies, literature and folklore”
(McGee 1999: 212). Debates over managed care have stressed that
individuals’ unhealthy choices have externalities, including
higher health care costs for fellow citizens. Unhealthy lifestyles can
impose substantial costs on others. Smokers impose the costs of
illnesses caused by exposure to second-hand smoke. Unhealthy diets and
the lack of exercise can contribute to reduced worker productivity and
increase health care spending. Obesity in pregnancy can adversely
impact the health of developing fetuses and infants. Unhealthy
lifestyles divert societal resources from other areas of public need,
such as education (McGee 1999).</p>

<h3><a name="RigRefCar">5.6 The Right to Refuse Care</a></h3>

<p>Whether persons with mental conditions are morally required to take
medications that make them better able to live normal lives could be
styled as a question of the limits of private choice. Some mental
health patients are not competent to make their own treatment
decisions, but the vast majority are competent most of the time. Some
patients are offered medications by their physicians to curb
distinctly anti-social impulses such as oppositionality, verbal
aggression and violence. It could be argued that these patients have
an ethical obligation to medicate themselves, as advised. Competent
patients with cognitive and emotional problems (such as moderate
depression or mild hallucinations) that affect mainly themselves may
plausibly argue that the benefits of psychotropic medications are not
outweighed by the risks of lethargy, sexual dysfunction, tremor,
speech problems and organ damage.  Questions of political philosophy
are implicated in debates over the extent to which authorities may
compel medication use by death row inmates, defendants awaiting trial,
prisoners and in-patients in state hospitals.</p>

<p>The flowering of bioethics as an academic discipline and branch of
philosophy was fed by religious, moral and ethical concerns raised by
high profile legal cases about the right to die (Beauchamp 2000).
These cases seemed to place the power to “play
God”—make life and death decisions—in the hands of
patients, families and physicians. The field was influenced, for
example, by the famous Karen Quinlan decision (<em>In the Matter of
Quinlan</em>, 1976).  This case transported the federal constitutional
ideal of the right to decisional privacy into state law, and
characterized the right of a comatose woman’s family to refuse
life-saving treatment on her behalf as a “right to
privacy” (Jonsen 1998). After the Quinlan decision, hospitals
began setting up ethics committees to help doctors, patients and
families exercise decisional privacy rights in a lawful and
responsible manner. In 1986, the U.S. Supreme Court recognized in the
case of Nancy Cruzan a right of patients to refuse medical care such
as artificial respiration and tube feeding, where the wishes of the
patient to die could be established by clear and convincing
evidence. </p>

<p> Moral philosophers have sought a greater role for ethics in
shaping interpretations of constitutional law in life and death
cases. On December 6, 1996, six prominent U.S. moral philosophers
submitted an unprecedented brief to the U.S. Supreme Court in two
cases, <em>Washington v. Glucksberg</em> (1997) and <em>Vacco
v. Quill</em> (1997). The philosopher’s were on the losing
side. The U.S. Supreme Court refused to strike down laws banning
assisted suicide, instead upholding state laws in New York and
Washington that criminalized physician-assisted suicide. The Court
argued that states have an interest in protecting life, protecting the
poor and the disabled, and promoting physicians’ ethical
integrity. Patient’s rights groups had argued that laws banning
physician assisted suicide violated the privacy and equality rights of
people with terminal illnesses.</p>

<p> According to what came to be known as “The
Philosophers’ Brief”, signed by Ronald Dworkin, Thomas
Nagel, Robert Nozick, John Rawls, Thomas Scanlon, and Judith Jarvis
Thomson in 1997 in connection with the United States Supreme Court
case, Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 U.S. 702 (1997), </p>

<blockquote><p> A person’s interest in following his own
convictions at the end of life is so central a part of the more
general right to make ‘intimate and personal choices’ for
himself that a failure to protect that particular interest would
undermine the general right altogether. Death is, for each of us,
among the most significant events of life. (Dworkin et al. 1997 [2007]
pp.548-561)
</p></blockquote>

<p>The Brief went on to argue that there is little moral difference
between allowing an authorized physician to administer a life-ending
injection on behalf of a terminally ill patient and allowing an
authorized physician to turn off the respirator or remove the feeding
tube of a person in a vegetative coma.  </p>

<p>The 2007 Theresa Schiavo case raised the philosophically important
question of when it is ethical to exercise privacy rights. A Florida
court allowed spouse Michael Schiavo to terminate life support on wife
Terri’s behalf, after the court found that Terri’s
autonomous choice would have been to refuse life-sustaining care if
she were hopelessly comatose. Since the age of twenty-five, Terri had
subsisted in a “persistent vegetative coma”. Autopsy
established that Terri had massive and irreversible brain damage, as
her husband believed. Terri’s parents had doubted the diagnosis
of hopeless coma and wanted their daughter alive. Assuming Michael
Schiavo was justified in ignoring the pleas of strangers who wanted
him to keep his wife alive, it is less clear that he was justified in
turning down the pleas of his wife’s own parents, who urged
Schiavo to waive his wife’s “privacy” and offered to
assume complete responsibility for her care. What are the obligations
of kin to honor the care and kinship wishes of fellow family members?
What weight do privacy arguments on behalf of an incompetent spouse
have in the face of parental claims? </p>

<h2><a name="Conclusion">6. Conclusion</a></h2>

<p>Privacy is a broad concept. Philosophers have identified several
forms of privacy.  Respect for recognized forms of privacy
—informational (<a href="#InfPri">Section 1</a>), physical (<a href="#PhyPri">Section 2</a>), associational (<a href="#AssPri">Section 3</a>), proprietary (<a href="#ProPri">Section
4</a>) and decisional (<a href="#DecPri">Section 5</a>)—is an
ideal of biomedical ethics for the conduct of clinical research and
administrative practices relating to physical and behavioral health.
Yet there is ample disagreement about the scope of the ideal. There is
wide philosophical consensus about the importance of medical
confidentiality, modesty and bodily integrity in all health settings;
but substantial philosophical disagreement about the limits of
personal autonomy or individual choice in fields relating to human
reproduction and genetics. As electronic data management technologies,
mobile health care apps, public health surveillance and brain imaging
technologies expand, the range and complexity of important privacy
questions in medicine will also expand.</p>
