Sometimes, philosophy drives science. Cosmology between 1932–48
provides an excellent example how explicitly philosophical
considerations directed the evolution of a modern science during a
crucial period of its development. The following article exhibits
these philosophical aspects of cosmological thinking in detail,
beginning with a brief sketch of the historical development of general
relativity cosmology until 1932. Following this, the historical
participants in the philosophical debate are introduced, along with
the basic ideas of their competing positions. Then the critical stages
of the debate — 1935–37 — are closely explored by
focussing directly upon the arguments of the participating scientists
and philosophers. Finally, the concluding stage of the philosophical
debate, namely, the emergence of the steady-state theory of the
Universe, is presented in the context of its development from Popper’s
philosophy of science.</p>

<h2><a name="Int">1. Introduction</a></h2>

<p>

One of the most vigorous philosophical debates of the century broke
out among cosmologists during the 1930s and 1940s. At the peak of the
debate, 1936–37, many of the most prominent scientists in Britain, as
well as several leading philosophers of science, had gotten themselves
publically involved. Their arguments, attacks and rebuttals were
chronicled in many of the leading scientific journals, including a
special edition of the foremost general scientific journal,
<em>Nature</em>, devoted entirely to philosophical arguments and
counter-arguments.</p>

<p>

Methodology was the central issue of the debate, although
metaphysical questions also arose, particularly those concerning the
actual reality of certain structures and forces imputed to the Universe
by the new cosmological theories and observations. But in the end,
methodology was the real goad spurring on most of the participants.</p>

<p>

At bottom, there were just two opposing positions in the debate,
each of which comprised a two-point stance. On one side were those
scientists who had their roots mostly in the experimental side of
natural science. To them, there was one and only one legitimate method
for science. Theory construction, they believed, involved two
closely-linked steps. First, one began from the <em>empirical
observations</em>, that is, from measurements, manipulations,
experiments, whose results were evident to the human senses; this is
classic <em>empiricist</em> epistemology. Observational results would
then suggest possible hypotheses to examine via further empirical
testing. When enough data concerning the hypothesis had been gathered,
<em>logical generalization</em> could be carried out, thereby producing
a theory; this is classic <em>inductivist</em> logic.</p>

<p>

Opposing these inductive-empiricist scientists were those whose
roots were mostly in the theoretical side of natural science, most
especially mathematical physics. To them, there was another, more
logically sound, method to construct theories. First,
<em>hypotheses</em> could be generated in any fashion, although most
believed that imagining hypotheses which were based upon very general,
very reasonable concepts—that the Universe’s physical processes
had simple mathematical descriptions, for example—was the best
place to begin; this is classic <em>rationalist</em> epistemology. Once
the hypothesis had been generated, strict analytical reasoning could be
used to make predictions about observations; this is classic
<em>deductivist</em> logic. Scientists who held this view came to be
called <em>hypothetico-deductivists</em>; their views about both
hypothesis generation and deductive predictions were each strongly
opposed by the inductive-empiricists.</p>

<p>

Part of the controversy may be laid to the fact that cosmology was a
new science, and disputes about methodology in new sciences are not
rare in the history of the sciences. What is rare about this case,
however, is the vigor, sometimes even bitterness, with which the
philosophical controversy was waged. Another reason for the controversy
lies in the fact that cosmology is a data-poor science: observations
are hard-won and rare, and they frequently must be run through
elaborate theoretical manipulations and corrections in order to make
sense at all. With a paucity of data results, scientists must rely upon
philosophical argument to undergird their views about how the
scientific work should be done.</p>

<p>

One final feature of the debate must be noted. The participants are
almost universally scientists, and not philosophers. Yet this does not
much affect the level of philosophical thinking going on; these
scientists knew their philosophy well, and they wielded philosophy’s
weapons and defenses with great skill. In the end, their debate shaped
cosmology into the science we know today.</p>

<p>

It will be useful to look briefly at the history of cosmology
leading up to the debate.</p>

<h2><a name="LeaUpDeb">2. The Lead-up to the Debate</a></h2>

<p>

Since about 1700 theories about the nature and structure of the
Universe were derived from Newtonian theory, most especially his theory
of gravitation, which was used to account for the behavior of heavenly
bodies and their systems. Newton’s theory hypothesized a
force—gravitation—acting upon material bodies, free to move
over time within the passive, inert ‘container’ of
three-dimensional space. Bodies, paths, and space itself exemplified
the classical geometry of Euclid. All these features changed with the
publication of Einstein’s General Theory of Relativity, 1915–17.</p>

<h3><a name="EinGenTheRel">2.1 Einstein’s General Theory of Relativity</a></h3>

<p>

Einstein’s intended his theory to replace Newton’s theory of
gravitation completely. In Einstein’s view, gravity was not a force
existing independently of the spatial ‘container’; rather,
gravitation arises as a curvature of the space (and time, which is
necessarily connected to space in the new theory), which means that
geometry and gravity and astronomical behavior are all intimately
connected. For example, near the sun the geometrical structure, the
curvature, of spacetime changes radically, which expresses itself as an
increasing velocity of incoming orbiting bodies such as comets or
satellites. One immediate, and to some, puzzling, consequence of
Einstein’s theory is that the geometry of the Universe is no longer
taken to be Euclidean. Although there are several different candidates
for the actual geometry of space, it was not known which is
correct.</p>

<p>

It was not recognized at first that the General Theory of Relativity
could be applied to the Universe as a single, whole, individual object,
thereby producing a new cosmological theory, one completely different
from its predecessors. Although the mathematics involved are extremely
difficult, two solutions, one by Einstein himself, the other by the
Dutch astronomer Willem de Sitter, were produced in just a short time
in 1917. Unfortunately, the universes predicted by the two solutions
were extreme: Einstein’s universe would be densely packed with matter,
whereas de Sitter’s would be essentially empty.</p>

<p>

Obviously, the universe as observed by astronomers did not conform
at all to the description provided by either solution, a fact many
found troubling. Moreover, no additional solutions were forthcoming
(even though both Friedmann and LeMaître had developed
alternatives, they remained unknown and unnoticed). For nearly twelve
years, the new cosmology appeared to be going nowhere. Then Hubble at
California’s Mt. Palomar made public his astonishing observations of a
cosmic Doppler shift, a shift toward the red in the color of light
coming from the most distant star systems.</p>

<h3><a name="HubExpUni">2.2 Hubble’s Expanding Universe</a></h3>

<p>

Most cosmologists—with the interesting exception of Hubble
himself—came to the immediate conclusion that the red shift could
only mean that the universe was expanding. Immediately the relativity
theorists were able to interpret the expansion as a continuous change
in the geometry of spacetime, which was thoroughly accounted for by the
General Theory of Relativity. After over a decade of stagnation in face
of the meager choice between just two models of the cosmos, Hubble’s
observations spurred theorists on to the construction of a melange of
new models, each vying in competition with the other.</p>

<p>

In the end, it was the Belgian astronomer Georges LeMaître’s
theory of an expanding universe that came to be accepted.
LeMaître’s model was publically proclaimed as appropriate and
generally correct during a special session of the British Association
for the Advancement of Science, 31 Oct 1931. Modern scientific
cosmology had been officially born; because of its birth within the
context of Einstein’s theory of relativity, the new cosmology became
quickly and broadly known as <em>Relativistic Cosmology</em>. The model
of this cosmology is most famously that of the blowing up of a balloon
painted with dots to represent galaxies. Over time, the radius of the
model’s spherical space (the balloon) increases, thereby decreasing the
curvature of the space (the balloon’s skin), and increasing the
distance between the dots.</p>

<p>

Although cosmologists came from Europe and America as well as
Britain, most of the work in theoretical cosmology took place in
London, Cambridge and Oxford. Americans Hubble, Tolman and Robertson
did their work at CalTech in Pasadena, but were frequently in England;
and most of the European and British workers cycled through Pasadena at
one time or another. De Sitter, from Holland, and LeMaître, from
Belgium, spent important periods in England, as did various of the
German workers. Thus, even though cosmology was done throughout the
Western world, its major concentrating point was England; our focus in
what follows will be the same.</p>

<h2><a name="Cos">3. Cosmology and its philosophy</a></h2>

<p>

Because it represented such a radical departure from previous
scientific thinking about the Universe, relativistic cosmology needed
to work out its philosophical underpinnings, most especially in regard
to its methodology. ‘How is this new science to be
conducted?’ was thus a compelling question. But method, of
course, is always linked to metaphysics and epistemology. A full-blown
philosophical discussion was evidently required. It came soon enough:
within a span of less than a year, a vigorous debate between two
philosophically opposed camps developed. The debate required nearly two
decades to reach its full resolution. But, with the resolution,
cosmology had philosophically certified its methodology within the
context of a concensus metaphysics and epistemology. Before going into
the details of the debate, however, several general points should be
noted. Let us turn to the details of the origin of the debate.</p>

<h3><a name="RelCosMaj">3.1 Relativistic Cosmology: the majority philosophy</a></h3>

<p>

To begin with, the cosmological thinking of the majority of
scientists—including Eddington, de Sitter, Robertson, Tolman, and
their colleagues—had betrayed a relatively unexamined, and
apparently uncontroversial cluster of philosophical perspectives: on
the metaphysical side they held a modest sort of <em>explanatory
realism</em>—if an accepted theory referred to entity <em>x</em>,
then <em>x</em> was acceptable as a genuinely, physically real object;
to this metaphysical stance was coupled a methodology exhibiting a
classic sort of <em>inductive empiricism</em>—scientific
knowledge consisted of generalizations built up from individual
empirical observations. But this cluster of views did not go long
unchallenged. In early July 1932, just nine months after relativistic
cosmology became the concensus during the British Association meeting,
Oxford astrophysicist E. A. Milne published a short article in
<em>Nature</em> which directly attacked the current philosophical
tenets, proposing their replacement by a new cluster of views, one as
radical as the new science it purported to undergird.</p>

<h3><a name="MilPhiCha">3.2 Milne’s Philosophical Challenge</a></h3>

<p>

Milne’s metaphysical views were based in positivism, most especially
in <em>operationalism</em>: only those objects whose properties could
be directly revealed by some observational procedure, or operation,
were to be counted among the real. Thus, for Milne, reality did not
contain the usual relativistic cosmology referents “curved
space”, “expanding space” or even
“four-dimensional spacetime”, simply because none of these
entities were operationalizable. Milne held that ‘what you see
is what you get’; since “curved space” of various
geometries couldn’t be observed, space was just as it
looked—Euclidean. In the same way, the expanding of the Universe
was a genuine expanding—each galaxy was retreating from each
other—not just a change in the geometry of the curvature, as it
was for the relativists. Moreover, in place of relativistic cosmology’s
inductive empiricism, Milne opted for a <em>hypothetico-deductive
rationalism</em>. Cosmologists, Milne believed, were bound to dream up
any and all possible models of a universe, and then deduce what, if
any, observable consequences followed from their hypotheses.
Hypothesizing could be based upon just about anything, although Milne
believed that certain very general rational principles derived from
aesthetic beliefs about universal order and regularity would be the
most fruitful. His ‘<em>cosmological principle</em>’,
namely, that every cosmologist in the universe should look out upon the
same cosmos, was the prime example of such thinking. Later, Bondi would
found Steady-state Cosmology on an even more general version of Milne’s
principle, which he called the ‘<em>perfect</em> cosmological
principle.’</p>

<h3><a name="KinRelAltCos">3.3 Kinematic Relativity—an alternative cosmology</a></h3>

<p>

Milne’s philosophy of cosmology came with a closely associated
cosmological model, <em>kinematic relativity</em>, so-called because of
its tight links to the kinematics of Einstein’s Special Theory of
Relativity. Kinematics, in Einstein’s Special Theory, is especially
concerned with observers trying to make measurements of the behavior of
objects moving in systems relative to themselves. According to Milne’s
understanding, these measurements could only be made by the observers
signalling among themselves using light or other electromagnetic
radiation, using clocks to time the signals. In the end, all
measurement—even space and velocity—reduced to timing the
signals as they went from one observer to another. This idea of
measurement represented a revolutionary simplification of previous
ideas, and held philosophical interest for that reason alone. There
were practical consequences as well. As Bondi later remarked,
“Milne’s idea led straightaway to the radar speed gun!”</p>

<p>

Milne’s kinematic relativity and its underlying philosophy both
immediately brought careful scrutiny, not to mention controversy.</p>

<h2><a name="GreCosDebBeg193193">4. The Great Cosmological Debate Begins: 1933–1934</a></h2>

<p>

Eddington was the first to attack Milne’s views. In a series of
lectures given at Harvard in late 1932 and published early in the
new year as <em>The Expanding Universe</em>, Eddington denied the
efficacy of both operationalism and hypothetico-deductivism, and not
only defended explanatory realism, but strengthened his ontological
position heroically: the theoretical entities of relativistic cosmology
were not just plausible, they were so necessary to understanding the
universe, that cosmological knowledge was essentially impossible
without them (Eddington 1933, p. 19).</p>

<h3><a name="DinFirAtt">4.1 Dingle’s First Attacks</a></h3>

<p>

Few others would ever go so far as Eddington’s ontological heroism;
yet epistemological and methodological heroism in the fight against
Milne was not rare. Chief hero in this aspect of the attack on Milne
was Herbert Dingle, a highly respected astrophysicist, and
then-secretary of the Royal Astronomical Society. Dingle’s initial
foray appeared as a response to Milne’s first detailed presentation of
kinematic relativity (Milne 1933). After claiming that while kinematic
relativity did not differ appreciably from relativistic cosmology in
its mathematical formalism or observable consequences, Dingle asserted
that, on the other hand, it invited special criticism because it
renounced “the fundamental principles of scientific
method”, namely, “Newton’s principle of induction from
phenomena” (Dingle 1933, p. 178). Dingle was never to relent in his
attacks upon Milne’s hypothetico-deductivism, at all times rejecting
the methodology as even a possible candidate for acceptance by genuine
science.</p>

<p>

Dingle’s article appeared back-to-back with an appraisal of
kinematic relativity by the important American cosmologist H. P.
Robertson (Robertson 1933a). Robertson focussed upon Milne’s
hypothetico-deducivism as well, noting that the cosmological principle
in kinematic relativity functions as an <em>a priori</em> rule, rather
than as an empirical generalization, its status in relativistic
cosmology. Robertson otherwise is not especially taken with Milne’s
theory, limiting himself to remarks suggesting that, where they can be
compared, kinematic relativity and relativistic cosmology apparently
are similar in physical content. As we shall shortly see, Robertson’s
later work strongly belied this earlier apparent indifference to
Milne’s theory.</p>

<h3><a name="TwoWayDisMil">4.2 Two Ways to Disagree with Milne</a></h3>

<p>

Right from the start, cosmologists differed in their opinions about
both the physical content of Milne’s theory, and its underlying
philosophy. Dingle disliked Milne’s methods, but found the theory
itself of not much interest. Robertson initially agreed with Dingle,
but within a short time had significant changes of heart. Eddington
disliked both the theory and its philosophy, finding them far too
deviant from what was typical, i.e., relativistic cosmology and its
mainstream philosophy. Younger cosmologists such as McVittie and
McCrea, students, respectively, of Eddington and Whittaker, soon joined
the fray. McVittie initially found the physics of kinematic relativity
quite interesting, and quite different from the physics of relativistic
cosmology (McVittie 1933b). But Milne’s philosophy was something else;
the strict empiricism McVittie had earlier revealed (McVittie 1933a)
made him equally unhappy with both Milne’s rationalism and his
hypothetico-deductivism.</p>

<p>

McCrea’s remarks were among the most perceptive and favorable
(Kermack and McCrea 1933). While he thought that Milne’s operationalist
criticisms of curved and expanding space were of little import, McCrea
was the first to notice the parsimony and elegance of Milne’s strictly
kinematic solution to the problem of the origin of the universe’s
expansion. Since a search for such a solution had vexed relativistic
cosmology for several years (McVittie 1931), McCrea suggested that
Milne’s mechanism should be immdiately shown to be part of relativistic
cosmology (Kermack and McCrea 1933 p. 529).</p>

<p>

Clearly, the so-recently won consensus about relativistic cosmology
and its philosophy had dissolved into confusion and controversy over
Milne and his methods.</p>

<h3><a name="MilMakPhiImp">4.3 Milne Makes Philosophical Improvements</a></h3>

<p>

Over the next year or so, Milne made strenuous efforts to elucidate
both kinematic relativity’s physics and its philosophy, beginning, as
would be his wont, with the philosophy. In October, Milne addressed the
Philosophical Association, giving an explicit and detailed analysis not
only of his philosophical views, but also of their history, which, he
claimed, extended back to Locke and Hume (Milne 1934a) His description
of the two opposed methods—inductive empiricism vs.
hypothetico-deductivism—is quite clear and useful:</p>

<blockquote>Strictly speaking, physics has no philosophy. It has
method…Now the methods of theoretical physics seem to be
reducible to two species, the method of starting with concepts and the
method of starting with things observed. …When a subject is
developed from concepts the concepts play the part of the terms
occurring in the axioms of geometry…. The concepts are undefined
save as being governed by propositions of which they are
subjects.</blockquote>

<p>

Milne’s commitment to axiomatization is notable here. It was based
in his earlier admiration for the work of Whitehead and Russell
(Crowther 1970); commitment to axiomatization in cosmology, once having
been initiated by Milne, would be an enduring hallmark of the work of
many, including both Robertson and Walker.</p>

<p>

Three weeks after this address, Milne spoke on related topics at the
monthly meeting of the Royal Astronomical Society. His main point was
that theories differed only insofar as their concepts could be cashed
out in observations deduced from them. Eddington took strong exception
to Milne’s arguments, claiming in response that kinematic relativity
and relativistic cosmology differed more importantly in their ontology
than in their consequences. Eddington was especially concerned with
differences in the spacetime-geometry each theory ascribed to the
world. For Eddington and his colleagues, the equivalence of gravitation
and spacetime geometry was a genuine reality, a feature of the physical
world, just as real as suns and moons and stars.</p>

<h3><a name="MajPhiIssWhaMakSciTheGoo">4.4 A Major Philosophical Issue: What makes a scientific theory ‘good’?</a></h3>

<p>

Milne was having none of it. In the next month’s
<em>Observatory</em>—the informal monthly publication of the
Royal Astronomical Society—he took Eddington and his
theoretical-realist colleagues to task, concluding that “theories
differ simply and solely when their predictions as to phenomena
differ”; most importantly, “this method of comparison
avoids all reference to distance-assignments, world-geometry, schemes
of projection or the like” (Milne 1934b). In other words,
metaphysics was to be avoided in cosmology; space, spacetime, geometry
and the like were to be rejected as scientific realities, replaced by
reference simply and solely to observations. The only realities,
according to Milne, were what could be reported among observers about
light signals and clocks.</p>

<p>

During 1934 Milne worked together with his new student A.G. Walker.
Walker never evinced much interest in the philosophical aspects of
kinematic relativity, choosing instead to focus tightly upon working
out the physical details of the theory itself. He had immediate
success (Walker 1934). One of his important conclusions was that other
authors, specifically McVittie and Robertson, were wrong to conclude
that the physics of Milne’s theory ultimately corresponded to
relativistic cosmology: “<em>Milne’s system is fundamentally
different from that of general relativity.</em>” (Walker 1934 p.
489; emphasis in original)</p>

<h3><a name="HowChoAmoThePhi">4.5 How to Choose Among Theories and Philosophies?</a></h3>

<p>

In an important review of the entire confused situation between
kinematic relativity and relativistic cosmology, McVittie confessed
that “experimentally it seems hopeless to discriminate between
them…at present the choice is almost entirely a matter of
personal taste” (McVittie 1934 p. 29). At almost the same time,
de Sitter took on Milne in serious fashion (de Sitter 1934). Responding
to Milne’s methodological challenge, he showed that, indeed, it is
possible to formulate relativistic cosmology in axiomatic fashion, just
as Milne had formulated kinematic relativity “from
concepts.” But de Sitter explicitly rejected Milne’s
philosophical use of the cosmological principle, “which asserts
that statistically the world pictures of two different observers must
be the same.” His objection is founded on the matter-of-fact that
“we have, however, no means of communicating with other
observers, situated on faraway stars, or moving with excessive
velocities” (de Sitter 1934 p. 598). So much for rational
principles as hypotheses!</p>

<p>

The year in cosmology ended almost as confused as it had begun, with
one exception: Milne had gotten much clearer about his philosophical
views, and was applying them to an exhaustive presentation of his
cosmology, theory and philosophy. His book <em>Relativity, Gravitation
and World Structure</em> (Milne 1935) would be published in just a few
months.</p>

<h2><a name="TriMilMet19336">5. The Triumph of Milne’s Methods 1935–36.</a></h2>

<p>

The new year marked a sudden change. In short order, McCrea, Walker
and Robertson succumbed to Milne’s methodological recommendations:
first, to carry out an operationalist paring of non-observational
concepts, then, secondly, to embed the resulting minimalist concept set
in an axiomatic hypothetical-deductive structure. Thus was the famous
Robertson-Walker spacetime metric born.</p>

<h3><a name="McCWalRobAdoMilMet">5.1 McCrea, Walker and Robertson Adopt Milne’s Methods</a></h3>

<p>

McCrea’s effort operationalized the concept of
“distance”, principally and originally by comparison of
certain elements of Newtonian cosmology and de Sitter’s axiomatized
version of relativistic cosmology (McCrea 1935). Walker’s paper
specifically eschewed use of “any indefinable concepts”, in
particular, he did not assume that the “associated metric [of
relativistic cosmology] has any <em>a priori</em> physical
significance” (Walker 1935). Robertson’s article, the first of
three, is the most important, both in its content, and in the signal it
sends, namely, that one of the original mainstream relativistic
cosmology proponents has adopted a major element of Milne’s new
philosophy for cosmology (Robertson 1935). Robertson’s conclusion
exhibits this point clearly and explicitly:</p>

<blockquote>We have examined, from the operational standpoint, the
problem of determining the most general kinematical background suitable
for an idealized universe in which the cosmological principle holds.
Allowing the fundamental observers the use only of clocks and
theodolites, and granting them the possibility of sending and receiving
we have shown that for each given mode of motion <em>x(t)</em> there
necessarily exists a quadratic line element which is invariant, in form
as well as in fact, under transformation from one fundamental observer
to another. (Robertson 1935 p. 300)</blockquote>

<p>

Unlike de Sitter, Robertson accepts the cosmological principle, replete
with its observers on far-separated particles. Moreover, as this
statement shows, Robertson is intimately familiar with Milne’s latest
operationalist reduction: space is to be reduced to time measurements
given by clock readings on signals exchanged between observers.
Robertson gets this idea from Milne’s book, which he had earlier
reviewed (but which was only subsequently published) for
<em>Astrophysical Journal</em> (Robertson 1936). </p>

<h3><a name="ButEddSco">5.2 But Eddington Scoffed…</a></h3>

<p>

Eddington disparages these same methods. In his scathing
<em>Nature</em> review of Milne’s book, he rejects Milne’s
hypothetico-deductivism, his cosmological principle, and, above all,
his operationalism: “When I visit the Cavendish Laboratory, I do
not find its occupants engaged in flashing light-signals at each other,
but I find practically everyone employing rigid scales or their
equivalent” (Eddington 1935, p. 636). Whittaker’s review was not
so negative as Eddington’s (Whittaker 1935). While the senior physicist
rejects Milne’s operationalism and attacks upon the geometrical
commitments of relativistic proponents, he is considerably more
forgiving about Milne’s hypothetico-deductivism, and even goes so far
as to remark Milne’s “brilliant record in astrophysical
discovery.” Nonetheless, Milne’s break with a tradition including
at least “Einstein, de Sitter, Friedmann, LeMaître, Weyl,
Eddington, H.P. Robertson and others” is to be regretted
(Whittaker 1935 p. 179). Perhaps, along with Eddington, Whittaker hopes
that soon “Professor Milne will return to orthodoxy”
(Eddington 1935, p. 636).</p>

<p>

But Whittaker’s view on Milne must be put into the perspective he
held on the whole ongoing debate. As he saw it</p>

<blockquote>…a lively debate is in progress at the present
moment between Sir Arthur Eddington and Dr Harold Jeffreys of
Cambridge, Professor Milne of Oxford, Sir James Jeans, and Professor
Dingle of the Imperial College, the subject being the respective shares
of reason and observation in the discovery of the laws of nature.
(Whittaker 1941, p. 160)</blockquote>

<p>

But lively debate is far too gentlemanly a description for what now
occurred. After holding his ire somewhat in check for—as he saw
it—already far too long, Dingle finally erupted. </p>

<h2><a name="DinDen">6. Dingle’s Denoument</a></h2>

<p>

Controversy over Milne and his philosophy reached a crescendo in
mid-1937. Dingle, his stew having finally boiled over, wrote privately
to the editor of <em>Nature</em>, first castigating the rampant
cosmological ‘mysticism’ passing itself off for science,
and then offering to produce an article taking the sword to the mystics
themselves. His offer was immediately accepted. The result was Dingle’s
notorious “Modern Aristotelianism”, a polemical diatribe
chiefly against Milne, but aimed as well at Eddington and Dirac on
account of their “betrayal” of the scientific method of
Newton and his fellow members of the Royal Society (Dingle 1937).</p>

<h3><a name="ModAri">6.1 Modern Aristotles?</a></h3>

<p>

The article is remarkable both for its style and for its content.
Dingle’s style in the article is vituperative. Thus, emotionally-loaded
terms such as “paralysis of reason”, “intoxication of
the fancy”, “‘Universe’ mania”, and the
like frequently appear, these to be topped only by references to
“delusions”, “traitors”, and, of course,
“treachery”, each associated with one or more of the guilty
parties (Dingle 1937, p. 786).</p>

<p>

Above and beyond his extreme language, Dingle makes certain
substantive claims bearing directly upon central philosophical
questions. The issue, as he sees it, is nothing more than the question
“Whether the <em>foundation</em> of science shall be observation
or invention” (Dingle 1937, p. 786). As always, talk about
‘foundations’ is philosophical talk. The two opposing
positions Dingle here calls “foundational” involve views on
both method and epistemology, suitably tangled together. Dingle
delineates the opposed alternatives as follows. The way of true
science, he claims, shows that “the first step in the study of
Nature should be sense observation, no general principles being
admitted which are not derived by induction therefrom” (Dingle
1937, p. 784). Stated more explicitly, Dingle here argues that authentic
science is <strong>empiricist</strong> in epistemology (scientific
knowledge is founded in sensory observation), and
<strong>inductivist</strong> in method (general principles are reached
via inductive logic). Opposed to this view, he argues, is “the
doctrine that Nature is the visible working-out of general principles
known to the human mind apart from sense perception” (Dingle
1937, p. 787). As representative of this latter view Dingle cites Milne,
and refers in particular to Milne’s claim that “it is, in fact,
possible to derive the laws of dynamics rationally…without
recourse to experience” (Milne 1937, p. 329). Obviously, Dingle
is here arguing against the view, Milne’s view, that authentic science
may be <strong>rationalist</strong> in epistemology (scientific
knowledge is founded in pure theoretical reasoning apart from sense
perception), and <strong>hypothetico-deductive</strong> in method
(general principles are justified by their deductively implying correct
observations).</p>

<p>

Along with Milne, Dingle indicts Eddington, and, by implication,
Dirac, all three of whom, Dingle believes, are guilty of inventing
scientific hypotheses by free mental imaginings rather than by strict
immersion in observations and observational data.</p>

<h3><a name="DinTruBel">6.2 Dingle as ‘True Believer’</a></h3>

<p>

What is going on here? Put bluntly, Dingle is an old-fashioned
empiricist and inductivist. He believes that the only way to do true
science is to first collect data, then, and only then, to hypothesize
on the basis of that data. Observation, then hypothesis. As he sees it,
Eddington, Milne and Dirac have got it exactly backwards. They first
(as he terms it) assume an hypothesis, then, and only then, go about
collecting data. Except, according to his lights, the data isn’t ever
collected: “to [the Aristotelians’] modern representatives it
seems as though a fancy is no sooner in the head than it is on paper
and sent for publication” (Dingle 1937, p. 785). Obviously Dingle
is simply wrong; it never occurred to his opponents that hypotheses
would <strong>not</strong> be followed immediately by attempts at
deductive prediction of observational consequences. But it was enough,
in Dingle’s mind, that they didn’t use induction, for them to come
under blame.</p>

<h3><a name="WroVerSta">6.3 Wrong from the Very Start</a></h3>

<p>

But there is something else at work here as well. Dingle doesn’t
object solely to his opponents’ lack of inductive logic. Of equal
importance is the fact that they find the source of their hypotheses in
fairly general principles, wide-ranging rational proposals about the
structure of the universe at large. These principles Dingle takes to be
<em>a priori</em>, in the most pejorative sense of that term. They are
phantasms, “chimeras” he calls them, which seduce the
imaginations of his opponents, and lead them and their dumb-struck
admirers away from the genuine, authentic method of science.
<strong>This</strong> is what really sticks in Dingle’s craw. In turn,
Eddington, Milne and Dirac are chastised, each for something slightly
different, but at bottom the same, namely, they one and all
“appear as a victim of the great ‘Universe’
mania” (Dingle 1937, p. 786). In the end, Dingle believes, the
danger of this new ‘methodology’ is real, and serious. As
he notes in conclusion:</p>

<blockquote>Nor are we dealing with a mere skin disease which time
itself will heal. Such ailments are familiar enough; every age has its
delusions and every cause its traitors. But the danger here is radical.
Our leaders themselves are bemused, so that treachery can pass
unnoticed and even think itself fidelity. It is the noblest minds that
are o’erthrown…the very council of the elect can violate its
charter and think it is doing science service. (Dingle 1937, p.
786)</blockquote>

<p>

Here Dingle obviously goes over the top. Yet overblown as it is,
there is no doubting his sincerity: Milne and the other cosmologists
have betrayed the true science bequeathed them by their ancestors in
the Royal Society.</p>

<p>

How could Dingle be answered?</p>

<h3><a name="DebGoeVerPub">6.4 The Debate Goes Very Public</a></h3>

<p>

The response arrived three months later, on 12 June. On this
particular Saturday in June, <em>Nature</em> published a fifteen-page
special supplement as No. 3528. Contained within were contributions
from sixteen “representative investigators”, as the editor
referred to them, each responding to “Modern
Aristotelianism” <em>Nature</em>’s Editor, R.A. Gregory,
introduces the occasion by noting that “in <em>Nature</em> of May
8, we published an article by Dr. Herbert Dingle entitled ‘Modern
Aristotelianism’”. Because the article, as Gregory goes on
to say, “created considerable interest”, <em>Nature</em>
“decided to invite further contributions on the subject from a
number of representative investigators.”</p>

<p>

“Created considerable interest” is, to understate the
issue, an understatement. Some of the contributors were quite obviously
livid with rage and other volatile emotions. Others, such as Milne
himself, who had come in for particularly scathing criticism in
Dingle’s article, were patient and careful in rebuttal. Each of the
sixteen contributors to the special article chose a side in the
controversy, either pro Dingle’s inductive empiricism, and con Milne et
al.’s rationalist hypothetico-deductivism, or vice versa. Remarks made
by the participants exhibit the full diversity of philosophy of science
in their contemporary community. Dingle’s views, in particular, were
not without favor.</p>

<p>

Harold Jeffreys, F.R.S., noted geologist and astronomer, and author of
a well-regarded philosophy of science book <em>Scientific
Inference</em> (1957), led off with a nice <i>ad hominem</i>:
“Without using induction, Milne and Eddington could not order
their lives for a day, and what they are really asserting is that they
are entitled to use special axioms in physics, for which no need has
been shown.” Jeffreys’ criticism here of course ignores the role
of deductive observations in justifying the “special”
axioms. The problem, as Jeffreys sees it, originates in the
perpetrators’ “belief that there is some special virtue in
mathematics.” L.N.G. Filon, F.R.S., vice-chancellor of the
University of London agrees on this point, noting that “some men
of science appear to think that they can solve the whole problem of
Nature by some all-inclusive mathematical intuition.”
R.A. Sampson, the Astronomer Royal, focusses upon the rationalistic
aspects of the ‘modern Aristotelians’, to wit, for their
“framing a theory independent of experience, such as is
denounced in Dr. Dingle’s article”, which produces work not
unlike that “of a poet or other humanist, who gives us at most a
number of illustrative cases.”</p>

<h3><a name="Cou">6.5 The Counterattack</a></h3>

<p>

But Milne, Eddington, and Dirac had their supporters as well. N.R.
Campbell, whose theory of science was already well-known, makes an
uncontroversial interpretation of the affair. “Science” he
begins, “(or at least physics) has long consisted of two
distinct but complementary activities”, one of which is
experimental and empirical; “its procedure is induction.”
The other activity attempts to provide explanations of scientific
laws, which explanations have the “pecularity” that
“they often (not always) predict new laws in addition to
explaining old ones.” Campbell cannot resist ending on an <i>ad
hominem</i> of his own: “If he [Dingle] does not deem it
important to observe the distinction between what is and what is not
demonstrable experiment, surely he should welcome a movement to
amalgamate the Royal with the Aristotelian Society.” Indeed.</p>

<p>

G.J. Whitrow, then a young lecturer at Christ Church, Oxford,
returns to the mathematical theme. Dingle, he argues, “not only
attacks the particular methods adopted by contemporary mathematical
investigators in relativistic cosmology, but even refuses to admit that
this subject is worthy of scientific investigation as it is based not
only on experience but also on reason.” Hypotheses, by this
light, may originate rationalistically as well as any other way,
certainly there is no problem with this.</p>

<h3><a name="CooVoi">6.6 The Coolest Voice</a></h3>

<p>

The clearest, most temperate description of the issues at hand is
given by young cosmologist William McCrea, then professor of
mathematics at Queen’s, Belfast, and editor of the R.A.S.’s
<em>Observatory</em>. Not to be outdone by Jeffreys, McCrea begins
with an <i>ad hominem</i> of his own: “Dr. H. Dingle’s objection to
‘modern Aristotelianism’ seems to be itself what he would
call Aristotelian rather than Galilean.” In other words, Dingle
raises a non-empirical objection about Milne <i>et al</i>.’s
non-empiricism!  But McCrea soon gets to the heart of the matter, the
role of hypothetico-deductivism in mathematical physics:</p>

<blockquote>What Dr. Dingle has done is to reopen the question of the
relation of mathematical physics to experimental physics, since he
claims to detect a new and perverted point of view in the former. Now a
system of mathematical physics, apart from the alleged perversion, is
the working out of the mathematical consequences of certain hypotheses.
The worth of the theory is judged…by the closeness of the
agreement of its predictions with the results of observation, and also
the number of phenomena which it can so predict from the one set of
hypotheses. The scientific attitude is, not to cavil at the attempt,
but to see if it is successful.</blockquote>

<p>

This is an absolutely standard interpretation of how the H-D method
works. Throughout his own writings, beginning right from his inaugural
lecture in Oxford (Milne 1929), Milne had subscribed to precisely the
same interpretation of the Hypothetico-Deductive (H-D) method. Whatever
the controversy is about, the issue is not how to interpret
hypothetico-deductivism. That much is evident.</p>

<p>

Moreover, it is quite clear that Dingle <i>et al</i>. are not mounting
opposition to something we, today, would consider philosophically
radical; rather, they are objecting to what, today, would be
considered completely unobjectionable. Given today’s acceptance of the
H-D method, yet its rejection by otherwise well-regarded scientists at
that time, it seems to follow that it was, at least in part, this
debate and its followup which settled the issue. In any case, Dingle
and his supporters generally went silent, restricting their activities
for the most part to books, or relatively positive statements of their
own positions (A.D.R. 1938, Dingle 1938). Things settled down, just in
time for the War.</p>

<h2><a name="CalBetSto">7. The Calm Between the Storms</a></h2>

<p>

During the next several years, it became evident that Milne’s
methods, and kinematic relativity as well, had reached respectability.
One important sign of this progress was exhibited at an early 1939
joint meeting between the Royal Astronomical Society and the Physical
Society of London, The meeting had as its goal a thorough review of the
situation in cosmology. McVittie was chosen to present the
observational situation; his report was soon published (McVittie,
1939). Reviewing the theoretical situation was George Temple, one of the
most highly respected mathematicians of the time. Temple’s report saw
print almost immediately (Temple 1939). Within a short time, Temple’s
paper took on the role of successor to Robertson’s definitive 1933
“Relativistic Cosmology” (Robertson 1933b).</p>

<h3><a name="TwoEquCom">7.1 Two Equal Competitors</a></h3>

<p>

Both McVittie and Temple presented kinematic relativity and
relativistic cosmology as equal competitors in accounting for the
cosmological observations. Unfortunately, as McVittie noted,
observations could not, at that time, discriminate between the two
theories. Temple’s analysis of Milne’s work praises its simplicity and
elegance, and refers in particular to its operationalism and
axiomatization, which “start from a completely novel discussion
of the correlation of measurements made by different observers in terms
of light signals only” (Temple 1939, p. 468). Throughout the rest
of his discussion of the two theories, Temple utilizes Milne’s
light-signal correlation method, explicitly rejecting rigid-rod
transport for distance measurement. Milne’s methods have triumphed.</p>

<p>

Later that year McCrea published an important paper in
<em>Philosophy of Science</em> (McCrea 1939). Put most simply, the
paper starts out to defend Milne’s methods, but ends up by presenting a
full-blown and interesting, although quite unhistorical, account of the
evolution and structure of physical theories.</p>

<h3><a name="OriEvoThe">7.2 The Origin and Evolution of Theories</a></h3>

<p>

McCrea’s overall view is that theories are set up to be
hypothetico-deductive in structure. His account is based on his view of
the evolution of theories of space-time and mechanics, beginning with
Newton, through the General Theory of Relativity and ending in
kinematic relativity. His argument reduces to the claim that, insofar
as Milne and e.g., Newton, can be shown to follow the same procedure,
any attack upon Milne is also an attack upon Newton. First, he states
his goals in the paper.</p>

<p>

The first goal is to emphasise how each theory leaves us in a
position in which the succeeding one appears as a perfectly natural
next step in the development of ideas (McCrea 1939, p. 137). McCrea
embeds this argument in an account of how analogue models (à la
Campbell) are used to set up new theories—this is essentially an
account of how discovery might proceed in linking an older theory with
its successor. The second goal is to show how, in spite of superficial
differences in character, the theories in question all necessarily
possess the same general structure constituted by the presence of
hypotheses, from which certain general mathematical relations are
deduced, which in their turn are used to predict relations between
observable quantities. As McCrea notes, “this study may claim an
interest of its own, but it is presented also for a further
reason” namely, that</p>

<blockquote>it has been contended [by Dingle, most especially] that
theories like Milne’s represent a fundamentally new outlook on the part
of some theorists, in that such theories are purely mental constructs
divorced from experience of the physical world. We shall see that on the
contrary Milne’s theory is easily brought into line with the others in
such a way that this criticism is neither more nor less true of it than
of the rest. (McCrea 1939, p. 138)</blockquote>

<p>

In McCrea’s discussion of the theories he asserts that “the
consituents [of the theories themselves] which are of physical
significance are sets of mathematical relations, coupled with sets of
rules of interpretation” which yield, “after observational
test, descriptions rather than explanations of physical
phenomena.” According to McCrea, one real advantage of his view
is that it “leads to simple criteria for comparing the merits of
different theories.” Finally, on the metaphysics of the original
hypotheses, McCrea claims that “the initial hypotheses from which
the mathematical relations are deduced do not ultimately have any
direct physical significance.”</p>

<p>

McCrea’s paper, published in the leading philosophy of science
journal of the time, is the final imprimateur on Milne’s views.</p>

<h3><a name="MilUltSuc">7.3 Milne’s Ultimate Success</a></h3>

<p>

Three years later, Milne was awarded the James Scott prize, the most
prestigious award for ‘natural philosophy’ in the
Anglophone world. Milne’s lecture title is telling: “Fundamental
Concepts of Natural Philosophy” (Milne 1943). Although Milne does
concede to Dingle that he no longer believes that it is possible to
deduce physics completely in the absence of reference to phenomena, for
the most part his award lecture is a long reiteration of his previous
twelve years’ work in cosmology.</p>

<p>

One year later, Milne received his ultimate accolade, election as
president of the Royal Astronomical Society. In his inaugural lecture,
Milne again reviews his work, but adds two remarks of interest. First,
he modifies his earlier view that theories are acceptable solely on the
basis of their successful predictive power; to this, he now adds that a
theory cannot be accepted as satisfactory unless it is philosophically
satisfying (Milne 1943, p. 120). Secondly, on a personal note, he
admits that he is still amazed at the outcry that his theory and its
philosophy caused. Milne here is being a bit disingenuous. In many
places in his letters he not only recognizes the outcry, he delights in
it, and seeks to provoke it even more (Milne 1932–37, 12 May 35; 28
Jul 36).</p>

<p>

From this point onward, cosmology’s philosophy is no longer directly
influenced by Milne himself. Moreover, kinematic relativity began to
stagnate as a research programme; except for Whitrow, Milne had no new
students, and failed to attract any new converts to the theory (Whitrow, 1996). His
personal philosophical work was done. </p>

<p>But although his personal philosophical work was done, and kinematic relativity seemed moribund as a research program, in the late 1990s it was rediscovered, and <em>Milne’s model</em>, as it was christened, came into renewed interest as a source of predictions for cosmological behaviour such as rates of cosmic expansion, and production of cosmological strings. (Moncy, 2016; Russo, 2003).</p>

<p>But even though Milne himself retreated into the background, his philosophical influence didn’t end, in fact it wasn’t to crest until the end of the 40s in the work of another man, Hermann Bondi. Again, however, a storm was generated by Milne’s
methods, even though they were now in the hands of another.</p>

<h2><a name="SteStaCos">8. Steady-state Cosmology</a></h2>

<p>

In 1948, a young mathematician, Herman Bondi, in concert with two
close friends Thomas Gold and Fred Hoyle, proposed a radical new
cosmological theory, the <em>Steady State</em> theory. This theory
differs from the basic picture shared by both kinematic relativity and
relativistic cosmology, namely, that of a universe with a definite
origin in a small, dense knot, followed by evolution into the universe
we have today. According to Bondi’s theory, the universe as far back
into the past as we might look would always look the same; there was no
evolution, there could be no “fossils”, as Bondi called
putative evidence of a universe different in the past from our present
one. What we observe today is the same state of a universe that has
been and always will be steady. Bondi came to his notion of the steady
state primarily from his commitment to the philosophical components of
Milne’s work, most especially the methodology of rationalism plus
hypothetico-deductivism; additionally, Bondi coupled to these Milnean
notions some ideas taken directly from the philosophy of Karl
Popper.</p>

<h3><a name="BonPhiOri">8.1 Bondi’s Philosophical Origins</a></h3>

<p>

Bondi reveals his philosophical commitments in several ways. First, he
argues against induction and extrapolation from small-scale
experiment, that is, against the inductive empiricism of Dingle <i>et
al</i>.  Secondly, he argues in favor of hypothesis and deduction,
that is, in favor of Milne <i>et al</i>. Finally, he specifically
remarks the excellence of Milne’s Methods, and the
theory—kinematic relativity—created therefrom, and remarks
the significance of these elements in the creation of his version of
the new steady-state cosmology.</p>

<p>

From the very beginning Bondi admits the validity of both positions
in the methodological debate:</p>

<blockquote>In particular, there are two important approaches to the
subject [cosmology] so different from each other that it is hardly
surprising that they lead to different answers…The contrast between
the ‘extrapolating’ and the ‘deductive’
attitudes to cosmology is very great indeed. (Bondi 1960),
p. 3–5)</blockquote>

<p>

The <em>extrapolating</em> approach, which Bondi sometimes calls the
<em>empirical school</em>, is represented by Dingle, McVittie, and
their colleagues. Opposed to the extrapolative approach is the
<em>deductive</em> approach, which “is reached from
investigations in the borderland between physics and philosophy.”
Milne is obviously the major proponent of this view. Although Bondi
finds good points in both approaches, he also finds problems in both
approaches. In the end, cosmology is the worse for excesses from
<strong>either</strong> end of the spectrum: </p>

<blockquote>Just as some adherents of the ‘empirical’
school tend to regard cosmology as a testing ground for their
extrapolations and as a legitimate playground for the geometers, so
some adherents of the deductive approach appear to regard cosmology as
a purely logical subject. (Bondi 1960, p. 7)</blockquote>

<p>

In this latter case, the deductive extremists, in their mathematical
zeal, seem to forget that cosmology, after all, <strong>should</strong>
have some relation to observation: “To them all that is of
interest in a theory is its logical character, not its relevance to the
interpretation of observational data.” Obviously, this danger
must be avoided: according to Bondi, deductivism can be a
<strong><em>scientific</em></strong> approach in cosmology only if its
postulates (or axioms) are candidates for disproof. </p>

<h3><a name="EntPop">8.2 Enter Popper</a></h3>

<p>

Clearly, with this reference to the connection between science and
disproof, Bondi has added a distinctly Poppererian element to the
deductivist methodology, one which had not previously appeared in the
works of any of the earlier members of the hypothetico-deductive
school. According to Popper’s philosophy of science, a theory can
legitimately be called “scientific” only if that theory
makes a prediction that, in principle, can be shown to be false, or
<em>falsified</em>, to use Popper’s own term. Thus astrology, for
example, fails to be a scientific theory because it cannot be
falsified: although astrology seems to make predictions, these
statements about the future are so vague, so general and abstract, that
they cannot be tied down to definite claims about observations to be
made at a definite time and place. Hence there is no explicit
observation to be made in falsification. Astronomy, in comparison,
makes explicit, specific predictions about what will occur in the sky
on such-and-such a date, in such-and-such a place. If the prediction
fails, then we know that the element of astronomical theory which made
the prediction is deficient, maybe even false.</p>

<p>

Cosmology is a borderline case: since observations of cosmological
significance are so rare and hard-won—Hubble’s observation of the
red shift was one of the first solid ones—it is very difficult,
not to mention brave, to tie one’s cosmological theory to Popper’s
falsificationist principle as a guarantee of scientific acceptability.
But this is exactly what Bondi did.</p>

<p>

Much later Bondi was to make explicit his debt to Popper:</p>

<blockquote>I think the person from whom we had most help on the
philosophical side was Popper. His analysis of science encouraged one
to be imaginative, and encouraged one to go for something that was very
rigid and therefore empirically disprovable. (Bondi 1990, p.
194)</blockquote>

<h3><a name="ButMilEnd">8.3 But It’s Milne In the End</a></h3>

<p>

Yet Bondi’s major philosophical debt was to Milne. According to
Bondi, Milne’s theory was through and through deductive, which was
reason enough for some of his colleagues to condemn it:</p>

<blockquote>The aim of this discipline [= kinematic relativity] is to
deduce as much as possible merely from the cosmological principle and
the basic properties of space, time and the propagation of light. The
beauty of this, as indeed of any deductive theory, rests on the rigour
of the arguments and the small number of the axioms required...When the
theory was first developed it met with great hostility and was
criticized very severely, often unjustly, and sometimes frivolously.
(Bondi 1960), p. 123)</blockquote>

<p>

In addition to his admiration of Milne’s H-D methodology, Bondi has
high praise as well for Milne’s operationalism, particularly its use in
defining distance: </p>

<blockquote>Imperfect as Milne’s definition of distance may be, it is
very much better than the ‘rigid ruler’ one used in most
other theories…Milne’s definition of distance, by no means
perfect as it is, is probably the best yet devised. (Bondi 1960, p.
126–9)</blockquote>

<p>

In the end, Bondi sums up Milne’s contributions with no uncertain
praise: </p>

<blockquote>The foregoing brief description will have indicated the
remarkable success of kinematic relativity in attempting to use the
cosmological principle not only for the construction of the substratum
but as chief guide in formulating ordinary physics. In this respect it
differs greatly from all other cosmologies which either rely on a
conventionally obtained body of physics or have not yet succeeded in
drawing conclusions of local interest from the cosmological principle.
(Bondi 1960, p. 136)</blockquote>

<h3><a name="RetCosPri">8.4 Return of the Cosmological Principle</a></h3>

<p>

Here Bondi speaks of Milne’s cosmological principle. According to
Milne’s principle, every observer in the universe should get the same
world picture, that is, should make precisely the same observations of
the universe at the same moment as any other observer (Milne 1934b).
Uniformity over spatial slices is guaranteed by Milne’s invoking of the
principle. Yet Milne’s universe evolves, it changes its form over time.
Hence it has no temporal uniformity. Bondi felt that this raised the
possibility that physics itself might change over time. Because of this
risk, Bondi generalized Milne’s cosmological principle into what he
called the <em>perfect cosmological principle</em> [= PCP]. According to
this principle, all observers at all places and <strong>at all
times</strong> will look out upon the same unchanging, unevolving,
universe. Such a universe is a universe in a steady-state—hence
the name.</p>

<p>

Clearly, PCP is a daring, indeed heroic, interpretation of a
methodological necessity. Forty years after the fact, Bondi described
the “philosophical attitude” which underlay his
“implausible” PCP:</p>

<blockquote>But the essential point of the philosophy was and is that
if the universe was evolving and changing, then there is no reason to
trust what we call the laws of physics, established by experiments
performed here and now, to have permanent validity. (Bondi 1990, p.
192)</blockquote>

<p>

Hence, or so Bondi’s argument goes, since there is reason
<strong>not</strong> to trust the laws of physics if the universe is
evolving, let us presume that the universe is <strong>not</strong>
evolving and changing; that is, let us presume PCP. Although the
principle (and the theory which results from it—steady state
cosmology) is, as McVittie remarked, “much more restrictive than
general relativity”; (McVittie 1990, p. 45) it is this very
restrictiveness which satisfies Bondi’s Popperian wishes: </p>

<blockquote>For the correct argument has always been that the steady
state model was the one that could be disproved most easily by
observation, Therefore, it should take precedence over other less
disprovable ones until it has been disproved. (Bondi and Kilmister
1959, p. 55–6)</blockquote>

<p>

In another place, Bondi makes a similar point: “Comparison with
observation becomes then possible and renders the PCP liable to
observational disproof. This possibility of a clear-cut disproof
establishes the scientific status of PCP” (Bondi 1957, p. 198).
Comments such as this make clear Bondi’s committment to a Popperian
addition to the basic deductive methodology he inherited from Milne. </p>

<h3><a name="PopCon">8.5 A Popperian Conclusion</a></h3>

<p>

In the end, the philosophical purity of Bondi’s steady state theory
served him, and cosmology, well. Of course, the usual suspect, Dingle,
and others of his ilk, such as McVittie in particular, were outraged,
and loudly, at Bondi’s extension of Milne’s methods. A passage from
Dingle’s R.A.S. Presidential Address suffices to show the tenor of the
debate’s declining days:</p>

<blockquote>Even idle speculation may not be quite valueless if it is
recognized for what it is. If the new cosmologists would observe this
proviso, calling a spade a spade and not a perfect agricultural
principle, one’s only cause for regret would be that such great talents
were spent for so little profit. (Dingle 1953, p. 406)</blockquote>

<p>

But PCP and the theory which it engendered were exactly as
described: eminently falsifiable. No matter the extent of Dingle <em>et
al</em>’s disdain, Steady State theory stayed right out in front, ready
for whatever empirical observations might be slung at it. As Bondi said
“Show me some fossils from an evolving universe, and I’ll give it
up.” In 1965, the fossils arrived, courtesy of the observations
of the 3° K remnant microwave radiation.</p>

<p>

And Bondi, true to his philosophy, gave it up.</p>
