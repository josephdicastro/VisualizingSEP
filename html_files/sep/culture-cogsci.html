<p>

Within Western analytic philosophy, culture has not been a major topic
of discussion. It sometimes appears as a topic in the philosophy of
social science, and in continental philosophy, there is a long
tradition of “Philosophical Anthropology,” which deals
with culture to some degree. Within core areas of analytic philosophy,
culture has most frequently appeared in discussions of moral
relativism, radical translation, and discussions of perceptual
plasticity, though little effort has been made to seriously
investigate the impact of culture on these domains. Cognitive science
has also neglected culture, but in recent years, that has started to
change. There has been a sizable intensification of efforts to
empirically test the impact of culture on mental processes. This entry
surveys ways in which the emerging cognitive science of culture has
been informing philosophical debates.</p>

<h2><a name="WhaCul">1. What is Culture?</a></h2>

<p>

The meaning of the term “culture” has been highly
contested, especially within anthropology (Kroeber and Kluckhohn 1952;
Baldwin et al. 2006). The first highly influential definition came
from Edward Tylor (1871, 1), who opens his seminal anthropology text
with the stipulation that culture is, “that complex whole which
includes knowledge, belief, art, law, morals, custom, and any other
capabilities and habits acquired by man as a member of society.”
Subsequent authors have worried that Tylor's definition packs in too
much, lumping together psychological items (e.g., belief) with
external items (e.g., art). From a philosophical perspective, this
would be especially problematic for those who hope that culture could
be characterized as a natural kind, and thus as a proper subject for
scientific inquiry. Other definitions often try to choose between the
external and internal options in Tylor's definition.</p>

<p>

On the external side, anthropologists have focused on both artifacts
and behaviors. Herskovits (1948, 17) tells us that, “Culture is
the man-made part of the environment,” and Meade (1953, 22) says
culture “is the total shared, learned behavior of a society or a
subgroup.” These dimensions are combined in Malinowski's (1931,
623) formulation: “Culture is a well organized unity divided
into two fundamental aspects—a body of artifacts and a system of
customs.”</p>

<p>

More recently, externally focused definitions of culture have taken a
semiotic turn. According to Geertz (1973, 89), culture is “an
historically transmitted pattern of meanings embodied in
symbols.” Culture, on such a view, is like a text—something
that needs to be interpreted through the investigation of symbols. For
Geertz, interpretation involves the production of “thick
descriptions,” in which behavioral practices are described in
sufficient detail to trace inferential associations between observed
events. It's not sufficient to refer to an observed ritual as a
“marriage;” one must recognize that nuptial rites have
very different sequelae across social groups, and these must be
described. Ideally, the anthropologist can present a culture from the
point of view of its members.</p>

<p>

Geertz's thick descriptions may seem to move from the external focus
of earlier approaches into a more psychological arena, but he does not
take interpretation to centrally involve psychological testing. The
term “thick description” is taken over from Ryle (1971),
whose approach to the mind emphasizes behavioral dispositions. An even
more radical break from psychology can be found in an approach called
“cultural materialism” (Harris 2001). Cultural
materialists believe that thick description thwarts explanation,
because the factors that determine social practices are largely
unknown to practitioners. For Harris, these factors principally
involve material variables, such as the ecological conditions in which
a group lives and the technologies available to it. Cultural variation
and change can be best explained by these factors without describing
richly elaborated practices, narratives, or psychological
states. Harris calls the materialistic approach “etic” and
contrasts it with the “emic” approaches, which try to
capture a culture from within. This differs from Tylor's
external/internal distinction because even external cultural items,
such as artworks, may be part of emic analyses on Harris's model,
since they belong to the symbolic environment of culture rather than,
say, the ecological or technological environments—variables that
can be repeated across cultural contexts. Harris aims for
generalizations whereas Geertz aims for (highly particular)
interpretations. The debate between semioticians and materialists can
be described as a debate about whether anthropology is best pursued as
one of the humanities or as a science.</p>

<p>

Aside from Tylor, the approaches that we have been surveying focus on
external variables, with Harris's cultural materialism occupying one
extreme. But psychological approaches to culture are also prevalent,
and they have gained popularity as cognitive science has taken a
cultural turn. D'Andrade (1995, 143) tells us that, since the 1950s,
“Culture is often said to consist in rules… These rules
are said to be implicit because ordinary people can't tell you what
they are” (D'Andrade himself favors a more encompassing,
processual definition, which includes both external items and the
cognitive processes that interact with them). Richerson and Boyd
(2005, 5) define culture as “information capable of affecting
individuals' behavior that they acquire from other members of their
species through teaching, imitation, and other forms of social
transmission.” Sperber (1996, 33) describes culture in terms of
“widely distributed, lasting mental and public representations
inhabiting a given social group.”</p>

<p>

Those who advance definitions of culture do not necessarily assume 
that
a good analysis must be faithful to the colloquial understanding of
that term. Rather, these definitions are normative, insofar as
they can be used to guide research. A focus on artifacts might
orient research towards manufactured objects and institutions, a focus
on behavior might promote exploration of human activities, a focus on
symbols might take language as a principal subject of study, a
materialist orientation might shift attention toward ecology, and a
focus on mental states might encourage psychological testing.
Philosophically, definitions that focus on external variables tend to
imply that culture is not reducible to the mental states of
individuals, whereas psychological definitions may imply the
 opposite. This bears on debates about 
 <a href="../methodological-individualism/">methodological individualism</a>.
 At one extreme, there are definitions like Richerson and Boyd's
(culture as information) that leave external variables out, and, at 
the
other, there are authors such as Harris, who say psychology can be
ignored.</p>

<p>

In summary, most definitions characterize culture as something that
is widely shared by members of a social group and shared in virtue of
belonging to that group. As stated, this formulation is too
general to be sufficient (a widespread influenza outbreak would qualify as
cultural). Thus, this formulation must be refined by offering a
specific account of what kind of shared items qualify as cultural, and
what kind of transmission qualifies as social. The definitions
reviewed here illustrate that such refinements are matters of
controversy.</p>

<h2><a name="CulTra">2. Cultural Transmission</a></h2>

<p>

One common thread in the definitions just surveyed is that culture
is socially transmitted. That point was already emphasized in
Tylor's seminal definition. Social transmission is a major
area of research and various theories have been offered to explain how
it works.</p>

<h3><a name="MemCulEpi">2.1 Memes and Cultural Epidemiology</a></h3>

<p>

It is a platitude that cultures change over time. Some
research studies the nature of these changes. Such changes are
often described under the rubric of cultural evolution. As the
term suggests, cultural change may resemble biological change in
various respects. As with biological traits, we can think of
culture as having trait-like units that arise and then spread to
varying degrees. The study of cultural evolution explores the
factors that can determine which cultural traits get passed on.</p>

<p>

Some authors push the analogy between cultural evolution and
biological evolution very far. Within biology, the most celebrated
evolutionary process is natural selection: traits that increase
fitness are more likely than others to get passed on from one
generation to the next. 20<sup>th</sup> century evolutionary theory
(“the modern synthesis”) supplements this Darwinian idea
with the principle that traits are transmitted genetically. Genes
produce traits (or phenotypes), which impact reproductive success, and
thereby impact which genes will be copied into the next generation.
Richard Dawkins (1976), who helped popularize this idea, suggests that
cultural traits get reproduced in an analogous way. Dawkins
characterizes cultural items as “memes” – a term
that echoes “gene” while emphasizing the idea that culture
is passed on mimetically—that is, by imitation. Like a gene, a
meme will spread if it is successful (for development and defense, see
Dennett 1995; Blakemore 1999).</p>

<p>

Some authors have resisted the analogy, arguing that there are crucial
differences between generic and cultural transmission (e.g., Atran
2001; Boyd and Richerson 2001; Sperber 2001). In natural selection,
genes ordinarily spread vertically from parents to children. Cultural
items, in contrast, often spread laterally across peer groups, and can
even spread from children to parents, as with the rise of email and
other technological innovations.  Cultural traits are also spread in a
way that is mediated by intentions, rather than blindly. A teacher may
intend to spread a trait, and a student may recognize that the trait
has some value, and innovators may come up with new traits by
intending to solve problems. Intentional creation is unlike random
mutation because it can happen at a more rapid rate with immediate
correction if the trait doesn't succeed. Success, too, is measured
differently in the cultural case. Some cultural traits are passed on
because they increase biological fitness, but traits that reduce
reproduction rates, such as tools or war or contraception, can also
spread, and many traits, such as music trends, spread without any
impact on procreation or survival. Unlike genes, cultural traits are
also copied imperfectly, sometimes changing slightly with each
transmission. And there is no clear distinction within culture between
a genotype and a phenotype; the trait that gets reproduced is often
responsible for the reproducing. For example, if someone learns to
ride a bicycle, there is no clear distinction between an inner
mechanism and an outward manifestation; the skill is both the
mechanism and its deployment.</p>

<p>

All these contrasts suggest to some that the notion of a meme is
misleading. Cultural traits are spread in ways that differ
significantly from genes. In an effort to bypass the comparison to
genes, Sperber (1996) offers an epidemiology analogy. Cultural
items, which for him are representations, are spread like
viruses. They can be spread laterally, and they can reduce
fitness. Viral transmission depends on contagion, and, like
viruses, some cultural traits are catchier than others. That is
to say, some traits are easier to learn—they are more psychologically
compelling.</p>

<p>

Boyer (2001) has applied this idea to the spread of religious
beliefs. Tales of the supernatural build on existing knowledge
but add variations that make them exciting, such as the idea of a 
person
who can survive death and walk through walls. Boyer shows
experimentally that such exotic variations on ordinary categories are
easy to remember and spread.</p>

<p>

The epidemiology analogy may have limitations. For example,
viruses do not usually spread with intentional mediation, and they are
often harmful. But it has some advantages over the analogy to genetic
transmission. Ultimately, such analogies give way to actual models of
how transmission works.</p>

<h3><a name="ImiAniCul">2.2 Imitation and Animal Culture</a></h3>

<p>

In cultural transmission, an acquired trait possessed by one member
of a social group ends up in another member of that group. In
order for this to occur, there must be some learning mechanism that
eventuates in doing what another individual does. Traditional
learning mechanisms, such as associative learning, trial and error, 
and
conditioning through reinforcement, are inadequate for explaining 
social
learning. If one individual performs a behavior in front of
another, the other may associate that behavior with the model, but
association will not cause it to perform the behavior itself.
Likewise, witnessing a behavior cannot lead to conditioning, because
observation alone does not have reinforcement value. Conditioning
can be used as a tool in social transmission, of course—a teacher
can reward a student—but such deployment depends on a prior
achievement: the student must attempt to do what the teacher has done
or instructed. Thus, transmission requires learning mechanisms
that go beyond those mentioned, mechanisms that cause a learner to
reproduce what a model has done.</p>

<p>

In a word, cultural transmission seems to depend on copying. When
observing a model, there are two things one might copy: the end or the
means. If a model obtains fruit from a plant, an observer capable
of copying ends may recognize that the plant bears fruit and try to
obtain that fruit as a result of having seen what the model
achieved. Tomasello (1996) calls such learning emulation.
Emulation is not always successful, however, because one cannot always
achieve an end without knowing the right means. Tomasello
reserves the term “imitation” for cases where observers
perform the actions that they observe. This is a powerful tool
for social transmission, and it is something human beings are very good
at. Indeed there is evidence that we spontaneously imitate facial
expressions and gestures almost immediately after birth (Metzoff and
Moore 1977). In fact, human children over-imitate: they copy
complex stepwise procedures even when simpler ways of obtaining goals
are conspicuously available (Horner and Whiten 2005).</p>

<p>

The human tendency to imitate may help to explain why our capacity for
social learning far exceeds other species. Apes may be more
likely to emulate than to imitate (Tomasello 1996). That is not
to say that apes never imitate; they just imitate less than human
beings (Horner and Whiten 2005). Thus, apes do have some
capacity to learn from conspecifics. If culture is defined in terms of
practices or abilities that are shared within groups in virtue of the
achievements of particular group members, then one can even say that
apes have culture. Evidence for group-specific innovations, such
as nut cracking techniques, have been found among chimpanzees (Whiten
et al. 2005) and orangutans (Van Schaik and Knott 2001).
Culture and cultural transmission has also been documented in dolphins
(Krützen et al. 2005).</p>

<p>

This raises a question. If other creatures are capable of
cultural transmission, why don't they show the extreme forms of
cultural variation and accumulated cultural knowledge characteristic 
of
our species? There are various possible answers. Great apes
may also be less innovative than humans, and this may stem from their
limited capacity to understand causal relations (Povinelli 2000), or
to plan for the distant future. Apes may also have limitations on
memory that prevent them from building on prior innovations to create
cultural products of ever-increasing complexity. In addition,
apes have less highly developed skills for mental state attribution
(Povinelli 2000), and that may further reduce their capacity for
imitative learning. Human infants do not just copy what adult
models do; they copy what those models are trying to do (Metzoff,
1995). Warneken and Tomasello (2006) have shown that young chimps
understand intended actions to some degree, but less robustly than
their human counterparts. Finally, the human capacity to build on
prior innovations and transmit cultural knowledge is often
linguistically mediated, and apes and dolphins may have communication
systems with far more limited expressive potential, making it
impossible to move beyond simple copying and adopt the deferred form of
imitation that we call instruction.</p>

<h3><a name="BiaCulTra">2.3 Biases in Cultural Transmission</a></h3>

<p>

It is widely agreed that human cultural transmission often involves
imitation, but there is also evidence that we do not imitate every
behavior we see. We imitate some observed behaviors more than
others. Much research explores the biases that we and other
creatures use when determining whom and when to imitate.</p>

<p>

Biases divide into two categories. Sometimes imitation depends on
content. We are more likely to pass on a story if it is exciting
(recall Boyer), we may be more likely to repeat a recipe if it is
tasty, and we are more likely to reproduce a tool if it is
effective. In other cases, imitation depends more on context than
content. The term “context bias” refers to our
tendency to acquire socially transmitted traits as a function of who 
is
transmitting them rather than what is getting transmitted (Henrich and
McErleath 2003). There are two basic kinds of context biases:
those based on frequency and those based on who is modeling the
trait. Let's consider these in turn.</p>

<p>

The most important frequency-dependent bias is conformity.  Social
psychologists have known for decades that people often copy the
behavior of the majority in a social group (e.g., Asch 1956).  Copying
the majority may help in creating cultural cohesion and communication,
and it may also allow for group selection, a process in which a
group's prospects for survival increases relative to other groups
based on its overall fitness. Group selection is hard to explain by
appeal to biological evolution, because genetic mutations are
localized to individuals, and are thus unlikely to result in whole
groups having different traits, but conformity allows for spread
within a group, and thus overcomes this limitation of genes. This
story still depends on the possibility that an innovation that has not
yet become widely practiced can get off the ground. If people only
copied the majority, that would never happen. One solution is to
suppose that conformity biases work in concert with an opposing trend:
nonconformity. If we sometimes copy rare behaviors, then new
innovations can initially spread because of their novelty and then
spread because of their high frequency. One example of these
complementary processes is fashion. New fashions (such as street
clothing coming from a small subculture, or the seasonal innovations
of fashion designers) may initially appeal because of their novelty,
and then spread through conformity.</p>

<p>

The nonconformist bias is postulated to explain the observation that
people sometimes prefer to copy cultural forms simply because they are
rare. Model-dependent biases (the second class of context biases
mentioned above) also promotes the imitation of rare forms. In these
biases, people selectively copy specific members of a social group. We
tend to copy those who are skilled, those who are successful, and
those who hold high prestige. The prestige bias is the most
surprising, because instrumental reasoning alone could lead us to copy
people who are skillful or successful. Prestige is not synonymous with
dominance. We do not necessarily hold those who dominate us in high
regard, and we do not seek to look at them, be near them, or be like
them. We do all of these things with high prestige individuals, and
this tendency goes beyond our bias to copy people who are skilled in
domains that we are trying to master.  Henrich and Gil White (2001)
review a large body of empirical evidence in support of this
conclusion. For example, many people will shift attitudes towards
experts, even when the experts have no expertise on the topic under
consideration; people will copy the task-performance style of a
professionally attired individual more often than they copy the style
of a college student; and groups of high-status individuals exert more
influence on dialect changes over time. Within the anthropological
literature, it has often been noted that high prestige individuals in
small-scale societies are listened to more than others, even on topics
that have little to do with the domain in which their prestige was
earned. Imitating prestigious individuals may confer advantages
similar to imitating people who are skillful or successful,
however. Doing so may increase the likelihood of acquiring
prestige-enhancing traits.</p>

<p>

Given the wide variety of biases, it may seem like a difficult task to
figure out whom to imitate on any given occasion. This is especially
daunting in cases where two biases conflict, as with conformity and
prestige. To solve this problem, McElreath et al.  (2008) have
proposed that imitation biases are hierarchically organized and
context-sensitive. For example, conformity may be the default choice
when payoffs in a group of models are similar, but prestige bias kicks
in when the payoff differential increases. McElreath et al.  use
computational models to show that such payoff sensitivity produces
behavioral patterns that fit with empirical evidence.</p>

<h3><a name="BioCulInt">2.4 Bio-cultural Interaction</a></h3>

<p>

Cultural transmission of traits is often contrasted with biological
transmission. It is said to involve nurture rather than nature.
Anthropologists emphasize the wide-ranging flexibility of human
behavior and regard cultural transmission as evidence for that.
This might suggest that cultural transmission operates in a way that is
independent of biology. But this idea has been challenged.</p>

<p>

One challenge comes from evolutionary psychology. Evolutionary
psychologists place greater emphasis on innate capacities.  Cultural
variation may appear to be inconsistent with nativism, but
evolutionary psychologists believe that some variation can be
explained within a nativist framework. They admit that human groups
differ in both their psychological states and customs, but deny that
such variation requires a social explanation. The term “evoked
culture” has been introduced to label the idea that differences
in the physical environment may cause differences in how social groups
think and act (Tooby and Cosmides 1992). We may be evolved with inner
toggles that make us act in ways that are adaptive to different
settings. For example, cultures that struggle with resource scarcity
may be more belligerent than those that live in places of abundance,
and it is possible that this personality difference hinges on an
innate switch that changes position in an environment-sensitive
way.</p>

<p>

The idea of evoked culture challenges the dichotomy between
environmental and evolved causes of behavior, by proposing that some
ontogenetically acquired traits result from natural selection.
But critics of evolutionary psychology note that evoked culture cannot
explain the relatively open-ended nature of human innovation. Scarcity
may trigger a biological disposition for belligerence, but does not
cause us to invent canons, peace treaties, or agriculture. Those
specific tools for coping with scarcity depend on insight and toil,
rather than innate knowledge.</p>

<p>

That dichotomy between biology and culture has been challenged in
ways that are less radical than the idea of evoked culture.
Indeed, one challenge pushes in the opposite direction; rather than
saying cultural traits are innate, some say that innate traits depend
on culture. Some species change their environment in a way that
alters evolutionary trajectories (Day et al. 2003). This
phenomenon is called “niche construction.” Niche
construction does not always involve culture: innate traits, such as
dam building in beavers, can alter the environment in a way that
introduces selection pressures. But some niche construction is
cultural. New inventions can lead to new environments that have
biological impact. For example, Simoons (1969) argues that adult
humans were all initially lactose intolerant, but acquired the ability
to digest lactic acid as a consequence of technologies of dairy
production. If so, culture can drive genetic change.</p>

<p>

A more controversial example is language. Some have argued that
language began as an invention, using domain general cognitive
resources, but introduced a selective advantage for mutations that
facilitate rapid language learning and increasingly sophisticated
constructions – an example of what biologists call a
“Baldwin effect,” named after the philosopher,
J.M. Baldwin (Deacon 1997). Language is socially transmitted and may
have been invented, securing its status as a cultural item, but, if
nativists are night, it is now transmitted by specialized innate
machinery, which makes it bio-cultural. The idea that we can acquire
traits from biology and culture, and that these two interact, has been
called dual-inheritance theory by Boyd and Richerson (1985).</p>

<p>

Dual-inheritance theory suggests that cultural evolution need not be
an alternative to biological evolution, but rather, can interact with
it. In some cases, cultural changes may actually exert a biological
force. On the other hand, cultural evolution may tend to reduce the
impact of biology. Consider niche construction again. If human beings
can alter their environments through technology, they can mitigate the
effects of external variables that might otherwise drive natural
selection (Laland et al. 2001).  Thus, the capacity for cultural
learning may render biological transformations unnecessary. Cultural
change is faster, more flexible, and driven by forethought. The extent
to which biology contributes to human variation across cultures is,
therefore, a matter of controversy. Evolutionary psychologists
emphasize the biological contributions to variation, dual-inheritance
theorists emphasize bio-cultural interactions, and their critics
suggest that the human capacity for cultural transmission reduces the
import of biology. The latter perspective gains some support from the
fact that many dramatic cultural differences have no known biological
causes or effects.</p>

<h2><a name="ExaCulInf">3. Examples of Cultural Influence</a></h2>

<p>

Philosophers have long speculated about cultural variation, raising
questions about whether people in different cultures differ
psychologically. Clearly people in different cultures know
different things, believe different things, and have different
tastes. But one might also wonder whether culture can influence
the way we think and experience the world. And one might wonder
whether differences in taste are a superficial veneer over underlying
normative universals, or whether, instead, culture plays a role in
shaping normative facts. Cognitive science offers empirical
insights into cultural differences that have been taken to bear on
these enduring questions. What follows is a survey of some areas
in which empirical investigation has been very active.</p>

<h3><a name="Lan">3.1 Language</a></h3>

<p>

20<sup>th</sup> century linguistics was born out of anthropology,
and anthropological studies of language built on the efforts of
European missionaries to understand the languages of human societies
that had been isolated from European contact. Within this
context, the study of language principally involved radical
translation—attempting to translate the vocabulary of another
language when there is no bilingual interpreter to tell you what words
mean. Anthropologists observing this practice, such as Franz Boas,
were struck by how different the world's languages can be, and
they began to wonder whether these differences pointed toward
differences in how cultural groups understand the world.</p>

<p>

Philosophers entered into such speculation too. Quine (1960) famously
used the activity of radical translation as a springboard to present
his theses about limits on a theory of meaning. When trying to
construct a translation manual for a foreign language based on verbal
behavior, there is a problem of underdetermination. If the language
users say “gavagai” when and only when a rabbit is
present, they may be referring to rabbits, but they may also be
referring to rabbit time slices or undetached rabbit parts.  Absent
any resolution of this underdetermination, there would always be a
degree of indeterminacy in our theories of what other language users
mean. Quine's behaviorism led him to think that these indeterminacies
are not merely epistemic; linguistic behavior is not just evidence for
what people mean, but the source of meaning, so there is no further
fact that can settle what people mean by their words. This led Quine
to be skeptical about the role of reference in his semantic theory,
but he didn't become a meaning nihilist. Without determinate
reference, the meaning of words can be understood in terms of
inferential roles. But Quine (1953) had earlier argued that there is
no principled distinction between those inferences that are
constitutive of meaning, and those that merely reflect beliefs about
the world (the analytic/synthetic distinction). Thus, the meaning of a
word depends, for Quine, on the total role of that word in its
language; Quine is a meaning holist. In the context of radical
translation, this raises a striking philosophical possibility. When we
encounter a word in another language, we cannot determine what it
refers to, so we must specify its meaning in terms of its total
inferential role; but inferential roles vary widely across cultural
groups, because beliefs diverge; thus, the meaning of a word in a
language spoken by one cultural group is unlikely to have an exact
analogue in other languages. Meanings vary across cultures. In this
sense, radical translation is actually impossible. One cannot
translate a sentence in another language, because one cannot find
synonymous sentence in one's own. At best, one can write paragraph-,
chapter-, or book-length gloss on inferential links that help convey
what foreign speakers mean by their words.</p>

<p>

This conjecture leads quickly to another that relates even more
directly to psychology. Many philosophers have assumed a close
relationship between language and concepts. Words are sometimes
said to constitute concepts and, more often, to express them.
Corresponding to the linguistic inferential roles that constitute
meanings for Quine, one might posit isomorphic conceptual roles, and,
if meanings are not shared, then it might follow that concepts are not
either: people in different groups might conceptualize the world
differently. The idea that languages may not be intertranslatable
suggests that there may also be incommensurable conceptual
schemes.</p>

<p>

This idea is challenged by Davidson (1974), who offers a kind of
dilemma. Suppose we encounter a group whose beliefs and
linguistic behaviors differ from ours but can nevertheless be
accurately characterized with patience and time. If we can
understand these other people, then their concepts must be shared with
ours. Suppose, however, that we cannot ever understand what they
mean by their words because they say things that can be offered no
coherent translation. Then it's best to assume they are not
really saying anything at all; their words are meaningless
noises. Either way, there is no proliferation of conceptual
schemes. Davidson's argument, which is only roughly
presented here, controversially presupposes a principle of charity,
according to which we should not attribute irrational (e.g.,
inconsistent) beliefs. Davidson may also be overly demanding in
requiring accurate translation between languages as opposed to some
weaker criterion of comprehension (see Bar-On 1994; Henderson 
1994).</p>

<p>

Well before Quine and Davidson were debating the incommensurability of
meanings, linguists had been exploring similar ideas. Edward
Sapir (1929), a student of Boaz, had proposed two interrelated theses:
linguistic determinism according to which language influences the way
people think, and linguistic variation, according to which languages
have profound differences in syntax and semantics (these terms are not
Sapir's, but exist in the literature). Together, these two
theses entail linguistic relativity: the thesis that speakers of
different languages differ in how they perceive and think in virtue of
speaking different languages. Sapir's student, Benjamin
Whorf (1956), speculated that languages encode fundamentally different
“logics,” which become so habitual to language users that
they seem natural, resulting in fundamentally different ways of
understanding the world. For example, Whorf speculates that
speakers of Hopi are anti-realists about time, since tense in that
language is expressed using epistemic modals, which describe events as
recalled, reported, or anticipated, in lieu of past, present, or
future. Sapir and Whorf's relativism about language has come to
be known as the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis. These two have been
criticized for offering insufficient support. They had limited
knowledge of the languages they discuss, and throughout their
discussions, they infer cognitive differences directly from linguistic
differences rather than testing whether language causes (or even
correlates) with difference in thought.</p>

<p>

The Sapir-Whorf hypothesis went out of fashion with the advent of
Chomskyan linguistics. Chomsky argued that linguistic differences
are superficial and scientifically uninteresting. Languages are
united by a universal grammar, and differences simply reflect 
different
settings in universally shared rules. A further setback for the
Sapir-Whorf hypothesis came with early testing. Heider (1972) set
out to see whether color vocabulary influenced color perception.
She investigated the Dani of New Guinea, who have only two color terms
(“mili”, for dark cool colors, and “mola,”
for light and warm colors). Heider found that the Dani divide
color space in much the same way as English speakers, and performed
like English speakers on color memory tests. There was also a
failed effort to show that Chinese speakers, who lack a counterfactual
construction, have difficulty with subjunctive thought (Bloom 1981;
Au 1983). Evidence for psychological differences across speakers
of distinct languages were hard to come by.</p>

<p>

More recently, however, some researchers have claimed to find such
differences. Lucy (1992), for example, found that speakers of Yucatec
Mayan, a language that lacks count nouns, made errors on memory tasks
that required keeping track of specific quantities of items. English
speakers are more likely to notice when two pictures differ in the
number of chickens as compare to the amount of grain, because
“chicken” is encoded with a count noun, and
“grain” is encoded with a mass noun.</p>

<p>

Pederson et al. (1998) investigated speakers of Tzeltal, a language
that expressed absolute frames of reference (like “north”
and “south”) but lacks terms for relative frames of
reference (such as “left” and “right”).
When performing spatial tasks, such as replicating a sequence of
objects in two different locations, they preserved the arrangement
relative to absolute coordinates even in conditions where English
speakers would use relative coordinates.</p>

<p>

Gordon (2004) studied numerical cognition among the Pirahã, a
language with a number vocabulary limited to words that mean, roughly,
“one,” “two,” and “many.” He
found that Pirahã made frequent numerical errors when copying
drawings of groups of lines, dropping nuts into a can, and reproducing a
series of beats.</p>

<p>

Even color perception, which was once regarded as immune to
Sapir-Whorf effects may be influenced by language. Kay and Kempton
(1994) found that speaker Tarahumara, a language that does not
distinguish green and blue, were more accurate than English speakers
at rating the similarity of color pairs within the blue-green range
(see also Roberson et al.  2000). Winawer et al. (2007) found that
speakers of Russian, which has separate lexemes for light blue and
darker blues, show categorical perception effects for light blue, not
found in English speakers. In categorical perception, differences
between stimuli that cross a categorical boundary are perceived as
greater than equal differences within a category. For Russian
speakers, a light and medium blue may look more different than a light
and dark blue, even if two pairs are equidistant in colorspace.</p>

<p>

Boroditsky et al. (2003) also found that gendered articles have an
influence on conceptualization. Speakers of Spanish and German
associate stereotypically gendered adjectives with common nouns as a
function of the gender of those nouns in their languages, even when
they are tested in English. For example, the German word for key is
<em>Schlüssel</em>, which is masculine, and the Spanish word,
<em>llave</em>, is feminine. German speakers may describe keys as
hard, heavy, and useful, while Spanish speakers describe them as
lovely, little, and intricate.</p>

<p>

These kinds of findings are now plentiful, but the Sapir-Whorf
Hypothesis has not gone unchallenged (for a review, see Bloom and Keil
2001).  For example, Li and Gleitman (2002) showed that Tzetal
speakers can reproduce object arrays using relative reference frames
in a simplified version of the experiments performed by Pederson et
al.  (1998) (see Levinson et al. 2002 for a reply). Frank et al.
(2008) found that Pirahã could match large quantities with
accuracy, but failed to do so when they relied on memory. Such
experimental critiques suggest that Sapir-Whorf effects are fragile,
and may be hard to show under certain conditions, but they also
confirm that language plays a role in encoding information, and
cognitive differences arise when memory is involved. Studies on color
perception and color comparison suggest that the effects are not
limited to memory, and Boroditsky's study of gendered pronouns suggest
that language can have an enduring impact on how we think about
familiar categories.</p>

<p>

In summary, it might be said that cognitive science has found evidence
in support of the hypothesis that language can influence thought.
Because language is a cultural item, linguistic effects on thought can
be characterized as cultural effects. But the interest of such
effects is open to debate. Neo-Whorfians will say that language
can establish modes of thinking that distinguish one group from
another, while critics say these differences are modest and don't
imply the radically incommensurable worldviews advertised by Whorf.</p>

<h3><a name="PerThi">3.2 Perceiving and Thinking</a></h3>

<p>

Research on the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis looks for ways in which
language influences perception and thought. But language is not
the only way that a culture can influence cognition. Other
research looks for cultural differences in language and perception that
are not necessarily mediated by language. For example, there is
research suggesting that cognition can be affected by methods of
subsistence or social values.</p>

<p>

In the decades after World War II, psychologists began to do
research on “cognitive styles.” Witkin (1950) introduced a
distinction between field-dependent psychological processing and
field-independent psychological processing. Field-dependent
thinkers tend to notice context and the relationship between things,
whereas field-independent thinkers tend to abstract away from context
and experience objects in a way that is less affected by their
relationships to other things. For example, field-independent
thinkers do better on what Witkin called the embedded figure task, in
which one shape (left) must be found embedded in another (right).</p>

<blockquote>

<img src="FigureEmbeddedFigureTest.jpg" width="550" alt="EmbeddedFigureTask" />

</blockquote>

<p>

Witkin's test was designed to study individual differences
within his own culture, but Berry (1966) realized that it could also be
used to investigate cultural variation. He was interested in how
different forms of subsistence might influence cognition. One
hypothesis is that hunters and gatherers must be good at
differentiating objects (plants or prey) from complex scenery.
Horticulturalists, on the other hand, must pay close attention to the
relationship between the many environmental factors that can influence
growth of a crop. To test this, Berry studied Inuit hunters and
Temne horticulturalists in Africa, and found that the latter are more
field-dependent than the former. (See also Segall et al. 1966,
who found that hunter-gatherers are less susceptible to the
Mueller-Lyer illusion, because—the authors argue—they
don't live in a “carpentered world, full of right-angled
buildings.”)</p>

<p>

Berry was interested in isolated, small-scale societies, but the
same research methods and principles have also been applied to much
larger cultural groups. Cultures of every size differ on a number
of dimensions. One distinction that has been extremely valuable
in cross-cultural research is the contrast between individualist
cultures and collectivist cultures (see Triandis, 1995). Individualists
place emphasis on individual achievements and goals; they value
autonomy and disvalue dependency on others. Collectivists place
emphasis on group membership and often value group cohesion and success
above personal achievement. Following Triandis, we can define
more precisely as follows:</p>

<p>

Collectivism: a social pattern in which individuals construe
themselves as parts of collectives and are primarily motivated by
duties to those collectives</p>

<p>

Individualism: a social pattern in which individuals see themselves
as independent of collectives and are primarily motivated by their own
preferences and needs</p>

<p>

The difference can be brought out experimentally by giving people in
different cultures tasks that assess how much they value autonomy and
how much they value inter-dependence. For example, when asked to
pick a colored pen from an array of pens, individualists tend to pick
the most unusual color, and collectivists tend to pick the most
common.</p>

<p>

Individualist and collectivist cultures are distributed widely
across the globe. Countries in Western Europe, North America, and
Anglophone Australasia score high in individualism. Collectivism
is more common in East Asia, South Asia, the Middle East, the
Mediterranean, and South America. It should be obvious that these
are vast and remote regions of the globe and highly diverse, culturally
speaking. Any large nation, such as India or America, will have
scores of subcultures each of which might vary along these
dimensions. The point is not that all collectivist cultures are
alike. Differences between collectivist cultures and within
collectivist cultures are often greater than between collectivist and
individualist cultures. The point is simply that collectivist
cultures share this one dimension of similarity, and that dimension, as
we will see, has an impact on cognitive style. Likewise for
individualists. Future research will offer more finely grained
distinctions, but at present, research on the cognitive effects of
individualism and collectivism offers some of the strongest evidence
for cultural differences in thought.</p>

<p>

Some researchers trace individualism and collectivism to material
conditions. For example, many Western cultures are individualistic
and trace their seminal cultural influence to ancient Greece, which had
an economy based on fishing and herding. Far Eastern countries trace
their seminal cultural influence to China, which had intensive
agriculture. In the West, free mercantilism and capitalism
emerged long ago, emphasizing individual achievement. In the
East, capitalism and free trade is comparatively new. So the
East/West contrast in collectivism and individualism may have its
origins in how people made their livelihood in past centuries.
Once these differences are in place, they tend to be reflected in many
other aspects of culture. Far Eastern languages use characters
that require a fine sensitivity to relationships between parts; Eastern
religion often focuses on relationships between human beings and
nature; Eastern ethical systems often emphasize responsibilities to the
family (Nisbett, 2003). These cultural differences can be used to
transmit and preserve psychological differences from generation to
generation.</p>

<p>

Nisbett et al. (2001) present a large body of research, which
suggests that members of individualist and collectivist cultures tend to
have measurably different cognitive styles. Nisbett and his
collaborators (mostly East Asian psychologists) talk about
field-dependence and field-independence, but also introduce the closely
related terms: holistic and analytic cognitive styles. They
postulate that, as collectivists, East Asians will process information
more holistically, seeing the relation between things, and
collectivists will process information more analytically, focusing on
individual agents and objects. They show that these differences
come out in a wide variety of psychological tasks. Here are some
examples reviewed by Nisbett.</p>

<p>

Westerns are more likely than Easterners to attribute a person's
behavior to an internal trait rather than an environmental
circumstance. In many cases, such attributions are mistaken
(social psychologists call this the Fundamental Attribution Error).</p>

<p>

Easterners are more likely to see both sides of a conflict when
faced with counter-arguments in a debate; Westerners dig in their
heels. The Eastern responses are more dialectical, whereas
Westerners are guided by the principle of Non-Contradiction. This
is a principle central to modern logic in the West, which asserts that
a claim and its negation can't both be right.</p>

<p>

Westerners tend to categorize objects based on shared features (cows
go with chickens because they are both animals), whereas Easterners
focus more on relationships between objects (cows go with grass,
because cows eat grass).</p>

<p>

When looking at a fish tank, Westerners first notice the biggest,
fastest fish and ignore the background. Easterners are more
likely to notice background features and relational events (a fish
swimming past some seaweed), and they are less likely to recall
individual fish on a memory test. In studies of expectations, Westerns
tend to expect things to remain the same, whereas Easterners are more
likely to expect change.</p>

<p>
In assessing the import of these differences, it is important to
realize that they are often subtle. In some cases, it is possible
to get a Westerner to respond like an Easterner and conversely, if
subjects are properly instructed or primed (Oyseman &amp; Lee,
2008). But the results show that there are predictable and
replicable differences in default cognitive styles as a function of
culture.</p>

<p>

Several philosophical ramifications deserve note. First,
variation in cognitive styles can be used to challenge the idea that
the rules used in thought are fixed by a hard-wired mental logic.
This idea was promulgated by Boole (1854) in his work on formal logic,
and it helped pave the way for the advent of computing and, ultimately,
for the computational theory of mind. If there is no fixed mental
logic, then the study of reasoning may owe more to nurture than has
often been assumed, and the traditional computational theory of mind
might even need a re-examination. Cultural differences do not
refute computational approaches, but they raise a question: if some
cultures tend to rely on formal principles and others rely on
stochastic approaches to reasoning, then we should not by default
assume that the mind naturally functions like a classical computer as
opposed to, say, a connectionist computer.</p>

<p>

Second, variation in reasoning can also be used to raise questions
about whether certain cognitive norms (such as a preference for the
principle of non-contradiction) are culturally inculcated and
contestable. This issue is related to contemporary debates about
whether classical logic is privileged. It was also the subject of
a provocative paper by Winch (1964), who, following ethnographic work
by Evans-Pritchard on the logic of witchcraft among the Azanda, argued
that the Western allegiance to bivalence is culturally contingent,
rather than normatively compulsory.</p>

<p>

Third, variation in perception raises questions about modularity; if
values can influence how we see, then seeing may be more amendable to
top-down influences than defenders of modularity have supposed.
Citing work on the Mueller-Lyer illusion, Fodor (1983) argues that
modularity is consistent with the possibility that cultural settings
can, over protracted time periods, alter how information is
processed. But this concession may be inadequate: perceptual
processing styles can be altered very quickly by priming cultural
values such as individualism and collectivism. Moreover, unlike
the Mueller-Lyer illusion, which may involve bottom-up perceptual
learning, research on individualism and collectivism suggests that
<em>values</em> can influence how we see. That's close in
spirit to the idea that perception is theory-laden, which was the
central thesis of New Look psychology—the theory that the
modularity hypothesis is supposed to challenge (Bruner, 1957; Hanson,
1958).</p>

<h3><a name="Emo">3.3. Emotions</a></h3>

<p>

Emotions are a fundamental feature of human psychology. They
are found in all cultures, and arguably, in all mammals. Indeed,
we seem to share many emotions with other animals. Dogs, for
example, show signs of fear (they cower), sadness (they cry), and
delight (they wag their tails giddily). This suggests that
emotions are evolved responses. There is a good explanation for
why emotions would be selected for: they help us cope with challenges
that have a tremendous impact on life and well-being. Fear protects
us from dangers, sadness motivates us to withdraw when resources or 
kin
are lost, and joy registers accomplishments and motivates us to take 
on
new challenges. Thus, it seems highly likely that emotions are
part of human nature. But emotions can also be influenced by
nurture. Some researchers even suggest that emotions can be
socially constructed—they say some emotions come into existence
through social learning. The thesis is controversial, of course,
but the claim that culture has an impact on emotional states is hard to
deny (for a review, see Mesquita and Frijda, 1992).</p>

<p>

To see how culture might impact emotions, consider various things that
normally occur when people have emotional responses. There is
some <em>elicitor</em> of the emotion; there is characteristically some
<em>appraisal</em> of that elicitor; this occurs along with
<em>feelings</em>; and these are associated with <em>motivational
states</em> as the body prepares to react; the emotion is also
<em>expressed</em>; and can lead to a decision about what
<em>actions</em> to carry out, including complex strategic actions
extended over time. Each of these things can come under cultural
influence.</p>

<p>

Begin with elicitors. Culture can clearly influence what arouses
our emotions. In Bali, crawling babies are said to arouse disgust
(Geertz, 1973: 420), and in Japan, disgust can be caused by failing an
exam (Haidt et al., 1997). In Sumatra, an encounter with a high
status individual can cause shame (Fessler, 2004). In Iran, a
woman without a headscarf might cause anger, and in France, a woman
with a headscarf might cause the same reaction.</p>

<p>

Feelings can differ cross-culturally, as well. For example, it
has been reported that, while <em>anger</em> is typically associated
with high arousal in the West, in Malay, anger (or <em>marah</em>) is
more strongly associated with sullen brooding (Goddard, 1996).
There are corresponding differences in motivational states. Anger
might instill a disposition to aggress in the West, whereas sulking
behavior may be more typical in Malaysia. In Malay, aggression is
associated with <em>amok</em>, which refers (as the imported homophone
does in English) to a frenzied state. Thus, there seems to be no
exact synonym for anger: a state that is prototypically aggressive but
not frenzied.</p>

<p>

Culture can also impact expressions of emotions. This is
sometimes done through active suppression. Ekman and Friesen
(1971) present evidence that public expression of negative emotions is
discouraged in Japan. New expressions may also be cultivated
culturally. There is evidence that tongue biting is used by women
to express shame in parts of India (Menon and Shweder, 1994).
There are also cultural difference in gestures used to express anger,
such as the middle finger in North America or the double finger salute
in Britain. What North Americans interpreted as an
“okay” sign would be interpreted as a sexual insult in
Russia or Brazil. As these gestures become habitual, they may
become incorporated into automatic ways of expressing emotions in some
contexts.</p>

<p>

In addition to emotional expressions, cultures can promote highly
complex behavioral responses. Love is sometimes taken to be
grounds for marriage, but less so in cultures where marriage is
arranged. Grief in Biblical contexts might have been expressed by
tearing ones clothes or covering oneself with dirt.
Shame can require culturally specific behaviors of self-abasement, such
as bowing low. Hope may promote the use of lucky charms or
prayers, depending on one's cultural beliefs.</p>

<p>

These examples suggest that culture can impact emotional response in a
wide variety of ways. As a consequence, emotions that are widely
recognized in one culture may go unnoticed or uninstantiated in
another. One example is <em>amae</em>, a Japanese emotion
construct, which is characterized as a positive feeling of dependency
on another person, group, or institution (Doi, 1973). Another
example is the Samoan emotion of <em>musu</em>, which expresses a
person's reluctance to do what is required of him or her. In more
isolated societies, it has even been argued that none of the named
emotions correspond exactly to emotions that we would recognize
here. This may be the case among the Ifaluk, a small group in
Micronesia (Lutz, 1988).</p>

<p>

In arguing for cultural variation in emotions, researchers often cite
differences in emotional vocabulary. Such differences would not
be especially powerful evidence were it not for independent evidence
(just discussed) that culture can exert a causal impact.
Vocabulary differences may also be evidential in another way. The
very fact that a label exists in a language may have a causal impact on
the frequency or manifestation of a psychological state. This is
what Hacking (1999) calls a “looping effect.” This
can sometimes be seen in the case of pathological emotions. For
example, incidence and symptoms of depression may increase as a
consequence of public discourse about depression (Ryder et al., 2008;
see also Murphy, 2006). Depression as we know it may be
culturally specific in the way it presents, even if there are related
disorders in other cultures, such as <em>melancholia</em> and
<em>acidia</em> in medieval Europe (Jackson, 1981). Some
emotional disorders may be common in one society and virtually unheard
of elsewhere. One example is <em>latah</em>, a disorder found
among women in parts of South East Asia, in which victims enter a
trance-like state, shout obscenities, repeat what others say to them,
and exhibit an extremely strong and sensitive startle response (Simons,
1996).</p>

<p>

In light of such cultural variation, some argue that emotions are
socially constructed (Averill, 1980; Harré, 1986; Armon-Jones,
 1989; also see the entry
 <a href="../social-construction-naturalistic/">naturalistic approaches to social construction</a>.)
 Others resist this idea, arguing that emotions are innate biological
programs, shared across the species despite differences in emotion
vocabulary. The latter position has been associated with evolutionary
approaches to emotion (Plutchik, 2001), and research on universal
recognition of emotional facial expressions (Ekman et al. 1969).</p>

<p>

Ekman and his collaborators studied an isolated culture, the Fore,
in Papua New Guinea. These people had little contact with the
West, and Ekman wondered whether they assign the same significance to
emotional expressions as we do. He identified six emotions that
are very reliably identified in Western nations (joy, sadness, anger,
fear, surprise, and disgust), and found corresponding words in
Fore. He asked his respondents to look at photos of expressions
and identify which faces go with which words. He also described
various scenarios (such as seeing an old friend or smelling something
bad) and asked them to choose the face that best expressed how someone
in those situations would feel. Using these methods, he was able
to show that the Fore give responses that are very similar to the
responses we give in the West. Ekman concluded that emotional
expressions are not cultural inventions, but rather, are biologically
determined.</p>

<p>

A close look at Ekman's data suggests that he may exaggerate the
degree of universality. The Fore do indeed respond similarly to their
Western counterparts, but not identically. For example,they are more
likely to label as fear the faces that we identify as surprise, and
they also associate sadness with the faces we label angry. So the
dominant response among the Fore differs from ours in two of six
cases. And even where they agree with our labeling, the level of
agreement is often surprisingly low, with less than 50% giving the
expected response. Moreover, the Fore who had more exposure to
outsiders also gave answers that were more like outsiders', suggesting
some cultural influence (see Russell, 1994, for more discussion).</p>

<p>

It doesn't follow that emotions are mere social
constructions. Rather, it seems that we have biologically basic
emotions that can be altered by culture. Whether these
alternations qualify as different emotions or simply different
manifestations of the same emotion depends on what one takes emotions
to be. The nature of emotions is a matter of considerable debate
(Prinz, 2004). For those who take emotions to essentially involve
judgments, constructivist theories of emotion are attractive, because
culture can influence how people construe situations (Solomon,
2002). Constructivism is also appealing to those who think of
emotions as analogous to scripts, which include everything from
canonical eliciting to conditions to complex behavioral sequalae
(Russell, 1991; Goddard, 1996; Goldie, 2000). Those who see
emotions as automatic behavioral programs or patterned bodily changes
have been less inclined towards constructivism (James, 1884; Darwin,
1872; Ekman, 1999; though see Prinz, 2002). Griffiths (1997) has
argued that emotions are not a natural kind: some are culturally
constructed scripts, others are automatic behavioral programs, and
others are evolved strategic responses that unfold over longer
timescales.</p>

<p>

It might seem that we can't settle on the question of whether
culture shapes emotions without deciding between these theories of what
emotions are. On the other hand, the evidence suggests that
culture can influence every aspect of our emotional responses, and this
suggests that, whatever emotions really are, culture can have an
impact. It is open to debate whether the impact is sufficiently
significant to warrant the conclusion that some emotions are social
constructs.</p>

<h3><a name="Mor">3.4 Morality</a></h3>

<p>

Few deny that biology makes some contribution to morality.
There is a vast literature on prosocial behavior in primates, moral
behavior in early childhood, and universal dispositions to empathy and
altruism (e.g., Warneken and Tomasello, 2009). But no account of
moral psychology can stop with biology. Morality is also
influenced by culture. This raises traditional philosophical
question about moral relativism.</p>

<p>

Evidence for cultural variation in values is easy to come by (see
Prinz, 2007). Consider, for example, attitudes towards various
forms of violence. Cannibalism, slavery, honor killing,
headhunting, public executions, and torture have
been widely practiced by a range of societies, but are reviled in the
contemporary West. There is also considerable diversity in the
sexual domain: polygamy, cousin marriage, masturbation, bestiality,
pre-marital sex, prostitution, concubinage, homosexuality, and other
practices are accepted in some places and morally condemned
elsewhere. The anthropological record suggests that just about
every behavior that we consider immoral has been an accepted cultural
practice somewhere. Of course, a society wouldn't survive
very long if it encouraged random killing of next-door neighbors, but
societies that encourage murder of people in the next village can
endure indefinitely (see Chagnon, 1988, on the Yanamamo).</p>

<p>

One can find further support of moral diversity by conducting
psychological experiments on members of different cultures and
subcultures. Nisbett and Cohen (1996) compared Americans from Southern
States with Americans from the North, and found that Southerners were
much more likely to endorse violence of various forms in response to
moral transgression (killing to defend property, corporal punishment,
gun possession, and so on). They explain this by noticing that
many Southerners are descendents of Scots-Irish immigrants who had to
develop a “culture of honor” to survive under harsh,
comparatively lawless conditions in Northern Ireland before coming to
the United States.</p>

<p>

Cultural differences in morality have also been tested using
economic games (Henrich et al., 2005). One example is the
ultimatum game, in which one person is told that they must divide a sum
of money (say $100) with a stranger. If the stranger rejects the
division, no one gets any of the money. In the U.S., most people
offer relatively equal splits. If they offer too little, the
other person typically rejects the split out of spite, and both players
go home empty handed. This is a measure of moral attitude towards
fairness, and there are subtle differences across cultures. The
Machiguenga of Peru, who have an economic system that does not depend
much on cooperation, make lower offers on average than Americans, and
they accept lower offers. Among the Au of New Guinea, people
sometimes reject “hyper-fair” offers—that is offers
over 50%. In the U.S., a hyper-fair offer would be happily
accepted, but the Au routinely reject such generosity; a similar
pattern has been found in Russian and other former Soviet states
(Herrmann et al., 2008). Hyper-fair offers may be regarded as
ostentatious or as trying to achieve some kind of dominance by making
the recipient feel indebted.</p>

<p>

Some philosophers have resisted the claim that there is cultural
variation in morality. Rachels (2003: chap. 2), for example,
argues that some differences are merely apparent. Inuits tolerate
infanticide, but so would we if we lived in the Arctic tundra where
resources are rare. Against this kind of reply, one might argue
that, in fact, values don't tend to change right away when we
change environments (the U.S. Southern culture of honor may be a
hold-over from hard times in Northern Ireland prior to U.S.
immigration; Nisbett and Cohen, 1996). Moreover, the fact that
our attitudes toward infanticide might shift in the tundra might be
taken as evidence for relativism rather than evidence against it;
morality is highly sensitive to environmental variables.</p>

<p>

Other critics have argued that we cannot adequately assess whether
cultures differ in values. Moody-Adams (1997) argues that, absent
a complete understanding of another culture's beliefs, we might
mistake differences in factual beliefs for moral differences. For
example, did the Aztecs really think cannibalism was okay, or were
they driven to this practice because of a cosmology that made them
think this was the only way to appease the Gods? We may never
know. On the other hand, anyone who is willing to concede that
culture can alter people's non-moral beliefs might also concede
that values can be altered.</p>

<p>

The most enduring philosophical debate about moral variation concerns
metaethical relativism. Does moral diversity imply that there is
no single true morality? On its own, the answer is no. But
some relativists argue that that there is no source of morality other
than our attitudes (e.g., they argue for subjectivism), so cultural
variation implies that morality is relative (Prinz, 2007). Others
argue that appeals to cultural history adequately explain why we have
moral values, so there is no pressure to posit a further domain of
values that transcend culture (Harman, 1977). These views do not
entail that any morality is possible. There may be a plurality of
acceptable value systems, given human nature and the situations we find
ourselves in (Wong, 2006). Opponents of relativism think such
pluralism is still too generous. Demands of reason (Kant),
intrinsic goods (consequentialism), natural conditions for flourishing
(Aristotle), ideal observers (Smith), and divine commands have all been
explored as sources of absolute values.</p>

<h2><a name="PhiIntCul">4. Philosophical Intuitions and Culture</a></h2>

<p>

Cultural variation bears on traditional philosophical questions,
such as questions about moral relativism, the modularity of 
perception,
and incommensurability of meaning. Cultural variation also bears
on the practice of philosophy itself. Some have argued that
philosophical theories are culturally informed, and that, therefore,
philosophers who take themselves to be seeking universal truths must
either revise their aspirations or alter their methodology.</p>

<p>

 One place where this issue has been confronted is
 <a href="../comparphil-chiwes/">comparative philosophy</a>.
 For example, scholars of philosophical traditions in East Asia
sometimes wonder to what extent these are related to traditions in the
West. A skeptical view would say that the starting assumptions,
guiding questions, and dominant methods are so different that
comparison is of limited value. On the other extreme, one might
think that one can simply treat Eastern and Western philosophers as if
they were part of a single domain, and compare them easily just as one
might compare two figures coming out of the same cultural
heritage.</p>

<p>

The idea that philosophical ideas are culturally informed has also been
investigated empirically. Experimental philosophers have
converted standard philosophical thought experiments into survey studies
in an effort to see whether untutored intuitions align with those that
have been endorsed by professional philosophers. Some
experimental philosophers have used the survey method to do
cross-cultural comparisons, most often comparing philosophical
intuitions in the United States to those in China and other East Asian
Countries. The results suggest that there is cultural
variation.</p>

<p>

In one pioneering study, Weinberg et al. (2001) looked at epistemic
intuitions. Within recent Western epistemology, the most
influential thought experiments owe to Edmund Gettier (1963), who
devised them in an effort to argue against the prevailing view that
knowledge is justified true belief. These cases are supposed to
show that a belief can be justified and true, without being an
intuitive case of knowledge. For example, it is a majority view
within Western philosophy that the following Gettier-inspired case does
not qualify as knowledge:</p>

<p>

Bob has a friend, Jill, who has driven a Buick for many years.
Bob therefore thinks that Jill drives an American car. He is not
aware, however, that her Buick has recently been stolen, and he is also
not aware that Jill has replaced it with a Pontiac, which is a
different kind of American car. Does Bob really know that Jill
drives an American car, or does he only believe it?</p>

<p>

Weinberg et al. gave this vignette to college students of European,
East Asian, and South Asian descent. Most European
Americans shared the intuition that Bob does not know that Jill drives
an American car, but the majority of East and South Asians had the
opposite intuition.</p>

<p>

Another cross-cultural study of philosophical intuitions is reported by
Machery et al. (2004). They turned from epistemology to
semantics, and found that one of the most influential thought
experiments in the philosophy of language elicits different intuitions
across cultural groups. The thought experiment owes to Kripke
(1979), who was arguing against descriptive theories of
reference. According to descriptive theories, a proper name
refers to the individual who satisfies the descriptions most associated
with that name. For example, descriptivists would say
“Gödel” refers to the person who proved the
incompleteness of arithmetic. Kripke objects by constructing an
imaginary case in which someone else came up with the proof and the
person we know as Gödel merely took credit for it.
Kripke's intution is that, even if this were so,
“Gödel” would continue to refer to the same person,
not to this other guy who discovered the proof. That intuition
counts against descpritvism and in favor of a causal-historical theory
of reference. Machery et al. show that American college students
with a Western cultural background were much more likely to share
Kripke's intuitions than students in Hong Kong in cases of this
kind (for objections, see Marti, 2009; and replies in, Machery et al.
2009).</p>

<p>

In another study, Huebner et al. (2010) use cross-cultural methods to
test an intuition that has been important in consciousness
studies. Block (1979) argued against functionalism using thought
experiments in which the functional organization of a human mind is
realized by a population of people rather than a biological
brain. Block's intuition is that this collective would not
be conscious, and therefore functional organization in not sufficient
for consciousness. Huebner et al. show that students in Hong Kong
are significantly more likely than American students to be willing to
ascribe consciousness to collectives. They conclude that the
intuitions underlying Block's argument are not cross-culturally
shared.</p>

<p>

The authors of these studies emphasize two points. First, the
standard method of drawing philosophical conclusions by consulting
intuitions may be problematic because those intuitions are not
consistently held across cultures. If philosophers seek to
discover the nature of knowledge, reference, or consciousness, by
analyzing the corresponding concepts, they must reckon with the fact
that these concepts vary, and no single analysis is likely to
emerge. Second, some of the variance may be accounted for by
cultural variables. This suggests that concepts are culturally
influenced, and that philosophical theories based on concepts may
reflect the attitudes of a cultural group, rather than universally
shared understanding of the target domain. From this perspective,
philosophy based on intuitive judgments begins to look more like
auto-anthropology than a window into absolute truths.</p>

<p>

Opponents of experimental philosophy argue that surveys of college
students reveal less about concepts than the intuitions of
professional philosophers. These critics suggest that intuitions among
professional philosophers engaged in careful discussion and
argumentation are more likely to converge and are more reliable. But,
this prognosis may be overly optimistic. Professional philosophers
within the same culture do not converge, so there is little <em>prima
facie</em> reason to expect cross-cultural converge. Moreover, it's
important to bear in mind that intuitions are tapping into semantic
knowledge, and semantic knowledge is not based on recollection of
perfect forms in Plato's heaven. Rather, it is informed by everything
from explicit instruction to language use within the community, and
salient exemplars. These sources of semantic knowledge may vary
cross-culturally. Thus, it remains possible that cherished
philosophical theories are more parochial than we assumed. If so,
research on the cognitive science of culture has important
implications for philosophical practice.</p>
