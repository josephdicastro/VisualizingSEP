<h1>Sounds</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Thu Jul 14, 2005; substantive revision Tue Oct 5, 2010</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>

Philosophy of perception typically centered on colors, as did the
metaphysics of mind when discussing the mind-dependence of secondary
qualities. Possibly, the philosophical privilege of the visible just
reflects the cognitive privilege of the visible—as vision is
considered to account for most of useful sensory information
gathering.</p>

<p>

This neglect of sounds is at times a regrettable state of affairs,
as sounds are not only an important element of the perceptual scene but
are also philosophically idiosyncratic in many intriguing ways; in
particular, their temporal and spatial unfolding, as presented in
perception, has interesting metaphysical and epistemological aspects.
There is, however, an advantage of the neglect. Many philosophical
aspects of sound and sound perception are not idiosyncratic and indeed
make for general issues in philosophy of perception. Hence in this
article we will take advantage of the many discussions that have used
other sensory features such as colors as a paradigm of a sensory
feature. For instance, we shall not rehearse the discussion about the
subjectivity of secondary qualities, as the example of sounds does not
seem to introduce new philosophically interesting elements that could
challenge generalizations obtained, say, from the example of
colors.</p>

<p>

The main issues which are on the table concern the nature of sounds.
Sounds enter the content of auditory perception. But what are they? Are
sounds individuals? Are they events? Are they properties of sounding
objects? If they are events, what type of event are they? What is the
relation between sounds and sounding objects? Temporal and causal
features of sounds will be important in deciding these and related
questions. However, it turns out that a fruitful way to organize these
issues deals with the spatial properties of sounds.</p>

<p>

Indeed, the various philosophical pronouncements about the nature of
sounds can be rather neatly classified according to the spatial status
each of them assigns to sounds. Where are sounds? Are they anywhere?
The main relevant families of answers include proximal, medial, distal,
and aspatial theories. Proximal theories would claim that sounds are
where the hearer is. Medial theories – exemplified by mainstream
acoustics – locate sounds in the medium between the resonating
object and the hearer. Distal theories consider sounds to be located at
the resonating object. Finally, aspatial theories deny spatial
relevance to sounds. There are significant variants of each of these.
Sound theories can also be classified according to other dimensions,
such as the metaphysical status they accord to sounds (for instance, as
occurring events as opposed to properties or dispositions). We shall
see some of the interactions between these different accounts.</p>

<h2><a name="ProTheSou">1. Proximal Theories of Sounds</a></h2>

<p>

Proximal theories of sounds construe sounds as located at or beneath
the bodily surface of the hearer. We distinguish two main strands.</p>

<h3><a name="SouSen">1.1 Sounds as Sensations</a></h3>

<p>

Modern philosophical accounts of sounds informed by psychology of
perception construe sounds as “sensations”, or
states/properties of hearers. Consider,</p>

<p>

 It seems…reasonable to suggest that the
sounds directly perceived are sensations of some sort produced in the
observer when the sound waves strike the ear. (Maclachlan, 1989 p.
26)</p>

<p>

The sound-as-sensations theory is justified by some facts about
auditory experience. People report hearing voices and bells even when
no one is speaking and no bell is ringing. Various examples of
subjective sounds are documented under the label of tinnitus. In an
anechoing chamber, most subjects experience subjective buzzing and
whistlings. Some subjects undergo pathologic tinnitus when they hear
sounds that disrupt their normal auditory capabilities. When Russian
composer Shostacovich turned his head on a side, he was subject to a
flow of melodies. (Sacks 2008) Tinnitus and other subjective auditory
phenomena have different causes, that can be related to the mechanical
properties of the inner ear or to more central features. The objects of
these experiences are naturally and spontaneously categorized as
sounds. If sounds are simply defined as the objects of audition, then
they are easily identified with the qualitative aspects of auditory
perception. Various strands of indirect realism in perception would
make this view mandatory. According to them, it is by hearing the
immediate, proximal items that we hear some distal events or objects.
In such a case sounds would be defined as the immediate objects of
auditory perception.</p>

<h3><a name="SouProSti">1.2 Sounds as Proximal Stimuli</a></h3>

<p>

A bit more peripheral, albeit still proximal, is a position,
defended by (O'Shaughnessy, 2000) claiming that the sound heard is
where the hearer is:</p>

<blockquote>

 …while the sound originates at a distance
and we can hear that it is coming from a direction and even place, and
while there is no auditory experience of hearing that the sound is
where we are, the sound that we hear is nonetheless where we are (p.
447).</blockquote>

<p>

This leaves open the possibility that an unheard sound be located
away from the hearer.</p>

<p>

Support for this position comes from the following example. If I
hear the noise of a motorcycle far away, the physical event at my ear
is qualitatively different from the physical event that is produced at
the motorcycle's place. If I was close to the motorcycle, the physical
event at my ear would be completely different from, and would not
correspond to that of a motorcycle driving far away. A party upstairs
does not sound the way it sounds to participants to the party. However,
these arguments can be resisted on two counts. First, one should
distinguish between source and informational channel. Consider a visual
analogon. From the fact that reflected light is the only light that
hits the eye, it does not follow that one does not see reflecting
surfaces or is not aware of incident light. Reflected light contains
information about the reflecting object and the illumination, which is
unpacked by the brain. In the case of sound, distance, echoes,
reverberations, and filtering affect the informational channel in a way
that informs about the position of the source. Second, the examples
used to support the proximal theory are unable to account for the
perceived constancy of auditory features of distant objects. The
motorcycle and the party can be judged to be very noisy, even if the
physical events at the hearer are faint because of the distance from
the respective sources. We do possess a notion of distal volume of a
sound.</p>

<p>

The locatedness of the sound at the hearer's position entails that
there are as many sounds as there are actual (or potential) hearers
around. An alternate account would consider that one and the same sound
is present which is, however, multiply located.</p>

<p>

These examples, and the related difficulties, thus suggest that a
major shortcoming of proximal theories is that they do not locate
sounds where an untutored description of what is perceived suggests
they are. This means that if sounds were inner sensations, or
mechanical events at the ear, we would be almost always mistaken in our
aural perceptions, at least on important aspects of the sound. In turn,
this amounts to accounting for auditory perception in terms of a
massive error theory. We shall see that proximal theories are not alone
in endorsing it.</p>

<h2><a name="MedTheSou">2. Medial Theories of Sounds</a></h2>

<p>

Medial theories construe sounds as features of the medium in which a
sounding object and a hearer are immersed. The identification of sounds
with sound waves is the major example of medial theories.</p>

<h3><a name="SouEveProMed">2.1 Sounds as Events or Properties of the Medium</a></h3>

<p>

In his treatise <em>On the Soul</em>, Aristotle wrote that
“sound is a particular movement of air” (420b 10). The
natural scientists of the 17th century refined this intuition into the
wave theory of sounds, which appeared to be an obvious competitor for
the quality or sensation (proximal) view. Galileo (1623) registered
that “sounds are produced and heard by us when… a frequent
vibration of air shaken in tiny waves moves a certain cartilage of the
tympanum in our ear… the more frequent the vibration, the higher
the pitch; the less frequent, the lower.” Descartes joined in and
in his <em>Passions of the Soul</em> considered that what we actually
hear are not the objects themselves, but some “movements coming
from them” (1649, XXIII). Indeed, around 1636, Mersenne measured
the speed of propagation of sound waves.</p>

<p>

Both Galileo and Descartes were aware that the medial account was
revisionary relative to a common sense view of sounds, or at least as
revisionary as is the sensation view. Sounds for the wave view or the
sensation view are not what we unreflectively take them to be on the
basis of the content of auditory perception. (Indeed, Galileo himself
endorsed both a proximal theory—sounds as sensations – and
a medial theory, thereby possibly originating a dualist account.) At
the same time Galileo and Descartes, as well as other modern
philosophers, were not particularly keen in detailing the
phenomenological content of auditory perception.</p>

<h3><a name="SouWav">2.2 Sounds as Waves</a></h3>

<p>

The wave account is, of course, endorsed by modern acoustics. Sounds
are construed as mechanical vibrations transmitted by an elastic
medium. They are thus described as longitudinal waves, defined by their
frequency and amplitude. A vibrating object (the sound source, such as
a moving vocal chord or a vibrating tuning fork) creates a disturbance
in the surrounding medium (say, air, or water). Each particle of the
medium is set in back-and-forth motion at a given frequency and with a
given amplitude, and the motion propagates to neighboring particles at
the same frequency, undergoing an energy loss that entails a decrease
in amplitude. Seen macroscopically, the propagation of sound is the
propagation of a compression in the medium followed by a depression,
that is, the propagation of a wave. The behavior of each particle is
described by a sinusoid that maps the cyclical pattern of compressions
and depressions against time. A cycle is the complete path of the
sinusoid from crease to crease, at the end of which the particle is
back to its starting position. Amplitude is the distance between
creases and valleys in the sinusoid, period is the distance between a
crease and its successor, and frequency is the number of cycles per
time unit.</p>

<p>

Contemporary philosophers of perception of the physicalist strand
tend to align themselves on the wave theory. Perkins (1983) thus
summarizes the view: “…the sound we hear is identical with
the train of airwaves that stretches from the distant sounding object
to our ear.” And indeed, the physicalist account of sounds seems
to make a good claim to successful reduction of key auditory phenomena
based on the identification of sounds with sound waves in a medium in
which a sounding object (and possibly a hearer) is present.</p>

<h3><a name="AssWavThe">2.3 Assessing the Wave Theory</a></h3>

<h4>2.3.1 Arguments for the Wave Theory</h4>

<p>

Many perceptual properties of sounds are neatly explained by the
presence of strong correlations with properties of waves, in particular
pitch and intensity (i.e. volume).</p>

<ul>

<li>The felt quality of high pitch is correlated with high
frequencies; low pitch is correlated with low frequencies;</li>

<li>High volumes are correlated with high, low volumes with low,
amplitudes.</li>

<li>The directionality of sounds (the fact that they appear to be
‘in a direction’) is related to the fact that the hearer is
located on a propagation line from the source.</li>

<li>Even more accomplished is the explanation of particular auditory
effects, such as the Doppler effect, whereby the speed of a sounding
object in motion contributes to a change in the sound's heard pitch (so
that the whistle of an engine passing by is heard to drop in pitch as
it travels past us).</li>

</ul>

<p>

Interestingly enough, the reduction of sounds to waves in a medium
is arguably more successful than the corresponding attempt to reduce
colors to properties of electromagnetic waves. The latter attempt is
affected by some major problems, such as the existence of non-spectral
colors like purple, or the fact that some spectral monochromatic colors
such as orange are seen as being composed colors.</p>

<h4>2.3.2 Arguments Against the Wave Theory</h4>

<p>

However, for all its merits, the medial identification of sounds
with sound waves raises some objections and leaves some matters
wanting.</p>

<p>

For instance, there are metameric sounds (as there are metamers
among colors), that is, sounds that feel identical to the ear although
the corresponding medial properties are different. There is no
one-to-one psychophysical correlation between auditory content and
sounds as waves (Churchland 2007: 222). Moreover, ultrasounds, above
20.000 Hz and infrasounds, below 20 Hz, have the same physical nature
as sounds—they are mechanical vibrations transmitted by an
elastic medium—but they are not audible (as infrared and
ultraviolet are not visible in the domain of colors): do they count as
sounds? It further appears that the relationship between sound and
sounding object remains underspecified. Do sound waves depend upon
sounding objects in the sense in which we usually think sounds
(as auditory events) do?</p>

<p>

Most importantly, as happened with proximal theories, medial
theories do not locate sounds where an untutored conception of auditory
perception suggests they are. If sounds were sound waves, we would be
almost always mistaken in our aural perceptions on important aspects,
which fact, once more, amounts to accounting for auditory perception in
terms of a massive error theory.</p>

<p>

What is the nature of sounds under the wave theory? Relevant to our
purposes, there are two main metaphysical conceptions about waves, in
both cases construed as individuals. Either (a) waves are considered to
be of the same nature as processes (temporally extended entities, with
temporal parts), or (b) they are taken as individuals of a peculiar
kind. In case (a), it may be argued that they do not move, for arguably
processes do not move (Dretske 1967), but rather have phases (temporal
parts) located at different spatial regions. Although we do say that
the party moved from John's room to Mary's room, the party was never
fully in either room. Objects like people (John, Mary, Sue, Lynn), on
the other hand, were completely in John's room first, and completely in
Mary's room later. Objects and people moved, as movement occurs
whenever a whole entity is fully first in a place and then in another.
The party did not move, but part of it was in John's room and part of
it in Mary's at different times.</p>

<p>

If waves were processes like parties, one would have to construe
sound waves' “movement” in terms of the presence of
different phases of the wave at different spatial locations. However,
one does not hear a sound wave's phase as being at a particular
location, in particular at any of the locations between the source and
oneself. Sound waves do not appear to be perceptually located where
sounds are. A wave-process has some starting phases in the object, and
some end-phases around the perceiver: but perception locates sounds
wholly where the object is.</p>

<p>

In case (b), (sound) waves are different from processes and are
peculiar just because waves move, as individual substances do. But
again, if sound waves move, the corresponding sounds are not generally
heard as moving. (Contrast this case with seeing a sea wave's phase at
a particular place.) Sound waves propagate in all or most directions
from a sounding object, but the corresponding sounds are not actually
heard as propagating in any direction: the only moving sounds are the
sounds emitted by a moving source. It follows that if sounds were sound
waves in this sense, we would not be hearing them as they are.</p>

<p>

Consider an analogy with light. In the realm of vision, the closest
analogon to sounds are the activities of light sources. We perceive
these activities, and we perceive them as located where their sources
are: the emission of a light bulb out there, the glowing of candlelight
over the table, the irradiation of the sun at the horizon; each with
its own respective color. Do we perceive light itself, as opposed to
the events of light emission at light sources? Clearly, light travels
from the source to our eye — if it didn't, we would not perceive the
source. But what we perceive is the emission event, and not the light.
An irrelevant element of disanalogy is related to the temporal
unfolding of sounds and light events respectively. Typically in the
environment light is emitted continuously, whereas sounds occur
episodically and have short lives. If most light sources were
intermittent as in piezoelectric lighters, or if most objects were
buzzing all the time, this element of disanalogy would be less salient.
(Pasnau 2007)</p>

<p>

In some conditions it looks as if we perceive light rays, e.g. in a
dusty room. But what is actually perceived is a set of particles of
water or of dust that intercept light. In order for a light ray to be
visible, it would have to send information to our eye without the
mediation of interposed matter. Coming back to sounds, the argument
based on the constraint of fidelity to the content of auditory
perception is thus, in a compact form: in order for sound waves to be
audible, they would have to transmit audible information that reaches
our ears. They don't. So we do not hear them. But we do hear sounds.
Hence sounds are not (medial) sound waves.</p>

<h4>2.3.3 Arguments for or Against the Wave Theory Reassessed</h4>

<p>

Some other remarks against the identification of sounds with sound
waves in the medium between the object and the perceiver apply
independently of the metaphysical construal of sound waves as processes
or sui generis individuals.</p>

<p>

Consider first the fact that sounds are sometimes loud and sometimes
soft; as we have seen, in the wave theory this feature is correlated
with amplitude of the sound waves. However, the location of the sound
plays a role in establishing the correlation. A loud sound, which is
heard as being far from us, is different from a soft sound, which is
heard as being close to us. The spectra of the two sounds are
different. If you want a vivid example, consider what happens if you
amplify the sound of a person who is speaking low. You do not have the
impression of a person who speaks loud. You have, on the other hand,
the impression of having come very close to a low-speaking giant.</p>

<p>

In some conditions, however, it can be difficult for us to tell a
loud sound in the distance from a soft sound nearby, because in the
part of space closer to our ears the sound waves that reach us and
correspond to the two sounds can have the same amplitude. (This only
holds for an ideal case of a long lasting sine wave with no sharp
attack. This type of sound is practically distance-proof because having
a single component, the only possible variation is in amplitude, and no
other spectral differences arise.)</p>

<p>

Indeed, the fact that the two sine waves have the same amplitude
when they are close to the ear accounts for the indistinguishability of
the two sounds. Nevertheless, the two sounds, even if
indistinguishable, are distinct, whereas the two sound waves are not. A
way to put the difficulty is as follows: a loud sinusoid heard at a
distance is still a loud sinusoid; but the corresponding sound waves
decrease in amplitude. As we have seen discussing proximal theories, we
can make perfect sense of the notion of distal volume of sounds, even
in the case in which we cannot distinguish a loud distant sound from a
soft sound in the vicinity. Something (decrease in amplitude) happens
to sound waves which does not happen to sounds (the distal volume does
not change). Hence it can be argued that on this account too sounds are
distinct from sound waves.</p>

<p>

As a matter of fact, one may want to distinguish two possible lines
of argument here:</p>

<ol type="i">

<li>A phenomenological argument, claiming that sometimes we hear a
constant sound (constant in intensity, for instance), even though the
source is moving away from us. Here different sound waves can
correspond to one and the same sound.</li>

<li>A metaphysical argument, holding that sometimes the sound waves
corresponding to two sounds are the same while the sounds are clearly
different: a loud sound in the distance, or a faint sound close to us.
Here the very same sound waves can correspond to distinct sounds. The
latter argument is not lethal, but is a useful reminder that there is
no fully developed theory of sounds as medial sound waves as yet.
Should the sound be identified with the sound waves when they reach the
ears, or with the whole train of sound waves from the source to our
ears, or with the sphere filled with sound waves and centered on the
source?</li>

</ol>

<p>

The thesis that sounds are sound waves is also often motivated by
the argument from vacuums. Surely, it is argued, sounds cannot exist in
a vacuum. As Hylas says in Berkeley's <em>Three Dialogues Between Hylas
and Philonous</em>, “a bell struck in the exhausted receiver of
an air-pump, sends forth no sound. The air therefore must be thought
the subject of sound” (1713: 171–2). But is the claim that there
are no sounds in vacuums really obvious? On pain of question begging,
it cannot be made to follow from any particular metaphysics of sounds.
In order to assess it on its own merits, consider once more the analogy
between, on the one hand, sounds and air, and, on the other hand,
emission events at light sources and light. Air is the medium of
auditory perception, and light is the medium of visual perception. The
reasoning now is that just as things can sensibly be taken to have
colors in the dark, they can sensibly be taken to produce sounds in a
vacuum.</p>

<p>

In the above arguments an important role is played by the following
requirement: <em>A theory of sounds should be true to the
phenomenological content of auditory perception.</em> It seems quite
reasonable to require that as sounds are the objects of hearing,
whatever they are should be somewhat revealed in hearing. In point of
fact, there are two ways in which the fidelity to auditory content
requirement can enter the arguments. In a strong version (O'Callaghan
2002) it may be held that no theory of sounds “should make the
fact of location perception a wholesale illusion” (p. 5); hence,
as sounds are represented as located, it would follow that they are
correctly so represented. It may be argued that this principle is too
strong because it is unjustifiedly specific. Why should location, among
all possible features of sounds, be protected against the possibility
of systematic illusion?</p>

<p>

In another, weaker version (Casati and Dokic 1994) it is the
representational power of auditory content that is appealed to.
Auditory experience has the power to represent sounds, and it has the
power to represent movement (as when one hears the sound of a moving
train's whistle). It is then natural to assume that auditory
experience would be able to represent sounds as moving, if sounds were
indeed moving entities by their nature. But such is not the case; hence
auditory experience correctly represents them as firmly located. This
construal of the requirement is compatible with the existence of
systematic, though possibly selective, illusion.</p>

<p>

The requirement of fidelity to auditory content may be challenged on
a number of grounds. First, it may be challenged by opposing its
rationale. Auditory content may well be massively illusory, and this
could be just the price to pay for any realist account of sounds.</p>

<p>

Possibly there is here an analogue to the case of colors, in which
there is room for selective illusion and for the choice between realism
about location, say, and realism about hue. Most arguments for the
subjectivity of colors start from the existence of strong correlations
between phenomenal hue structures (such as the relation of
complementarity between colors, e.g. red and green, which is manifest
in phenomena such as afterimages or color-blindness) and neural
structures (such as bipolar cells). These arguments then stress the
absence of physical correlates for hue structure (nothing in the
wavelengths corresponding to red and green hues can make one predict
the subjective complementarity between red and green). They finally
conclude that colors are mind-dependent. However, the arguments only
establish the mind-dependence of hue structures, not of colors per se.
The location of colors as “outside the brain” can still be taken for
granted. Brought back to sounds, this form of selective realism would
allow for subjective tonal qualities and for an external (non proximal)
location of sounds.</p>

<p>

Second, the requirement of fidelity to auditory content may be
challenged by questioning the phenomenological claim that motivates it.
The move would consist in suggesting that sounds do not have the strong
spatial property of locatedness, but the weaker property of
directionality. The distinction between two senses of
‘locatedness’ in relation to sounds can be traced back to
Malpas (1965), based on ordinary language arguments, and is echoed in
Urmson (1968) and Hacker (1987:102 ff.); cf. O'Shaughnessy (1957).
Locatedness in the strong sense specifies an address for the sound,
e.g., by specifying both directionality and distance from the hearer
(thus including egocentrical directionality as a component), or by
locating sounds in allocentric space (e.g. a siren from the boat at
Pier 3). According to a weaker sense of ‘locatedness', sounds would
only be perceived as “coming from” a certain direction,
without any information about the distance they travel. Now surely this
is not the general case. Although in some cases (e.g. the decrease in
amplitude of a sine wave) it may be difficult or impossible to tell,
say, whether what we hear is a soft sound nearby or a loud sound far
away, in most cases the distinction is perfectly available to the
subject, as we noticed earlier when we introduced the notion of distal
volume: someone screaming in a distance is never confused with someone
speaking low near you ear. Indeed the issue of the locatedness of
sounds is the subject matter of specialized branches of cognitive
science (Blauert 1974; Bregman 1994.)</p>

<p>

Incidentally, claiming that sounds are heard in a direction rather
than at a location mixes up two ways of accounting for auditory
experience: phenomenology on the one hand and commonsense reflections
on the directional transmission of auditory information on the other
hand. The commonsense picture may have been made a bit too
sophisticated by exposure to some physical accounts of sounds.</p>

<h4>2.3.4 Defending the Wave Theory: Giving Up Fidelity to Auditory Content</h4>

<p>

Wave theorists typically give up the requirement that an account of
sound be faithful to auditory content (although they would not
typically acknowledge this; as Pasnau 1999 has remarked, the very same
textbook on sounds may simultaneously endorse a medial, a proximal and
a distal theory). However, wave theorists may also try to reconcile
auditory content with the wave conception. Sorensen (2007) proposes for
instance that it is not a purely auditory phenomenon that we do
sometimes identify and localize objects and events at their
<em>center</em>, whenever a center is available . For instance
earthquakes are <em>localized</em> (in the epistemic sense) at their
hypocenter , although it is admitted that they are not <em>located</em>
at their hypocenter. An earthquake is everywhere it can be felt or
measured. Analogously, according to the wave theorist sounds are waves
in a medium, but they are located at their center (at their origin).
The wave conception considers as relatively benign the error of
locating a sound (i.e., a sound wave) at its center/origin.</p>

<p>

An important dialectical limitation of Sorensen’s suggestion
is that it does not provide us with an independent argument in favor of
the Wave Theory. The identification of sounds with sound waves is of
course compatible with the fact that we locate sounds at a point (the
sounding object’s location) which happens to be the center of
expanding sound waves. However, the analogy with the localization of
earthquakes breaks down at a crucial point. Of course, we can usefully
identify a certain region <em>as</em> the center of a particular
earthquake. (In general, earthquakes can be localized at their
hypocenter only when we have at least a rough representation of their
full extension in space.) By contrast, as Sorensen admits, the auditory
system does not identify the sounding object’s location
<em>as</em> the center of expanding sound waves. Indeed, it does not
identify this location as the center of anything. (Compare the way the
visual system identifies the landing area of a stone thrown in water as
the center of a series of concentric, expanding waves. None of the sort
is available to the auditory system.) Now many entities other than
sound waves are at the object’s location when we hear a sound,
including events (monadic or relational, as we shall see below). Thus,
facts about the apparent location of sounds do not justify the Wave
Theory better than the Event Theory; quite the contrary, given our
other independent considerations against the former approach.</p>

<h4>2.3.5 Source medium and environment medium</h4>

<p>

Several among the previous remarks jointly point to the necessity of
better accounting for the distinction between events in the sounding
thing and events in the surrounding medium. As for sounds, this
distinction is consequent upon the distinction between two kinds of
medium: the source medium (that is, the stuff the thing is composed of)
and the medium proper or environment medium, surrounding the sounding
thing, the one in which the hearer could be immersed as well. Let us
take them in turn. First, a thing is a sounding entity only insofar the
stuff or the stuffs the thing is composed of is or are vibrating. For a
simple example, there are no properties of a tuning fork which account
for its sounding, which are not properties of the stuff(s) the fork
consists of (including shape). A more complex example is
the case of the flute, in which the “sounding object” is air inside the
flute. In both cases a portion of matter – the source medium
– is vibrating.</p>

<p>

But, second, do we ever happen to hear events in the medium? We
actually do, but in a somewhat indirect way. Consider the visual realm.
In some cases both a thing and (a part of) a medium between us and the
thing are seen. This happens when we look at things through irregularly
warmed air, or through moving water. In these cases, we see both the
thing and the medium, the thing in an unclear way, and the medium as
that which makes the thing appear in an unclear way.</p>

<p>

But these cases are not the norm. Perceptual media are in the norm
cognitively transparent: they are imperceptible insofar as they
transmit without significant alteration information about some relevant
properties of the thing perceived through them. Media become
perceivable when this transmitting function is impaired by some event
or disturbance occurring in them. Auditorily, this occurs in the case
of the Doppler effect. The vibration of the air carries information
both about the sounding object and about the effect its speed has on
the medium.</p>

<p>

The affectedness of the medium is a feature which is mostly evident,
and almost pervasive in the case of sounds, because of the relatively
similar size of the phenomena involved at the source and in the medium
proper. Vibrations in the sounding objects are macroscopic phenomena,
of a size which is fairly comparable to the size of the sounding object
itself. Therefore the interaction of these vibrations with the
surrounding medium can easily be a source of misperception, for their
impact on the medium brings about processes which are of the same order
of magnitude of the object involved.</p>

<h2><a name="DisTheSou">3. Distal Theories of Sounds</a></h2>

<p>

After proximal and medial theories, one should consider another
candidate for the physical identification of sounds, namely distal
properties, processes or events in the medium inside (or at the surface
of) sounding objects, or in the stuff of the sounding object. Distal
views claim their superiority to non-distal competitors in virtue of
their adherence to the spatial structure of auditory content. As we
have seen, we do hear sounds both as externalized (hence auditory
content is at odds with proximal views) and as distally located (hence
auditory content is at odds with medial views).</p>

<p>

There exist at least four varieties of the distal account of sounds:
the Property Theory, the Located Event Theory, the Relational Event
Theory , and the Dispositional Theory . These account all subscribe to
the idea that sounds are distally located, but they differ in ascribing
to sounds different ontological status. Let us take them in turn.</p>

<h3><a name="SouPro">3.1 Sounds as Properties</a></h3>

<p>

According to the Property View, sounds are properties of material
objects just like colors and shapes.</p>

<p>

The property view is in part endorsed by the founding fathers of
modern philosophy of perception, Galileo and Locke, who opened a
tradition of lumping various sensory items in the class of secondary
qualities. The typical 17th century list of secondary qualities
includes colors, smells and sounds. No significant internal
metaphysical differentiation is made within the class of sensory
qualities, hence the charge of an oversimplification cannot be directly
addressed to historical accounts. Other philosophers may have added
shapes to the list (as Berkeley did), without addressing the issue of
the homogeneity of the class: the issue was only whether shapes are
secondary as sounds are, not whether they are on a par with sounds as
to their structure.</p>

<p>

The Property View has contemporary endorsers (Pasnau 1999; although
Pasnau takes sounds to be properties like colors, he comes close to the
event view when he writes, p. 316, that sounds “either are the
vibrations of [objects that have sounds], or supervene on those
vibrations”; indeed Pasnau 2007 rejoined the Event Theory).</p>

<p>

The property view faces a number of objections. First, we ordinarily
describe objects as “having” colors or shapes, but we do
not ordinarily describe sources as “having sounds”.</p>

<p>

Rather, we say that they make or produce sounds (conversely, a red
table does not “produce” or “make” red). This is an ordinary language
argument, and as such it might not be very strong.</p>

<p>

The main consideration against the Property View is that it
underestimates the important differences between colors and shapes on
the one hand, and sounds on the other hand. The latter, unlike the
former, are dynamic dependent individuals. And even if colors and
shapes can be theoretically conceived as individuals, they are not
dynamic. Sounds take up time. They start and cease. They are
intrinsically temporal entities. Their temporal profile is essential to
individuating them, in a way which has no analogue in the case of
colors and shapes. However, Cohen (2009), although not directly
endorsing the property view, criticizes arguments that conclude to an
asymmetry between sounds and colors, in particular with regard to
temporality.</p>

<h3><a name="SouLocEve">3.2 Sounds as Located Events</a></h3>

<p>

In this and the following section, we shall present two Event
Theories of sounds, for which we use two distinct labels. An earlier
one, The Located Event Theory, was defended by Casati and Dokic (1994)
and has been recently rejoined by Pasnau (2007); the more recent
version, the Relational Event Theory, has received an articulated
defence by O'Callaghan (2007). The two accounts agree on categorizing
sounds as events, that is, located temporal particulars, and diverge on
some specifics of the class of particulars that are admitted to be
sounds. The Relational Event Theory makes sounds depend upon the
existence of a medium that carries information about them. In this
sense, only a subclass of situations involving sounds for the Located
Event Theory are situations involving sounds for the Relational Event
Theory.</p>

<h4>3.2.1 The Located Event Theory</h4>

<p>

According to the Located Event Theory, sounds are events happening
to material objects. They are located at their source, and are
identical with, or at least supervene on, vibration processes in the
source. On this view (Casati and Dokic 1994), auditory perception of
sounds requires a medium which transmits information from the vibrating
object to the ears; however, the transmitting medium is not essential
to the existence of sounds. One can see at once the fit of this view
with those features of sound which were sources of trouble in the cases
discussed above when criticizing proximal and medial theories.</p>

<ol type="a"> 

<li>Vibration processes in the sounding object do
not move any more than sounds appear to.</li>

<li>They do not propagate from the object, as
much as sounds do not appear to.</li>

<li>Distal volume is constant: Like sounds, and
unlike sound waves in the ambient medium, the intensity of vibration
processes can remain the same through a period of time, even if one
distances oneself from the source and hence hears them as less
loud.</li>

<li>Finally, and most importantly, tuning-forks
and other sounding objects can be taken as continuing to vibrate
irrespective of their being or not being immersed in a vibrating
medium. One does not create sounds by surrounding vibrating objects
with a medium— one simply reveals them.</li>

</ol>

<p>

A by-product of the Located Event Theory is that it makes plain what
category sounds belong to, as opposed to views that construe sounds
generically as qualities. Sounds are either instantaneous events or
temporally extended processes. They start and cease. They are
intrinsically temporal entities.</p>

<p>

Another feature of the Located Event Theory is that it
provides us with a clear example of the compatibility of a theory of
non-direct perception, according to which we hear external events by
hearing their perceptual deputies, with a non-phenomenalistic theory,
according to which perceptual deputies are not mental items. The case
of sound perception shows that there can be indirect perception without
mental deputies. We hear coaches and telephones by hearing their
sounds, i.e., by hearing some (cluster of) vibratory processes or
events occurring in those objects. Sounds are both physical events and
perceptual deputies.</p>

<h4>3.2.2 Objections to the Located Event Theory</h4>

<p>

We shall now briefly discuss some objections to the identification
proposed by the Located Event Theory, as they allow us to highlight
certain metaphysically interesting features of sounds.</p>

<p> <em>Imprecise Location and Echoes</em>. The first objection
concerns sound location. Even if sounds are heard as located, it could
be held that location is often imprecise or even erroneous, this in
turn depending on — and being explained by — the nature of sound
waves. Here is a relatively common echo example.  Suppose you walk
under the rain, your umbrella open. At some point you enter a building
with a glass roof. Rain drops on the roof, and no longer on your
umbrella. The umbrella attenuates the noise from the roof, which is
reflected by the ground. You hear the raindrops as if they were below
you, and not above you. Erroneous location is here explained by the
path of sound waves.</p>

<p>

The temptation of identifying sounds with sound waves can arise
because of this fact: that sounds can be mislocated in audition. They
can be heard as located in a region which is larger than, or removed
from, the one occupied by a sounding object, a region which it is
reasonable to take as being occupied by sound waves.</p>

<p>

This example poses no particular threat to the distal view. Consider
again a visual analogy. Seeing an object in a mirror is not seeing
another, immaterial object located in an immaterial space beyond the
mirror-plane. There is no such immaterial object; we see one and the
only material object, and we locate it incorrectly as if it was behind
the mirror.</p>

<p>

The mirror sophism should be credited to Hobbes' Leviathan (Hobbes
1651, I, I; cf. Casati and Dokic 1994, p. 49–51), which explicitly
linked perception in a mirror and perception of echoes:</p>

<blockquote>

The cause of sense, is the external body, or object, which
presseth the organ proper to each sense, either immediately, as in the
taste and touch; or mediately, as in seeing, hearing, and smelling;
which pressure, by the mediation of the nerves, and other strings and
membranes of the body, continued inwards to the brain and hearth,
causeth there a resistance, or counter-pressure, or endeavour of the
earth to deliver itself, which endeavour, because outward, seemeth to
be some matter without. And this seeming, or fancy, is that which men
call sense; and consisteth, as to the eye, in a light, or colour
figured; to the ear, in a sound…if those colours and sounds were
in the bodies, or objects that cause them, they could not severed by
them, as by glasses, and in echoes by reflection, we see they are;
where we know the thing we see is in one place, the appearance in
another.</blockquote>

<p>

The deviant paths of sound waves (in echoes) is responsible for the
perceptual difficulty in locating sounds, much as the deviant path of
light rays (in mirrors) is responsible for the analogous difficulty for
visible objects (Casati and Dokic 1994. See also O'Callaghan 2007 for a
lengthy discussion of echoes). But it is not the case that sound waves
are sounds just because of their responsibility. From the fact that a
subject hears something as imperfectly located, it does not follow that
she hears something which is imperfectly located.</p>

<p><em>Doppler Effect</em>.  The second objection concerns typical
acoustical effects, like the Doppler effect, which are perfectly
accounted for by appealing to (medial) sound waves. The Doppler effect
is a shift in frequency of the sound heard by an observer who moves
relative to the sound source. As waves in the direction of movement
are compressed, and waves in the opposite direction are expanded, the
frequency drops dramatically when the hearer and the source go past
each other. Such explanations of the Doppler effect are harmless for a
distal account. The Doppler effect is dependent on something going on
in the medium, but this should not allow one to conclude that what we
hear are sound waves in the medium.  The situation can be described as
follows in a way that is relatively uncommitting: When we hear sounds
as undergoing the Doppler effect, we do not hear anything different
from a vibration process in a sounding object, a process which is
heard in a sort of perspectival shortening because the movement of the
sounding object causes, among other things, the Doppler effect.</p>

<p>

As a matter of fact, the objection could be turned on its head. On a
train passing by, a trumpet player is delivering a concert. According
to the distal view, the melody does not change, it is just perceived as
changing. If we repeated the experience a number of times, we would
find it suspect that the melody's key drops only when the train passes
by. Surely, we would infer, there is something wrong with the medium
that blocks our perception of the true melody. And surely the train
passengers would disconfirm our impression: they do not hear any key
drop. The medial theory here indeed predicts that there are two
melodies, the one that we hear from the platform, and the one the
passengers hear.</p>

<p><em>Properties of Sounds</em>. A third objection is as
follows. “Sounds are phenomenologically high or low (they have high or
low pitch). But processes in objects cannot be high or low. Therefore
sounds are not processes in objects.” This can be answered in the
following way. Notice first that sound waves fare no better on this
objection—they cannot literally be said to be high or low. But a
more substantial answer is available. What one needs is a way of
systematically correlating predicates like ‘…is
high’, ‘…is higher than…’ to processes
in sounding objects. It is likely that a high sound corresponds to a
quickly vibrating process, and so forth.</p>

<p><em>The Causal Link</em>. A fourth objection has it that “surely
there are sound waves in the ambient medium, otherwise no causal link
could be set between the sounding object and our perception of the
latter.” And such sound waves can certainly be measured and physically
described. Now there is no point in denying that there are sound waves
in the ambient medium: of course there are, and they are causally
responsible for our aural perceptions when these are perceptions of
anything at all. A defender of the Located Event Theory ought to just
contend that such sound waves are not what we hear.</p>

<p>

Consider an analogy we discussed before. Light is causally
responsible for your perception of an object's surface. But this does
not make you see the light when you see the surface. We can see
luminescent sources, but never light in itself: in order to be seen,
light should have to emit light carrying information about it.</p>

<p><em>Space Filling Sounds?</em>. Finally, another objection concerns
the alleged meaningful use of expressions such ‘the sound fills
the room’, ‘sounds fill the room’. It seems that
what makes these sentences true is best found in the spreading of
sound waves, which could actually be everywhere in the room. But one
should not be too much impressed by idioms. ‘The sound fills the
room’ does not describe any phenomenological fact which is
different from the fact that the sound is audible from any place in
the room (in this respect sounds are unlike fog, which can literally
be seen to fill a room).</p>

<p>

However, this point deserves closer attention. For sometimes sounds
do seem to fill space. Thunders seem to. This is a case in which the
only vibrating entity is the medium. Nonetheless this case too can be
accommodated by the Located Event Theory: what we hear is sudden
heating of air due to the electric discharge, whose impact is
confusedly propagated by the medium. A portion of air (the portion that
is suddenly heated up) is the vibrating object and another portion is
the transmitting medium.</p>

<h3>3.2.3 The Relational Event Theory</h3>

<p>

According to the Relational Event Theory, sounds are events which
involve both the source and the surrounding medium. They are relational
rather than “monadic” events. (The distinction between monadic and
relational events is not to be taken as cast in iron, since the latter
can be reduced to the former by making the mereological sum of sources
and surrounding medium the subject of sounds.) O'Callaghan (2002, 2007)
has developed such a view at some length. He notes that the wave
conception of sounds is not the only possible interpretation of
Aristotle's remarks about sounds in <em>On the Soul</em>. Aristotle
writes that “everything which makes a sound does so because
something strikes something else in something else again, and this last
is air”. On O'Callaghan's view, what Aristotle might have meant
is that the sound itself is not a movement of the air, it is rather the
event in which a vibrating object disturbs a surrounding medium and
sets it “moving”. Waves in the medium are not the sounds
themselves, but rather the effects of sounds. According to the
Relational Event Theory, sounds are ‘disturbings' of a medium, hence
depend existentially on a medium that is disturbed and that will
transmit information to a listener. This account differs from the
Located Event Theory insofar as the latter allows for sounds that exist
in a vacuum, and thus distinguishes between a medium that hosts the
vibration and a medium that transmits the vibration.</p>

<p>

The Relational Event Theory shares with medial theories an
endorsement of Berkeley's argument that sounds do not exist in a
vacuuum. It is, in point of fact, a hybrid theory (O'Callaghan 2007, p.
55), sharing with medial theories the tenet of the indispensability of
a medium to the existence of a sound.</p>

<p>

An argument against the Relational Event Theory capitalizes upon the
fact that we have the conceptual resources to distinguish between not
hearing a sound because the sounding object is no longer resonating and
not hearing it because we do not have informational access to the
sounding object anymore. The Relational Event theory faces the risk of
collapsing unto a medial position.</p>

<p>

To develop this line of thought and make it vivid, imagine a vacuum
jar which has the property of immediately creating a vacuum upon
closing the lid, and of immediately recalling air upon opening the lid.
Take now a sounding object like a tuning fork at 440Hz and have it
vibrate, supposing that the vibration fades and becomes inaudible after
10 seconds. What you hear is an A that becomes feebler and feebler
until it disappears. Now, place the tuning fork inside the jar, have it
vibrate as before, and repeatedly open-and-close the lid of the jar,
say once in a bit less than a second. What do you hear? You may have
the feeling that a few short sounds, each feebler than the preceding
one, come into existence and pass away. But you may as well have the
impression of a sound that is <em>revealed</em> by the opening and
closing of the jar. Indeed, the fading of the sound should be audible
from each “window” to the next, implying that there is a single sound
that fades. If sounds were either sound waves in the medium surrounding
the object, or items dependent on the medium as per the Relational
Event Theory, we would be forced to admit that the tuning-fork started
and ceased to sound; because the relevant sound waves would not be
present in the surrounding medium. Only the first impression, that of a
series of short sounds, would be accounted for. But the second
impression, that of a continuous underlying sound that is revealed, is
supported too. A visual analogue of this would be the perception of an
object in the dark, on which light is shed at intervals. We would not
have the impression that the object gets its colors and then loses them
at intervals.</p>

<p>

An advantage of the Relational Event Theory over the Located Event
Theory is that the former provides a criterion for specifying which
among vibratory events at a source are sounds, namely, those that
create medial disturbances that are (or can be) heard. The Located
Event Theorist can, on the one hand, observe that the minimal
requirement of a metaphysics of sounds is to specify which type of
entities are sounds, and not, more specifically, which, among entities
of that type, are sounds. Thus she would claim that sounds are events
at a source, without caring to discuss whether some events at a source
are not sounds. On the other hand, she can observe that too much
fine-grained a classification would create a problem with those events
that share with sounds all interesting metaphysical properties except
for the property of being audible; a problem which, incidentally,
affects a number of physicalist reductions of sounds.</p>

<h3><a name="DisVie">3.3 The Dispositional View</a></h3>

<p>

There are yet other ways to construe sounds under the distal
umbrella. According to dispositional account of sounds, “sounds
are dispositions of objects to vibrate in response to being
stimulated.  Sounds are perceived transiently, but they are not
perceived as being transient and they are not in fact transient”
(Kulvicki 2008b, p.2). The account takes Pasnau’s original
insight that sounds be considered as akin to colors in their being
located features of objects. Indeed, Kulvicki draws a set of analogies
between sounds and colors based on the assumption that colors are
dispositions to reflect light in a certain manner. The analogies
include the fact that as colors exist in the dark (being dispositions)
sounds exist in the vacuum, and that as light waves are a way to get
knowledge of colors, compression waves in a medium are a way to get
knowledge of sounds. To complete the analogy, as “colors give
off light when stimulated by light, objects in a medium give off
compression waves when they are thwacked” (p. 4). More
controversially, “Without vibrating, objects have sounds, but
these sounds cannot be heard” (p. 4).
<em>Thwacking</em> is the key element in the dispositional proposal.
Thwacking <em>reveals</em> sounds. A good thwack (an impulse that
contains all relevant frequencies) is considered to be to sounds what
white light is to colors. White light contains waves of all lengths in
roughly the same proportion and thus samples adequately the
dispositions of the object to reflect some of them. If you lit up a
surface with a monochromatic laser beam at 500nm, the disposition the
surface may have to reflect light of 600nm will not be revealed.
A good thwack makes the object resonate at all frequencies and thus
reveals the vibratory modes of an object by stimulating it at the
frequencies at which it responds better.</p>

<p>

The impulse proposal solves an alleged disanalogy between color and
sound, i.e. the absence of a normative analogon of white light in the
case of sounds (O'Callaghan 2007). White light is normatively
significant for revealing colors; a good impulse is normatively
significant for revealing a sounding disposition.</p>

<p>

Kulvicki’s dispositional theory neatly accounts for some distal
intuitions about sounds. (Other intuitions, such as the idea that
sound have a loudness, are beyond the descriptive power of the theory,
that on that score considers loudness as a property not of the sound,
but of the thwack). In particular it highlights the importance of
action in bringing about auditory information about an object: most
objects sound because we deliberately impart a thwack on them, and in
many cases in which we want to know how an object sounds, we do impart
the thwack, and subtly modulate it. When we hear a sound we get
knowledge of a kind of resistance an object opposes to thwacking; it
is knowledge of an elastic disposition. The account explains the fact
that the more the object reacts, the more it is sonorous. And an
object — say, a guitar string — is “A sharp”
because at that frequency it responds optimally to thwacking.</p>

<p>

Kulvicki’s alleges that an analysis of the phenomenon of sound
constancy, modeled on an analogon to color constancy, militates in
favour of the dispositional view. Colors are notoriously resilient to
many changes of illumination, and even when incident light composition
is very distant from standard light, surfaces may be seen as having
their standard color. “The green grass looks green in the orange
light at dusk, but it looks like green grass illuminated oddly”
(Kulvicky 2008b, p. 9). This is in synch with the likely function of
vision — to inform about distal, stable properties of
surfaces. Analogously, Kulvicki claims, “objects sound roughly
the same whether it is white noise [i.e., an impulse] or something
reasonably far from it that stimulates them” (p.  9). Our
ability to recognize voices across a large variation of ways to
produce them is a case in point. In general, humans are able to
identify sounds in terms of their spectral slopes ans spectral
envelope patterns, which are “fairly constant across changes in
the fundamental frequency produced by the vocal chords”
(p. 10). Now, it can be objected that voices are but a part of the
auditory world, and they are the object of dedicated neural
machinery. More generally, however, sound constancy is exhibited in
hearing objects of various sorts.  “There is no obvious reason
the auditory system should exhibit constancy for something like
spectral slope or envelope pattern, unless the auditory system has the
function of identifying stable properties of objects”
(p. 10). Facts of auditory constancy thus help out the dispositional
theory insofar as the function of the auditory system is to find out
whatever stable property of the environment is heard as being indeed
constant.</p>

<h4>3.3.1 Objections To the Dispositional Theory</h4>

<p>

We shall enlist two objections to the dispositional account.</p>

<p>

A first problem with the dispositional account is that of specifying
what precisely the disposition in question is. An object's disposition
to vibrate at its natural frequencies does not exhaust the
possibilities. “When struck, an object vibrates in an odd but
characteristic fashion for a brief time before it settles into
vibrating at its natural frequencies, if it has any. Like natural
frequencies, these attack patterns are relatively stable dispositions
of objects to vibrate when thwacked. Similarly, objects' vibrations
decay characteristically. Attacks and decays are stable dispositions of
objects to vibrate when thwacked, just as natural frequencies of
vibration are” (Kulvicki 2008b, p. 14).</p>

<p>

Hence there are three dispositions (at least) here: a disposition to
react in the attack mode, a disposition to react in the decay mode, a
disposition to vibrate in a certain way. There are many more. For
instance, a disposition to respond by emitting a certain pattern of
waves when rubbed or when brushed; or when broken. Many are the
dispositions, and the dispositional account should endorse the idea
that many are the (possibly unheard) sounds here. Call this the
many-disposition problem.</p>

<p>

Normativity half-solves the many-disposition problem. Some ways of
imparting energy to an object are more telling than others. By
contrast, light is the sole “thwacker” for colors (modulo differences
in intensity and light spectrum), but there are many twhackers for
eliciting the sonority of an object. The dispositional theory of colors
suffers from some variant of the many-disposition problem. The color of
many objects and stuff depends on their temperature. At 1000 c°,
iron glows. At –20C°, water is white.</p>

<p>

A different problem for the dispositional theory is: What are those
invididuals that we hear when the object sounds? The main problem a
dispositional account of sounds has to face is that even if we accept
that sounds are sound dispositions, there appear prima facie to exist,
on top of those dispositions, the individual, occurrent sounds –
those that last when the disposition is realized. (A similar problem
plagued Chisholm's account of events as repeatable entities: as
Davidson pointed out, any such account should accomodate the problem
of assigning a status to the single occurrences of the repetitions,
which cannot be themselves repeatable items.) Indeed, as Kulvicki
(2008b) notes,“now and again one encounters objects making
sounds they do not have” (p. 8); he dismisses these encounters
as rather exceptional, but no matter their frequency — and radio
listening provides a very common example — the “sound
made”, as distinct from the “sound had”, must be
accommodated by any theory of sounds. Kulvicki addresses the problem
in a general way, by distinguishing between sounds as dispositions and
the hearings of sounds . There are no individual sounds, only episodes
of hearing the dispositional sounds. We do hear sounds, these are the
dispositions, but the impression that sounds last depends on the fact
that our hearing episodes last.</p>

<p>

Kulvicki denies that this account entails an error theory because he
thinks that intuitions are not particularly telling about the
distinction between hearing as an individual event and hearing a sound.
However, a threefold distinction should apply here. Grant the
dispositional sound. Grant hearing episodes. Now, the duration of a
hearing episode is different from the duration of an occurrent sound.
You set a tuning fork in motion. It vibrates for thirty seconds. But
then, after ten seconds, you get bored and block your ears with your
hand. The duration of your hearing is ten seconds. But the sound is
still there, for another twenty seconds. Generally speaking, unheard
sounds are accounted for in the dispositional theory only as unrealized
dispositions. Occurrent unheard sounds are invisible to the
dispositional account.</p>

<h2><a name="AspThe">4. Aspatial Theories</a></h2>

<p>

We divided up existing accounts of sounds according to the spatial
location they assign to sounds. However, there are aspatial theories of
sounds as well. Aspatial theories deny either (i) that sounds are
intrinsically spatial, or (ii) that auditory perception is
intrinsically spatial. Arguably, claim (i) implies claim (ii), but the
converse is not true, which leaves room for an interesting aspatial
theory of auditory perception which nevertheless acknowledges that
sounds have some spatial locations.</p>

<h3><a name="AspSou">4.1 Aspatial Sounds</a></h3>

<p>

We have seen the use of phenomenological arguments against both
medial and proximal theories of sound. To sum them up, one may claim
that, first, auditory experience has a spatial content whereby sounds
seem to be located in egocentric space (to the left, above, in front of
us, etc.). Second, unless one subscribes to an error theory of auditory
experience, sounds are where they are (normally) heard to be, namely at
their sources.</p>

<p>

But are sounds really located in space? There is in the literature a
strong non-locational view of sounds. Strawson has made the
plausibility of a thought-experiment of a purely auditory world rest
upon the tenet of an intrinsic non-spatiality of sounds. (Philosophers
and psychologists such as Lotze (1842: §§ 123–6), Binet
(1905: Ch 3), Heymans (1905: Ch. 1), Stumpf (1907: 29), Wellek (1934),
Révész (1946), Evans (1980: 248 ff.), have investigated
the phenomenology of auditory space and suggested the possibility of a
purely auditory world.) Strawson (1959: 65–66) thus wrote:
“Sounds … have no intrinsic spatial characteristics: such
expressions as ‘to the left of’, ‘spatially
above’, ‘nearer’, ‘farther’ have no
intrinsically auditory significance (…). A purely auditory
concept of space… is an impossibility. The fact that, with the
variegated types of sense-experience which we in fact have, we can, as
we say, ‘on the strength of hearing alone’ assign
directions and distances to sounds, and things that emit or cause them,
counts against this not at all. For this fact is sufficiently explained
by the existence of correlations between the variations of which sound
is intrinsically capable and other non-auditory features of
sense-experience.”</p>

<p>

Strawson designed his thought-experiment in the context of an
analysis of the Kantian claim that the notion of there being objective
entities (entities which do not depend on our perception of them)
involves the notion of space: “[t]he question we are to consider,
then, is this: Could a being whose experience was purely auditory have
a conceptual scheme which provided for objective particulars?”
(p. 66). Thus, he imagined a character (later on called
“Hero” by Evans 1980) who has only non-spatial
auditory experiences. Hero perceives sounds, but he does not perceive
them to be located in physical space. What Strawson tried to show is
that Hero needs an “analogue” to the notion of space in
order to “locate” sounds when they are not actually heard.
This analogue is provided by what Strawson calls a
“master-sound”, namely a constant sound varying in pitch.
Any particular sound is heard against the background of the
master-sound. Thanks to the master-sound, Hero can distinguish between
experiencing the same particular sound again (when its
“location” as provided by the master-sound is the same),
and experiencing successively two particular sounds of the same type
(when they have different “locations” on the master-sound
map). Evans (1980) questioned the claim that the master-sound could
play the role of physical space in grounding the notion of objective
particulars; see also Strawson's (1980) reply to Evans.</p>

<p>

In evaluating Strawson's thought-experiment, we should distinguish
the claim that there can be non-spatial auditory experiences from the
claim that there can be a world populated only with sounds. Strawson's
thought-experiment justifies the former claim, but it does not
obviously lead to the latter. One cannot infer from the fact that we
can perceptually represent a sound without representing its location,
that we can perceptually represent a non-located sound.</p>

<h3><a name="AspAudPer">4.2 Aspatial Auditory Perception</a></h3>

<p>

It is possible to argue that auditory perception is not
intrinsically spatial independently of a commitment to the claim that
sounds do not have spatial locations. This is O'Shaughnessy's view, who
writes that “while we have the auditory experience of hearing
that a sound comes from p, we do not have any experience that it is
here where it now sounds… And this is so for a very interesting
reason: namely, that we absolutely never immediately perceive sounds to
be at any place” (2000: 446). However, O'Shaughnessy does not
draw the conclusion that sounds have no spatial locations. On the
contrary, as we have seen, he defends a proximal account of the
location of sounds, according to which sounds are where hearers, rather
than sources, are.</p>

<p>

O'Shaughnessy would not be impressed by allegedly phenomenological
arguments according to which one normally hears sounds as located at
their sources. One may still have the feeling that his sophisticated
version of proximal theories does not locate sounds where an untutored
description of what is perceived suggests they are. As a consequence,
it appears to be another massive error theory of auditory
perception.</p>

<h3><a name="SouPurEve">4.3 Sounds as Pure Events</a></h3>

<p>

Scruton (2009; see also his 1997) proposes a non-physicalist account
of sounds. He is impressed by the fact that when we hear sounds as
music we (can) hear them as events detached from their physical causes.
He then suggests that sounds are ‘pure events', things that happen but
which don’t happing to anything, and that they are ‘secondary
objects', entities whose nature is bound up with the way we perceive
them.</p>

<p>

One way of reconciling Scruton’s interesting suggestions with
a physicalist account of sounds is to draw a distinction (which of
course should be properly developed) between the ontology we need to
account for our ecological ability to hear sounds in our natural
environment and the ontology we need to account for our (at least
partly acquired) ability to hear sounds as music. Eventually, the
ontology of sounds as music, which Scruton wants to focus on, might be
quite different from the ontology of natural sounds, which can still be
of the physicalist kind.</p>

<h2><a name="Con">5. Conclusion</a></h2>

<p>

We have suggested that a fruitful way to classify the various
accounts of sounds that have been given in the literature is in terms
of their spatial locations. If the sounds we hear have spatial
locations, they can be thought to be located either where the material
sources are (distal theories), or where the hearers are (proximal
theories), or somewhere in between (medial theories). It has also been
denied that sounds have any spatial locations, which gives rise to a
fourth class of theories, aspatial theories. All these theories have
interestingly different phenomenological, epistemological and
metaphysical implications.</p>
