<p>

<em>Epistêmê</em> is the Greek word most often translated
as knowledge, while <em>technê</em> is translated as either
craft or art. These translations, however, may inappropriately harbor
some of our contemporary assumptions about the relation between theory
(the domain of ‘knowledge’) and practice (the concern of
‘craft’ or ‘art’). Outside of modern science,
there is sometimes skepticism about the relevance of theory to
practice because it is thought that theory is conducted at so great a
remove from the facts, the province of practice, that it can lose touch
with them. Indeed, at the level of practice, concrete experience might
be all we need. And within science, theory strives for a value-free
view of reality. As a consequence, scientific theory cannot tell us
how things should be — the realm of ‘art’ or
‘craft’ . So we must turn elsewhere for answers to the
profound, but still practical, questions about how we should live our
lives. However, some of the features of this contemporary distinction
between theory and practice are not found in the relation between
<em>epistêmê</em> and <em>technê</em>. As we move
chronologically from Xenophon to Plotinus, we go from an author who
does not distinguish between the two terms, to an author who has
little use for <em>technê</em> because it is so far from
reality. It is in Aristotle that we find the basis for something like
the modern opposition between <em>epistêmê</em> as pure
theory and <em>technê</em> as practice. Yet even Aristotle
refers to <em>technê</em> or craft as itself also
<em>epistêmê</em> or knowledge because it is a practice
grounded in an ‘account’ — something involving
theoretical understanding. Plato — whose theory of forms seems an
arch example of pure theoretical knowledge — nevertheless is
fascinated by the idea of a kind of <em>technê</em> that is
informed by knowledge of forms.  In the <em>Republic</em> this
knowledge is the indispensable basis for the philosophers' craft of
ruling in the city. Picking up another theme in Plato's dialogues, the
Stoics develop the idea that virtue is a kind of <em>technê</em>
or craft of life, one that is based on an understanding of the
universe. The relation, then, between <em>epistêmê</em>
and <em>technê</em> in ancient philosophy offers an interesting
contrast with our own notions about theory (pure knowledge) and
(experience-based) practice. There is an intimate positive
relationship between <em>epistêmê</em> and
<em>technê</em>, as well as a fundamental contrast.</p>

<div id="main-text">

<h2><a name="1">1. Xenophon</a></h2>

<p>

Xenophon's only sustained discussions of <em>epistêmê</em>
and <em>technê</em> are in two of his Socratic works,
<em>Memorabilia</em> and <em>Oeconomicus</em>. The
<em>Memorabilia</em> recounts conversations which Socrates held on a
variety of topics; the <em>Oeconomicus</em> is a conversation largely
devoted to one, i.e., the art of running a successful estate and
household. In these works, knowledge is intimately tied to knowing how
to do things, especially the more organized kind of knowing-how
designated by <em>technê</em>. There is no distinction between
<em>epistêmê</em> as theoretical knowledge and
<em>technê</em> as mere craft or skill. Socrates explicitly
identifies as <em>technai</em> such activities as playing the harp,
generalship, piloting a ship, cooking, medicine, managing an estate,
smithing, and carpentry; by association with these <em>technai</em>,
we can include housebuilding, mathematics, astronomy, making money,
flute playing, and painting. Without marking any difference, he also
calls many of these activities <em>epistêmai</em>.</p>

<p>

At the beginning of <em>Memorabilia</em>, Xenophon, in fact,
portrays Socrates as uninterested in the abstract investigations of the
physical philosophers. Socrates, he says, eschewed the investigation of
the <em>kosmos</em>; he preferred looking into human affairs. Besides,
humans cannot understand the universe, as shown by the inability of
those who engage in these kinds of study to agree (I.i.11-14). In fact,
towards the end of the work, Xenophon says that Socrates held that the
study of geometry should be pursued to the point where one could
measure a parcel of land he meant to buy; study of more complicated
figures he disparaged because he did not see the use of it (IV.vii.3).
If after this introduction we did not expect to find a very great
difference between <em>epistêmê</em> and
<em>technê</em>, we would not be disappointed.</p>

<p>

Almost all occurrences of the word
‘<em>epistêmê</em>’ show its close connection
to skill, practice, and <em>technê</em>. In a jocular vein,
Critoboulos says he wants to gain the knowledge
(<em>epistêmê</em>) which will allow him to win over those
with good souls and beautiful bodies (II.vi.30). Socrates compares the
knowledge (<em>epistêmê</em>) of justice to the knowledge
of letters (IV.ii.20). As well, the verb <em>epistasthai</em> —
the root of <em>epistêmê</em> — carries the sense of
knowing how to do something. The stronger know how to use
(<em>chrêsthai</em>) the weaker like slaves (II.i.12-13). If one
does not know how to pilot (<em>kubernân</em>) a ship — a
<em>technê</em> — both he and his ship will be lost
(II.vi.38).  One must learn the crafts (<em>technai</em>) of war from
one who knows them (<em>epistamenon</em>) (II.i.28). Socrates says
that some of the sub-skills of generalship — which elsewhere he
calls a <em>technê</em> — come by nature and others come
through knowledge (<em>epistêmê</em>) (III.i.6-7). The
difference is between what is not acquired and what is acquired; but
we find no distinction — as in Plato — between what is
acquired by teaching and what is acquired by training. Thus Xenophon
does not make the Platonic distinction between theoretical instruction
and learning by practice (cf. <em>Meno</em> 70a-b).</p>

<p>

Socrates emphasizes that learning an <em>epistêmê</em>
— what we would call a field of knowledge — entails care,
diligence, and practice. He says that idleness does not put knowledge
worthy of mention into the soul; one must also have care or diligence
(<em>epimeleia</em>) for doing fine and good deeds (II.i.20). Free men
(actually gentlemen farmers) who are not idle but exercise diligence
in those useful things they understand are happiest; work and
application help men to learn what they need to know and to remember
what they learn (II.vii.7-8). Near the beginning of the
<em>Memorabilia</em>, Socrates argues against those who say that a
just man can never become unjust. Rather, he says, those who do not
train the soul cannot carry out the functions of the soul
(I.ii.19-20). Since acquiring and keeping them is a question of
practice and diligence, the knowledge in these contexts is craft and
skill.</p>

<p>

The practical bent of Xenophon's Socrates can even be seen in his
definition of each of the virtues. Saying that those who know what each
virtue is can expound these to others, he gives definitions for the
virtues. A pious man, for instance, knows the laws respecting the
worship of the gods and thus worships the gods lawfully; and, in
general, the man who knows what is lawful with respect to the gods is
pious (IV.vi.1-4). The pious man, then, is defined by informed
religious practice. The most abstract definition is that of wisdom,
which Socrates says is the same thing as knowledge
(<em>epistêmê</em>). Next he cautions that no one can know
all things; so a person is wise to the extent that he knows (IV.vi.7).
Knowledge, then, can be accumulated. Since knowledge is divided into
various skills, such as managing an estate and generalship, and their
subdivisions, the wise man would appear to be someone who acquires as
much of this kind of knowledge as possible. If so, he is a person of
wide accomplishments, not someone with a theory about the universe.</p>

<p>

Throughout the <em>Memorabilia</em>, Xenophon weaves the theme of
the craft of ruling (<em>basilikê technê</em>). It is the
finest of virtues and <em>technai</em>, by which men, public and
private, become capable of ruling and benefiting other men and
themselves (IV.ii.11). Kings and rulers are not simply those who are
chosen but those who know how to rule. In this regard they are compared
to others who exercise a <em>technê</em>, such as ship's pilots
(III.ix.10-11). A good king does not just look out after his own life
but also that of the ones he rules and he is the cause of their
happiness (III.ii.2-3). Although it is suggested that Socrates
identifies the royal <em>technê</em> with happiness, it also
entails a certain amount of physical suffering, apparently associated
with the duties of a king (II.i.17).</p>

<p>

In the <em>Oeconomicus</em>, Socrates uses knowledge
(<em>epistêmê</em>) and craft (<em>technê</em>)
interchangeably to refer to the practical undertakings of a gentleman,
called in Greek <em>kalos k'agathos</em> — literally one who is fine
and good. He opens the work with the question whether estate management
(<em>oikonomia</em>) is the name of a type of knowledge
(<em>epistêmê</em>) like medicine, smithing, and carpentry.
Then he asks whether he and his interlocutor can say what the function
(<em>ergon</em>) of estate management is, just as we can say what are
the functions of these other <em>technai</em> (I.1-2). When he uses
<em>epistêmê</em> in what follows, the focus of his
discussion is some aspect of estate or household management. He refers
indifferently to the knowledge (<em>epistêmê</em>) and the
craft (<em>technê</em>) of estate management and of farming; the
latter includes sub-skills such as breeding stock (V.3) casting seed
(XVII.7) and the planting of trees (XIX.1). However, there is a
distinction between illiberal arts (<em>banausikai technai</em>) and
those worthy of a gentleman. The latter are the craft of war
(<em>polemikê</em> <em>technê</em>) and that of farming
(<em>geôrgia</em>). The illiberal arts confine one to the
workshop and narrow one's interests to his own welfare; the crafts of
war and farming give one a wider scope so that he can attend to his
friends and city (IV.2-4; VI.5-9). In fact, farming is the mother and
nurse of the other <em>technai</em> (V.17). However, knowledge by
itself is not sufficient to prosper. There are those who have the
knowledge and resources to increase their estates but are unwilling to
do so (I.16). Others, like Socrates' respondent Critoboulos, might gain
such knowledge but do not have the wealth necessary to make use of it
(II.11-13). Still, Socrates says, knowledge is not sufficient to profit
but one also needs care and diligence in order to put his knowledge
into effect (XX.2-6). This unused knowledge is not untried theory but
neglected skill.</p>

<h2><a name="2">2. Plato</a></h2>

<p>

In Plato's dialogues the relation between knowledge
(<em>epistêmê</em>) and craft or skill
(<em>technê</em>) is complex and surprising. There is no general
and systematic account of either but rather overlapping treatments,
reflecting the context of different dialogues.  Nevertheless, Plato
emphasizes certain characteristics of both that demonstrate a
sustained and consistent engagement with the two concepts.</p>

<p>

Throughout the dialogues characters frequently cite
<em>technê</em> as a way of illustrating important points in
their philosophical conversations.  Some crafts mentioned are
medicine, horsemanship, huntsmanship, oxherding, farming, calculation,
geometry, generalship, piloting a ship, chariot-driving, political
craft, prophecy, music, lyre-playing, flute-playing, painting,
sculpture, housebuilding, shipbuilding, carpentry, weaving, pottery,
smithing, and cookery. Each of these activities is associated with the
word t<em>echnê</em>, e.g., medicine with the <em>iatrikê
technê</em>. Each is also associated with a practitioner, e.g.,
medicine with a physician (<em>iatros</em>). Other crafts are
mentioned but without practitioners, e.g., arithmetic, flute-making,
and sorcery. Socrates uses medicine much more than any other
<em>technê</em>; other crafts repeatedly mentioned, albeit less
frequently than medicine, are house-building, weaving, political
craft, music, shoemaking, piloting a ship, generalship, prophecy,
carpentry, farming, horsemanship, flute-playing. To our contemporary
ears this list is quite various; it is hard to think that they all
have any interesting characteristics in common. Such crafts, or
<em>technai</em>, as farming and building have concrete, inanimate
products. Horse training and huntsmanship care for animate but
non-human beings. Medicine cares for the health of humans.
Calculation has neither a concrete product nor does it provide
care.</p>

<p>

In some dialogues, craft
(<em>technê</em>) and knowledge (<em>epistêmê</em>)
seem interchangeable in much the same way as in Xenophon's Socratic
dialogues. In the <em>Charmides</em> (165c) Socrates says that
medicine, i.e., the physician's craft (<em>iatrikê
technê</em>), is the knowledge (<em>epistêmê</em>) of
health. In <em>Euthydemus</em> (281a) Socrates says that what guides
right use of materials in carpentry is the knowledge of carpentry
(<em>techtonikê</em> <em>epistêmê</em>). In
<em>Ion</em> (532c) Socrates tells the rhapsode Ion that he is not able
to talk about Homer with craft and knowledge. In <em>Protagoras</em>
(356d-e) Socrates refers to measuring as both a craft and a kind of
knowledge.</p>

<p>

However, Plato's interest in <em>technê</em> is not innocent.
He uses the notion as a way of explicating central themes, such as
virtue, ruling, and the creation of the cosmos.  As a consequence, he
develops a complex account of <em>technê</em>. First of all, a
craft has a function (<em>ergon</em>); this is what it
characteristically does or what it characteristically accomplishes.
In fact, crafts are differentiated by their specific functions
(<em>erga</em>)(<em>Rep.</em> 346a).  A similar idea is assumed in the
exchange between Dionysiodorus and Socrates (<em>Euthydemus</em>
301c), as it is by Socrates in <em>Euthyphro</em> (13d) and
<em>Ion</em> (537c).  While the <em>ergon</em> of a craft is its goal,
the goal is frequently identified with a result separate from the
activity of the craft.  In the <em>Euthydemus</em> (291e) the goal
(<em>ergon</em>) of medicine is health just as food is the goal
(<em>ergon</em>) of farming.  When in the <em>Charmides</em> (165e)
Critias denies that calculation has an <em>ergon</em>, in the way that
a house is the <em>ergon</em> of building or a garment of weaving,
Socrates answers that nevertheless calculation is about the odd and
the even.  His answer suggests the possibility of a
<em>technê</em> whose goal is not a separate result — an
idea to be found in the <em>Statesman</em>. Still in the
<em>Gorgias</em> (453e-454a) Socrates argues that calculation produces
as its <em>ergon</em> persuasion about the amount of the odd and the
even — a result separate from the activity of calculation.</p>

<p>

   As the concept of <em>technê</em> develops, the role of
reflective knowledge is emphasized.  Whereas <em>technê</em> is
associated with knowing how to do (<em>epistasthai</em>) certain
activities, <em>epistêmê</em> sometimes indicates a
theoretical component of <em>technê</em>.  Then it is associated
with understanding (<em>gnôsis</em>). On the one hand, the
physician knows how to care for the sick (<em>Rep</em>. 342d), to
prescribe a regimen (<em>Rep</em>. 407d), to provide for the advantage
of the body (<em>Rep</em>. 341e), to make someone healthy
(<em>Charm</em>. 174c), to make someone vomit (<em>Laws</em> 933b). On
the other, the physician knows or recognizes
(<em>gignôskein</em>) health by medical knowledge
(<em>epistêmê</em>) (<em>Charm.</em> 170c). Since health
is the goal of the medical craft, the physician understands the goal
of the craft. Plato emphasizes this knowledge as a distinct aspect of
the craftsman's skill. Sometimes this aspect is theoretical in the
root sense of <em>theôria</em> — looking.  In the
<em>Cratylus</em> (389a-b) Socrates talks about the carpenter who
makes the weaver's shuttle; he looks to (<em>blepôn</em>)
something whose nature is to weave. This latter seems to be a material
model because Socrates supposes what would happen if it were to
break. In that case, the carpenter looks to the form (<em>eidos</em>)
of shuttle, that which is shuttle (<em>ho estin kerkis</em>). In the
<em>Gorgias</em> (503d-e) all craftsmen work not at random but look
toward the goal of their craft (<em>ergon</em>) so that what each
produces will have a certain form. Socrates cites painters,
housebuilders, and shipbuilders. In <em>Republic</em> VI Socrates
compares philosophers who are rulers to painters who look to a model
(484c).</p>

<p>

The theoretical aspect is also expressed as articulate reasoning about
the goal.  In Plato's view, the ability to explain why he does what he
does is one of the most important characteristics of craft.  In the
<em>Charmides</em>, Socrates says that we test the physician by
questioning him since he understands health (<em>Charm.</em>
170e5-7). Expanding on the idea of testing, Socrates says they will
investigate the physician in what he says and in what he does, on
whether what he says is true and whether what he does is right
(171b7-9). This theoretical side of craft is further developed in the
<em>Gorgias</em>. In his conversation with Polus and later in his
conversation with Callicles, Socrates carries on a sustained
reflection about craft. In his conversation with Polus, Socrates
distinguishes four crafts (<em>technai</em>: medicine, physical
training, judging, and legislating; the first pair are concerned with
the body and the latter with the soul (464b). These crafts provide
their care always for the best, either of the body or of the soul
(464c). Unlike empiric practice (<em>empeiria</em>),
<em>technê</em> has an account to give by which it provides the
things it provides, an account of what their nature is, so that it can
say the cause of each (465a). In the conversation with Callicles,
Socrates returns to this account, when he seems especially interested
in the ability of <em>technê</em> to give an account. He says
medical <em>technê</em> investigates the nature of the thing it
cares for (<em>therapeuei</em>) and the cause of what it does and has
an account to give of each of them (501a). The context shows that what
medicine cares for is health, so it has an account to give of health,
which is the cause of its actions.</p>

<p>

So far then, a craft is defined by its goal and is a kind of
knowledge. Fully developed, this knowledge is knowing how to
accomplish a goal on the basis of an understanding of the goal; the
understanding can be articulated in an account. The account informs
and guides the skilled practice. A craftsman's being able to
articulate the goal is most fully developed, perhaps, in the
<em>Laws</em>. The Athenian Stranger describes the distinction between
the slave doctor and the doctor of free men as resting on the ability
to give an account. The slave doctor relies on experience
(<em>empeiria</em>) and has no account to give for his procedure. The
free doctor not only has an account, he communicates it to his
patients as a way of eliciting their cooperation in the course of
treatment (720 b-d). Presumably, the patients come to appreciate the
reasons for the actions the doctor undertakes as well as the regimen
he prescribes because they better understand the nature of health and
the way the treatments produce health. In fact, the empiric doctor
laughs at the free doctor for instructing his patients — as
though he were trying to make them into doctors themselves (857
d-e).</p>

<p>

There is a second feature of <em>technê</em> that is vital for
understanding its importance to Plato.  In the <em>Gorgias</em>,
<em>technê</em> is distinguished from <em>empeiria</em> not only
by its ability to give an account but also because it seeks the
welfare of its object.  The physician and the physical trainer seek
the welfare of the body, just as the judge and the legislator seek the
welfare of the soul (464c).  These features of <em>technê</em>
figure in one of Plato's persistent themes, the knowledge needed to
rule the city.  One of its most important occurrences is in the
<em>Republic</em>, where Socrates characterizes ruling as a kind of
<em>technê</em> that looks out after the welfare of the city
(<em>Rep.</em> 342e).  But in other dialogues as well, the authentic
ruler has a knowledge, both practical and theoretical, that allows him
to achieve what is good for the city.  In fact, the passage just cited
from the <em>Laws</em> is part of an analogy to explain why the
legislator should be able to explain to the citizens the reasons
behind the law.</p>

<p>

Indeed, most accounts of knowledge in the dialogues are carried out in
the context of such discussions. Even in the <em>Theaetetus</em>, the
dialogue most often thought of as dedicated to epistemology, we find
the same theme. When he argues against Protagoras' relativism,
Socrates gets the sophist to concede that some people are wiser than
others when it comes to what is good for the city (167c-d). Socrates
then seizes upon an analogy with medicine. While each person may be
the final authority for himself when it comes to what is hot, dry, and
sweet for him, in matters of health and disease not everyone knows the
healthy for himself nor is he able to cure himself. Just so, while
Protagoras may hold that for each city what is fine or base, just or
unjust, pious or impious is what the city takes it to be, what is
really advantageous for the city is not the same as what it takes to
be advantageous (171e - 172b). Although Socrates' investigation of
knowledge becomes more abstract when he introduces being, not-being,
likeness and unlikeness, identity and difference, unity and plurality,
to this group he adds the fine and the base, the good and the bad
(185c-186a). The soul itself investigates these things, trying to
determine their being (<em>ousia</em>) and their opposition to one
another and the being of that opposition. Finally, the investigation
of being, non-being and the other opposites — including the fine
and the base, the good and the bad — also reflects both on the
being of each and on its usefulness (<em>pros te ousian kai
ôpheleian</em>) (186c).While Socrates does not explain what
reflecting on their usefulness amounts to, the remark shows a link,
however slight, to the original motivation for the investigation of
knowledge— i.e., providing what is really advantageous for the
city.</p>

<p>

Nevertheless, these passages from the <em>Theaetetus</em> raise an
important issue. Knowledge of the forms tends to become an end in
itself; and in this way the idea of knowledge as pure theory begins to
make an appearance in the dialogues. This tension is also prominent in
the <em>Republic</em>, of course, where Socrates introduces and
develops the notion that rulers should be philosophers, who are defined
by their knowledge of forms. At the beginning of the discussion of
philosophical rulers in <em>Republic</em> IV, knowledge and craft fall
into a familiar pattern of interchangeability. After defining the three
classes in the city, Socrates is looking for the knowledge
(<em>epistêmê</em>) in virtue of which the city is
well-counseled. He dismisses the crafts of carpentry, smithing, and
farming — obviously crafts and called <em>epistêmai</em>
(428b-c). While these focus on some partial good for the city, the
<em>epistêmê</em> of ruling takes counsel for the city as a
whole and what is best for it internally and externally (428 b-d).
Then, in <em>Republic</em> V, Socrates introduces an altogether
different notion of the knowledge that philosophers will have — one
whose object is forms. Indeed this passage defines for most readers
Plato's idea of <em>epistêmê</em>.</p>

<p>

Knowledge (<em>epistêmê</em>) is the ability to know the
real as it is (477b). The context shows that when Socrates talks about
the real, he is referring to the forms. In the <em>Republic</em>, the
prominent forms are the forms for the beautiful, the good, and the
just. In the <em>Symposium</em>, Socrates describes the form of the
beautiful as neither coming to be nor passing away, as not changing in
any other way, as never being or even appearing to anyone as anything
but beautiful (211a-b). Since an analogous description applies to the
good and the just, one can see that forms are very different from the
sorts of things we experience through the sensory perception
associated with the usual <em>technai</em>. After forms are introduced
in the <em>Republic</em>, they are the objects of the most abstract
and highest knowledge, afforded by the power of dialectic.  At the end
of Book VI, Socrates uses the words for knowledge that we have found
in other contexts— understanding (<em>gnôsis</em>) and
knowledge (<em>epistêmê</em>). However, in the Divided
Line passage a new vocabulary is introduced, as though the conception
of knowledge has changed in a fundamental way. As he has in other
places, Socrates divides the visible world (<em>horaton</em>) from the
intelligible (<em>noêton</em>). Whereas before the intelligible
had been the undivided field of <em>gnôsis</em> and
<em>epistêmê</em>, now it is subdivided into the fields of
mathematical or deductive reasoning (<em>dianoia</em>) and the
grasping of the unhypothetical beginning point (<em>nous</em>). The
latter is the goal of dialectic (511a-b).</p>

<p>

Still, it would be wrong to think of <em>technê</em> and
<em>epistêmê</em> as becoming separated from one another.
Even though <em>epistêmê</em> is tied to forms, it still
has a role in <em>technê</em>. In fact, at the beginning of
<em>Republic</em> VI, Socrates gives his interlocutors a peculiar
description of what the philosopher will do with this knowledge of
reality. Converting Socrates' negative description of the
non-philosopher, we find that the philosopher has a knowledge
(<em>gnôsis</em>) of the reality of each form, thus a clear
paradigm in his soul. Like painters, philosophers look to
(<em>apoblepontes</em>) the truest paradigm, always referring to it
and contemplating it as accurately as possible; in this way they
establish here the laws respecting the fine, the just, and the good,
if there is need to establish them, or take care to preserve those
that are established (484c-d). By comparing philosophers to painters
who imitate a paradigm, Socrates is giving to the knowledge of forms a
role within a kind of craft which imitates forms. This notion of
imitating forms is an important one for Plato; he uses it again in the
account of creation in the <em>Timaeus</em>. At 28a, the Demiurge
— the craftsman of the universe — looking at
(<em>blepôn</em>) that which does not change and using it as a
paradigm, fashions its form and power into his creation. In the
subsequent passage we learn that this unchanging paradigm is the
intelligible animal that contains all other intelligible animals
(30c-d).</p>

<p>

Later in <em>Republic</em> VI there is a connection — of a
different sort— between <em>technê</em> and
<em>epistêmê</em>.  Knowledge, in the sense of
<em>epistêmê</em>, will be deductive and logical, like
mathematics; unlike mathematics, its deductions will be based on
foundations that need no further justification. In part it will be
something like mathematical deduction based in fundamental
reality. Two aspects of this development are significant. First, using
a mathematical model as the root of this conception of knowledge makes
it purely theoretical; it is theoretical because, like calculation in
the <em>Charmides</em> (165e), it has no separate product. Second, in
using mathematical thinking as an analogue for dialectic, Socrates is
still relying on the notion of <em>technê</em> since both
geometry and calculation are <em>technai</em>.  So even though Plato
distinguishes between <em>technê</em> and
<em>epistêmê</em>, their relation is more of a tension
than a divorce.</p>

<p>

In fact, that dialectic is compared to a kind of <em>technê</em>
strongly suggests that there is a distinction between theoretical and
practical <em>technai</em>. Practical <em>technê</em> brings
into existence products separate from the <em>technê</em>
itself, while theoretical <em>technê</em> does not. The account
of dialectic in the <em>Sophist</em> reflects just such a distinction
between theoretical and practical <em>technai</em>. In this account
(253a ff) the Visitor from Elea begins with the idea that there is a
<em>technê</em> for telling which letters join to which, just as
there is <em>technê</em> for which musical notes mingle and
which do not. Then the Visitor turns to the kinds
(<em>genê</em>) that he has just introduced: being, rest,
motion, sameness, and difference (254d-e). He posits a sort of
knowledge (<em>epistêmê</em>) for showing which kinds
harmonize and which do not. Since this is the knowledge of how to
discriminate according to kinds, discriminating is preliminary to
showing what kinds harmonize. Still, knowing how to discriminate the
kinds is not productive — e.g., in the way carpentry is
productive. In the later part of his discussion, in the
<em>Statesman</em>, the Visitor, in fact, introduces an intriguing
distinction between <em>epistêmai</em> that are practical
— like carpentry — and those which are for knowledge only
(258d). The Visitor calls them respectively the practical
(<em>praktikê</em>) and the theoretical
(<em>gnôstikê</em> — clearly related to
<em>gnôsis</em> and <em>gignôskein</em>)(259d). However,
the theoretical is subdivided into (a) <em>epistêmai</em> like
calculation, which only judges or distinguishes the things known and
(b) <em>epistêmai</em> like that of the architect
(<em>architektôn</em>), which command and are thus called
commanding (<em>epitaktikê</em>) (259e). The Visitor may seem to
have blurred his original distinction between practical and
theoretical by including commanding knowledge
(<em>epitaktikê</em>) in the latter category. Still, the notion
that at least part of theoretical knowledge only judges the things
known gives us a basis for distinguishing theoretical from practical
knowledge. The former entails craft-like skill; but the skill remains
focused on the objects of knowledge. In calculation the objects are
numbers; in dialectic they are the kinds. This kind of knowledge has
no product separate from its activity; by contrast, practical
knowledge actually produces something separate, in the way carpentry
does.  This way of expressing the difference suggests that theoretical
<em>epistêmê</em> is not so much a body of knowledge as an
ability to grasp very abstract sorts of distinctions. </p>

<p>

Still, by including commanding knowledge, the Visitor has left a
middle ground between the purely theoretical and the practical.
Certainly architecture is not practical since it does not directly
produce anything, in the way carpentry does. However, it does give
commands, whose effects are practical; thus, it is not for knowledge
only, in the way in which calculation is for knowledge only. Insofar
as architecture is an analogue for the political craft, the Visitor
seems to be exploiting this middle ground (259e). It is as though the
Visitor is trying to associate the political craft with the most
abstract disciplines, like geometry, even though it has to have
practical impact. In fact, including commanding knowledge under
theoretical knowledge reflects again the tension between the knowledge
needed to rule and the elaboration of that knowledge. The ruler needs
to be able to engage in purely theoretical investigation; he also
needs to bring order into the city. The Visitor turns to the latter
activity when he compares the kingly or political knowledge to
weaving. Finally, he arrives at the conclusion that the kingly
knowledge weaves together all the other <em>epistêmai</em>
— like generalship and judging — as well as the laws and
those things having to do with the city (305e).  While no resolution
is offered to this tension two features of this long discussion are
suggestive. If the kingly or political <em>epistêmê</em>
is like weaving, it depends on the ability first of all to distinguish
what it will weave together.  Insofar as dialectic is the skill of
distinguishing the things known, it can serve as preliminary to
weaving because it is preliminary to showing how the kinds
harmonize. Further, if political knowledge is like architecture, it is
a commanding knowledge (<em>epitaktikê
epistêmê</em>); it gives commands. If we search for the
source of these commands, a likely source is the relations and
distinctions to be found among forms.  If so, the abstract structures
discovered by <em>gnôstikê</em> are normative for the
city, the way the forms are in the <em>Republic</em>.</p>

<h2><a name="3">3. Aristotle</a></h2>

<p>

The obvious place to begin a consideration of
<em>epistêmê</em> and <em>technê</em> in Aristotle's
writings is in Book VI of the <em>Nicomachean Ethics</em>. Here
Aristotle makes a very clear distinction between the two intellectual
virtues, a distinction which is not always observed elsewhere in his
work. He begins with a distinction between two parts of the rational
soul, the calculating part (<em>to logistikon</em>) and the scientific
part (<em>to epistêmonikon</em>). With the calculating part we
consider (<em>theôroumen</em>) things which admit of change
whereas with the scientific part we consider things which do not admit
of change (1139a5-15). Things which admit of change are, e.g., the
contingencies of everyday life; things which do not admit of change
are, e.g., the necessary truths of mathematics. Then Aristotle becomes
somewhat more specific about these parts of the soul. Within the
calculating part we find practical thinking. In practical thinking
(<em>praktikê dianoia</em>) we attain truth and falsity with
respect to action. In the scientific part theoretical thinking
(<em>theôrêtikê dianoia</em>) attains truth and
falsity. Truth and falsity is the goal of all thinking; but with
practical thinking the goal is truth and falsity in relation to correct
desire (1139a25-30). Given these capacities, Aristotle turns to the
virtues of the rational part of the soul.</p>

<p>

There are five virtues of thought: <em>technê</em>,
<em>epistêmê</em>, <em>phronêsis</em>,
<em>sophia</em>, and <em>nous</em> (1139b15). Various translations
have been offered for each of these terms. Most often,
<em>technê</em> is translated as craft or art. While
<em>epistêmê</em> is generally rendered as knowledge, in
this context, where it is used in its precise sense, it is sometimes
translated as scientific knowledge.  However, one must not confuse
this usage with our contemporary understanding of science, which
includes experimentation. Conducting experiments to confirm hypotheses
is a much later development. Rather, translating
<em>epistêmê</em> as scientific knowledge is a way of
emphasizing its certainty. In any event, as soon as Aristotle
introduces these five terms, he turns to the distinction between the
first two virtues. First he defines <em>epistêmê</em>, as
he says, in its accurate sense and leaving aside its analogous uses.
Scientific knowledge is distinguished by its objects, which do not
admit of change; these objects are eternal and exist of
necessity. More precisely, scientific knowledge comprises
demonstration, starting from first principles; the latter must also be
known, although they are not known by demonstration (1139b15-30). The
full account of <em>epistêmê</em> in the strict sense is
found in <em>Posterior Analytics</em>, where Aristotle says that we
think we know something without qualification
(<em>epistasthai…haplôs</em>) when we think we know
(<em>gignôskein</em>) the cause by which the thing is, that it
is the cause of the thing, and that this cannot be otherwise
(71b10-15).  As though to emphasize the necessity of what is known, he
most frequently uses geometry as an example of
<em>epistêmê</em>. In this regard, it should be pointed
out that Aristotle uses the notion of cause (<em>aitia</em>) in a
broader sense than it usually has in contemporary thought. Thus,
understanding how the geometrical axioms lead to a theorem that right
triangles have a certain property would be an instance, for Aristotle,
of understanding the cause of the proven property of the right
triangle.</p>

<p>

With this distinction between the spheres of scientific knowledge and
of craft we seem to have, at last, the classic division between the
purely theoretical and the purely practical. Scientific knowledge
concerns itself with the world of necessary truths, which stands apart
from the world of everyday contingencies, the province of
craft. Still, there are many problems of interpretation surrounding
this description of scientific knowledge in <em>Posterior
Analytics</em>. While we cannot address them in this article, we can
at least point out a central one. The description just given of
<em>epistêmê</em> makes scientific knowledge into a
deductive system in which the relations among terms are invariable and
necessary. The problem for commentators has been how to reconcile this
description of <em>epistêmê</em> with Aristotle's actual
procedure in such treatises as the <em>Physics</em> and <em>De
Anima</em>, where one does not find a deductive system of invariable
and necessary relations. One possible explanation is that these
treatises are preliminary sketches for a truly scientific treatise. So
one could envision another <em>Physics</em> which would be a series of
deductions, all expressing invariable and necessary truths about
nature. However, this charitable assessment does not avoid all
problems. In <em>Metaphysics</em> II, Aristotle explicitly undermines
the possibility of an <em>epistêmê</em>, in the strict
sense, with respect to nature. At the end of Book II, Aristotle makes
a distinction between the accuracy to be found in mathematics and that
in other disciplines. Mathematical accuracy, he says, cannot be
expected in all things but only in those which do not contain
matter. In particular, then, one cannot expect mathematical accuracy
in the study of nature since it is concerned with matter
(995a15-20). If ‘mathematical accuracy’ means the grasp of
necessary and invariable relations among terms, then the study of
nature will, by definition, have no such accuracy because what it
studies contains matter. About nature, then, we might have to settle
for something less than <em>epistêmê</em> in the strict
sense. Indeed, in Book VI of the <em>Metaphysics</em>, Aristotle seems
to make a major concession on the issue of
<em>epistêmê</em> when he says that there is no knowledge
of the accidental, i.e., what happens infrequently, because all
<em>epistêmê</em> is of that which is always or for the
most part (<em>hôs epi to polu</em>) (1027a20). Instead of
grasping what is always and necessary, knowledge can then grasp what
happens for the most part, e.g., the regularities of nature, to which
there are exceptions.</p>

<p>

There is, then, some ambivalence in Aristotle's use of the term
<em>epistêmê</em>. For our purposes in this article, we
will leave suspended the question whether <em>epistêmê</em>
in the strict sense is achievable in the study of nature. Still, we can
recognize a secondary sense of <em>epistêmê</em>, since
Aristotle in some contexts uses <em>epistêmê</em> although
the strict conditions do not hold. One of these contexts appears to be
the study of nature. As we shall see, this secondary sense is important
for understanding the relation between <em>technê</em> and
<em>epistêmê</em>.</p>

<p>

Let us return to the definition of craft in the <em>Nicomachean
Ethics</em>. Having distinguished craft from scientific knowledge,
Aristotle also distinguishes it from virtue (<em>aretê</em>). To
do so he begins by distinguishing between making something
(<em>poiêton</em>) and action (<em>praktikon</em>), since the
disposition (<em>hexis</em>) with respect to making is different from
the disposition with respect to acting. <em>Technê</em> is a
disposition (<em>hexis</em>) that produces something by way of true
reasoning; it is concerned with the bringing into existence (<em>peri
genesin</em>) of things that could either exist or not. The principle
(<em>archê</em>) of these things is in the one who makes them,
whereas the principle of those things that exist by necessity or by
nature is in the things themselves (1140a1-20). Presumably Aristotle
means to distinguish between activity, whose end is in itself, and
making, whose end is a product separate from the activity of making.
When someone plays the flute, e.g., typically there is no further
product of playing; playing the flute is an end in itself. This
distinction is clearer in the opening paragraphs of the
<em>Nicomachean Ethics</em>. There Aristotle says that each
<em>technê</em>, investigation, action (<em>praxis</em>), and
undertaking seems to aim at some good. The ends vary, however; some
ends are the activities themselves and some ends are products
(<em>erga</em>) beyond the activities. As examples of ends, he cites
health as the end of medicine, a ship as the end of shipbuilding, and
victory as the end of generalship; these ends are products separate
from the respective activities (1094a5-10).</p>

<p>

This distinction between making and acting is important for the
distinction between craft (<em>technê</em>) and virtue
(<em>aretê</em>) because virtue is a disposition for acting. The
value of the works (<em>ginomena</em>) of <em>technai</em> is in the
works themselves — because they are of a certain sort. By contrast,
the value of a virtuous action depends on the agent, who must act with
knowledge and deliberately choose the action for itself; finally, the
action must come from a fixed disposition of character. The latter two
features do not belong to <em>technê</em> (1105a25-1105b5).
Presumably, then, the craftsman does not choose his activity for itself
but for the end; thus the value of the activity is in what is made. In
the case of virtue, by contrast, the value is not in a separate product
but in the activity itself. Indeed, Aristotle has another important
reason for distinguishing <em>technê</em> from virtue. As a
rational potency (<em>dunamis meta logou</em>) <em>technê</em> is
capable of contrary effects. Medicine, e.g., can produce both disease
and health. The reason is that knowledge
(<em>epistêmê</em>) is a rational formula (<em>logos</em>)
which explains a thing and its privation. Presumably, then, medicine
includes a rational formula or definition of health and its privation,
disease; hence, it is a capacity to produce either of these opposite
states. Aristotle goes on to say that, while the knowledge is relevant
to both states, in a sense it is most relevant to the positive state
(<em>Metaphysics</em>, 1046b5-25). Of course, virtue is not a potency
for contrary effects in any way at all.</p>

<p>

Now that we have traced Aristotle's way of distinguishing craft from
scientific knowledge and from virtue, we can focus on craft as
productive. As we have just seen, craft is productive because it has an
account to give of what it produces — a notion we have seen in Plato.
Aristotle also gives us a very interesting sketch of the way this
account is the basis for practical reasoning. In an important example
from <em>Metaphysics</em> VII we see how the account of the goal is the
basis for reasoning which ends in action. In production the form is in
the soul of the one who produces; in the case of medicine, health is
such a form. To begin with, health is knowledge
(<em>epistêmê</em>) and an account (<em>logos</em>) in the
soul. Then the physician engages in the following kind of reasoning:
since health is this particular state, if the patient is to be healthy,
he should have this other particular state, for instance homogeneity,
and if he is to have homogeneity, he should have heat. The physician
continues to reason in this way until he arrives at the last step, the
thing he can do. From this point the process, which aims at health, is
called production (1032b1-10).</p>

<p>

With this sketch of practical reasoning we can come to closer grips
with what sorts of things admit of change. Let us begin with health
and the claim that the physician has an account of health. It is
health that is the cause of the steps in the practical reasoning
because it explains what is to be done. In what way does health admit
of change?  One possibility is that what constitutes health is not
invariable; thus the account of health would not be invariable. While
it seems unlikely that health is variable in this sense, what
obviously admits of change is whether health exists in this particular
case or not. If health does not exist in this case, it is up to
medicine to restore it. In this sense, as well, all of the steps
prescribed by the practical reasoning admit of change. In the case of
this patient, homogeneity may or may not exist; heat may or may not
exist. However, there is another sense in which the steps in the
syllogism might admit of change. Each step alleges a productive
relation — e.g., heat produces homogeneity. Now, there is a
sense in which these relations admit of change. While heat produces
homogeneity, in a particular case heat causing homogeneity may or may
not exist because there may or may not be heat. To say of all these
conditions that they admit of change, then, implies that they could or
could not exist. Whether these conditions exist or not depends on an
agent bringing them into existence. So the field of craft is those
conditions that can be brought into existence by an agent.</p>

<p>

To this kind of contingency, however, another must be added. The
productive relation can be contingent in another sense. It is
contingent whether heat, e.g., produces homogeneity. Heat does not
invariably nor necessarily produce homogeneity, although it does do so
for the most part (<em>Prior Analytics</em>, 32b5-20). There are,
then, two kinds of contingency possible in practicing medicine. The
first kind has to do with whether the physician acts or not; the
second kind has to do with whether the productive relation holds or
not. On the one hand, if the first kind of contingency held but the
second did not, the physician would have a nearly sovereign command of
health. If the productive relations between heat and homogeneity and
between homogeneity and health were invariable and necessary, then so
long as the physician could produce heat, he could invariably produce
health.  On the other hand, if the productive connections were not
invariable and necessary — but only held for the most part
— then the physician could reliably but not invariably produce
health (<em>Metaphysics</em>, 1026b30-1027a25). One could say of
contingent productive connections that they hold unless something
unusual happens, that, e.g., heat always causes homogeneity unless
something unusual intervenes.  Accidental factors — by
definition factors which arise infrequently — can defeat the
causal link between heat and homogeneity. But since accidental factors
are infrequent, one can claim that for the most part heat causes
homogeneity. In view of this kind of contingency, what the physician
can claim to know is that heat produces homogeneity unless something
unusual intervenes. In his deliberations, what he does not know is
when something unusual will happen (<em>Nicomachean Ethics</em>,
1112a20-1112b10).</p>

<p>

Scientific knowledge, in the strict sense, does not deal with these
kinds of contingency. Nevertheless, Aristotle still describes medicine
— which does deal with contingency — as an
<em>epistêmê</em>, as we have seen. Indeed, from time to
time, Aristotle mentions <em>epistêmê</em> and
<em>technê</em> in the same breath, as though they are not as
distinct as <em>Nicomachean Ethics</em> VI would make them seem. In
the <em>Physics</em> (194a20), Aristotle argues that the student of
nature will study both form and matter. To illustrate he says that it
belongs to the same <em>epistêmê</em> to study the form as
well as the matter; the physician, for instance, studies health as
well as bile and phlegm. In <em>Nicomachean Ethics</em>, in his
polemic against the Platonic notion of the good itself— using
<em>epistêmê</em> and <em>technê</em> indifferently
— Aristotle says the physician does not study health as such but
human health — even the health of this human because it is
individuals that he cures (1097a10-15). Clearly, if medicine is an
<em>epistêmê</em> which studies health, it is also a
<em>technê</em> which produces health. If he were using
<em>epistêmê</em> in its strict sense, he ought not to
have called medicine <em>epistêmê</em>. Indeed, the mixing
of <em>epistêmê</em> and <em>technê</em> is not
confined to medicine. In <em>Nicomachean Ethics</em> II, when he
illustrates the notion of the mean between extremes, he cites experts
in physical training. Then he says that every
<em>epistêmê</em> achieves well its goal (<em>ergon</em>)
by looking at the mean and using that as a standard in its
products. His use of the words <em>technitai</em> (craftsmen) and
<em>technê</em> to describe this phenomenon shows that he is not
thinking of <em>epistêmê</em> in its strict sense
(1106b5-15).</p>

<p>

Thus, a mixed picture of <em>epistêmê</em> and
<em>technê</em> begins to emerge. While <em>technê</em>
deals with things which change, Aristotle still has a tendency to call
it <em>epistêmê</em>. The reason for this tendency is
probably that, while the person with <em>technê</em> does not
have <em>epistêmê</em> in the strict sense, he has
something close to it. At the beginning of the <em>Metaphysics</em>,
Aristotle says that the person with <em>epistêmê</em> and
the person with <em>technê</em> share an important similarity.
There Aristotle contrasts the person of experience (<em>empeiria</em>)
with someone who has <em>technê</em> or
<em>epistêmê</em>. The former knows that, when Callias had
such and such disease, thus and such helped him, and the same for
Socrates and many others. However, the person who has a
<em>technê</em> goes beyond experience to a universal judgment.
This judgment is that this remedy helped all individuals of this type,
with this disease. Examples of the types of individuals are the
phlegmatic and the bilious, when afflicted with a burning fever
(981a5-15). However, it is important to note that the universals cited
— phlegmatic and bilious — have a role to play in
explaining a fever and, thus, a role to play in the account of a
cure. As Aristotle says, the master craftsman
(<em>technitês</em>) is wiser than the person of experience
because he knows the cause, the reasons that things are to be
done. The mere artisan (<em>cheirotechnês</em>) acts without
this knowledge (981a30-b5). Aristotle goes on to say that in general
the sign of knowing or not knowing is being able to teach.  Because
<em>technê</em> can be taught, we think it, rather than
experience, is <em>epistêmê</em> ( 981b10). Presumably the
reason that the one with <em>technê</em> can teach is that he
knows the cause and reason for what is done in his
<em>technê</em>. So we can conclude that the person with
<em>technê</em> is like the person with
<em>epistêmê</em>; both can make a universal judgment and
both know the cause.</p>

<p>

Still, even if the craftsman is capable of a universal judgment about
the cause of disease, the accuracy of the judgment is not absolute, as
we have seen, but holds only for the most part. In this regard it is
reminiscent of the kind of accuracy Aristotle says is to be expected
in the study of the supreme good. In <em>Nicomachean Ethics</em> I 3,
he says that it is political science (<em>politikê</em>
<em>epistêmê</em>) which pursues this study
(1094b1). Since there is disagreement and error surrounding the topic
of the good, we must be content, concerning such a subject and relying
on similar premises, to show the truth roughly and in outline. Given a
subject and premises that hold for the most part (<em>hôs epi to
polu</em>) similar conclusions will follow. He adds that it is the
mark of an educated person to seek the amount of accuracy
(<em>takribes</em>) that the nature of the subject matter permits
(1094b20-25). Later in Book I, Aristotle returns to the problem of the
accuracy appropriate to different undertakings; one must seek accuracy
(<em>akribeian</em>) according to each subject matter and to the
degree that is appropriate to the method for investigating it. He
illustrates this problem by comparing geometry with carpentry. Both
seek (<em>epizêtousi</em>) the right angle, the latter insofar
as it is useful for his product and the former as to what it is and
its properties, since he is looking for the truth (1098a25-30). Here
Aristotle suggests the notion of practical accuracy, clearly distinct
from mathematical accuracy, is possibly distinct from the accuracy of
the study of nature.</p>

<h2><a name="4">4. The Stoics</a></h2>

<p>

Among the Stoics, the relation between <em>epistêmê</em>
and <em>technê</em> is the richest and most focused of all the
accounts we have so far considered. That relation is enmeshed in the
Stoic account of virtue, in which the two notions of knowledge and
craft flow together in forming the science and art of living. Zeno
refers to a <em>technê</em> which cures the diseases of the soul
(<em>SVF</em>, i.e. <em>Stoicorum Veterum Fragmenta</em>, I 323) and
Chrysippus says that practical judgment (<em>phronêsis</em>) is
a kind of <em>technê</em> concerning the things having to do
with life (<em>SVF</em> II 909). While virtue is compared to a
<em>technê</em>, it is also a complete and unshakeable
understanding of the universe. It has then some of the features of an
<em>epistêmê</em> in Aristotle's strong sense. Clearly,
such a position rests on the basis of peculiar Stoic doctrines. We can
begin with the Stoic idea of impulse to action.  Diogenes Laertius
says that, according to the Stoics, an animal has self-preservation as
the object of its first impulse (<em>hormê</em>).  So, the first
thing appropriate (<em>oikeios</em>) to every animal – including
humans – is its own constitution and the consciousness of this.
Impulse leads every animal to seek what is appropriate to it and
rejects what is not appropriate.  In addition, the constitution of
adult humans includes reason; so, reason supervenes on what would be
purely automatic impulses in other animals.  Stoics say that reason is
itself the craftsman (<em>technitês</em>) of the adult's
impulses (Diogenes Laertius 7.85-6).</p>

<p>

For the Stoics, however, reason's being the craftsman of all adult
human impulses does not imply a division between the rational and any
non-rational parts of the soul. Orthodox Stoics do not divide the soul
into reason and non-rational desires. Without this division there is
no basis for a distinction between <em>epistêmê</em> as an
intellectual virtue and reason as exercising a kind of
<em>technê</em> with respect to some non-rational element.
Rather, there is only the reasoning (<em>dianoia</em>) and governing
principle (<em>hêgemonikon</em>) which is capable of opposite
states and thus becomes either virtue or vice (Plutarch, <em>On moral
virtue</em> 441 C-D). Moral weakness or hesitancy comes from
alternating judgments about what is morally right (446E-447A). Such an
account implies that reason controls impulse solely by its judgments.
One's emotions, then, are not independent of reason; they cannot
pursue as good something different from what reason takes to be
good. In those who do not know what the good is, reason gives rise to
mistaken impulses to action.  For instance, the belief that health is
good is mistaken because only virtue is good; still, this mistaken
belief is expressed as fear at the prospect of losing one's health,
which, in turn, can move one to preserve health at the expense of
virtue.  However, in the one who knows that virtue is the only good
– the sage – reason, unimpeded by fear, gives rise to
impulses that aim only at virtue.  If reason is the craftsman of
impulse and if <em>technê</em> implies knowledge, then it molds
one's impulsive feelings, i.e., the ones that lead one to act, through
knowledge of the good.  </p>

<p>
However, this knowledge of the good locates what is good for the sage
in what is good for the whole universe.  Zeno says that the end of
life is to live in accordance with nature.  In fact, living in
accordance with nature is the same as virtue (Diogenes Laertius,
7.87).  Chrysippus modifies Zeno's claim when he says that living in
accordance with virtue is equivalent to living in accordance with the
experience of what happens by nature.  What happens by nature is
governed by universal law, which is right reason pervading everything
and is identical with Zeus, who is the leader of the governance of
everything (Diogenes Laertius, 7.87-8).  The consequence is that the
sage's reason, endowed with knowledge of the way right reason pervades
the universe, supervenes on impulse with the good of the whole in
view.  Chrysippus says that there is no other or more appropriate way
of approaching the account of things which are good and bad or the
virtues or happiness than from universal nature and from the
governance of the universe. (Plutarch. <em>On Stoic
Self-contradictions</em> 1035 C-D)</p>

<p>At this point, we can appreciate the way Stoicism presents a
distinct view of the relation between <em>epistêmê</em>
and <em>technê</em>.  Socratic intellectualism holds that what
one knows to be good is sufficient for one to do what is good; but it
has no moral psychology to justify the claim.  Finding the claim
itself paradoxical, Plato explains the hesitancy to do what one knows
to be good by introducing non-rational elements into the soul. (See
the entry on
  <a href="../ethics-ancient/">ancient ethical theory</a>,
especially the sections on Socrates and on Plato.) Finally, the Stoics
return to a form of Socratic intellectualism.  However, Stoicism
provides the missing moral psychology with its doctrine of the unity
of the soul.  In the soul of the Stoic sage, the knowledge of the good
is an unshakeable grasp of what is good both for the sage and for the
whole universe.  Because of its unity, there is nothing in the soul of
the sage to oppose this knowledge.  It is as though the Stoics assume
that, without opposition, this sort of knowledge would naturally pass
over into action once the connection is made with a particular
situation.  Any reason to think otherwise is false.  One type of false
opinion is theoretical (and external to moral reasoning) and comes
from mistaken views about moral psychology that clutter the soul up
with non-rational parts.  The other type is practical (and internal to
moral reasoning) and comes from failure to know that virtue is living
in accordance with nature and is the only good.  This type of false
opinion gives rise to such emotions as fear, which impede living in
accordance with nature.  Once these are swept away, knowledge of what
is good is motivation enough to act.  In the sage, then, where the
unity of the soul is perfected, the theoretical grasp characteristic
of <em>epistêmê</em> just is a <em>technê</em>.</p>

<p>  

The way this <em>technê</em> works is illustrated in another
widely held Stoic teaching, i.e., the unity of the virtues.  Zeno held
that virtue is practical knowledge (<em>phronêsis</em>) in
various forms.  When <em>phronêsis</em> deals with what is owed
to others it is justice (<em>dikaiosunê</em>); when it deals
with what should be chosen it is moderation
(<em>sôphrosunê</em>); when it deals with what must be
endured it is courage (<em>andreia</em>).  In all of these definitions
Zeno means <em>phronêsis</em> to be knowledge
(<em>epistêmê</em>) (Plutarch, <em>On moral virtue</em>
441A).  According to Sextus, the Stoics say
that <em>phronêsis</em>, being knowledge
(<em>epistêmê</em>) of the good and the evil, provides
a <em>technê</em> concerning life (SVF III 598).  Here we can
see the 'sage' or fully perfected human being has a kind of insight
into what is good and bad in each situation of life.  In its
particularity, this insight is like that of a master craftsman, who
knows what is appropriate at each juncture of his practice.  And like
the master craftsman, the sage reacts appropriately both in the way he
feels and in the way he acts.</p>

<p> 

Still, there is room for a distinction
between <em>epistêmê</em> and <em>technê</em>.
Several authors attribute to Zeno the notion that
a <em>technê</em> is a systematic collection of cognitions
(<em>katalêpseis</em>) unified by practice for some goal
advantageous in life (SVF I 73).  The difference
between <em>technê</em> and <em>epistêmê</em>
properly speaking is that the latter is said to be secure and
unshakeable by reason (Stobaeus 2.73,16-74,3).  In general,
however, <em>technê</em> does not have the same kind of
stability (Cicero, <em>On Ends</em> III.50).  Indeed,
such <em>technai</em> as love of music, and liberal arts in general,
are not even called knowledge (Stobaeus, 2.67, 5-12; cf
Seneca, <em>Letters</em> 88).  Nevertheless, such distinctions
between <em>epistêmê</em> and <em>technê</em> do not
keep the Stoics from characterizing virtue as <em>technê</em>.
This special <em>technê</em> does consist in a secure and
unshakeable insight into what is appropriate at each juncture of
life.</p>

<p>

A significant refinement of this <em>technê</em> is found in
Cicero's <em>On Ends</em>.  In Book V, Piso, representing the views of
Antiochus of Ascalon, gives an overview of philosophical schools.  The
account depends on the notion of the highest good (<em>summum
bonum</em>) because differences about the highest good define the
possible schools.  The explication of these differences begins with an
analogy drawn from the crafts (<em>artes</em>, Cicero's Latin for the
Greek <em>technai</em>).  First of all, the art is different from its
object.  Second, as medicine is the art of health and navigation the
art of guiding ships, so prudence (practical wisdom) is the art of how
to live (<em>vivendi ars est prudentia</em>).  Piso presents this last
claim as common to all the schools, or at least as a good way to
present an element which is common.  Next he says that whatever
prudence would aim for is something suited to our nature and the
object of natural impulse (what the Greeks call <em>hormê</em>).
Stoics hold that prudence aims for the primary objects of nature.  The
primary objects of nature include such things as life and health.
However, Stoics do not hold that actually obtaining the primary
objects of nature is the highest good.  Rather they maintain that
making every effort to obtain them (i.e., appropriate ones among them,
given the circumstances), even if one is unsuccessful, is morality and
is the only thing desirable for itself and the highest good
(V.16-20).</p>

<p>

If life and health are among the primary objects of nature, then the
Stoic teaching is that doing everything to obtain life and health is
morality. But this claim must be qualified; it is not moral to strive
for life and health in an unjust way. Another of the primary objects
of nature is human solidarity. Thus, making every effort to obtain
life and health (and the other primary objects of nature) is the same
as being virtuous, just as making every effort to cure a patient is
the same as following the craft of medicine. Whether the sage actually
obtains life and health (or his other specific objectives in his
actions) is beyond his control. Finally, however, virtuously striving
for these is more important than obtaining them — it is, in
fact, the only true good.</p>

<p>

In Book III, the Stoic Cato explains this complicated position.  Human
beings begin life automatically and instinctively seeking the primary
objects of nature, but as their power of reason develops, they come to
realize, if they attain a correct understanding, that moral action is
really the end of life. So they shift the aim of their life, from the
primary objects of nature themselves to doing everything possible to
attain them. Using an analogy to marksmanship, Cato says that someone
who makes it his purpose to hit the target would do everything he
could to hit the target. Thus, he says, his end would be to try
everything he could. Cato's thought is that the sage will aim for such
things as health; however, the good — and therefore the end he
seeks — is in the way he pursues health. Thus, actually getting
health is preferable to not getting it, but pursuing it in a moral way
is what is desirable in itself. So, he explains, wisdom
(<em>sapientia</em>) is not like medicine or navigation but closer to
acting and dancing, where the end is the exercise of the art and is in
the art itself and not external to it. Even this analogy to the art of
dancing is not quite adequate. According to Cato, a virtuous action
entails all the virtues; presumably he means, e.g., a just action is
also moderate and courageous. However, not every dance movement
includes all the possible dance steps (III. 22-25). In sum, the Stoics
give us the powerful idea that the excellent human life, and
happiness, is the same thing as performing in an artful way, striving
for a life of natural satisfactions, but actually finding ultimate
value in the way one strives.</p>

<h2><a name="5">5. Alexander of Aphrodisias</a></h2>

<p>

In commenting on the notion of contingency in Aristotle's <em>Prior
Analytics</em>, Alexander introduces the idea of stochastic
<em>technê</em> — an idea important for the Stoic
explanation of virtue that we have just seen. Aristotle himself
recognizes a kind of knowledge that deals with things that happen for
the most part; what happens for the most part is distinct from what
may or may not happen (<em>Prior Analytics</em>, 32b5-20). In his
commentary on the kind of syllogism relative to what happens for the
most part, Alexander calls the <em>technai</em> that use this kind of
syllogism stochastic. The root sense of ‘stochastic’ is
the ability to aim or hit.  Obviously there is an ambiguity in the
notion. A necessary condition of being able reliably to hit the target
is being able to aim; but aiming and hitting are different. If one
aims well, she usually hits, but contingencies can
intervene. Stochastic <em>technai</em> are ones subject to this kind
of contingency. Alexander calls them stochastic, in the sense of
conjectural (<em>In An.Pr</em>. 39, 15-40, 5). When the physician,
e.g., aims at health, his aiming is a kind of conjecture, albeit a
grounded one, that such and such treatment will produce health.</p>

<p>

Alexander develops the notion of stochastic <em>technê</em>
further in his commentary on Aristotle's <em>Topics</em>. Addressing
the problem that dialectic does not always achieve its goal, i.e.,
leading the interlocutor to a contradiction, he divides
<em>technai</em> into ones which achieve their ends by definite steps
and those which cannot (<em>In Top</em>. 32,10-34,1). Given materials,
tools, and other conditions, carpentry, e.g., can produce houses by
following a series of steps each of which is effective in a
determinate way. However, medicine does not always cure and certainly
does not cure with the reliability that carpentry produces
houses. Even though medicine tries everything in its power, chance can
intervene so that it does not achieve its goal, the curing of the
patient. When carpentry, by contrast, tries everything in its power,
it achieves its goal.  Failure here is the result not of chance but of
error in executing the <em>technê</em>, as Alexander says in
<em>Quaestiones</em> (<em>Quaestio</em> 2.16, 10-25). To mark the
difference between these two kinds of <em>technê</em>, Alexander
says that the task (<em>ergon</em>) of medicine is to try everything
possible to achieve its goal (<em>telos</em>); but achieving its goal
is not (totally) within the power of medicine. He calls stochastic,
then, the sorts of <em>technê</em> whose task is to try
everything possible to achieve their goal, the realization of the goal
being subject to chance.</p>

<p>

In a different vein, Alexander makes an interesting addition to
Aristotle's distinction between <em>epistêmê</em> and
<em>technê</em>. In his account of wisdom in Book One of the
<em>Metaphysics</em>, Aristotle argues that knowledge is valued for
its own sake. In one place, Aristotle says that what distinguishes
experience (<em>empeiria</em>) from <em>technê</em> is that the
latter has a rational account, which explains what it does. Of course,
the one with experience may be more effective than the inexperienced
person who has only the rational account. Still, we think the
craftsman wiser than the empiric because of his knowledge of the
account (<em>Metaphysics</em> 981a 5-30). The suppressed conclusion is
that wisdom is characterized by knowledge of causes quite apart from
the utility of knowing the causes. Another argument shows that wisdom
is not productive knowledge. Since wonder is the beginning of
philosophy, satisfying that wonder is an end in itself. In fact, this
kind of pursuit arose when the requirements of necessity and ease were
satisfied (<em>Metaphysics</em> 982b 10-15). So wisdom is knowledge
without practical utility, an end in itself.</p>

<p>

In his commentary on the <em>Metaphysics</em>, Alexander interprets
these arguments as showing that pure knowledge is superior to action.
But there is a difference between the claim that there is a kind of
knowledge which is an end in itself and the claim that pure knowledge
is superior to action. The latter idea is a distinct development in
thinking about the relation between knowledge and craft. This
development rests on the notion that action implies need and it is
better to be without need. So knowledge that fills no need is superior
to action, which fills some need or other. We see this idea at work in
the auxiliary arguments which Alexander offers to back up or explicate
claims made in Aristotle's text. For instance, when Alexander first
claims that Aristotle means to show that knowledge is more honorable
than action, he says that action aims at some end other than
itself. As though remembering that virtuous action — unlike
productive action — has no end outside itself, he immediately
offers an argument to the effect that even virtuous actions have
reference to the passions.  Divine beings, who are without passions,
have no need of virtue. Those who have passions need the virtues in
order to control the passions (<em>In Metaph.</em> 2,
1-10). Obviously, to have passions is to be in need. The contrast
between the divine and the human also figures in another auxiliary
argument. In passing, Aristotle says that one might justifiably think
that wisdom is beyond human ability because in many ways human nature
is in slavery (<em>Metaphysics</em> 982b30).  Alexander explicates the
remark about slavery by saying that humans are slaves in that they
need such things as health and prosperity. But what is divine is free
of all need (<em>In Metaph.</em> 17, 15-20).</p>

<p>

Alexander returns to this theme in his commentary on Aristotle's
<em>Prior Analytics</em>. At the beginning of the commentary, he
claims that theorizing is the highest of human goods. In making out
this claim, Alexander points to the situation of the gods, who are
without emotions and therefore do not need the moral virtues. Nor do
they need to deliberate. What is left is contemplating the truth. For
the gods, theorizing about truth is continuous and uninterrupted. Such
a state is impossible for humans in general; but some may approach
it. By leaving behind emotions and the human condition, one may engage
in the divine activity of pure theorizing. Insofar as one is engaged
in this activity, a human becomes like the gods. If becoming like god
(<em>homoiôsis theô(i)</em>) is the greatest good for
humans, then syllogistic, the method for theorizing, is most valuable
(<em>In An. Pr</em>. 5,20 - 6,10). Although expressed hypothetically,
becoming like god is being put forth as the greatest good for humans.
Even if a human cannot always be in such a state, when he is in a
state of continuous and uninterrupted theorizing about the truth, he
is just so far forth like god. In this discussion Alexander is
building on themes found in Aristotle's <em>Nicomachean Ethics</em>
(X.7-8). There Aristotle argues that the life of contemplation is
happiness because it is the virtue of the highest part of the soul,
reason. Since this part is the most god-like, contemplation is in some
sense divine activity.  Still, in these passages, Aristotle continues
to talk about integrating contemplation of truth within the context of
a human life. By contrast, Alexander suggests that one might lead
— or at least strive for— a god-like life of pure
contemplation. In such an account, pure theory is expressly divorced
from practice and promoted over it.</p>

<h2><a name="6">6. Plotinus</a></h2>

<p>

As might be expected, Plotinus' philosophy does not have much use for
the concept of <em>technê</em>. Its account of knowledge is
fuller than that of craft and is close to Aristotle's idea of
<em>epistêmê</em> in the strong sense. In the
<em>Enneads</em>, <em>epistêmê</em> is not directly
associated with <em>technê</em>. In the first place,
<em>epistêmê</em> refers to the particular cognitive state
of the first hypostasis from the One, Nous, in which there is an
identity between knowledge and what is known (VI. 6. 15). Our souls
gain true knowledge by the presence of Nous, although Nous knows
non-discursively while our souls characteristically know in a
discursive way (V. 9. 7; IV. 3.18). Discursive knowledge is the sort
of knowing that moves from, e.g., premise to conclusion;
non-discursive thought, then, is a unitary grasp or
understanding. Discursive knowledge, through dialectic, is able to
speak in a reasoned way about each thing, say what it is and in what
way it differs from others, and what it has in common with those with
which it exists, and so on. It does all these things with certain
knowledge (<em>epistêmê</em>) and not by opinion
(I. 3. 4). Plotinus also uses <em>epistêmê</em> in another
sense to refer to the various branches of knowledge which are
articulated in theorems (e.g., IV. 3. 2). Since the ideal state for a
human is to enjoy the knowledge which is found in Nous and then,
beyond that, the contemplation of the One, Plotinus gives short shrift
to the civic virtues of courage, justice, and moderation. Once one
attains the higher levels, he gives up the civic virtues in their
usual sense. At this level, moderation, for instance, is not measure
and limit but rather separation from one's lower nature
(I. 2. 7. 25).</p>

<p>

<em>Technê</em>, then, is even further down Plotinus' list of
concerns. He gives as examples of <em>technai</em> grammar, rhetoric,
lyre playing, music, housebuilding, medicine, and farming (II. 3. 2.
10-15; IV. 4. 31. 15-20). The most important use of the nature of
<em>technê</em> is to illustrate points about the coming to be
of the universe. Plotinus holds that Nous gives rise to the rational
principle (<em>logos</em>) which is responsible for the existence of
our universe (III. 2. 2) although the rational principle does not
create the universe because the universe neither comes into existence
nor perishes (III. 2. 1). Still, Plotinus uses analogies with
<em>technê</em> to explain the work of the rational
principle. In the treatise on beauty, he says that beauty in the
material world comes from shape or form and rational principle;
insofar as matter is ordered by these it is beautiful. As an
illustration of this point he cites the way <em>technê</em> can
bestow beauty on a house and its parts (I. 6. 2). In justifying the
presence of both good and evil in the universe, he cites the way a
painter includes varying and contrasting elements in painting
(III. 2. 11). In another very striking passage, Plotinus invokes the
<em>technai</em> of dance, music, and drama to explain the way
contrasting elements in the life of the universe are blended
(III. 2. 16). Nevertheless, there are ways in which the activity of
the rational principle is different from <em>technê</em>. The
most important is that rational principle does not reason that the
universe should exist; the creative power of rational principle is the
power to make another thing without striving for its being made. This
power is not acquired or learnt the way a <em>technê</em> is
(III. 2. 2). In explaining the way nature works, Plotinus says that
nature is productive because of its contemplation of realities in
Nous. Its act of contemplation makes what it contemplates— as
though the very act of contemplation were automatically productive
(III. 8. 4). In a similar vein he says that the universe is an image
of reality but does not exist by discursive thought (<em>dianoia</em>)
nor by contrivance of craft (<em>epitechnêsis</em>)
(II. 9. 8). Plotinus, then, is proposing the interesting notion that
pure thought, while distinct from craft, can be productive in its own
right.</p>

<p>

Hence Plotinus can dismiss <em>technê</em> as later than soul
and imitating it, making unclear and weak copies, childish things not
worth much, stacking up many devices in making an image of nature (IV.
3. 10). Still, Plotinus makes some interesting claims about craft when
he is being less severe. Making an analogy with the beauty in Nous,
Plotinus says that the statue is beautiful not because of the stone
but because of the form which craft puts in it. Moreover, this beauty
which exists in the craft is much better than the beauty expressed in
the stone (V. 8. 1). Drawing another analogy between Nous and
<em>technê</em>, he says that the forming principles of the
universe come from Nous the way the forming principles in the souls of
craftsmen come from their crafts (V. 9. 3). Finally he raises the
question whether <em>technê</em> might be based somehow in the
intelligible world. In answer, he distinguishes those crafts which
imitate nature from those which consider proportion in general. The
former are painting, sculpture, dance, and mime. However, music deals
with proportion of an intelligible kind (V. 9. 11). Music, then, has
some grasp of purely intelligible proportion.</p>
