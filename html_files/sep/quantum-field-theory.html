<h1>Quantum Field Theory</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Thu Jun 22, 2006; substantive revision Thu Sep 27, 2012</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
Quantum Field Theory (QFT) is the mathematical and conceptual
framework for contemporary elementary particle physics.  In a rather
informal sense QFT is the extension of quantum mechanics (QM), dealing
with particles, over to fields, i.e. systems with an infinite number
of degrees of freedom. (See the entry on
 <a href="../qm/">quantum mechanics</a>.)
In the last few years QFT has become a more widely discussed
topic in philosophy of science, with questions ranging from
methodology and semantics to ontology.  QFT taken seriously in its
metaphysical implications seems to give a picture of the world which
is at variance with central classical conceptions of particles and
fields, and even with some features of QM.</p>

<p>
The following sketches how QFT describes fundamental physics and what
the status of QFT is among other theories of physics. Since there is a
strong emphasis on those aspects of the theory that are particularly
important for interpretive inquiries, it does not replace an
introduction to QFT as such. One main group of target readers are
philosophers who want to get a first impression of some issues that
may be of interest for their own work, another target group are
physicists who are interested in a philosophical view upon QFT.

<h2><a name="Intro">1. What is QFT?</a></h2>

<p> In contrast to many other physical theories there is no canonical
definition of what QFT is. Instead one can formulate a number of
totally different explications, all of which have their merits and
limits. One reason for this diversity is the fact that QFT has grown
successively in a very complex way. Another reason is that the
interpretation of QFT is particularly obscure, so that even the
spectrum of options is not clear. Possibly the best and most
comprehensive understanding of QFT is gained by dwelling on its
relation to other physical theories, foremost with respect to QM, but
also with respect to classical electrodynamics, Special Relativity
Theory (SRT) and Solid State Physics or more generally Statistical
Physics. However, the connection between QFT and these theories is
also complex and cannot be neatly described step by step.</p>

<p>
If one thinks of QM as the modern theory of one particle (or, perhaps,
a very few particles), one can then think of QFT as an extension of QM
for analysis of systems with many particles—and therefore with a
large number of degrees of freedom.  In this respect going from QM to
QFT is not inevitable but rather beneficial for pragmatic
reasons. However, a general threshold is crossed when it comes to
fields, like the electromagnetic field, which are not merely difficult
but impossible to deal with in the frame of QM. Thus the transition
from QM to QFT allows treatment of both particles and fields within a
uniform theoretical framework. (As an aside, focusing on the number of
particles, or degrees of freedom respectively, explains why the famous
renormalization group methods can be applied in QFT as well as in
Statistical Physics. The reason is simply that both disciplines study
systems with a large or an infinite number of degrees of freedom,
either because one deals with fields, as does QFT, or because one
studies the thermodynamic limit, a very useful artifice in Statistical
Physics.) Moreover, issues regarding the number of particles under
consideration yield yet another reason why we need to extend
QM. Neither QM nor its immediate relativistic extension with the
Klein-Gordon and Dirac equations can describe systems with a
variable number of particles. However, obviously this is essential for
a theory that is supposed to describe scattering processes, where
particles of one kind are destroyed while others are created.</p>

<p>
One gets a very different kind of access to what QFT is when focusing
on its relation to QM and SRT. One can say that QFT results from the
successful reconciliation of QM and SRT. In order to understand the
initial problem one has to realize that QM is not only in
a <em>potential</em> conflict with SRT, more exactly: the locality
postulate of SRT, because of the famous EPR correlations of entangled
quantum systems. There is also a manifest contradiction between QM and
SRT on the level of the dynamics. The Schrödinger equation,
i.e. the fundamental law for the temporal evolution of the quantum
mechanical state function, cannot possibly obey the relativistic
requirement that all physical laws of nature be invariant under
Lorentz transformations.  The Klein-Gordon and Dirac equations,
resulting from the search for relativistic analogues of the
Schrödinger equation in the 1920s, do respect the requirement of
Lorentz invariance. Nevertheless, ultimately they are not satisfactory
because they do not permit a description of fields in a principled
quantum-mechanical way.</p>

<p>
Fortunately, for various phenomena it is legitimate to neglect the
postulates of SRT, namely when the relevant velocities are small in
relation to the speed of light and when the kinetic energies of the
particles are small compared to their mass energies
<em>mc</em><sup>2</sup>. And this is the reason why non-relativistic
QM, although it cannot be the correct theory in the end, has its
empirical successes. But it can never be the appropriate framework for
electromagnetic phenomena because electrodynamics, which prominently
encompasses a description of the behavior of light, is already
relativistically invariant and therefore incompatible with
QM. Scattering experiments are another context in which QM
fails. Since the involved particles are often accelerated almost up to
the speed of light, relativistic effects can no longer be
neglected. For that reason scattering experiments can only be
correctly grasped by QFT.</p>

<p>

Unfortunately, the catchy characterization of QFT as the successful
merging of QM and SRT has its limits. On the one hand, as already
mentioned above, there also is a relativistic QM, with the
Klein-Gordon- and the Dirac-equation among their most famous
results. On the other hand, and this may come as a surprise, it is
possible to formulate a non-relativistic version of QFT (see Bain
2011).  The nature of QFT thus cannot simply be that it reconciles QM
with the requirement of relativistic invariance.  Consequently, for a
discriminating criterion it is more appropriate to say that only QFT,
and not QM, allows describing systems with an infinite number of
degrees of freedom, i.e. fields (and systems in the thermodynamic
limit). According to this line of reasoning, QM would be the modern
(as opposed to classical) theory of particles and QFT the modern
theory of particles <em>and</em> fields. Unfortunately however, and
this shall be the last turn, even this gloss is not untarnished.
There is a widely discussed no-go theorem by Malament (1996) with the
following proposed interpretation: Even the quantum mechanics of one
single particle can only be consonant with the locality principle of
special relativity theory in the framework of a field theory, such as
QFT.  Hence ultimately, the characterization of QFT, on the one hand,
as the quantum physical description of systems with an infinite number
of degrees of freedom, and on the other hand, as the only way of
reconciling QM with special relativity theory, are intimately
connected with one another.</p>

<p>

<strong>Figure 1.</strong>
</p>

<p>
The diagram depicts the relations between different theories, where
Non-Relativistic Quantum Field Theory is not a historical theory but
rather an ex post construction that is illuminating for conceptual
purposes. Theoretically, [(i), (ii), (iii)], [(ii), (i), (iii)] and
[(ii), (iii), (i)] are three possible ways to get from Classical
Mechanics to Relativistic Quantum Field Theory. But note that this is
meant as a conceptual decomposition; history didn't go all these steps
separately. On the one hand, by good luck, so to say, classical
electrodynamics is relativistically invariant already, so that its
successful quantization leads directly to Relativistic Quantum Field
Theory. On the other hand, some would argue (e.g. Malament 1996) that
the only way to reconcile QM and SRT is in terms of a field theory, so
that (ii) and (iii) would coincide. Note that the steps (i), (ii) and
(iii), i.e. quantization, transition to an infinite number of degrees
of freedom, and reconciliation with SRT, are all ontologically
relevant. In other words, by these steps the nature of the physical
entities the theories talk about may change fundamentally. See Huggett
2003 for an alternative three-dimensional “map of
theories”.</p>

<strong>Further Reading on QFT and Philosophy of QFT</strong>.  Mandl
and Shaw (2010), Peskin and Schroeder (1995), Weinberg (1995) and
Weinberg (1996) are standard textbooks on QFT.  Teller (1995) and
Auyang (1995) are the first systematic monographs on the philosophy of
QFT. The anthologies Brown and Harré (1988), Cao (1999) and
Kuhlmann et al. (2002) are anthologies with contributions by
physicists and philosophers (of physics), where the last anthology has
a focus on ontological issues. The literature on the philosophy of QFT
has increased significantly in the last decade. Besides a number of
separate papers there are two new monographs, Cao (2010) and Kuhlmann
(2010), and one special issue (May 2011) of  <em>Studies in History
and Philosophy of Modern Physics</em>.  Bain (2011), Huggett (2000)
and Ruetsche (2002) provide article length discussions on a number of
issues in the philosophy of QFT.</p>

<h2><a name="BasStrStaFor">2. The Basic Structure of the Conventional Formulation</a></h2>

<h3><a name="LagForQFT">2.1 The Lagrangian Formulation of QFT</a></h3>

<p>

The crucial step towards <em>quantum</em> field theory is in some
respects analogous to the corresponding quantization in quantum
mechanics, namely by imposing commutation relations, which leads to
operator valued quantum fields.  The starting point is the classical
Lagrangian formulation of mechanics, which is a so-called analytical
formulation as opposed to the standard version of Newtonian mechanics.
A generalized notion of momentum (the
<em>conjugate</em> or <em>canonical</em> momentum) is defined by
setting <em>p</em> = ∂<em>L</em>/∂<em>q̇</em>, where
<em>L</em> is the Lagrange function <em>L</em> = <em>T</em> −
<em>V</em> (<em>T</em> is the kinetic energy and <em>V</em> the
potential) and <em>q̇</em> ≡ <em>dq</em>/<em>dt</em>.
This definition can be motivated by looking at the special case of a
Lagrange function with a potential <em>V</em> which depends only on
the position so that (using Cartesian coordinates)
∂<em>L</em>/∂<em>ẋ</em> 
= (∂/∂<em>ẋ</em>)(<em>m</em><em>ẋ</em><sup>2</sup>/2) 
= <em>m</em><em>ẋ</em> = <em>p</em><sub><em>x</em></sub>.
 Under these conditions the generalized momentum coincides with the
usual mechanical momentum.  In classical Lagrangian <em>field </em>
theory one associates with the given field φ
a second field, namely the conjugate field</p>

<blockquote>
 (3.1)    π =
 ∂<span class="scriptuc">L</span>/∂<em>φ̇</em>
</blockquote>

<p>
 where
 <span class="scriptuc">L</span>
 is a Lagrangian density.  The field φ and its conjugate field
π are the direct analogues of the canonical coordinate <em>q</em>
and the generalized (canonical or conjugate) momentum <em>p</em> in
classical mechanics of point particles.</p>

<p>

In both cases, QM and QFT, requiring that the canonical variables
satisfy certain commutation relations implies that the basic
quantities become operator valued. From a physical point of view this
shift implies a restriction of possible measurement values for
physical quantities some (but not all) of which can have their values
only in discrete steps now.  In QFT the canonical commutation
relations for a field φ and the corresponding conjugate field π
are</p>

<blockquote>
 <table>
 <tbody><tr>
 <td>(3.2)   </td>
 <td>[φ(<strong>x</strong>,<em>t</em>), 
 π(<strong>y</strong>,<em>t</em>)]</td>
 <td> = </td>
 <td>iδ<sup>3</sup>(<strong>x</strong> − <strong>y</strong>)</td>
 </tr>
 
 <tr>
 <td></td>
 <td>[φ(<strong>x</strong>,<em>t</em>), 
 φ(<strong>y</strong>,<em>t</em>)]</td>
 <td> = </td>
 <td>[π(<strong>x</strong>,<em>t</em>),
 π(<strong>y</strong>,<em>t</em>)] = 0</td>
 </tr>
 </tbody></table>
</blockquote>

<p>

which are equal-time commutation relations, i.e., the commutators
always refer to fields at the same time.  It is not obvious that the
equal-time commutation relations are Lorentz invariant but one can
formulate a manifestly covariant form of the canonical commutation
relations.  If the field to be quantized is not a bosonic field, like
the Klein-Gordon field or the electromagnetic field, but a fermionic
field, like the Dirac field for electrons one has to use
anticommutation relations.</p>

<p>

While there are close analogies between quantization in QM and in QFT
there are also important differences. Whereas the commutation
relations in QM refer to a quantum object with three degrees of
freedom, so that one has a set of 15 equations, the commutation
relations in QFT do in fact comprise an infinite number of equations,
namely for each of the infinitely many space-time 4-tuples
(<strong>x</strong>,<em>t</em>) there is a new set of commutation
relations. This infinite number of degrees of freedom embodies the
field character of QFT.</p>

<p>

It is important to realize that the operator valued field
φ(<strong>x</strong>,<em>t</em>) in QFT is <em>not</em> analogous
to the wavefunction ψ(<strong>x</strong>,<em>t</em>) in QM, i.e.,
the quantum mechanical state in its position representation. While the
wavefunction in QM is acted upon by observables/operators, in QFT it
is the (operator valued) field itself which acts on the space of
states. In a certain sense the single particle wave functions have
been transformed, via their reinterpretation as operator valued
quantum fields, into observables.  This step is sometimes called
‘second quantization’ because the single particle wave
equations in relativistic QM already came about by a quantization
procedure, e.g., in the case of the Klein-Gordon equation by replacing
position and momentum by the corresponding quantum mechanical
operators. Afterwards the solutions to these single particle wave
equations, which are states in relativistic QM, are considered as
classical fields, which can be subjected to the canonical quantization
procedure of QFT. The term ‘second quantization’ has often
been criticized partly because it blurs the important fact that the
single particle wave function φ in relativistic QM and the
operator valued quantum field φ are fundamentally different kinds
of entities despite their connection in the context of discovery.</p>

<p>

In conclusion, it must be emphasized that both in QM and QFT
states <em>and</em> observables are equally important. However, to
some extent their roles are switched. While states in QM can have a
concrete spatio-temporal meaning in terms of probabilities for
position measurements, in QFT states are abstract entities and it is
the quantum field operators that seem to allow for a spatio-temporal
interpretation. See the section on the field interpretation of QFT for
a critical discussion.</p>

<h3><a name="Int">2.2 Interaction</a></h3>

<p>

Up to this point, the aim was to develop a free field theory.  Doing
so does not only neglect interaction with other particles (fields), it
is even unrealistic for one free particle because it interacts with
the field that it generates itself.  For the description of
interactions—such as scattering in particle colliders—we
need certain extensions and modifications of the formalism. The
immediate contact between scattering experiments and QFT is given by
the scattering or S-matrix which contains all the relevant predictive
information about, e.g., scattering cross sections. In order to
calculate the S-matrix the interaction Hamiltonian is needed. The
Hamiltonian can in turn be derived from the Lagrangian density by
means of a Legendre transformation.</p>

<p>

In order to discuss interactions one introduces a new representation,
the <em>interaction picture</em>, which is an alternative to
the Schrödinger and the Heisenberg picture.  For the interaction
picture one splits up the Hamiltonian, which is the generator of
time-translations, into two parts <em>H</em> = <em>H</em><sub>0</sub>
+ <em>H<sub>int</sub></em>, where <em>H</em><sub>0</sub> describes the
free system, i.e., without interaction, and gets absorbed in the
definition of the fields and <em>H<sub>int</sub></em> is the
interaction part of the Hamiltonian, or short the ‘interaction
Hamiltonian’.  Using the interaction picture is advantageous
because the equations of motion as well as, under certain conditions,
the commutation relations are the same for interacting fields as for
free fields. Therefore, various results that were established for free
fields can still be used in the case of interacting fields.  The
central instrument for the description of interaction is again the
S-matrix, which expresses the connection between in and out states by
specifying the transition amplitudes.  In QED, for instance, a state
|<em>in</em>⟩ describes one particular configuration of electrons,
positrons and photons, i.e., it describes how many of these particles
there are and which momenta, spins and polarizations they have before
the interaction.  The S-matrix supplies the probability that this
state goes over to a particular |<em>out</em>⟩ state, e.g., that a
particular counter responds after the interaction. Such probabilities
can be checked in experiments.</p>

<p>

The canonical formalism of QFT as introduced in the previous section
is only applicable in the case of free fields since the inclusion of
interaction leads to infinities (see the historical part).  For this
reason perturbation theory makes up a large part of most publications
on QFT. The importance of perturbative methods is understandable
realizing that they establish the immediate contact between theory and
experiment. Although the techniques of perturbation theory have become
ever more sophisticated it is somewhat disturbing that perturbative
methods could not be avoided even in principle. One reason for this
unease is that perturbation theory is felt to be rather a matter of
(highly sophisticated) craftsmanship than of understanding
nature. Accordingly, the corpus of perturbative methods plays a small
role in the philosophical investigations of QFT. What does matter,
however, is in which sense the consideration of interaction effects
the general framework of QFT.  An overview about perturbation theory is given in section 4.1 (“Perturbation Theory—Philosophy and Examples”) of
Peskin &amp; Schroeder (1995).</p>

<h3><a name="GauInv">2.3 Gauge Invariance</a></h3>

<p>

Some theories are distinguished by being <em>gauge invariant</em>,
which means that <em>gauge transformations</em> of certain terms do
not change any observable quantities.  Requiring gauge invariance
provides an elegant and systematic way of introducing terms for
interacting fields. Moreover, gauge invariance plays an important role
in selecting theories.  The prime example of an intrinsically gauge
invariant theory is electrodynamics. In the potential formulation of
Maxwell's equations one introduces the vector
potential <strong>A</strong> and the scalar potential φ, which are
linked to the magnetic
field <strong>B</strong>(<strong>x</strong>,<em>t</em>) and the
electric field <strong>E</strong>(<strong>x</strong>,<em>t</em>)

where <em>F</em><sup>μν</sup> is the electromagnetic field
tensor and <em>A</em><sup>μ</sup> = (φ, <strong>A</strong>) the
4-vector potential.  The important point in the present context is
that given the identification (3.3), or (3.4), there remains a certain
flexibility or freedom in the choice of <strong>A</strong> and φ,
or <em>A</em><sup>μ</sup>. In order to see that, consider the
so-called <em>gauge transformations</em></p>

<p>
 where χ is a scalar function (of space and time or of space-time)
which can be chosen arbitrarily. Inserting the transformed
potential(s) into equation(s) (3.3), or (3.4), one can see that the
electric field <strong>E</strong> and the magnetic field
<strong>B</strong>, or covariantly the electromagnetic field tensor
<em>F</em><sup>μν</sup>, are not effected by a gauge
transformation of the potential(s).  Since only the electric field
<strong>E</strong> and the magnetic field <strong>B</strong>, and
quantities constructed from them, are observable, whereas the vector
potential itself is not, nothing physical seems to be changed by a
gauge transformation because it leaves <strong>E</strong> and
<strong>B</strong> unaltered.  Note that gauge invariance is a kind of
symmetry that does not come about by space-time transformations.</p>

<p>

In order to link the notion of gauge invariance to the Lagrangian
formulation of QFT one needs a more general form of gauge
transformations which applies to the field operator φ and which
is supplied by</p>

varies with <em>x</em>.  
</p>

<p>
It turned out that requiring invariance under local gauge
transformations supplies a systematic way for finding the equations
describing fundamental interactions. For instance, starting with the
Lagrangian for a free electron, the requirement of local gauge
invariance can only be fulfilled by introducing additional terms,
namely those for the electromagnetic field.  Gauge invariance can be
captured by certain symmetry groups: U(1) for electromagnetic,
SU(2)⊗U(1) for electroweak and SU(3) for strong
interaction. This is an important basis for unification programs, as
is the analogy to general relativity where a local gauge symmetry is
associated with the gravitational field. Moreover, it turned out that
only gauge invariant quantum field theories are renormalizable.  All
this can be taken to show that a mathematically rich theory, with
surplus structures, can be very valuable in the construction of
theories.</p>

<p>
Auyang (1995) emphasizes the general conceptual significance of
invariance principles; Redhead (2002) and Martin (2002) focus
specifically on gauge symmetries. Healey (2007) and Lyre (2004 and
2012) discuss the ontological significance of gauge theories, among
other things concerning the Aharanov-Bohm effect and ontic structural
realism.</p>

<h3><a name="EffFieTheRen">2.4 Effective Field Theories and Renormalization</a></h3>

<p>

In the 1970s a program emerged in which the theories of the standard
model of elementary particle physics are considered as effective field
theories (EFTs) which have a common quantum field theoretical
framework. EFTs describe relevant phenomena only in a certain domain
since the Lagrangian contains only those terms that describe particles
which are relevant for the respective range of energy. EFTs are
inherently approximative and change with the range of energy
considered.  EFTs are only applicable on a certain energy scale, i.e.,
they only describe phenomena in a certain range of energy. Influences
from higher energy processes contribute to average values but they
cannot be described in detail. This procedure has no severe
consequences since the details of low-energy theories are largely
decoupled from higher energy processes. Both domains are only
connected by altered coupling constants and the renormalization group
describes how the coupling constants depend on the energy.</p>

<p>

The main idea of EFTs is that theories, i.e., in particular the
Lagrangians, depend on the energy of the phenomena which are
analysed. The physics changes by switching to a different energy
scale, e.g., new particles can be created if a certain energy
threshold is exceeded. The dependence of theories on the energy
scale distinguishes QFT from, e.g., Newton's theory of gravitation
where the same law applies to an apple as well as to the moon.
Nevertheless, laws from different energy scales are not completely
independent of each other. A central aspect of considerations about
this dependence are the consequences of higher energy processes on the
low-energy scale.</p>

<p>

On this background a new attitude towards renormalization developed in
the 1970s, which revitalizes earlier ideas that divergences result
from neglecting unknown processes of higher energies. Low-energy
behavior is thus affected by higher energy processes.  Since higher
energies correspond to smaller distances this dependence is to be
expected from an atomistic point of view. According to the
reductionist program the dynamics of constituents on the microlevel
should determine processes on the macrolevel, i.e., here the
low-energy processes. However, as, for instance hydrodynamics shows,
in practice theories from different levels are not quite as closely
connected because a law which is applicable on the macrolevel can be
largely independent of microlevel details. For this reason analogies
with statistical mechanics play an important role in the discussion
about EFTs.  The basic idea of this new story about renormalization is
that the influences of higher energy processes are localizable in a
few structural properties which can be captured by an adjustment of
parameters.  “In this picture, the presence of infinities in
quantum field theory is neither a disaster, nor an asset. It is simply
a reminder of a practical limitation—we do not know what happens
at distances much smaller than those we can look at directly”
(Georgi 1989: 456). This new attitude supports the view that
renormalization is the appropriate answer to the change of fundamental
interactions when the QFT is applied to processes on different energy
scales. The price one has to pay is that EFTs are only valid in a
limited domain and should be considered as approximations to better
theories on higher energy scales. This prompts the important question
whether there is a last fundamental theory in this tower of EFTs which
supersede each other with rising energies.  Some people conjecture
that this deeper theory could be a string theory, i.e., a theory which
is not a field theory any more.  Or should one ultimately expect from
physics theories that they are only valid as approximations and in a
limited domain? Hartmann (2001) and Castellani (2002) discuss the fate
of reductionism vis-à-vis EFTs. Wallace (2011) and Fraser
(2011) discuss what the successful application of renormalization
methods in quantum statistical mechanics means for their role in QFT,
reaching very different conclusions.</p>

<h2><a name="BeyStaMod">3. Beyond the Standard Model</a></h2>

<p>
The “standard model of elementary particle physics” is
sometimes used almost synonymously with QFT.  However, there is a
crucial difference. While the standard model is a theory with a fixed
ontology (understood in a prephilosophical sense), i.e. three
fundamental forces and a certain number of elementary particles, QFT
is rather a frame, the applicability of which is open. Thus while
quantum chromodynamics (or ‘QED’) is a <em>part</em> of the standard
model, it is an <em>instance </em> of a quantum field theory, or short
“<em>a</em> quantum field theory” and not a part of QFT.  This
section deals with only some particularly important proposals that go
beyond the standard model, but which do not necessarily break up the
basic framework of QFT.
</p>

<h3><a name="QuantumGravity">3.1 Quantum Gravity</a></h3>

<p>
The standard model of particle physics covers the electromagnetic, the
weak and the strong interaction. However, the fourth fundamental force
in nature, gravitation, has defied quantization so far. Although
numerous attempts have been made in the last 80 years, and in
particular very recently, there is no commonly accepted solution up to
the present day. One basic problem is that the mass, length and time
scales quantum gravity theories are dealing with are so extremely
small that it is almost impossible to test the different
proposals.</p>

<p>

The most important extant versions of quantum gravity theories are canonical quantum
gravity, loop theory and string theory.  Canonical quantum gravity
approaches leave the basic structure of QFT untouched
and <em>just</em> extend the realm of QFT by quantizing gravity.
Other approaches try to reconcile quantum theory and general
relativity theory not by supplementing the reach of QFT but rather by
changing QFT itself. String theory, for instance, proposes a
completely new view concerning the most fundamental building blocks:
It does not merely incorporate gravitation but it formulates a new
theory that describes all four interactions in a unified way, namely
in terms of strings (see next subsection).</p>

<p>

While quantum gravity theories are very complicated and even more
remote from classical thinking than QM, SRT and GRT, it is not so
difficult to see why gravitation is far more difficult to deal with
than the other three forces.  Electromagnetic, weak and strong force
all act in a given space-time.  In contrast, gravitation is, according
to GRT, not an interaction that takes place <em>in</em> time, but
gravitational forces are identified with the curvature of space-time
itself. Thus quantizing gravitation could amount to quantizing
space-time, and it is not at all clear what that could mean. One
controversial proposal is to deprive space-time of its fundamental
status by showing how it “emerges ” in some
non-spatio-temporal theory. The “emergence” of space-time
then means that there are certain derived terms in the new theory that
have some formal features commonly associated with space-time. See
Kiefer (2007) for physical details, Rickles (2008) for an accessible
and conceptually reflected introduction to quantum gravity and
Wüthrich (2005) for a philosophical evaluation of the alleged
need to quantize the gravitational field. Also, see the entry on
<a href="../quantum-gravity/">quantum gravity</a>.
</p>

<h3><a name="StrThe">3.2 String Theory</a></h3>

<p>

String theory is one of the most promising candidates for bridging
the gap between QFT and general relativity theory by supplying a
unified theory of all natural forces, including gravitation.  The
basic idea of string theory is not to take particles as fundamental
objects but strings that are very small but extended in one
dimension. This assumption has the pivotal consequence that strings
interact on an extended distance and not at a point. This difference
between string theory and standard QFT is essential because it is the
reason why string theory also encompasses the gravitational force
which is very difficult to deal with in the framework of QFT.</p>

<p>

It is so hard to reconcile gravitation with QFT because the typical
length scale of the gravitational force is very small, namely at
Planck scale, so that the quantum field theoretical assumption of
point-like interaction leads to untreatable infinities.  To put it
another way, gravitation becomes significant (in particular in
comparison to strong interaction) exactly where QFT is most severely
endangered by infinite quantities.  The extended interaction of
strings brings it about that such infinities can be avoided.  In
contrast to the entities in standard quantum physics strings are not
characterized by quantum numbers but only by their geometrical and
dynamical properties. Nevertheless, “macroscopically”
strings look like quantum particles with quantum numbers. A basic
geometrical distinction is the one between open strings, i.e., strings
with two ends, and closed strings which are like bracelets. The
central dynamical property of strings is their mode of excitation,
i.e., how they vibrate.</p>

<p>

Reservations about string theory are mostly due to the lack of
testability since it seems that there are no empirical consequences
which could be tested by the methods which are, at least up to now,
available to us. The reason for this “problem” is that the
length scale of strings is in the average the same as the one of
quantum gravity, namely the Planck length of approximately
10<sup>−33</sup> centimeters which lies far beyond the
accessibility of feasible particle experiments. But there are also
other peculiar features of string theory which might be hard to
swallow. One of them is the fact that string theory implies that
space-time has 10, 11 or even 26 dimensions. In order to explain the
appearance of only four space-time dimensions string theory assumes
that the other dimensions are somehow folded away or
“compactified” so that they are no longer visible. An
intuitive idea can be gained by thinking of a macaroni which is a
tube, i.e., a two-dimensional piece of pasta rolled together, but
which looks from the distance like a one-dimensional string.</p>

<p>

Despite of the problems of string theory, physicists do not abandon
this project, partly because many think that, among the numerous
alternative proposals for reconciling quantum physics and general
relativity theory, string theory is still the best candidate, with
“loop quantum gravity” as its strongest rival (see the
entry on
 <a href="../quantum-gravity/">quantum gravity</a>). 
Correspondingly, string theory has also received some attention within
the philosophy of physics community in recent years.  Probably the
first philosophical investigation of string theory is Weingard (2001)
in Callender &amp; Huggett (2001), an anthology with further related
articles.  Dawid (2003) (see Other Internet Resources below) argues
that string theory has significant consequences for the philosophical
debate about realism, namely that it speaks against the plausibility
of anti-realistic positions. Also see Dawid (2009). Johansson and
Matsubara (2011) assess string theory from various different
methodological perspectives, reaching conclusions in disagreement with
Dawid (2009).  Standard introductory monographs on string theory are
Polchinski (2000) and Kaku (1999). Greene (1999) is a very successful
popular introduction. An interactive website with a nice elementary
introduction is ‘Stringtheory.com’ (see the Other Internet
Resources section below).</p>

<h2><a name="AltApp">4. Axiomatic Reformulations of QFT</a></h2>

<h3><a name="DefStaForQFT">4.1 Deficiencies of the Conventional Formulation of QFT</a></h3>

<p>
 
From the 1930s onwards the problem of infinities as well as the
potentially heuristic status of the Lagrangian formulation of QFT
stimulated the search for reformulations in a concise and eventually
axiomatic manner. A number of further aspects intensified the unease
about the standard formulation of QFT.  The first one is that
quantities like total charge, total energy or total momentum of a
field are unobservable since their measurement would have to take
place in the whole universe. Accordingly, quantities which refer to
infinitely extended regions of space-time should not appear among the
observables of the theory as they do in the standard formulation of
QFT.  Another problematic feature of standard QFT is the idea that QFT
is about field values at points of space-time. The mathematical aspect
of the problem is that a field at a point, 
 <span class="nw">φ(<em>x</em>),</span> is not
an operator in a Hilbert space. The physical counterpart of the
problem is that it would require an infinite amount of energy to
measure a field at a point of space-time.  One way to handle this
situation—and one of the starting points for axiomatic
reformulations of QFT—is not to consider fields at a point but
instead fields which are smeared out in the vicinity of that point
using certain functions, so-called test functions.  The result is a
smeared field φ(<em>f</em>) =
 <font size="+1">∫</font> φ(<em>x</em>)<em>f</em>(<em>x</em>)<em>dx</em>
with supp(<em>f</em>) ⊂ 
 <span class="scriptuc">O</span>,
  where supp(<em>f</em>) is the support of the test function <em>f</em>
and
 <span class="scriptuc">O</span>
 is a bounded open region in Minkowski space-time.</p>

<p>

The third important problem for standard QFT which prompted
reformulations is the existence of <b>inequivalent representations</b>.  In
the context of quantum mechanics, Schrödinger, Dirac, Jordan and
von Neumann realized that Heisenberg's matrix mechanics and
Schrödinger's wave mechanics are just two (unitarily) equivalent
representations of the same underlying abstract structure, i.e., an
abstract Hilbert space 
 <span class="scriptuc">H</span> and linear operators acting on this
space.  In other words, we are merely dealing with two different ways
for representing the same physical reality, and it is possible to
switch between these different representations by means of a unitary
transformation, i.e. an operation that is analogous to an innocuous
rotation of the frame of reference. <em>Representations</em> of some
given algebra or group are sets of mathematical objects, like numbers,
rotations or more abstract transformations (e.g. differential
operators) together with a binary operation (e.g. addition or
multiplication) that combines any two elements of the algebra or
group, such that the structure of the algebra or group to be
represented is preserved. This means that the combination of any two
elements in the representation space, say <em>a</em> and <em>b</em>,
leads to a third element which corresponds to the element that results
when you combine the elements corresponding to <em>a</em>
and <em>b</em> in the algebra or group that is represented.  In
1931 von Neumann gave a detailed proof (of a conjecture by Stone) that
the canonical commutation relations (CCRs) for position coordinates
and their conjugate momentum coordinates in configuration space fix
the representation of these two sets of operators in Hilbert space up
to unitary equivalence (von Neumann's uniqueness theorem).  This means
that the specification of the purely algebraic CCRs suffices to
describe a particular physical system.
</p>
  

<p>
 
In quantum <em>field</em> theory, however, von Neumann's uniqueness
theorem looses its validity since here one is dealing with an infinite
number of degrees of freedom. Now one is confronted with a multitude
of <em>inequivalent</em> irreducible representations of the CCRs and
it is not obvious what this means physically and how one should cope
with it. Since the troublesome inequivalent representations
of the CCRs that arise in QFT are all <em>irreducible</em> their
inequivalence is not due to the fact that some are reducible while
others are not (a representation is <em>reducible</em> if there is an
invariant subrepresentation, i.e. a subset which alone represent the
CCRs already).  Since inequivalent irreducible representations (short:
IIRs) seem to describe different physical states of affairs it is no
longer legitimate to simply choose the most convenient representation,
just like choosing the most convenient frame of reference.  The
acuteness of this problem is not immediately clear, since prima facie
it is possibly that all but one of the IIRs are physically irrelevant,
i.e. mathematical artefacts of a redundant formalism. However,
although apparently this applies to most of the available IIRs, it
seems that a number of irreducible representations of the CCRs remain
that are inequivalent <em>and</em> physically relevant.
</p>

<h3><a name="AlgPoiVie">4.2 Algebraic Approaches to QFT</a></h3>

<p>
According to the algebraic point of view <em>algebras</em> of
observables rather than observables themselves in a particular
representation should be taken as the basic entities in the
mathematical description of quantum physics; thereby avoiding the
above-mentioned problems from the outset. In standard QM the algebraic
point of view in terms of <em>C</em>*-algebras makes no notable
difference to the usual Hilbert space formulation since both
formalisms are equivalent. However, in QFT this is no longer the case
since the infinite number of degrees of freedom leads to
unitarily <em>inequivalent</em> irreducible representations of
a <em>C</em>*-algebra. Thus sticking to the usual Hilbert space
formulation tacitly implies choosing one particular representation.
The notion of <em>C</em>*-algebras, introduced abstractly by
Gelfand and Neumark in 1943 and named this way by Segal in 1947,
generalizes the notion of the
algebra <span class="scriptuc">B</span>(<span class="scriptuc">H</span>)
of all bounded operators on a Hilbert
space <span class="scriptuc">H</span>, which is also the most
important example for a <em>C</em>*-algebra.  In fact, it can be shown
that any <em>C</em>*-algebra is isomorphic to a (norm-closed,
self-adjoint) algebra of bounded operators on a Hilbert space.  The
boundedness (and self-adjointness) of the operators is the reason
why <em>C</em>*-algebras are considered as ideal for representing
physical observables.  The 'C' indicates that one is dealing with a
complex vector space and the '*' refers to the operation that maps an
element <em>A</em> of an algebra to its <em>involution</em> (or
adjoint) <em>A</em>*, which generalizes the conjugate complex of
complex numbers to operators. This involution is needed in order to
define the crucial norm property of <em>C</em>*-algebras, which is of
central importance for the proof of the above isomorphism claim.
</p>

<p> Another point where algebraic formulations are advantageous
derives from the fact that two quantum fields are physically
equivalent when they generate the same algebras of local observables.
Such equivalent quantum field theories belong to the same so-called
Borchers class which entails that they lead to the same
<em>S</em>-matrix.  As Haag (1996) stresses, fields are only an
instrument in order to “coordinatize” observables, more
precisely: sets of observables, with respect to different finite
space-time regions.  The choice of a particular field system is to a
certain degree conventional, namely as long as it belongs to the same
Borchers class. Thus it is more appropriate to consider these
algebras, rather than quantum fields, as the fundamental entities in
QFT.</p>

<p>
A prominent attempt to axiomatise QFT is Wightman's field axiomatics
from the early 1950s. Wightman imposed axioms on polynomial
algebras <span class="scriptuc">P</span>(<span class="scriptuc">O</span>)
of smeared fields, i.e., sums of products of smeared fields in finite
space-time regions <span class="scriptuc">O</span>.  A crucial point
of this approach is replacing the mapping
<em>x</em> → φ(<em>x</em>) by 
<span class="scriptuc">O</span> →
<span class="scriptuc">P</span>(<span class="scriptuc">O</span>).
While the usage of unbounded field operators makes Wightman's approach
mathematically cumbersome, <b>Algebraic Quantum Field Theory
(AQFT)</b>—arguably the most successful attempt to reformulate
QFT axiomatically—employs only bounded operators.  AQFT
originated in the late 1950s by the work of Haag and quickly advanced
in collaboration with Araki and Kastler. AQFT itself exists in two
versions, concrete AQFT (Haag-Araki) and abstract AQFT (Haag-Kastler,
1964). The concrete approach uses von Neumann algebras
(or <em>W</em>*-algebras), the abstract one <em>C</em>*-algebras. The
adjective ‘abstract’ refers to the fact that in this
approach the algebras are characterized in an abstract fashion and not
by explicitly using operators on a Hilbert space. In standard QFT, the
CCRs together with the field equations can be used for the same
purpose, i.e., an abstract characterization. One common aim of these
axiomatizations of QFT is avoiding the usual approximations of
standard QFT. However, trying to do this in a strictly axiomatic way,
one only gets ‘reformulations’ which are not as rich as
standard QFT. As Haag (1996) concedes, the “algebraic approach
[…] has given us a frame and a language not a
theory”.</p>

<h3><a name="BasIdeAQF">4.3 Basic Ideas of AQFT</a></h3>

<p>
One of the crucial ideas of AQFT is taking so-called <em>nets of
algebras</em> as basic for the mathematical description of a quantum
physical system. A decade earlier, Segal (1947) used a
single <em>C</em>*-algebra—generated by all bounded operators—and dismissed the availability of inequivalent representations
as irrelevant to physics. Against this approach Haag argued that
inequivalent representations can be understood physically by realizing
that the important physical information in a quantum field theory is
not contained in individual algebras but in the net of algebras,
i.e. in the mapping
 <span class="scriptuc">O</span> →
 <span class="scriptuc">A</span>(<span class="scriptuc">O</span>) from
finite space-time regions to algebras of local observables. The
crucial point is that it is <em>not</em> necessary to specify
observables explicitly in order to fix physically meaningful
quantities.  The very way how algebras of local observables are linked
to space-time regions is sufficient to supply observables with
physical significance. It is the partition of the algebra
 <span class="scriptuc">A</span><sub><em>loc</em></sub>
of <em>all</em> local observables into subalgebras which contains physical
information about the observables, i.e., it is the net structure of
algebras which matters.</p>

<p>
Physically the most important notion of AQFT is the principle of
<em>locality</em> which has an external as well as an internal aspect.
The external aspect is the fact that AQFT considers only observables
connected with finite regions of space-time and not global observables
like the total charge or the total energy momentum vector which refer
to infinite space-time regions. This approach was motivated by the
operationalistic view that QFT is a statistical theory about local
measurement outcomes with all the experimental information coming from
measurements in finite space-time regions. Accordingly everything is
expressed in terms of <em>local algebras</em> of observables. The
internal aspect of locality is that there is a constraint on the
observables of such local algebras: All observables of a local algebra
connected with a space-time region
  <span class="scriptuc">O</span> 
 are required to commute with all observables of another algebra which
is associated with a space-time region
  <span class="scriptuc">O</span>′
 that is space-like separated from
  <span class="scriptuc">O</span>.
 This principle of (Einstein) <em>causality</em> is the main
relativistic ingredient of AQFT.</p>

<p>

The basic structure upon which the assumptions or conditions of AQFT
are imposed are local observables, i.e., self-adjoint elements in
local (non-commutative) von Neumann-algebras, and physical states,
which are identified as positive, linear, normalized functionals which
map elements of local algebras to real numbers. States can thus be
understood as assignments of expectation values to observables.  One
can group the assumptions of AQFT into relativistic axioms, such as
locality and covariance, general physical assumptions, like isotony
and spectrum condition, and finally technical assumptions which are
closely related to the mathematical formulation.</p>

<p>
As a reformulation of QFT, AQFT is expected to reproduce the main
phenomena of QFT, in particular properties which are characteristic of
it being a field theory, like the existence of antiparticles, internal
quantum numbers, the relation of spin and statistics, etc. That this
aim could not be achieved on a purely axiomatic basis is partly due to
the fact that the connection between the respective key concepts of
AQFT and QFT, i.e., observables and quantum fields, is not
sufficiently clear. It turned out that the main link between
observable algebras and quantum fields are <em>superselection
rules </em>, which put restrictions on the set of all observables and
allow for classification schemes in terms of permanent or essential

<h3><a name="AQFPhi">4.4 AQFT and the Philosopher</a></h3>

<p>
In recent years, QFT has received a lot of attention in the philosophy
of physics. Most philosophers who engage in that debate rest their
considerations on AQFT; for instance, see Baker (2009), Baker &amp;
Halvorson (2010), Earman &amp; Fraser (2006), Fraser (2008, 2009,
2011), Halvorson &amp; Müger (2007), Kronz &amp; Lupher (2005), Kuhlmann (2010a, 2010b), 
Lupher (2010), Rédei &amp; Valente (2010) and Ruetsche (2002, 2003, 2006, 2011). While most philosophers of physics who are
skeptical about this approach remained largely silent, Wallace (2006,
2011) launched an eloquent attack on the predominance of AQFT for
foundational studies about QFT. To be sure, Wallace emphasizes, his
critique is not directed against the use of algebraic methods,
e.g. when studying inequivalent representations. Rather, he aims at
AQFT as a physical theory, regarded as a rival to conventional QFT
(CQFT). In his evaluation, viewed from the 21st century, one has to
state that CQFT succeeded, while AQFT failed, so that “to be
lured away from the Standard Model by [AQFT] is sheer madness”
(Wallace 2011:124).  So what may justify this drastic conclusion? On
the one hand, Wallace points out that, the problem of ultraviolet
divergences, which initiated the search for alternative approaches in
the 1950s, was eventually solved in CQFT via the renormalization group
techniques. On the other hand, AQFT never succeeded in finding
realistic interacting quantum field theories in four dimensions (such
as QED) that fit into their framework.
</p>

<p>
Fraser (2009, 2011) is most actively engaged in defending AQFT against
Wallace's assault.  She argues (2009) that consistency plays a central
role in choosing between different formulations of QFT since they do
not differ in their respective empirical success and AQFT fares better
in this respect.  Moreover, Fraser (2011) questions Wallace's crucial
point in defense of CQFT, namely that the empirically successful
application of renormalization group techniques in QFT removes all
doubts about CQFT: The fact that renormalization in condensed matter
physics and QFT are formally similar does not license Wallace's claim
that there are also physical similarities concerning the freezing out
of degrees of freedom at very small length scales. And if that
physical analogy cannot be sustained, then the empirical success of
renormalization in CQFT leaves the physical reasons for this success
in the dark, in contrast to the case of condensed matter physics,
where the physical basis for the empirical success of renormalization
is intelligible, namely the fact that matter is discrete at atomic
length scales. As a consequence, despite of the formal analogy with
renormalization in condensed matter physics the empirical success of
renormalization in CQFT does not, as Wallace claims, discredit the
idea to work with arbitrarily small regions of spacetime, as it is
done in AQFT.
</p>

<p>
Kuhlmann (2010b) also advocates AQFT as the prime object for
foundational studies, focusing on ontological considerations. He
argues that for matters of ontology AQFT is to be preferred over CQFT
because, like ontology itself, AQFT strives for a clear separation of
fundamental and derived entities and a parsimonious selection of basic
assumptions. CQFT, on the other hand is a grown formalism that is very
good for calculations but obscures foundational issues.  Moreover,
Kuhlmann contends that AQFT and CQFT should not be regarded as rival
research programs. Nowadays at the very least, AQFT is not meant to
replace CQFT, despite of the “kill it or cure it” slogan
(Streater and Wightman 1964: 1, cited by Wallace 2011: 117).  AQFT is
suited and designed to illuminate the basic structure of QFT, but it
is not and never will be the appropriate framework for the working
physicist.

<h2><a name="PhiIss">5. Philosophical Issues</a></h2>

<h3><a name="Ont">5.1 Setting the Stage: Candidate Ontologies</a></h3>

<p>

Ontology is concerned with the most general features, entities and
structures of being. One can pursue ontology in a very general sense
or with respect to a particular theory or a particular part or aspect
of the world. With respect to the ontology of QFT one is tempted to
more or less dismiss ontological inquiries and to adopt the following
straightforward view. There are two groups of fundamental fermionic
matter constituents, two groups of bosonic force carriers and four
(including gravitation) kinds of interactions.  As satisfying as this
answer might first appear, the ontological questions are, in a sense,
not even touched.  Saying that, for instance the down quark is a
fundamental constituent of our material world is the starting point
rather than the end of the (philosophical) search for an ontology of
QFT. The main question is what kind of entity, e.g., the down quark
is. The answer does not depend on whether we think of down quarks or
muon neutrinos since the sought features are much more general than
those ones which constitute the difference between down quarks or muon
neutrinos. The relevant questions are of a different type. What are
particles at all? Can quantum particles be legitimately understood as
particles any more, even in the broadest sense, when we take, e.g.,
their localization properties into account?  How can one spell out
what a field is and can “quantum fields” in fact be
understood as fields?  Could it be more appropriate not to think of,
e.g., quarks, as the most fundamental entities at all, but rather of
properties or processes or events?</p>

<h4><a name="Part">5.1.1 The Particle Interpretation</a></h4>

<p>

Many of the creators of QFT can be found in one of the two camps
regarding the question whether particles or fields should be given
priority in understanding QFT. While Dirac, the later Heisenberg,
Feynman, and Wheeler opted in favor of particles, Pauli, the early
Heisenberg, Tomonaga and Schwinger put fields first (see Landsman
1996).  Today, there are a number of arguments which prepare the
ground for a proper discussion beyond mere preferences.</p>

<h5>5.1.1.1 The Particle Concept</h5>

<p>

It seems almost impossible to talk about elementary <em>particle</em>
physics, or QFT more generally, without thinking of particles which
are accelerated and scattered in colliders.  Nevertheless, it is this
very interpretation which is confronted with the most fully developed
counter-arguments. There still is the option to say that our classical
concept of a particle is too narrow and that we have to loosen some of
its constraints.  After all, even in classical corpuscular theories of
matter the concept of an (elementary) particle is not as unproblematic
as one might expect. For instance, if the whole charge of a particle
was contracted to a point, an infinite amount of energy would be
stored in this particle since the repulsive forces become infinitely
large when two charges with the same sign are brought together. The
so-called <em>self energy</em> of a point particle is infinite.</p>

<p>

Probably the most immediate trait of particles is their
<em>discreteness</em>. Particles are countable or ‘aggregable’
entities in contrast to a liquid or a mass. Obviously this
characteristic alone cannot constitute a sufficient condition for
being a particle since there are other things which are countable as
well without being particles, e.g., money or maxima and minima of the
standing wave of a vibrating string.  It seems that one also
needs <em>individuality</em>, i.e., it must be possible to say that it
is this or that particle which has been counted in order to account
for the fundamental difference between ups and downs in a wave pattern
and particles.  Teller (1995) discusses a specific conception of
individuality, <em>primitive thisness</em>, as well as other possible
features of the particle concept in comparison to classical concepts
of fields and waves, as well as in comparison to the concept of field
quanta, which is the basis for the interpretation that Teller
advocates.  A critical discussion of Teller's reasoning can be found
in Seibt (2002).  Moreover, there is an extensive debate on
individuality of quantum objects in quantum mechanical systems of
‘identical particles’. Since this discussion concerns QM
in the first place, and not QFT, any further details shall be omitted
here.  French and Krause (2006) offer a detailed analysis of the
historical, philosophical and mathematical aspects of the connection
between quantum statistics, identity and individuality.  See Dieks and
Lubberdink (2011) for a critical assessment of the debate. Also
consult the entry on
 <a href="../qt-idind/">quantum theory: identity and individuality</a>.
</p>

<p>

There is still another feature which is commonly taken to be pivotal
for the particle concept, namely that particles are localizable in
space. While it is clear from classical physics already that the
requirement of
<em>localizability</em> need not refer to point-like localization, we
will see that even localizability in an arbitrarily large but still
finite region can be a strong condition for quantum particles. Bain
(2011) argues that the classical notions of localizability and
countability are inappropriate requirements for particles if one is
considering a relativistic theory such as QFT.
</p>

<p>

Eventually, there are some potential ingredients of the particle
concept which are explicitly opposed to the corresponding (and
therefore opposite) features of the field concept. Whereas it is a
core characteristic of a field that it is a system with an infinite
<em>number of degrees of freedom</em>, the very opposite holds for
particles. A particle can for instance be referred to by the
specification of the coordinates <strong>x</strong>(<em>t</em>)
that pertain, e.g., to its center of mass—presupposing
impenetrability.  A further feature of the particle concept is
connected to the last point and again explicitly in opposition to the
field concept. In a pure particle ontology the interaction between
remote particles can only be understood as an <em>action at a
distance</em>.  In contrast to that, in a field ontology, or a
combined ontology of particles and fields, <em>local action</em> is
implemented by mediating fields.  Finally, classical particles are
massive and impenetrable, again in contrast to (classical) fields.</p>

<h5>5.1.1.2 Why QFT Seems to be About Particles</h5>
<p>

The easiest way to quantize the electromagnetic (or: radiation) field
consists of two steps. First, one Fourier analyses the vector
potential of the classical field into normal modes (using periodic
boundary conditions) corresponding to an infinite but denumerable
number of degrees of freedom. Second, since each mode is described
independently by a harmonic oscillator equation, one can apply the
harmonic oscillator treatment from non-relativistic quantum mechanics
to each single mode.  The result for the Hamiltonian of the radiation
field is</p>

<p>

with the index <em>r</em> labeling the polarisation.  These
commutation relations imply that one is dealing with a bosonic field.
</p>

<p>

The operators <em>a<sub>r</sub></em><sup>†</sup>(<strong>k</strong>)
and <em>a<sub>r</sub></em>(<strong>k</strong>)
have interesting physical interpretations as so-called particle
creation and annihilation operators. In order to see this, one has to
examine the eigenvalues of the operators</p>

<blockquote>
(2.3)    <em>N<sub>r</sub></em>(<strong>k</strong>) = 
 <em>a<sub>r</sub></em><sup>†</sup>(<strong>k</strong>)·<em>a<sub>r</sub></em>(<strong>k</strong>)
</blockquote>

<p> 

which are the essential parts in <em>H</em><sub>rad</sub>.  Due to
the commutation relations (2.2) one finds that the eigenvalues of
<em>N<sub>r</sub></em>(<strong>k</strong>) are the integers
<em>n<sub>r</sub></em>(<strong>k</strong>) = 0, 1, 2, … and the
corresponding eigenfunctions (up to a normalisation factor) are </p>

<blockquote>
 (2.4) |<em>n<sub>r</sub></em>(<strong>k</strong>)⟩ 
 =
 [<em>a<sub>r</sub></em><sup>†</sup>(<strong>k</strong>)]<sup><em>n<sub>r</sub></em>(<strong>k</strong>)</sup>|0⟩
</blockquote>

<p>
 
 where the right hand side means that
<em>a<sub>r</sub></em><sup>†</sup>(<strong>k</strong>)
operates <em>n<sub>r</sub></em>(<strong>k</strong>) times on
|0⟩, the state vector of the vacuum with no photons present.
The interpretation of these results is parallel to the one of the
harmonic
oscillator. <em>a<sub>r</sub></em><sup>†</sup>(<strong>k</strong>)
is interpreted as the <em>creation operator</em> of a photon with
momentum ℏ<strong>k</strong> and energy
ℏω<sub><strong>k</strong></sub> (and a polarisation which
depends on
<em>r</em> and <strong>k</strong>).
That is, equation (2.4) can be understood in the following way. One
gets a state with <em>n<sub>r</sub></em>(<strong>k</strong>)
photons of momentum 
ℏ<strong>k</strong>
and energy
ℏω<sub><strong>k</strong></sub>
when the creation operator
<em>a<sub>r</sub></em><sup>†</sup>(<strong>k</strong>)
operates <em>n<sub>r</sub></em>(<strong>k</strong>) times on
the vacuum state |0⟩. Accordingly,
<em>N<sub>r</sub></em>(<strong>k</strong>)
is called the <em>number operator</em> and
<em>n<sub>r</sub></em>(<strong>k</strong>)
the ‘occupation number’ of the mode that is specified by
<strong>k</strong> and <em>r</em>, i.e., this mode is occupied by
<em>n<sub>r</sub></em>(<strong>k</strong>) photons. Note that Pauli's
exclusion principle is not violated since it only applies to fermions
and not to bosons like photons. The corresponding interpretation for
the <em>annihilation operator</em>
 <em>a<sub>r</sub></em>(<strong>k</strong>) is parallel: When it
operates on a state with a given number of photons this number is
lowered by one.</p>

<p>

It is a widespread view that these results complete “the
justification for interpreting <em>N</em>(<em>k</em>) as the number
operator, and hence for the particle interpretation of the quantized
theory” (Ryder 1996: 131). This is a rash judgement,
however. For instance, the question of localizability is not even
touched while it is certain that this is a pivotal criterion for
something to be a particle. All that is established so far is that
certain mathematical quantities in the formalism are
discrete. However, countability is merely one feature of particles and
not at all conclusive evidence for a <b>particle interpretation of
QFT</b> yet . It is not clear at this stage whether we are in fact
dealing with particles or with fundamentally different objects which
only have this one feature of discreteness in common with
particles.</p>

<p>
Teller (1995) argues that the Fock space or “occupation number” representation does support a particle ontology in terms
of <b>field quanta</b> since these can be counted or aggregated,
although not numbered. The degree of excitation of a certain mode of
the underlying field determines the number of objects, i.e. the
particles in the sense of quanta. Labels for individual particles like
in the Schrödinger many-particle formalism do not occur any more,
which is the crucial deviation from the classical notion of
particles. However, despite of this deviation, says Teller, quanta
should be regarded as particles: Besides their countability another
fact that supports seeing quanta as particles is that they have the
same energies as classical particles.  Teller has been criticized for
drawing unduly far-reaching ontological conclusions from one
particular representation, in particular since the Fock space
representation cannot be appropriate in general because it is only
valid for free particles (see, e.g., Fraser 2008).  In order to avoid
this problem Bain (2000) proposes an alternative quanta interpretation
that rests on the notion of asymptotically free states in scattering
theory.  For a further discussion of the quanta interpretation see the
subsection on inequivalent representations below.</p>

<p>
The vacuum state |0⟩ is the energy ground state, i.e., the
eigenstate of the energy operator with the lowest eigenvalue. It is a
remarkable result in ordinary non-relativistic QM that the ground
state energy of e.g., the harmonic oscillator is <em>not</em> zero in
contrast to its analogue in classical mechanics. In addition to this,
the relativistic <b>vacuum of QFT</b> has the even more striking
feature that the expectation values for various quantities do not
vanish, which prompts the question what it is that has these values or
gives rise to them if the vacuum is taken to be the state with no
particles present. If particles were the basic objects of QFT how can
it be that there are physical phenomena even if nothing is there
according to this very ontology? Eventually, studies of QFT in curved
space-time indicate that the existence of a particle number operator
might be a contingent property of the flat Minkowski space-time,
because Poincaré symmetry is used to pick out a preferred
representation of the canonical commutation relations which is
equivalent to picking out a preferred vacuum state (see Wald
1994).</p>

<p>
Before exploring whether other (potentially) necessary requirements
for the applicability of the particle concept are fulfilled let us see
what the alternatives are. Proceeding this way makes it easier to
evaluate the force of the following arguments in a more balanced
manner.
</p>

<h4><a name="Field">5.1.2 The Field Interpretation</a></h4>

<p>
Since various arguments seem to speak against a particle
interpretation, the allegedly only alternative, namely a field
interpretation, is often taken to be the appropriate ontology of
QFT. So let us see what a physical field is and why QFT may be
interpreted in this sense.  A classical point particle can be
described by its position <strong>x</strong>(<em>t</em>) and its
momentum <strong>p</strong>(<em>t</em>), which change as the
time <em>t</em> progresses. So there are six degrees of freedom for
the motion of a point particle corresponding to the three coordinates
of the particle's position and three more coordinates for its
momentum. In the case of a classical field one has an independent
value for each single point <strong>x</strong> in space, where this
specification changes as time progresses. The field value φ can be
a scalar quantity, like temperature, a vectorial one as for the
electromagnetic field, or a tensor, such as the stress tensor for a
crystal.  A field is therefore specified by a time-dependent mapping
from each point of space to a field value
φ(<strong>x</strong>,<em>t</em>).  Thus a field is a system with
an infinite number of degrees of freedom, which may be restrained by
some field equations.  Whereas the intuitive notion of a field is that
it is something transient and fundamentally different from matter, it
can be shown that it is possible to ascribe energy and momentum to a
pure field even in the absence of matter. This somewhat surprising
fact shows how gradual the distinction between fields and matter
can be.</p>

<p>

The transition from a classical field theory to a quantum field theory
is characterized by the occurrence of <em>operator-valued</em> quantum
fields φ̂(<strong>x</strong>,<em>t</em>),
and corresponding conjugate fields, for both of which certain
canonical commutation relations hold.  Thus there is an obvious formal
analogy between classical and quantum fields: in both cases field
values are attached to space-time points, where these values are
specified by real numbers in the case of classical fields and
operators in the case of quantum fields. That is, the mapping

<strong>x</strong> ↦
φ̂(<strong>x</strong>,<em>t</em>)

in QFT is analogous to the classical mapping

<strong>x</strong> ↦
φ(<strong>x</strong>,<em>t</em>).

Due to this formal analogy it appears to be beyond any doubt that QFT is a field theory. 
</p>

<p>

But is a systematic association of certain mathematical terms with all
points in space-time really enough to establish a field theory in a
proper physical sense? Is it not essential for a physical field theory
that some kind of real physical <em>properties</em> are allocated to
space-time points? This requirement seems not fulfilled in QFT,
however.  Teller (1995: ch. 5) argues that the expression <em>quantum
field</em> is only justified on a “perverse reading” of
the notion of a field, since no definite physical values whatsoever
are assigned to space-time points. Instead, quantum field operators
represent the whole spectrum of possible values so that they rather
have the status of observables (Teller: “determinables”)
or general solutions.  Only a specific <em>configuration</em>, i.e. an
ascription of definite values to the field observables at all points
in space, can count as a proper physical field.
</p>

<p>
There are at least four proposals for a field interpretation of QFT,
all of which respect the fact that the operator-valuedness of quantum
fields impedes their direct reading as physical fields.</p>

<p>
(i) Teller (1995) argues that definite physical quantities emerge when
not only the quantum field operators but also the state of the system
is taken into account. More specifically, for a given state |ψ⟩
one can calculate the expectation values
⟨ψ|φ(<em>x</em>)|ψ⟩ which yields an ascription of
definite physical values to all points x in space and thus
a <em>configuration</em> of the operator-valued quantum field that may
be seen as a proper physical field.  The main problem with proposal
(i), and possibly with (ii), too, is that an expectation value is the
average value of a whole sequence of measurements, so that it does not
qualify as the physical property of any actual single field system, no
matter whether this property is a pre-existing (or categorical) value
or a propensity (or disposition).
</p>

<p>
(ii) The vacuum expectation value or <b>VEV interpretation</b>,
advocated by Wayne (2002), exploits a theorem by Wightman
(1956). According to this reconstruction theorem all the information
that is encoded in quantum field operators can be equivalently
described by an infinite hierarchy of <em>n</em>-point vacuum
expectation values, namely the expectation values of all products of
quantum field operators at <em>n</em> (in general different)
space-time points, calculated for the vacuum state.  Since this
collection of vacuum expectation values comprises only definite
physical values it qualifies as a proper field configuration, and,
Wayne argues, due to Wightman's theorem, so does the equivalent set of
quantum field operators. Thus, and this is the upshot of Wayne's
argument, an ascription of quantum field operators to all space-time
points does by itself constitute a field configuration, namely for the
vacuum state, even if this is not the actual state.</p>

<p>
But this is also a problem for the VEV interpretation: While it shows
nicely that much more information is encoded in the quantum field
operators than just unspecifically what could be measured, it still
does not yield anything like an <em>actual</em> field
configuration. While this last requirement is likely to be too strong
in a quantum theoretical context anyway, the next proposal may come at
least somewhat closer to it.</p>

<p>
(iii) In recent years the term <b>wave functional interpretation</b>
has been established as the name for the default field interpretation
of QFT. Correspondingly, it is the most widely discussed extant
proposal; see, e.g., Huggett (2003), Halvorson and Müger (2007),
Baker (2009) and Lupher (2010).  In effect, it is not very different
from proposal (i), and with further assumptions for (i) even
identical. However, proposal (ii) phrases things differently and in a
very appealing way.  The basic idea is that quantized fields should be
interpreted completely analogously to quantized one-particle states,
just as both result analogously from imposing canonical commutation
relations on the non-operator-valued classical quantities. In the case
of a quantum mechanical particle, its state can be described by a wave
function ψ(x), which maps positions to probability amplitudes,
where |ψ(<em>x</em>)|<sup>2</sup> can be interpreted as the
probability for the particle to be measured at
position <em>x</em>. For a field, the analogue of positions are
classical field configurations φ(<em>x</em>), i.e. assignments of
field values to points in space. And so, the analogy continues, just
as a quantum particle is described by a wave function that maps
positions to probabilities (or rather probability amplitudes) for the
particle to be measured at <em>x</em>, quantum fields can be
understood in terms of <em>wave functionals</em>
ψ[φ(<em>x</em>)] that map functions to numbers, namely
classical field configurations φ(<em>x</em>) to probability
amplitudes, where |ψ[φ(<em>x</em>)]|<sup>2</sup> can be
interpreted as the probability for a given quantum field system to be
found in configuration φ(<em>x</em>) when measured.  Thus just as
a quantum state in ordinary single-particle QM can be interpreted as a
superposition of classical localized particle states, the state of a
quantum field system, so says the wave functional approach, can be
interpreted as a superposition of classical field configurations. And
what superpositions mean depends on one's general interpretation of
quantum probabilities (collapse with propensities, Bohmian hidden
variables, branching Everettian many-worlds,…).  In practice,
however, QFT is hardly ever represented in wave functional space
because usually there is little interest in measuring field
configurations. Rather, one tries to measures ‘particle’ states and
therefore works in Fock space.
</p>

<p>
(iv) For a modification of proposal (iii), indicated in Baker (2009:
sec. 5) and explicitly formulated as an alternative interpretation by
Lupher (2010), see the end of the section “Non-Localizability
Theorems” below.
</p>

<h4><a name="OSR">5.1.3 Ontic Structural Realism</a></h4>

<p>
The multitude of problems for particle as well as field
interpretations prompted a number of alternative ontological
approaches to QFT. Auyang (1995) and Dieks (2002) propose different
versions of event ontologies. Seibt (2002) and Hättich (2004)
defend process-ontological accounts of QFT, which are scrutinized in
Kuhlmann (2002, 2010a: ch. 10).  In recent years, however, ontic
structural realism (OSR) has become the most fashionable ontological
framework for modern physics.  While so far the vast majority of
studies concentrates on ordinary QM and General Relativity Theory, it
seems to be commonly believed among advocates of OSR that their case
is even stronger regarding QFT, in light of the paramount significance
of symmetry groups (also see below)—hence the name <em>group
structural realism</em> (Roberts 2010).  Explicit arguments are few
and far between, however.
</p>
 

<p> 
One of the rare arguments in favor of OSR that deal specifically
with QFT is due to Kantorovich (2003), who opts for a Platonic version
of OSR; a position that is otherwise not very popular among
OSRists. Kantorovich argues that directly after the big bang
“the world was baryon-free, whereas the symmetry of grand
unification existed as an abstract structure” (p. 673).  Cao
(1997b) points out that the best ontological access to QFT is gained
by concentrating on structural properties rather than on any
particular category of entities.  Cao (2010) advocates a
“constructive structural realism” on the basis of a
detailed conceptual investigation of the formation of quantum
chromodynamics.  However, Kuhlmann (2011) shows that Cao's position
has little to do with what is usually taken to be ontic structural
realism, and that it is not even clear whether it should at least be
rated as an epistemic variant of structural realism.
</p>
 

<p> Lyre (2004) argues that the central significance of gauge theories
in modern physics supports structural realism, and offers a case study
concerning the <em>U</em>(1) gauge symmetry group, which characterizes
QED.  Recently Lyre (2012) has been advocating an intermediate form of
OSR, which he calls “Extended OSR (ExtOSR)”, according to
which there are not only relational structural properties but also
structurally derived intrinsic properties, namely the invariants of
structure: mass, spin, and charge. Lyre claims that only ExtOSR is in
a position to account for gauge theories.  Moreover, it can make sense
of zero-value properties, such as the zero mass of photons.  See the
Section 4.2 (OSR and Quantum Field Theory) in the SEP entry on

 <a href="../structural-realism/">structural realism</a>.
</p>

<h4><a name="Trope">5.1.4 Trope Ontology</a></h4>

<p>
Kuhlmann (2010a) proposes a <b>Dispositional Trope Ontology (DTO)</b>
as the most appropriate ontological reading of the basic structure of
QFT, in particular in its algebraic formulation, AQFT. The term
‘trope’ refers to a conception of properties that breaks
with tradition by regarding properties as particulars rather than
repeatables (or ‘universals’). This new conception of
properties permits analyzing objects as pure bundles of
properties/tropes without excluding the possibility of having
different objects with (qualitatively but not numerically) exactly the
same properties.  One of Kuhlmann's crucial points is that (A)QFT
speaks in favor of a bundle conception of objects because the net
structure of observable algebras alone (see section “Basic Ideas
of AQFT” above) encodes the fundamental features of a given
quantum field theory, e.g. its charge structure.</p>

<p>
In the DTO approach, the essential properties/tropes of a trope bundle
are then identified with the defining characteristics of a
superselection sector, such as different kinds of charges, mass and
spin.  Since these properties cannot change by any state transition
they guarantee the object's identity over time.  Superselection
sectors are inequivalent irreducible representations of the algebra of
all quasi-local observables.  While the essential properties/tropes of
an object are permanent, its non-essential ones may change.  Since we
are dealing with quantum physical systems many properties are
dispositions (or propensities); hence the name <em>dispositional</em>
trope ontology.</p>

<p>
A trope bundle is not individuated via spatio-temporal co-localization
but because of the particularity of its constitutive tropes.  Morganti
(2009) also advocates a trope-ontological reading of QFT, which refers
directly to the classification scheme of the Standard Model.

<h3><a name="Wigner">5.2 Did Wigner Define the Particle Concept?</a></h3>

<p>

Wigner's (1939) famous analysis of the Poincaré group is often
assumed to provide a definition of elementary particles.  The main
idea of Wigner's approach is the supposition that each irreducible
(projective) representation of the relevant space-time symmetry group
yields the state space of one kind of elementary physical system,
where the prime example is an elementary particle which has the more
restrictive property of being structureless.  The physical
justification for linking up irreducible representations with
elementary systems is the requirement that “there must be no
relativistically invariant distinction between the various states of
the system” (Newton &amp; Wigner 1949).  In other words the
state space of an elementary system shall have no internal structure
with respect to relativistic transformations.  Put more technically,
the state space of an elementary system must not contain any
relativistically invariant subspaces, i.e., it must be the state space
of an irreducible representation of the relevant invariance group. If
the state space of an elementary system had relativistically invariant
subspaces then it would be appropriate to associate these subspaces
with elementary systems.  The requirement that a state space has to be
relativistically invariant means that starting from any of its states
it must be possible to get to all the other states by superposition of
those states which result from relativistic transformations of the
state one started with.  The main part of Wigner's analysis consists
in finding and classifying all the irreducible representations of the
Poincaré group.  Doing that involves finding relativistically
invariant quantities that serve to classify the irreducible
representations.  Wigner's pioneering identification of types of
particles with irreducible unitary representations of the
Poincaré group has been exemplary until the present, as it is
emphasized, e.g., in Buchholz (1994).  For an alternative perspective
focusing on “Wigner's legacy” for ontic structural realism
see Roberts (2011).</p>

<p>

Regarding the question whether Wigner has supplied a definition of
particles, one must say that although Wigner has in fact found a
highly valuable and fruitful <em>classification</em> of particles, his
analysis does not contribute very much to the question what a particle
is and whether a given theory can be interpreted in terms of
particles. What Wigner has given is rather a conditional
answer. <em>If</em> relativistic quantum mechanics can be interpreted
in terms of particles <em>then</em> the possible types of particles
and their invariant properties can be determined via an analysis of
the irreducible unitary representations of the Poincaré
group. However, the question whether, and if yes in what sense, at
least relativistic quantum mechanics can be interpreted as a particle
theory at all is not addressed in Wigner's analysis. For this reason
the discussion of the particle interpretation of QFT is not finished
with Wigner's analysis as one might be tempted to say. For instance,
the pivotal question of the localizability of particle states, to be
discussed below, is still open. Moreover, once interactions are
included, Wigner's classification is no longer applicable (see Bain
2000). Kuhlmann (2010a: sec. 8.1.2) offers an accessible introduction
to Wigner's analysis and discusses its interpretive relevance.</p>

<h3><a name="NonLoc">5.3 Non-Localizability Theorems</a></h3>

<p>
The observed ‘particle traces’, e.g., on photographic
plates of bubble chambers, seem to be a clear indication for the
existence of particles. However, the theory which has been built on
the basis of these scattering experiments, QFT, turns out to have
considerable problems to account for the observed ‘particle
trajectories’. Not only are sharp trajectories excluded by
Heisenberg's uncertainty relations for position and momentum
coordinates, which hold for non-relativistic quantum mechanics
already. More advanced examinations in AQFT show that ‘quantum
particles’ which behave according to the principles of
relativity theory cannot be localized in any bounded region of
space-time, no matter how large, a result which excludes even
tube-like trajectories. It thus appears to be impossible that our
world is composed of particles when we assume that localizability is a
necessary ingredient of the particle concept.  So far there is no
single unquestioned argument against the possibility of a particle
interpretation of QFT but the problems are piling up. Reeh &amp;
Schlieder, Hegerfeldt, Malament and Redhead all gained mathematical
results, or formalized their interpretation, which prove that certain
sets of assumptions, which are taken to be essential for the particle
concept, lead to contradictions.</p>

<p>
The <b>Reeh-Schlieder theorem</b> (1961) is a central result in
AQFT. It asserts that acting on the vacuum state Ω with elements
of the von Neumann observable algebra <em>R</em>(<em>O</em>) for open
space-time region <em>O</em>, one can approximate as closely as one
likes any state in Hilbertspace
<span class="scriptuc">H</span>, in particular one that is very
different from the vacuum in some space-like separated
region <em>O</em>′. The Reeh-Schlieder theorem is thus
exploiting long distance correlations of the vacuum.  Or one can
express the result by saying that local measurements do not allow for
a distinction between an N-particle state and the vacuum state.
Redhead's (1995a) take on the Reeh-Schlieder theorem is that local
measurements can never decide whether one observes an N-particle
state, since a projection operator <em>P</em><sub>Ψ</sub> which
corresponds to an N-particle state Ψ can never be an element of a
local algebra
<em>R</em>(<em>O</em>). Clifton &amp; Halvorson (2001) discuss what
this means for the issue of entanglement. Halvorson (2001) shows that
an alternative “Newton-Wigner” localization scheme fails
to evade the problem of localization posed by the Reeh-Schlieder
theorem.
</p>

<p>
<b>Malament</b> (1996) formulates a <b>no-go theorem</b> to the effect
that a relativistic quantum theory of a fixed number of particles
predicts a zero probability for finding a particle in any spatial set,
provided four conditions are satisfied, namely concerning translation
covariance, energy, localizability and locality.
The <em>localizability condition</em> is the essential ingredient of
the particle concept: A particle—in contrast to a
field—cannot be found in two disjoint spatial sets at the same
time.  The <em>locality condition</em> is the main relativistic part
of Malament's assumptions. It requires that the statistics for
measurements in one space-time region must not depend on whether or
not a measurement has been performed in a space-like related second
space-time region.  Malament's proof has the weight of a no-go theorem
provided that we accept his four conditions as natural assumptions for
a particle interpretation.  A relativistic quantum theory of a fixed
number of particles, satisfying in particular the localizability and
the locality condition, has to assume a world devoid of particles (or
at least a world in which particles can never be detected) in order
not to contradict itself. Malament's no-go theorem thus seems to show
that there is no middle ground between QM and QFT, i.e., no theory
which deals with a fixed number of particles (like in QM) and which is
relativistic (like QFT) without running into the localizability
problem of the no-go theorem. One is forced towards QFT which, as
Malament is convinced, can only be understood as a field
theory. Nevertheless, whether or not a particle interpretation of QFT
is in fact ruled out by Malament's result is a point of debate. At
least prima facie Malament's no-go theorem alone cannot supply a final
answer since it assumes a fixed number of particles, an assumption
that is not valid in the case of QFT.</p>

<p>

The results about non-localizability which have been explored above
may appear to be not very astonishing in the light of the following
facts about ordinary QM: Quantum mechanical wave functions (in
position representation) are usually smeared out over all
 ℜ<sup>3</sup>,
 so that everywhere in space there is a non-vanishing probability for
finding a particle. This is even the case arbitrarily close after a
sharp position measurement due to the instantaneous spreading of wave
packets over all space. Note, however, that ordinary QM is
non-relativistic. A conflict with SRT would thus not be very
surprising although it is not yet clear whether the above-mentioned
quantum mechanical phenomena can actually be exploited to allow for
superluminal signalling.  QFT, on the other side, has been designed to
be in accordance with special relativity theory (SRT). The local
behavior of phenomena is one of the leading principles upon which the
theory was built. This makes non-localizability within the formalism
of QFT a much severer problem for a particle interpretation.</p>

<p>

Malament's reasoning has come under attack in Fleming &amp;
Butterfield (1999) and Busch (1999). Both argue to the effect that
there are <b>alternatives to Malament's conclusion</b>. The main line
of thought in both criticisms is that Malament's ‘mathematical
result’ might just as well be interpreted as evidence that the
assumed concept of a sharp localization operator is flawed and has to
be modified either by allowing for unsharp localization (Busch 1999)
or for so-called “hyperplane dependent localization”
(Fleming &amp; Butterfield 1999). In Saunders (1995) a different
conclusion from Malament's (as well as from similar) results is
drawn. Rather than granting Malament's four conditions and deriving a
problem for a particle interpretation Saunders takes Malament's proof
as further evidence that one can not hold on to all four
conditions. According to Saunders it is the localizability condition
which might not be a natural and necessary requirement on second
thought.  Stressing that “relativity requires the language of
events, not of things” Saunders argues that the localizability
condition loses its plausibility when it is applied to events: It
makes no sense to postulate that the same event can not occur at two
disjoint spatial sets at the same time. One can only require for the
same <em>kind</em> of event not to occur at both places.  For Saunders
the particle interpretation as such is not at stake in Malament's
argument. The question is rather whether QFT speaks about things at
all. Saunders considers Malament's result to give a negative answer to
this question.  A kind of meta paper on Malament's theorem is
Halvorson &amp; Clifton (2002). Various objections to the choice of
Malament's assumptions and his conclusion are considered and
rebutted. Moreover, Halvorson and Clifton establish two further no-go
theorems which preserve Malament's theorem by weakening tacit
assumptions and showing that the general conclusion still holds.  One
thing seems to be clear. Since Malament's ‘mathematical
result’ appears to allow for various different conclusions it
cannot be taken as conclusive evidence against the tenability of a
particle interpretation of QFT and the same applies to Redhead's
interpretation of the Reeh-Schlieder theorem. For a more detailed
exposition and comparison of the Reeh-Schlieder theorem and Malament's
theorem see Kuhlmann (2010a: sec. 8.3).</p>

<p>
Does the <b>field interpretation</b> also suffer from problems
concerning non-localizability?  In the section “Deficiencies of
the Conventional Formulation of QFT” we already saw that,
strictly speaking, field operators cannot be defined at points but
need to be smeared out in the (finite and arbitrarily small) vicinity
of points, giving rise to smeared field
operators <span class="overstrike">φ<span class="up">ˆ</span></span>(<em>f</em>),
which represent the weighted average field value in the respective
region. This procedure leads to operator-valued distributions instead
of operator-valued fields. The lack of field operators at points
appears to be analogous to the lack of position operators in QFT,
which troubles the particle interpretation. However, for position
operators there is no remedy analogous to that for field operators:
while even unsharply localized particle positions do not exist in QFT
(see Halvorson and Clifton 2002, theorem 2), the existence of smeared
field operators demonstrates that there are at least point-like field
operators.  On this basis Lupher (2010) proposes a “modified
field ontology”.</p>

<h3><a name="InRep">5.4 Inequivalent Representations</a></h3>

<p>
The occurrence of inequivalent representations is a grave obstacle for
interpreting QFT, which is increasingly rated as the single most
important problem, that has no counterpart whatsoever in standard
QM. As we saw in the section “Deficiencies of the Conventional
Formulation of QFT”, the quantization of a theory with an
infinite number of degrees of freedom, such as a field theory, leads
to unitarily <em>inequivalent</em> representations (UIR) of the
canonical commutation relations.  It is highly controversial what the
availability of UIRs means. One possible stance is to dismiss them as
mathematical artifacts with no physical relevance. Ruetsche (2002)
calls this “Hilbert Space Conservatism”. On the one hand,
this view fits well to the fact that UIRs are hardly even mentioned in
standard textbooks on QFT. On the other hand, this cannot be the last
word because UIRs undoubtedly do real work in physics, e.g. in quantum
statistical mechanics (see Ruetsche 2003) and in particular when it
comes to spontaneous symmetry breaking.
</p>

<p> The coexistence of UIRs can be readily understood looking at
ferromagnetism (see Ruetsche 2006). At high temperatures the atomic
dipoles in ferromagnetic substances fluctuate randomly.  Below a
certain temperature the atomic dipoles tend to align to each other in
some direction. Since the basic laws governing this phenomenon are
rotationally symmetrical, no direction is preferred. Thus once the
dipoles have “chosen” one particular direction, the
symmetry is broken. Since there is a different ground state for each
direction of magnetization, one needs different Hilbert
spaces—each containing a unique ground state—in order to
describe symmetry breaking systems. Correspondingly, one has to employ
inequivalent representations.
</p>

<p>
One important interpretive issue where UIRs play a crucial role is
the <b>Unruh effect</b>: a uniformly accelerated observer in a
Minkowski vacuum should detect a thermal bath of particles, the
so-called Rindler quanta (Unruh 1976, Unruh &amp; Wald 1984). A mere
change of the reference frame thus seems to bring particles into
being. Since the very existence of the basic entities of an ontology
should be invariant under transformations of the referential frame the
Unruh effect constitutes a severe challenge to a particle
interpretation of QFT.  Teller (1995: 110-113) tries to dispel this
problem by pointing out that while the Minkowski vacuum has the
definite value zero for the Minkowski number operator, the particle
number is indefinite for the Rindler number operator, since one has a
superposition of Rindler quanta states. This means that there are only
propensities for detecting different numbers of Rindler quanta but no
actual quanta. However, this move is problematic since it seems to
suggest that quantum physical propensities in general don't need to be
taken fully for real.</p>

<p>
Clifton and Halvorson (2001b) argue, contra Teller, that it is
inapproriate to give priority to either the Minkowski or the Rindler
perspective. Both are needed for a complete picture. The Minkowski as
well as the Rindler representation are true descriptions of the world,
namely in terms of objective propensities.  Arageorgis, Earman and
Ruetsche (2003) argue that Minkowski and Rindler (or Fulling)
quantization do <em>not</em> constitute a satisfactory case of
physically relevant UIRs. First, there are good reasons to doubt that
the Rindler vacuum is a physically realizable state. Second, the
authors argue, the unitary inequivalence in question merely stems from
the fact that one representation is reducible and the other one
irreducible: The restriction of the Minkowski vacuum to a Rindler
wedge, i.e. what the Minkowski observer says about the Rindler wedge,
leads to a mixed state (a thermodynamic KMS state) and therefore a
reducible representation, whereas the Rindler vacuum is a pure state
and thus corresponds to an irreducible representation.  Therefore, the
Unruh effect does not cause distress for the particle
interpretation—which the authors see to be fighting a losing
battle anyhow—because Rindler quanta are not real and the
unitary inequivalence of the representations in question has nothing
specific to do with conflicting particle ascriptions.
</p>

<p>
The occurrence of UIRs is also at the core of an analysis by Fraser
(2008). She restricts her analysis to inertial observers but compares
the particle notion for free and interacting systems.  Fraser argues,
first, that the representations for free and interacting systems are
unavoidably unitarily inequivalent, and second, that the
representation for an interacting system does not have the minimal
properties that are needed for any particle
interpretation—e.g. Teller's (1995) quanta version—namely
the countability condition (quanta are aggregable) and a relativistic
energy condition.  Note that for Fraser's negative conclusion about
the tenability of the particle (or quanta) interpretation for QFT
there is no need to assume localizability.
</p>

<p>
Bain (2000) has a diverging assessment of the fact that only
asymptotically free states, i.e. states very long before or after a
scattering interaction, have a Fock representation that allows for an
interpretation in terms of countable quanta. For Bain, the occurrence
of UIRs without a particle (or quanta) interpretation for intervening
times, i.e. close to scattering experiments, is irrelevant because the
data that are collected from those experiments always refer to systems
with negligible interactions. Bain concludes that although the
inclusion of interactions does in fact lead to the break-down of the
alleged duality of particles and fields it does not undermine the
notion of particles (or fields) as such.
</p>

<p>
Fraser (2008) rates this as an unsuccessful “last ditch”
attempt to save a quanta interpretation of QFT because it is ad hoc
and can't even show that at least something similar to the free field
total number operator exists for finite times, i.e. between the
asymptotically free states. Moreover, Fraser (2008) points out that,
contrary to what some authors suggest, the main source of the
impossibility to interpret interacting systems in terms of particles
is <em>not</em> that many-particle states are inappropriately
described in the Fock representation if one deals with interacting
fields but rather that QFT obeys special relativity theory (also see
Earman and Fraser (2006) on Haag's theorem). As Fraser concludes,
“[F]or a free system, special relativity and the linear field
equation conspire to produce a quanta interpretation.” In his
reply Bain (2011) points out that the reason why there is no total
number operator in interacting relativistic quantum field theories is
that this would require an absolute space-time structure, which in
turn is not an appropriate requirement.
</p>

<p> Baker (2009) points out that the main arguments against the
particle interpretation—concerning non-localizability
(e.g. Malament 1996) and failure for interacting systems (Fraser
2008)—may also be directed against the wave functional version
of the field interpretation (see field interpretation (iii) above). Mathematically, Baker's crucial point is
that wave functional space is unitarily equivalent to Fock space, so
that arguments against the particle interpretation that attack the
choice of the Fock representation may carry over to the wave
functional interpretation.  First, a Minkowski and a Rindler observer
may also detect different field configurations. Second, if the Fock
space representation is not apt to describe interacting systems, then
the unitarily equivalent wave functional representation is in no
better situation: Interacting fields are unitarily inequivalent to
free fields, too.
</p>

<p>
It is difficult to say how the availability of UIRs should be
interpreted in general.  Clifton and Halvorson (2001b) propose seeing
this as a form of complementarity. Ruetsche (2003) advocates a
“Swiss army approach”, according to which the availability
of UIRs shows that physical possibilities in different degrees must be
included into our ontology. However, both proposals are yet too
sketchy and await further elaboration.
</p>

<h3><a name="SymHeuObj">5.5 The Role of Symmetries</a></h3>

<p>

Symmetries play a central role in QFT. In order to characterize a
special symmetry one has to specify transformations T and features
that remain unchanged during these transformations: invariants I.
Symmetries are thus pairs {T, I}. The basic idea is that the
transformations change elements of the mathematical description (the
Lagrangians for instance) whereas the empirical content of the theory
is unchanged. There are space-time transformations and so-called
internal transformations. Whereas space-time symmetries are universal,
i. e., they are valid for all interactions, internal symmetries
characterize special sorts of interaction (electromagnetic, weak or
strong interaction).  Symmetry transformations define properties of
particles/quantum fields that are conserved if the symmetry is not
broken. The invariance of a system defines a conservation law, e.g.,
if a system is invariant under translations the linear momentum is
conserved, if it is invariant under rotation the angular momentum is
conserved. Inner transformations, such as gauge transformations, are
connected with more abstract properties.</p>

<p>

Symmetries are not only defined for Lagrangians but they can also be
found in empirical data and phenomenological descriptions. Symmetries
can thus bridge the gap between descriptions which are close to
empirical results (‘phenomenology’) and the more abstract
general theory which is a most important reason for their heuristic
force. If a conservation law is found one has some knowledge about the
system even if details of the dynamics are unknown. The analysis of
many high energy collision experiments led to the assumption of
special conservation laws for abstract properties like baryon number
or strangeness. Evaluating experiments in this way allowed for a
classification of particles. This phenomenological classification was
good enough to predict new particles which could be found in the
experiments. Free places in the classification could be filled even if
the dynamics of the theory (for example the Lagrangian of strong
interaction) was yet unknown.  As the history of QFT for strong
interaction shows, symmetries found in the phenomenological
description often lead to valuable constraints for the construction of the
dynamical equations. Arguments from group theory played a decisive role
in the unification of fundamental interactions.  In addition,
symmetries bring about substantial technical advantages. For example,
by using gauge transformations one can bring the Lagrangian into a
form which makes it easy to prove the renormalizability of the theory.
See also the entry on
 <a href="../symmetry-breaking/">symmetry and symmetry breaking</a>.</p>

<p>
In many cases symmetries are not only heuristically useful but supply
some sort of ‘justification’ by being used in the
beginning of a chain of explanation. To a remarkable degree the
present theories of elementary particle interactions can be understood
by deduction from general principles. Under these principles symmetry
requirements play a crucial role in order to determine the
Lagrangian. For example, the only Lorentz invariant and gauge
invariant renormalizable Lagrangian for photons and electrons is
precisely the original Dirac Lagrangian. In this way symmetry
arguments acquire an explanatory power and help to minimize the
unexplained basic assumptions of a theory. Heisenberg concludes that
in order “to find the way to a real understanding of the
spectrum of particles it will therefore be necessary to look for the
fundamental symmetries and not for the fundamental particles.”
(Blum <em>et al</em>. 1995: 507).</p>

<p>
Since symmetry operations change the perspective of an observer but
not the physics an analysis of the relevant symmetry group can yield
very general information about those entities which are unchanged by
transformations. Such an invariance under a symmetry group is a
necessary (but not sufficient) requirement for something to belong to
the ontology of the considered physical theory. Hermann Weyl
propagated the idea that objectivity is associated with invariance
(see, e.g., his authoritative work Weyl 1952: 132). Auyang (1995)
stresses the connection between properties of physically relevant
symmetry groups and ontological questions. Kosso argues that
symmetries help to separate objective facts from the conventions of
descriptions; see his article in Brading &amp; Castellani (2003), an
anthology containing numerous further philosophical studies about
symmetries in physics.</p>

<p>
Symmetries are typical examples of structures that show more
continuity in scientific change than assumptions about objects. For
that reason structural realists consider structures as “the best
candidate for what is ‘true’ about a physical
theory” (Redhead 1999: 34). Physical objects such as electrons
are then taken to be similar to fiction that should not be taken
seriously, in the end. In the epistemic variant of structural realism
structure is all we know about nature whereas the objects which are
related by structures might exist but they are not accessible to
us. For the extreme ontic structural realist there is nothing but
structures in the world (Ladyman 1998).</p>

<h3><a name="TakSto">5.6 Taking Stock: Where do we Stand?</a></h3>

<p>
A <b>particle interpretation</b> of QFT answers most intuitively what
happens in particle scattering experiments and why we seem to detect
particle trajectories. Moreover, it would explain most naturally why
particle talk appears almost unavoidable. However, the particle
interpretation in particular is troubled by numerous serious
problems. There are no-go theorems to the effect that, in a
relativistic setting, quantum “particle” states cannot be
localized in any finite region of space-time no matter how large it
is.  Besides localizability, another hard core requirement for the
particle concept that seems to be violated in QFT is
countability. First, many take the Unruh effect to indicate that the
particle number is observer or context dependent. And second,
interacting quantum field theories cannot be interpreted in terms of
particles because their representations are unitarily inequivalent to
Fock space (Haag's theorem), which is the only known way to represent
countable entities in systems with an infinite number of degrees of
freedom.
</p>

<p>
At first sight the <b>field interpretation</b> seems to be much better
off, considering that a field is not a localized entity and that it
may vary continuously—so no requirements for localizability and
countability.  Accordingly, the field interpretation is often taken to
be implied by the failure of the particle interpretation. However, on
closer scrutiny the field interpretation itself is not above reproach.
To begin with, since “quantum fields” are operator valued
it is not clear in which sense QFT should be describing physical
fields, i.e. as ascribing physical properties to points in space. In
order to get determinate physical properties, or even just
probabilities, one needs a quantum state. However, since quantum
states as such are not spatio-temporally defined, it is questionable
whether field values calculated with their help can still be viewed as
local properties.  The second serious challenge is that the arguably
strongest field interpretation—the wave functional
version—may be hit by similar problems as the particle
interpretation, since wave functional space is unitarily equivalent to
Fock space.
</p>

<p>
The occurrence of <b>unitarily inequivalent representations
(UIRs)</b>, which first seemed to cause problems specifically for the
particle interpretation but which appears to carry over to the field
interpretation, may well be a severe obstacle for any ontological
interpretation of QFT. However, it is controversial whether the two
most prominent examples, namely the Unruh effect and Haag's theorem,
really do cause the contended problems in the first place. Thus one of
the crucial tasks for the philosophy of QFT is further unmasking the
ontological significance of UIRs.
</p>

<p>
The two remaining contestants approach QFT in a way that breaks more
radically with traditional ontologies than any of the proposed
particle and field interpretations. <b>Ontic Structural Realism
(OSR)</b> takes the paramount significance of symmetry groups to
indicate that symmetry structures as such have an ontological primacy
over objects. However, since most OSRists are decidedly against
Platonism, it is not altogether clear how symmetry structures could be
ontologically prior to objects if they only exist in concrete
realizations, namely in those objects that exhibit these
symmetries.</p>

<p><b>Dispositional Trope Ontology (DTO)</b> deprives both particles
and fields of their fundamental status, and proposes an ontology whose
basic elements are properties understood as particulars, called
‘tropes’. One of the advantages of the DTO approach is its
great generality concerning the nature of objects which it analyzes as
bundles of (partly dispositional) properties/tropes: DTO is flexible
enough to encompass both particle and field like features without
being committed to either a particle or a field ontology.
</p>

<p>
In conclusion one has to recall that one reason why the ontological
interpretation of QFT is so difficult is the fact that it is
exceptionally unclear which parts of the formalism should be taken to
represent anything physical in the first place. And it looks as if
that problem will persist for quite some time.
