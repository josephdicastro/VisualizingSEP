# Visualizing the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy

Visualizing SEP is a visual search engine for exploring the <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/">Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy</a> powerfully, intuitively, and beautifully.

The application uses topic webs to map the relationships between the articles in the SEP, allowing one to navigate the entirety of the encyclopedia more easily than ever before. The fundamental motivation of Visualizing SEP is that the web of knowledge that links different ideas and schools of thought together is as important as any particular topic itself, so the application brings these intertextual connections to the forefront of the research process.

Every article returned by the applicationâ€™s search engine is presented within a network graph of all the articles to which it is directly linked, allowing users to easily deep-dive into the topic and its surrounding contexts, or to continually explore new avenues of related knowledge. Visualizing SEP is first and foremost a powerful research tool, but it also doubles as a fun way to explore the incredible resource that is the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy.
