    - Visualizing the Stanford Encylopedia of Philosophy
    - This project creates interactive network maps of all the articles in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, where a user can explore the entire encylopedia by searching for single articles and then seeing which other articles are directly linked to that one.
