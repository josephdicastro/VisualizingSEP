# Visualizing the Stanford Encylopedia of Philosophy
This is the beginning of a large project visualizing conceptual relationships in the history of philosophy, using the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy and the Indiana Philosophy Ontology Project as the reference datasets. 

## Current work:
The project is developing a new-ish kind of visual search engine using interactive network maps of all the articles in the Stanford Encyclopedia. With this search engine, the user can explore the entire corpus of the encylopedia by searching for single articles and then seeing which other articles are directly linked to that one. For each article,  a preview of the article's first paragraph is provided, as well as a link into the full article itself.
