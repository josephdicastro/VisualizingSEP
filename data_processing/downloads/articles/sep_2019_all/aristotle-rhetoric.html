<h1>Aristotle’s Rhetoric</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Thu May 2, 2002; substantive revision Mon Feb 1, 2010</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>

Aristotle's <em>Rhetoric</em> has had an enormous influence on the 
development of the art of rhetoric. Not only authors writing in the 
peripatetic tradition, but also the famous Roman teachers of 
rhetoric, such as Cicero and Quintilian, frequently used elements 
stemming from the Aristotelian doctrine. Nevertheless, these authors 
were interested neither in an authentic interpretation of the 
Aristotelian works nor in the philosophical sources and backgrounds 
of the vocabulary that Aristotle had introduced to rhetorical theory.
Thus, for two millennia the interpretation of Aristotelian rhetoric 
has become a matter of the history of rhetoric, not of philosophy. In
the most influential manuscripts and editions, Aristotle's 
<em>Rhetoric</em> was surrounded by rhetorical works and even written
speeches of other Greek and Latin authors, and was seldom interpreted
in the context of the whole Corpus Aristotelicum. It was not until 
the last few decades that the philosophically salient features of the
Aristotelian rhetoric were rediscovered: in construing a general 
theory of the persuasive, Aristotle applies numerous concepts and 
arguments that are also treated in his logical, ethical, and 
psychological writings. His theory of rhetorical arguments, for 
example, is only one further application of his general doctrine of 
the <em>sullogismos</em>, which also forms the basis of dialectic, 
logic, and his theory of demonstration. Another example is the 
concept of emotions: though emotions are one of the most important 
topics in the Aristotelian ethics, he nowhere offers such an 
illuminating account of single emotions as in the <em>Rhetoric</em>. 
Finally, it is the <em>Rhetoric</em>, too, that informs us about the 
cognitive features of language and style. </p>

<h2><a name="works">1. Works on Rhetoric</a></h2>

<p>

According to ancient testimonies, Aristotle wrote an early dialogue 
on rhetoric entitled ‘<em>Grullos</em>’, in which he put 
forward the argument that rhetoric cannot be an art 
(<em>technê</em>); and since this is precisely the position of 
Plato's <em>Gorgias</em>, the lost dialogue <em>Grullos</em> has 
traditionally been regarded as a sign of Aristotle's (alleged) early 
Platonism. But the evidence for the position of this dialogue is too 
tenuous to support such strong conclusions: it also could have been a
‘dialectical’ dialogue, which listed the pros and cons of
the thesis that rhetoric is an art. We do not know much more about 
the so-called ‘<em>Technê Sunagogê</em>’, a 
collection of previous theories of rhetoric that is also ascribed to 
Aristotle. Cicero seems to use this collection itself, or at least a 
secondary source relying on it, as his main historical source when he
gives a short survey of the history of pre-Aristotelian rhetoric in 
his <em>Brutus</em> 46–48. Finally, Aristotle once mentions a 
work called ‘<em>Theodecteia</em>’ which has also been 
supposed to be Aristotelian; but more probably he meant the 
rhetorical handbook of his follower Theodectes, who was a former 
pupil of Isocrates. </p>

<p>

What has come down to us are just the three books on rhetoric, which 
we know as <em>The Rhetoric</em>, though the ancient catalogue of the
Aristotelian works, reported by Diogenes Laertius, mentions only two 
books on rhetoric (perhaps our <em>Rhetoric</em> I &amp; II), and two
further books on style (perhaps our <em>Rhetoric</em> III?). Whereas 
most modern authors agree that at least the core of <em>Rhet.</em> I 
&amp; II presents a coherent rhetorical theory, the two themes of 
<em>Rhet.</em> III are not mentioned in the agenda of <em>Rhet.</em> 
I &amp; II. The conceptual link between <em>Rhet.</em> I &amp; II and
<em>Rhet.</em> III is not given until the very last sentence of the 
second book. It is quite understandable that the authenticity of this
<em>ad hoc</em> composition has been questioned: we cannot exclude 
the possibility that these two parts of the <em>Rhetoric</em> were 
not put together until the first edition of Aristotle's works 
completed by Andronicus in the first century. In the <em>Poetics</em>
(1456a33) we find a cross-reference to a work called 
‘<em>Rhetoric</em>’ which obviously refers to 
<em>Rhet.</em> I &amp; II, but excludes <em>Rhet.</em> III. 
Regardless of such doubts, the systematic idea that links the two 
heterogeneous parts of the <em>Rhetoric</em> does not at all seem to 
be unreasonable: it is not enough to have a supply of things to say 
(the so-called “thought”), the theorist of rhetoric must 
also inform us about the right way to say those things (the so-called
“style”).</p>

<p>

The chronological fixing of the <em>Rhetoric</em> has turned out to 
be a delicate matter. At least the core of <em>Rhet.</em> I &amp; II 
seems to be an early work, written during Aristotle's first stay in 
Athens (it is unclear, however, which chapters belong to that core; 
regularly mentioned are the chapters I.4–15 and II.1–17).
It is true that the <em>Rhetoric</em> refers to historical events 
that fall in the time of Aristotle's exile and his second stay in 
Athens, but most of them can be found in the chapters II.23–24,
and besides this, examples could have been updated, which is 
especially plausible if we assume that the <em>Rhetoric</em> formed 
the basis of a lecture held several times. Most striking are the 
affinities to the (also early) <em>Topics</em>; if, as it is widely 
agreed, the <em>Topics</em> represents a pre-syllogistic state of 
Aristotelian logic, the same is true of the <em>Rhetoric</em>: we 
actually find no hints of syllogistic inventory in it.</p>

<h2><a name="agenda">2. The Agenda of the <em>Rhetoric</em></a></h2>

<p>

The structure of <em>Rhet.</em> I &amp; II is determined by two 
tripartite divisions. The first division consists in the distinction 
among the three means of persuasion: The speech can produce 
persuasion either through the character of the speaker, the emotional
state of the listener, or the argument (<em>logos</em>) itself (see 
below 
 <a href="#means">§5</a>).
 The second tripartite division concerns the three species of public 
speech. The speech that takes place in the assembly is defined as the
deliberative species. In this rhetorical species, the speaker either 
advises the audience to do something or warns against doing 
something. Accordingly, the audience has to judge things that are 
going to happen in the future, and they have to decide whether these 
future events are good or bad for the polis, whether they will cause 
advantage or harm. The speech that takes place before a court is 
defined as the judicial species. The speaker either accuses somebody 
or defends herself or someone else. Naturally, this kind of speech 
treats things that happened in the past. The audience or rather jury 
has to judge whether a past event was just or unjust, i.e., whether 
it was according to the law or contrary to the law. While the 
deliberative and judicial species have their context in a 
controversial situation in which the listener has to decide in favor 
of one of two opposing parties, the third species does not aim at 
such a decision: the epideictic speech praises or blames somebody, it
tries to describe things or deeds of the respective person as 
honorable or shameful. </p>

<p>

The first book of the <em>Rhetoric</em> treats the three species in 
succession. <em>Rhet.</em> I.4–8 deals with the deliberative, 
I.9 with the epideictic, I.10–14 the judicial species. These 
chapters are understood as contributing to the argumentative mode of 
persuasion or—more precisely—to that part of 
argumentative persuasion that is specific to the respective species 
of persuasion. The second part of the argumentative persuasion that 
is common to all three species of rhetorical speech is treated in the
chapters II.19–26. The second means of persuasion, which works 
by evoking the emotions of the audience, is described in the chapters
II.2–11. Though the following chapters II.12–17 treat 
different types of character these chapters do not, as is often 
assumed, develop the third means of persuasion, which depends on the 
character of the speaker. The underlying theory of this means of 
persuasion is elaborated in a few lines of chapter II.1. The 
aforementioned chapters II.12–17 give information about 
different types of character and their disposition to emotional 
response, which can be useful for those speakers who want to arouse 
the emotions of the audience. Why the chapters on the argumentative 
means of persuasion are separated by the treatment of emotions and 
character (in II.2–17) remains a riddle, especially since the 
chapter II.18 tries to give a link between the specific and the 
common aspects of argumentative persuasion. <em>Rhetoric</em> 
III.1–12 discusses several questions of style (see below 
 <a href="#8.1">§8.1</a>),
 Rhetoric III.13–19 is on the several parts of a speech.</p>

<h2><a name="dialectic">3. Rhetoric as a Counterpart to Dialectic</a></h2>

<p>

Aristotle stresses that rhetoric is closely related to dialectic. He 
offers several formulas to describe this affinity between the two 
disciplines: first of all, rhetoric is said to be a 
“counterpart” (<em>antistrophos</em>) to dialectic 
(<em>Rhet.</em> I.1, 1354a1); (ii) it is also called an 
“outgrowth” (<em>paraphues ti</em>) of dialectic and the 
study of character (<em>Rhet.</em> I.2, 1356a25f.); finally, 
Aristotle says that rhetoric is part of dialectic and resembles it 
(<em>Rhet.</em> I.2, 1356a30f.). In saying that rhetoric is a 
counterpart to dialectic, Aristotle obviously alludes to Plato's 
<em>Gorgias</em> (464bff.), where rhetoric is ironically defined as a
counterpart to cookery in the soul. Since, in this passage, Plato 
uses the word ‘<em>antistrophos</em>’ to designate an 
analogy, it is likely that Aristotle wants to express a kind of 
analogy too: what dialectic is for the (private or academic) practice
of attacking and maintaining an argument, rhetoric is for the 
(public) practice of defending oneself or accusing an opponent. </p>

<p>

This analogy between rhetoric and dialectic can be substantiated by 
several common features of both disciplines:</p>

<ul>
<li>Rhetoric and dialectic are concerned with things that do not belong
to a definite genus or are not the object of a specific science.</li>

<li>Rhetoric and dialectic rely on accepted sentences
(<em>endoxa</em>).</li>

<li>Rhetoric and dialectic are not dependent on the principles of
specific sciences.</li>

<li>Rhetoric and dialectic are concerned with both sides of an
opposition.</li>

<li>Rhetoric and dialectic rely on the same theory of deduction and
induction.</li>

<li>Rhetoric and dialectic similarly apply the so-called
<em>topoi</em>.</li>
</ul>

<p>

The analogy to dialectic has important implications for the status of
rhetoric. Plato argued in his <em>Gorgias</em> that rhetoric cannot 
be an art (<em>technê</em>), since it is not related to a 
definite subject, while real arts are defined by their specific 
subjects, as e.g. medicine or shoemaking are defined by their 
products, i.e., health and shoes. However, though dialectic has no 
definite subject, it is easy to see that it nevertheless rests on a 
method, because dialectic has to grasp the reason why some arguments 
are valid and others are not. Now, if rhetoric is nothing but the 
counterpart to dialectic in the domain of public speech, it must be 
grounded in an investigation of what is persuasive and what is not, 
and this, in turn, qualifies rhetoric as an art.</p>

<p>

Further, it is central to both disciplines that they deal with 
arguments from accepted premises. Hence the rhetorician who wants to 
persuade by arguments or (rhetorical) proofs can adapt most of the 
dialectical equipment. Nevertheless, persuasion that takes place 
before a public audience is <em>not only</em> a matter of arguments 
and proofs, but also of credibility and emotional attitudes. This is 
why there are also remarkable differences between the two 
disciplines:</p>

<ul>
<li>Dialectic can be applied to every object whatsoever, rhetoric is
useful especially in practical and public matters.</li>

<li>Dialectic proceeds by questioning and answering, while rhetoric for
the most part proceeds in continuous form.</li>

<li>Dialectic is concerned with general questions, while rhetoric is
concerned for the most part with particular topics (i.e., things about
which we cannot gain real knowledge).</li>

<li>Certain uses of dialectic apply qualified <em>endoxa</em>, i.e.,
<em>endoxa</em> that are approved by experts, while rhetoric aims at
<em>endoxa</em> that are popular.</li>

<li>Rhetoric must take into account that its target group has only
restricted intellectual resources, whereas such concerns are totally
absent from dialectic.</li>

<li>While dialectic tries to test the consistency of a set of
sentences, rhetoric tries to achieve the persuasion of a given
audience.</li>

<li>Non-argumentative methods are absent from dialectic, while rhetoric
uses non-argumentative means of persuasion.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="purpose">4. The Purpose of Rhetoric</a></h2>

<h3><a name="4.1">4.1 The Definition of Rhetoric</a></h3>

<p>

Aristotle defines the rhetorician as someone who is always able to 
see what is persuasive (<em>Topics</em> VI.12, 149b25). 
Correspondingly, rhetoric is defined as the ability to see what is 
possibly persuasive in every given case (<em>Rhet.</em> I.2, 
1355b26f.). This is not to say that the rhetorician will be able to 
convince under all circumstances. Rather he is in a situation similar
to that of the physician: the latter has a complete grasp of his art 
only if he neglects nothing that might heal his patient, though he is
not able to heal <em>every</em> patient. Similarly, the rhetorician 
has a complete grasp of his method, if he discovers the available 
means of persuasion, though he is not able to convince 
<em>everybody</em>. </p>

<h3><a name="4.2">4.2 The Neutrality of Aristotelian Rhetoric</a></h3>

<p>

Aristotelian rhetoric as such is a neutral tool that can be used by 
persons of virtuous or depraved character. This capacity can be used 
for good or bad purposes; it can cause great benefits as well as 
great harms. There is no doubt that Aristotle himself regards his 
system of rhetoric as something useful, but the good purposes for 
which rhetoric is useful do not define the rhetorical capacity as 
such. Thus, Aristotle does not hesitate to concede on the one hand 
that his art of rhetoric can be misused. But on the other hand he 
tones down the risk of misuse by stressing several factors: 
Generally, it is true of all goods, except virtue, that they can be 
misused. Secondly, using rhetoric of the Aristotelian style, it is 
easier to convince of the just and good than of their opposites. 
Finally, the risk of misuse is compensated by the benefits that can 
be accomplished by rhetoric of the Aristotelian style. </p>

<h3><a name="4.3">4.3 Why We Need Rhetoric</a></h3>

<p>

It could still be objected that rhetoric is only useful for those who
want to outwit their audience and conceal their real aims, since 
someone who just wants to communicate the truth could be 
straightforward and would not need rhetorical tools. This, however, 
is not Aristotle's point of view: Even those who just try to 
establish what is just and true need the help of rhetoric when they 
are faced with a public audience. Aristotle tells us that it is 
impossible to teach such an audience, even if the speaker had the 
most exact knowledge of the subject. Obviously he thinks that the 
audience of a public speech consists of ordinary people who are not 
able to follow an exact proof based on the principles of a science. 
Further, such an audience can easily be distracted by factors that do
not pertain to the subject at all; sometimes they are receptive to 
flattery or just try to increase their own advantage. And this 
situation becomes even worse if the constitution, the laws, and the 
rhetorical habits in a city are bad. Finally, most of the topics that
are usually discussed in public speeches do not allow of exact 
knowledge, but leave room for doubt; especially in such cases it is 
important that the speaker seems to be a credible person and that the
audience is in a sympathetic mood. For all those reasons, affecting 
the decisions of juries and assemblies is a matter of persuasiveness,
not of knowledge. It is true that some people manage to be persuasive
either at random or by habit, but it is rhetoric that gives us a 
method to discover <em>all</em> means of persuasion on <em>any</em> 
topic whatsoever. </p>

<h3><a name="4.4">4.4 Aristotelian Rhetoric as Proof-Centered and Pertinent</a></h3>

<p>

Aristotle joins Plato in criticizing contemporary manuals of 
rhetoric. But how does he manage to distinguish his own project from 
the criticized manuals? The general idea seems to be this: Previous 
theorists of rhetoric gave most of their attention to methods outside
the subject; they taught how to slander, how to arouse emotions in 
the audience, or how to distract the attention of the hearers from 
the subject. This style of rhetoric promotes a situation in which 
juries and assemblies no longer form rational judgments about the 
given issues, but surrender to the litigants. Aristotelian rhetoric 
is different in this respect: it is centered on the rhetorical kind 
of proof, the enthymeme (see below 
 <a href="#enthymeme">§6</a>),
 which is called the most important means of persuasion. Since people 
are most strongly convinced when they suppose that something has been
proven (<em>Rhet.</em> I.1, 1355a5f.), there is no need for the 
orator to confuse or distract the audience by the use of emotional 
appeals, etc. In Aristotle's view an orator will be even more 
successful when he just picks up the convincing aspects of a given 
issue, thereby using commonly-held opinions as premises. Since people
have a natural disposition for the true (<em>Rhet.</em> I.1, 
1355a15f.) and every man has some contribution to make to the truth 
(<em>Eudemian Ethics</em> I.6, 1216b31,) there is no unbridgeable gap
between the commonly-held opinions and what is true. This alleged 
affinity between the true and the persuasive justifies Aristotle's 
project of a rhetoric that essentially relies on the persuasiveness 
of pertinent argumentation; and it is just this argumentative 
character of Aristotelian rhetoric that explains the close affinity 
between rhetoric and dialectic (see above 
 <a href="#dialectic">§3</a>).
 </p>
 
<h3><a name="4.5">4.5 Is There an Inconsistency in Aristotle's Rhetorical Theory?</a></h3>

<p>

Of course, Aristotle's rhetoric covers non-argumentative tools of 
persuasion as well. He tells the orator how to stimulate emotions and
how to make himself credible (see below 
 <a href="#means">§5</a>);
 his art of rhetoric includes considerations about delivery and style 
(see below 
 <a href="#8.1">§8.1</a>)
 and the parts of a speech. It is understandable that several 
interpreters found an insoluble tension between the argumentative 
means of pertinent rhetoric and non-argumentative tools that aim at 
what is outside the subject. It does not seem, however, that 
Aristotle himself saw a major conflict between these diverse tools of
persuasion—presumably for the following reasons: (i) He leaves 
no doubt that the subject that is treated in a speech has the highest
priority (e.g. <em>Rhet.</em> III.1, 1403b18–27). Thus, it is 
not surprising that there are even passages that regard the 
non-argumentative tools as a sort of accidental contribution to the 
process of persuasion, which essentially proceeds in the manner of 
dialectic (cp. <em>Rhet.</em> I.1, 1354a15). (ii) There are, he says 
(III.1, 1404a2f.), methods that are not right, but necessary because 
of certain deficiencies of the audience. His point seems to be that 
the argumentative method becomes less effective, the worse the 
condition of the audience is. This again is to say that it is due to 
the badness of the audience when his rhetoric includes aspects that 
are not in line with the idea of argumentative and pertinent 
rhetoric. (iii) In dealing with methods of traditional rhetoric, 
Aristotle obviously assumes that even methods that have traditionally
been used instead of argumentation can be refined so that they 
support the aim of an argumentative style of rhetoric. The prologue 
of a speech, for example, was traditionally used for appeals to the 
listener, but it can also be used to set out the issue of the speech,
thus contributing to its clearness. Similarly, the epilogue has 
traditionally been used to arouse emotions like pity or anger; but as
soon as the epilogue recalls the conclusions reached, it will make 
the speech more understandable. <br /></p>
 

<h2><a name="means">5. The Three Means of Persuasion</a></h2>

<p>

 <a name="argument">The</a>
 systematical core of Aristotle's <em>Rhetoric</em> is the doctrine 
that there are three technical means of persuasion. The attribute 
‘technical’ implies two characteristics: (i) Technical 
persuasion must rest on a method, and this, in turn, is to say that 
we must know the reason why some things are persuasive and some are 
not. Further, methodical persuasion must rest on a complete analysis 
of what it means to be persuasive. (ii) Technical means of persuasion
must be provided by the speaker himself, whereas preexisting facts, 
such as oaths, witnesses, testimonies, etc. are non-technical, since 
they cannot be prepared by the speaker.</p>

<p>

A speech consists of three things: the speaker, the subject that is 
treated in the speech, and the listener to whom the speech is 
addressed (<em>Rhet.</em> I.3, 1358a37ff.). It seems that this is why
only three technical means of persuasion are possible: Technical 
means of persuasion are either (a) in the character of the speaker, 
or (b) in the emotional state of the hearer, or (c) in the argument 
(<em>logos</em>) itself.</p>

<p>

(a) The persuasion is accomplished by character whenever the speech 
is held in such a way as to render the speaker worthy of credence. If
the speaker appears to be credible, the audience will form the 
second-order judgment that propositions put forward by the credible 
speaker are true or acceptable. This is especially important in cases
where there is no exact knowledge but room for doubt. But how does 
the speaker manage to appear a credible person? He must display (i) 
practical intelligence (<em>phronêsis</em>), (ii) a virtuous 
character, and (iii) good will (<em>Rhet.</em> II.1, 1378a6ff.); for,
if he displayed none of them, the audience would doubt that he is 
able to give good advice at all. Again, if he displayed (i) without 
(ii) and (iii), the audience could doubt whether the aims of the 
speaker are good. Finally, if he displayed (i) and (ii) without 
(iii), the audience could still doubt whether the speaker gives the 
best suggestion, though he knows what it is. But if he displays all 
of them, Aristotle concludes, it cannot rationally be doubted that 
his suggestions are credible. It must be stressed that the speaker 
must accomplish these effects by <em>what</em> he says; it is not 
necessary that he is actually virtuous: on the contrary, a 
preexisting good character cannot be part of the technical means of 
persuasion.</p>

<p>

(b) The success of the persuasive efforts depends on the emotional 
dispositions of the audience; for we do not judge in the same way 
when we grieve and rejoice or when we are friendly and hostile. Thus,
the orator has to arouse emotions exactly because emotions have the 
power to modify our judgments: to a judge who is in a friendly mood, 
the person about whom he is going to judge seems not to do wrong or 
only in a small way; but to the judge who is in an angry mood, the 
same person will seem to do the opposite (cp. <em>Rhet.</em> II.1, 
1378a1ff.). Many interpreters writing on the rhetorical emotions were
misled by the role of the emotions in Aristotle's ethics: they 
suggested that the orator has to arouse the emotions in order (i) to 
motivate the audience or (ii) to make them better persons (since 
Aristotle requires that virtuous persons do the right things together
with the right emotions). Thesis (i) is false for the simple reason 
that the aim of rhetorical persuasion is a certain judgment 
(<em>krisis</em>), not an action or practical decision 
(<em>prohairesis</em>). Thesis (ii) is false, because moral education
is not the purpose of rhetoric (see above 
 <a href="#purpose">§4</a>),
 nor could it be effected by a public speech: “Now if speeches 
were in themselves enough to make men good, they would justly, as 
Theognis says, have won very great rewards, and such rewards should 
have been provided; but as things are … they are not able to 
encourage the many to nobility and goodness.” (EN X.9. 
1179b4–10)</p>

<p>

How is it possible for the orator to bring the audience to a certain 
emotion? Aristotle's technique essentially rests on the knowledge of 
the definition of every significant emotion. Let, for example, anger 
be defined as “desire, accompanied with pain, for conspicuous 
revenge for a conspicuous slight that was directed against oneself or
those near to one, when such a slight is undeserved.” (Rhet. 
II.2 1378a31–33). According to such a definition, someone who 
believes that he has suffered a slight from a person who is not 
entitled to do so, etc., will become angry. If we take such a 
definition for granted, it is possible to deduce circumstances in 
which a person will most probably be angry; for example, we can 
deduce (i) in what state of mind people are angry and (ii) against 
whom they are angry and (iii) for what sorts of reason. Aristotle 
deduces these three factors for several emotions in the chapters 
II.2–11. With this equipment, the orator will be able, for 
example, to highlight such characteristics of a case as are likely to
provoke anger in the audience. In comparison with the tricks of 
former rhetoricians, this method of arousing emotions has a striking 
advantage: The orator who wants to arouse emotions must not even 
speak outside the subject; it is sufficient to detect aspects of a 
given subject that are causally connected with the intended emotion.</p>

<p>

(c) We persuade by the argument itself when we demonstrate or seem to
demonstrate that something is the case. For Aristotle, there are two 
species of arguments: inductions and deductions (<em>Posterior 
Analytics</em> I.1, 71a5ff.). Induction 
(<em>epagôgê</em>) is defined as the proceeding from 
particulars up to a universal (<em>Topics</em> I.12, 105a13ff.). A 
deduction (<em>sullogismos</em>) is an argument in which, certain 
things having been supposed, something different from the 
suppositions results of necessity through them (<em>Topics</em> I.1, 
100a25ff.) or because of their being true (<em>Prior Analytics</em> 
I.2, 24b18–20). The inductive argument in rhetoric is the 
example (<em>paradeigma</em>); unlike other inductive arguments, it 
does not proceed from many particular cases to one universal case, 
but from one particular to a similar particular if both particulars 
fall under the same genus (<em>Rhet.</em> I.2, 1357b25ff.). The 
deductive argument in rhetoric is the enthymeme (see below 
 <a href="#enthymeme">§6</a>):
 </p>

<blockquote>but when, certain things being the case, something
different results beside them because of their being true, <em>either
universally or</em> <em>for the most part</em>, it is called deduction
here (in dialectic) and enthymeme there (in rhetoric).</blockquote>

<p>

It is remarkable that Aristotle uses the qualification “either 
universally or for the most part”: obviously, he wants to say 
that in some cases the conclusion follows universally, i.e., by 
necessity, while in other cases it follows only <em>for the most 
part</em>. At first glance, this seems to be inconsistent, since a 
non-necessary inference is no longer a deduction. However, it has 
been disputed whether in arguments from probable premises the formula
“for the most part” qualifies the inference itself 
(“If for the most part such and such is the case <em>it follows
for the most part</em> that something different is the case”), 
or only the conclusion (“If for the most part such and such is 
the case <em>it follows by necessity</em> that <em>for the most 
part</em> something different is the case”). If the former 
interpretation is true, then Aristotle concedes in the very 
definition of the enthymeme that some enthymemes are not deductive. 
But if the latter interpretation (which has a parallel in <em>An. 
post.</em> 87b23–25) is correct, an enthymeme whose premises 
and conclusion are for the most part true would still be a valid 
deduction. </p>

<h2><a name="enthymeme">6. The Enthymeme</a></h2>

<h3><a name="6.1">6.1 The Concept of Enthymeme</a></h3>

<p>

For Aristotle, an enthymeme is what has the function of a proof or 
demonstration in the domain of public speech, since a demonstration 
is a kind of <em>sullogismos</em> and the enthymeme is said to be a 
<em>sullogismos</em> too. The word ‘<em>enthymeme</em>’ 
(from ‘<em>enthumeisthai</em>—to consider’) had 
already been coined by Aristotle's predecessors and originally 
designated clever sayings, bon mots, and short arguments involving a 
paradox or contradiction. The concepts ‘proof’ 
(<em>apodeixis</em>) and ‘<em>sullogismos</em>’ play a 
crucial role in Aristotle's logical-dialectical theory. In applying 
them to a term of conventional rhetoric, Aristotle appeals to a 
well-known rhetorical technique, but, at the same time, restricts and
codifies the original meaning of ‘enthymeme’: properly 
understood, what people call ‘enthymeme’ <em>should</em> 
have the form of a <em>sullogismos</em>, i.e., a deductive argument. </p>

<h3><a name="6.2">6.2 Formal Requirements</a></h3>

<p>

In general, Aristotle regards deductive arguments as a set of 
sentences in which some sentences are premises and one is the 
conclusion, and the inference from the premises to the conclusion is 
guaranteed by the premises alone. Since enthymemes in the proper 
sense are expected to be deductive arguments, the minimal requirement
for the formulation of enthymemes is that they have to display the 
premise-conclusion structure of deductive arguments. This is why 
enthymemes have to include a statement as well as a kind of reason 
for the given statement. Typically this reason is given in a 
conditional ‘if’-clause or a causal ‘since’- 
or ‘for’-clause. Examples of the former, conditional type
are: “If not even the gods know everything, human beings can 
hardly do so.” “If the war is the cause of present evils,
things should be set right by making peace.” Examples of the 
latter, causal type are: “One should not be educated, for one 
ought not be envied (and educated people are usually envied).” 
“She has given birth, for she has milk.” Aristotle 
stresses that the sentence “There is no man among us who is 
free” taken for itself is a maxim, but becomes an enthymeme as 
soon as it is used together with a reason such as “for all are 
slaves of money or of chance (and no slave of money or chance is 
free).” Sometimes the required reason may even be implicit, as 
e.g. in the sentence “As a mortal, do not cherish immortal 
anger” the reason why one should not cherish mortal anger is 
implicitly given in the phrase “immortal,” which alludes 
to the rule that is not appropriate for mortal beings to have such an
attitude. </p>

<h3><a name="6.3">6.3 Enthymemes as Dialectical Arguments</a></h3>

<p>

Aristotle calls the enthymeme the “body of persuasion”, 
implying that everything else is only an addition or accident to the 
core of the persuasive process. The reason why the enthymeme, as the 
rhetorical kind of proof or demonstration, should be regarded as 
central to the rhetorical process of persuasion is that we are most 
easily persuaded when we think that something has been demonstrated. 
Hence, the basic idea of a rhetorical demonstration seems to be this:
In order to make a target group believe that <em>q</em>, the orator 
must first select a sentence <em>p</em> or some sentences 
<em>p<sub>1</sub></em> … <em>p<sub>n</sub></em> that are 
already accepted by the target group; secondly he has to show that 
<em>q</em> can be derived from <em>p</em> or <em>p<sub>1</sub></em> 
… <em>p<sub>n</sub></em>, using <em>p</em> or 
<em>p<sub>1</sub></em> … <em>p<sub>n</sub></em> as premises. 
Given that the target persons form their beliefs in accordance with 
rational standards, they will accept <em>q</em> as soon as they 
understand that <em>q</em> can be demonstrated on the basis of their 
own opinions. </p>

<p>

Consequently, the construction of enthymemes is primarily a matter of
deducing from accepted opinions (<em>endoxa</em>). Of course, it is 
also possible to use premises that are not commonly accepted by 
themselves, but can be derived from commonly accepted opinions; other
premises are only accepted since the speaker is held to be credible; 
still other enthymemes are built from signs: see 
 §<a href="#6.5">6.5</a>.
 That a deduction is made from accepted opinions—as opposed to 
deductions from first and true sentences or principles—is the 
defining feature of dialectical argumentation in the Aristotelian 
sense. Thus, the formulation of enthymemes is a matter of dialectic, 
and the dialectician has the competence that is needed for the 
construction of enthymemes. If enthymemes are a subclass of 
dialectical arguments, then it is natural to expect a specific 
difference by which one can tell enthymemes apart from all other 
kinds of dialectical arguments (traditionally, commentators regarded 
logical incompleteness as such a difference; for some objections 
against the traditional view, see 
 §<a href="#6.4">6.4</a>).
 Nevertheless, this expectation is somehow misled: The enthymeme is 
different from other kinds of dialectical arguments, insofar as it is
used in the rhetorical context of public speech (and rhetorical 
arguments are called ‘enthymemes’); thus, no further 
formal or qualitative differences are needed.</p>

<p>

However, in the rhetorical context there are two factors that the 
dialectician has to keep in mind if she wants to become a rhetorician
too, and if the dialectical argument is to become a successful 
enthymeme. First, the typical subjects of public speech do 
not—as the subject of dialectic and theoretical 
philosophy—belong to the things that are necessarily the case, 
but are among those things that are the goal of practical 
deliberation and can also be otherwise. Second, as opposed to 
well-trained dialecticians the audience of public speech is 
characterized by an intellectual insufficiency; above all, the 
members of a jury or assembly are not accustomed to following a 
longer chain of inferences. Therefore enthymemes must not be as 
precise as a scientific demonstration and should be shorter than 
ordinary dialectical arguments. This, however, is not to say that the
enthymeme is defined by incompleteness and brevity. Rather, it is a 
sign of a well-executed enthymeme that the content and the number of 
its premises are adjusted to the intellectual capacities of the 
public audience; but even an enthymeme that failed to incorporate 
these qualities would still be enthymeme.</p>

<h3><a name="6.4">6.4 The Brevity of the Enthymeme</a></h3>

<p>

In a well known passage (<em>Rhet.</em> I.2, 1357a7–18; 
similar: <em>Rhet.</em> II.22, 1395b24–26), Aristotle says that
the enthymeme often has few or even fewer premises than some other 
deductions, (<em>sullogismoi)</em>. Since most interpreters refer the
word ‘<em>sullogismos</em>’ to the syllogistic theory 
(see the entry on 
 <a href="../aristotle-logic/">Aristotle's logic</a>),
 according to which a proper deduction has exactly two premises, those
lines have led to the widespread understanding that Aristotle defines
the enthymeme as a <em>sullogismos</em> in which one of two premises 
has been suppressed, i.e., as an abbreviated, incomplete syllogism. 
But certainly the mentioned passages do not attempt to give a 
definition of the enthymeme, nor does the word 
‘<em>sullogismos</em>’ necessarily refer to deductions 
with exactly two premises. Properly understood, both passages are 
about the selection of appropriate premises, not about logical 
incompleteness. The remark that enthymemes often have few or less 
premises concludes the discussion of two possible mistakes the orator
could make (Rhet. I.2, 1357a7–10): One can draw conclusions 
from things that have previously been deduced or from things that 
have not been deduced yet. The latter method is unpersuasive, for the
premises are not accepted, nor have they been introduced. The former 
method is problematic, too: if the orator has to introduce the needed
premises by another deduction, and the premises of this pre-deduction
too, etc., one will end up with a long chain of deductions. Arguments
with several deductive steps are common in dialectical practice, but 
one cannot expect the audience of a public speech to follow such long
arguments. This is why Aristotle says that the enthymeme is and 
should be from fewer premises. </p>

<blockquote><a href="supplement.html" name="6.4s">Supplement on The Brevity of the Enthymeme</a></blockquote>

<h3><a name="6.5">6.5 Different Types of Enthymemes</a></h3>

<p>

Just as there is a difference between real and apparent or fallacious
deductions in dialectic, we have to distinguish between real and 
apparent or fallacious enthymemes in rhetoric. The <em>topoi</em> for
real enthymemes are given in chapter II.23, for fallacious enthymemes
in chapter II.24. The fallacious enthymeme pretends to include a 
valid deduction, while it actually rests on a fallacious inference. </p>

<p>

Further, Aristotle distinguishes between enthymemes taken from 
probable (<em>eikos</em>) premises and enthymemes taken from signs 
(<em>sêmeia</em>). (Rhet. I.2, 1357a32–33). In a 
different context, he says that enthymemes are based on 
probabilities, examples, <em>tekmêria</em> (i.e., proofs, 
evidences), and signs (Rhet. II.25, 1402b12–14). Since the 
so-called <em>tekmêria</em> are a subclass of signs and the 
examples are used to establish general premises, this is only an 
extension of the former classification. (Note that neither 
classification interferes with the idea that premises have to be 
accepted opinions: with respect to the signs, the audience must 
<em>believe</em> that they exist and <em>accept</em> that they 
indicate the existence of something else, and with respect to the 
probabilities, people must <em>accept</em> that something is likely 
to happen.) However, it is not clear whether this is meant to be an 
exhaustive typology. That most of the rhetorical arguments are taken 
from probable premises (“For the most part it is true that 
…” “It is likely that …”) is due to 
the typical subjects of public speech, which are rarely necessary. 
When using a sign-argument or sign-enthymeme we do not try to explain
a given fact; we just indicate <em>that</em> something exists or is 
the case: “… anything such that when it is another thing
is, or when it has come into being, the other has come into being 
before or after, is a sign of the other's being or having come into 
being.” (<em>Prior Analytics</em> II.27, 70a7ff.). But there 
are several types of sign-arguments too; Aristotle offers the 
following examples:</p>

<!--pdf exclude end-->

<p>

Sign-arguments of type (i) and (iii) can always be refuted, even if 
the premises are true; that is to say that they do not include a 
valid deduction (<em>sullogismos</em>); Aristotle calls them 
<em>asullogistos</em> (non-deductive). Sign-arguments of type (ii) 
can never be refuted if the premise is true, since, for example, it 
is not possible that someone has fever without being ill, or that 
someone has milk without having given birth, etc. This latter type of
sign-enthymemes is necessary and is also called 
<em>tekmêrion</em> (proof, evidence). Now, if some 
sign-enthymemes are valid deductions and some are not, it is tempting
to ask whether Aristotle regarded the non-necessary sign-enthymemes 
as apparent or fallacious arguments. However, there seems to be a 
more attractive reading: We accept a fallacious argument only if we 
are deceived about its logical form. But we could regard, for 
example, the inference “She is pregnant, since she is 
pale” as a good and informative argument, even if we know that 
it does not include a logically necessary inference. So it seems as 
if Aristotle didn't regard all non-necessary sign-arguments as 
fallacious or deceptive; but even if this is true, it is difficult 
for Aristotle to determine the sense in which non-necessary 
sign-enthymemes are valid arguments, since he is bound to the 
alternative of deduction and induction, and neither class seems 
appropriate for non-necessary sign-arguments.</p>

<h2><a name="Topoi">7. The <em>Topoi</em></a></h2>

<p>

Generally speaking, an Aristotelian <em>topos</em> 
(‘place’, ‘location’) is an argumentative 
scheme that enables a dialectician or rhetorician to construe an 
argument for a given conclusion. The use of so-called <em>topoi</em> 
or ‘<em>loci communes</em>’ can be traced back to early 
rhetoricians such as Protagoras, Gorgias (cp. Cicero, 
<em>Brutus</em>, 46–48) and Isocrates. But while in earlier 
rhetoric a <em>topos</em> was understood as a complete pattern or 
formula that can be mentioned at a certain stage of the speech to 
produce a certain effect, most of the Aristotelian <em>topoi</em> are
general instructions saying that a conclusion of a certain form can 
be derived from premises of a certain form; and because of this 
‘formal’ or ‘semi-formal’ character of 
Aristotelian <em>topoi</em>, one <em>topos</em> can be used to 
construe several different arguments. Aristotle's book 
<em>Topics</em> lists some hundred <em>topoi</em> for the 
construction of dialectical arguments. These lists of <em>topoi</em> 
form the core of the method by which the dialectician should be able 
to formulate deductions on any problem that could be proposed. Most 
of the instructions that the <em>Rhetoric</em> gives for the 
composition of enthymemes are also organized as lists of 
<em>topoi</em>; especially the first book of the <em>Rhetoric</em> 
essentially consists of <em>topoi</em> concerning the subjects of the
three species of public speech. </p>

<h3><a name="7.1">7.1 The Definition of ‘Topos’</a></h3>

<p>

It is striking that the work that is almost exclusively dedicated to 
the collection of <em>topoi</em>, the book <em>Topics</em>, does not 
even make an attempt to define the concept of <em>topos</em>. At any 
rate the <em>Rhetoric</em> gives a sort of defining characterization:
“I call the same thing element and <em>topos</em>; for an 
element or a <em>topos</em> is a heading under which many enthymemes 
fall.” (<em>Rhet.</em> 1403a18–19) By 
‘element’ Aristotle does not mean a proper part of the 
enthymeme, but a general form under which many concrete enthymemes of
the same type can be subsumed. According to this definition, the 
<em>topos</em> is a general argumentative form or pattern, and the 
concrete arguments are instantiations of the general <em>topos</em>. 
That the <em>topos</em> is a general instruction from which several 
arguments can be derived, is crucial for Aristotle's understanding of
an artful method of argumentation; for a teacher of rhetoric who 
makes his pupils learn ready samples of arguments would not impart 
the art itself to them, but only the products of this art, just as if
someone pretending to teach the art of shoe-making only gave samples 
of already made shoes to his pupils (see <em>Sophistical 
Refutations</em> 183b36ff.). </p>

<h3><a name="7.2">7.2 The Word ‘<em>Topos</em>’ and the Technique of Places</a></h3>

<p>

The word ‘<em>topos</em>’ (place, location) most probably
is derived from an ancient method of memorizing a great number of 
items on a list by associating them with successive places, say the 
houses along a street, one is acquainted with. By recalling the 
houses along the street we can also remember the associated items. 
Full descriptions of this technique can be found in Cicero, <em>De 
Oratore</em> II 86–88, 351–360, <em>Auctor ad 
Herennium</em> III 16–24, 29–40 and in Quintilian, 
<em>Institutio</em> XI 2, 11–33). In <em>Topics</em> 
163b28–32, Aristotle seems to allude to this technique: 
“For just as in the art of remembering, the mere mention of the
places instantly makes us recall the things, so these will make us 
more apt at deductions through looking to these defined premises in 
order of enumeration.” Aristotle also alludes to this technique
in <em>On the soul</em> 427b18–20, <em>On Memory</em> 
452a12–16, and <em>On Dreams</em> 458b20–22. </p>

<p>

But though the name ‘<em>topos</em>’ may be derived from 
this mnemotechnical context, Aristotle's use of <em>topoi</em> does 
not rely on the technique of places. At least within the system of 
the book <em>Topics</em>, every given problem must be analyzed in 
terms of some formal criteria: Does the predicate of the sentence in 
question ascribe a genus or a definition or peculiar or accidental 
properties to the subject? Does the sentence express a sort of 
opposition, either contradiction or contrariety, etc.? Does the 
sentence express that something is more or less the case? Does it 
maintain identity or diversity? Are the words used linguistically 
derived from words that are part of an accepted premise? Depending on
such formal criteria of the analyzed sentence one has to refer to a 
fitting <em>topos</em>. For this reason, the succession of 
<em>topoi</em> in the book <em>Topics</em> is organized in accordance
with their salient formal criteria; and this, again, makes a further 
mnemotechnique superfluous. More or less the same is true of the 
<em>Rhetoric</em>—except that most of its <em>topoi</em> are 
structured by material and not by formal criteria, as we shall see in
section 7.4. Besides all this, there is at least one passage in which
the use of the word ‘<em>topos</em>’ can be explained 
without referring to the previously mentioned mnemotechnique: In 
<em>Topics</em> VIII.1, 155b4–5 Aristotle says: “we must 
find the location (<em>topos</em>) from which to attack”, where
the word ‘<em>topos</em>’ is obviously used to mean a 
starting point for attacking the theses of the opponents.</p>

<h3><a name="7.3">7.3 The Elements of a <em>Topos</em></a></h3>

<p>

A typical Aristotelian <em>topos</em> runs as follows: “Again, 
if the accident of a thing has a contrary, see whether it belongs to 
the subject to which the accident in question has been declared to 
belong: for if the latter belongs, the former could not belong; for 
it is impossible that contrary predicates should belong at the same 
time to the same thing.” (<em>Topics</em> 113a20–24). 
Like most <em>topoi</em>, it includes (i) a sort of general 
instruction (“see, whether …”); further it 
mentions (ii) an argumentative scheme—in the given example, the
scheme ‘if the accidental predicate <em>p</em> belongs to the 
subject <em>s</em>, then the opposed <em>P</em>* cannot belong to 
<em>s</em> too’. Finally, the <em>topos</em> refers to (iii) a 
general rule or principle (“for it is impossible, 
…”) which justifies the given scheme. Other 
<em>topoi</em> often include the discussion of (iv) examples; still 
other <em>topoi</em> suggest (v) how to apply the given 
schemes.—Though these are elements that regularly occur in 
Aristotelian <em>topoi</em>, there is nothing like a standard form 
with which all <em>topoi</em> comply. Often Aristotle is very brief 
and leaves it to the reader to add the missing elements.</p>

<h3><a name="7.4">7.4 The Function of a <em>Topos</em></a></h3>

<p>

In a nutshell, the function of a <em>topos</em> can be explained as 
follows. First of all, one has to select an apt <em>topos</em> for a 
given conclusion. The conclusion is either a thesis of our opponent 
that we want to refute, or our own assertion we want to establish or 
defend. Accordingly, there are two uses of <em>topoi</em>: they can 
either prove or disprove a given sentence; some can be used for both 
purposes, others for only one of them. Most <em>topoi</em> are 
selected by certain formal features of the given conclusion; if, for 
example, the conclusion maintains a definition, we have to select our
<em>topos</em> from a list of <em>topoi</em> pertaining to 
definitions, etc. When it comes to the so-called 
‘material’ <em>topoi</em> of the <em>Rhetoric</em>, the 
appropriate <em>topos</em> must be selected not by formal criteria, 
but in accordance with the content of the conclusion—whether, 
for example, something is said to be useful or honorable or just, 
etc. Once we have selected a <em>topos</em> that is appropriate for a
given conclusion, the <em>topos</em> can be used to construe a 
premise from which the given conclusion can be derived. If for 
example the argumentative scheme is ‘If a predicate is 
generally true of a genus, then the predicate is also true of any 
species of that genus’, we can derive the conclusion ‘the
capacity of nutrition belongs to plants’ using the premise 
‘the capacity of nutrition belongs to all living things’,
since ‘living thing’ is the genus of the species 
‘plants’. If the construed premise is accepted, either by
the opponent in a dialectical debate or by the audience in public 
speech, we can draw the intended conclusion. </p>

<p>

It has been disputed whether the <em>topos</em> (or, more precisely, 
the ‘if …, then …’ scheme that is included 
in a <em>topos</em>) that we use to construe an argument must itself 
be regarded as a further premise of the argument. It could be either,
as some say, the premise of a propositional scheme such as the modus 
ponens, or, as others assume, as the conditional premise of a 
hypothetical syllogism. Aristotle himself does not favor one of these
interpretations explicitly. But even if he regarded the 
<em>topoi</em> as additional premises in a dialectical or rhetorical 
argument, it is beyond any doubt that he did not use them as premises
that must be explicitly mentioned or even approved by the opponent or
audience.</p>

<blockquote><a href="supplement2.html" name="7.4s">Supplement on the <em>Topoi</em> of the Rhetoric</a></blockquote>

<h2><a name="style">8. Style: How to Say Things with Words</a></h2>

<p>

<em>Rhet.</em> III.1–12 introduces the topic of <em>lexis</em>,
usually translated as ‘style’. This topic was not 
announced until the final passage of <em>Rhet.</em> II, so that most 
scholars have come to think of this section as a more or less 
self-contained treatise. The insertion of this treatise into the 
<em>Rhetoric</em> is motivated by the claim that, while 
<em>Rhet.</em> I &amp; II dealt with thought (dianoia), i.e., about 
<em>what</em> the orator should say, it remains to inquire into the 
various ways of saying or formulating one and the same thing. In the 
course of <em>Rhet.</em> III.1–12 it turns out that Aristotle 
tackles this task by using some quite heterogeneous approaches. After
an initial exploration of the field of delivery and style (III.1) 
Aristotle tries to determine what good prose style consists in; for 
this purpose he has to go into the differentiation and the selection 
of various kinds of nouns, one of which is defined as metaphor 
(III.2). The following chapters III.3–6 feature topics that are
at best loosely connected with the theme of good prose style; among 
these topics is the opposite of good style, namely frigid or 
deterring style (<em>psuchron</em>) (III.3), the simile, which turns 
out to be connected with the metaphor (III.4), the issue of correct 
Greek (III.5), the appropriateness (III.7) and the means by which 
one's style becomes long-winded and dignified (III.6). Chapters 
III.8–9 introduce two new approaches to the issue of style, 
which seem to be unrelated to everything that has been said so far: 
These are the topics of the rhythmical shaping of prose style and of 
periodic and non-periodic flow of speech. Chapters III.10–11 
are dedicated to how the orator can ‘bring things before one's 
eyes’, which amounts to something like making the style more 
vivid. Again metaphors are shown to play a crucial role for that 
purpose, so that the topic of metaphor is taken up again and deepened
by extended lists of examples. Chapter III.12 seems to make a new 
start by distinguishing between oral and written style and assessing 
their suitability for the three genres of speech (see above 
 <a href="#agenda">§2</a>).
 The philosophical core of Aristotle's treatise on style in <em>Rhet. 
III.1–12</em> seems to be included in the discussion of the 
good prose style (see below 
 <a href="#8.1">§8.1</a>),
 however it is the topic of metaphor (see below 
 <a href="#8.2">§8.2</a>)
 that has attracted the most attention in the later reception up to 
the present day.</p>

<h3><a name="8.1">8.1 The Virtue of Style</a></h3>

<p>

Originally the discussion of style belongs to the art of poetry 
rather than to rhetoric; the poets were the first, as Aristotle 
observes, to give an impulse for the study of style. Nevertheless he 
admits that questions of style or, more precisely, of different ways 
to formulate the same subject, may have an impact on the degree of 
clarity: “What concerns the topic of lexis, however, has some 
small necessary place in all teaching; for to speak in one way rather
than another makes some difference in regard to clarity; although not
a great difference…” (<em>Rhet.</em> III.1, 
1404a8–10). Clarity again matters for comprehension and 
comprehensibility contributes to persuasiveness. Indeed Aristotle 
even claims that the virtue or excellence (<em>aretê</em>) of 
prose style ultimately depends on clarity, because it is the genuine 
purpose of a speech is to make something clear. In prose speeches, 
the good formulation of a state of affairs must therefore be a clear 
one. However, saying this is not yet enough to account for the best 
or excellent prose style, since clear linguistic expressions tend to 
be banal or flat, while good style should avoid such banality. If the
language becomes too banal it will not be able to attract the 
attention of the audience. The orator can avoid this tendency of 
banality by the use of dignified or elevated expressions and in 
general by all formulations that deviate from common usage. On the 
one hand, uncommon vocabulary has the advantage of evoking the 
curiosity of an audience. On the other hand the use of such elevated 
vocabulary bears a serious risk: Whenever the orator makes excessive 
use of it, the speech might become unclear, thus failing to meet the 
default requirement of prose speech, namely clarity. Moreover, if the
vocabulary becomes too sublime or dignified in relation to prose's 
subject matter (Aristotle assumes it is mostly everyday affairs), the
audience will notice that the orator uses his words with a certain 
intention and will become suspicious about the orator and his 
intentions. Hitting upon the right wording is therefore a matter of 
being clear, but not too banal; In trying not to be too banal, one 
must use uncommon, dignified words and phrases, but one must be 
careful not to use them excessively or inappropriately in relation to
prose style and the typical subject matter of prose speeches. </p>

<p>

Bringing all these considerations together Aristotle defines the good
prose style, i.e. the virtue of prose style, as follows: “Let 
the virtue of linguistic form be defined as being clear, for since 
the logos is a (linguistic, sc.) sign, it would fail to bring about 
its proper function, whenever it does not make clear (whatever it is 
the sign of, sc.)—and neither banal/mean/flat 
(<em>tapeinên</em>) nor above the deserved dignity, but 
appropriate (<em>prepon</em>).” (<em>Rhet.</em> III.2, 
1404b1–4; similar at III.12, 1414a22–26) According to 
this definition, the virtue of prose style has to avoid two opposed 
tendencies, both of which are excessive and therefore fallacious: The
good style is clear in a way that is neither too banal nor too 
dignified, but appropriate (in proportion to the subject matter of 
prose speech). In this respect the definition of stylistic virtue 
follows the same scheme as the definition of ethical virtues in 
Aristotle's ethical writings, insofar as both the stylistic virtue 
and the virtue of character are defined in terms of a mean that lies 
between two opposed excesses. If the virtue of style is defined as a 
mean between the banality involving form of clarity and overly 
dignified (and hence inappropriate) speech, it is with good reason 
that Aristotle speaks of only one virtue of prose style, and not of 
clarity, ornament (by dignified expressions) and appropriateness as 
three distinct virtues of style. However, from the times of Cicero 
and Quintilianus on, these three, along with the correctness of Greek
or Latin, became the canonical four virtues of speech (<em>virtutes 
dicendi</em>). Reading Aristotle through the spectacles of the Roman 
art of rhetoric, scholars often try to identify two, three or four 
virtues of style in his <em>Rhetoric</em>.</p>

<p>

Finally, if the virtue of style is about finding a balance between 
banal clarity, which is dull, and attractive dignity, which is 
inappropriate in public speeches, how can the orator manage to 
control the different degrees of clarity and dignity? For this 
purpose Aristotle equips the orator with a classification of words 
(more or less the same classification can also be found in 
<em>Poetics</em> chapter 21): First of all Aristotle distinguishes 
between the <em>kuria onamata</em>, the standard expressions, and the
<em>glôtta</em>, the borrowed words, idioms or vernacular 
expressions. Most examples that Aristotle gives of this latter class 
are taken from the different Greek dialects, and most examples of 
this type are in turn taken from the language of the Homeric epos. 
Further classes are defined by metaphors and by several expressions 
that are somehow altered or modified, e.g., newly coined expressions 
(<em>pepoiêmena</em>), composite expressions (especially new or
unusual compositions (<em>ta dipla</em>)), and lengthened, shortened 
or otherwise altered expressions. Sometimes Aristotle also uses the 
term <em>kosmos</em> under which he collects all epithets and 
otherwise ornamental expressions. These different types of words 
differ in accordance with their familiarity. Most familiar are the 
usual or current words, the least familiar words are the 
<em>glôtta</em> or words that are newly coined. The metaphors 
are also unknown and unusual, because a usual, well-known word is 
used to designate something other than its usual designation (see 
below 
 <a href="#8.2">§8.2</a>).
 The best established words, the <em>kuria</em>, make their subject 
clear, but do not excite the audience's curiosity, whereas all other 
types of words are not established, and hence have the sort of 
attraction that alien or foreign things used to have. Since remote 
things are admirable (<em>thaumaston</em>) and the admirable is 
pleasant, Aristotle says, one should make the speech admirable and 
pleasant by the use of such unfamiliar words. However one has to be 
careful not to use inappropriately dignified or poetic words in prose
speech. Thus the virtue of style is accomplished by the selection and
balanced use of these various types of words: Fundamental for prose 
speech is the use of usual and therefore clear words. In order to 
make the speech pleasant and dignified and in order to avoid banality
the orator must make moderate use of non-familiar elements. Metaphor 
plays an important role for prose style, since metaphors contribute, 
as Aristotle says, clarity as well as the unfamiliar, surprising 
effect that avoids banality and tediousness. </p>

<h3><a name="8.2">8.2 Aristotelian Metaphors</a></h3>

<p>

According to Aristotle <em>Poetics</em> 21, 1457b9–16 and 
20–22, a metaphor is “the application of an alien name by
transference either from genus to species, or from species to genus, 
or from species to species, or by analogy, that is, 
proportion”. These four types are exemplified as follows: </p>

<table cellpadding="3">

<p>

Most of the examples Aristotle offers for types (i) to (iii) would 
not be regarded as metaphors in the modern sense; rather they would 
fall under the headings of metonomy or synecdoche. The examples 
offered for type (iv) are more like modern metaphors. Aristotle 
himself regards the metaphors of group (iv), which are built from 
analogy, as the most important type of enthymemes. An analogy is 
given if the second term is to the first as the fourth to the third. 
Correspondingly, an analogous metaphor uses the fourth term for the 
second or the second for the fourth. This principle can be 
illustrated by the following Aristotelian examples:</p>

<table cellpadding="3">
<tbody><tr>
<td> </td>
<td align="center"><strong>Analogy</strong></td>
<td align="center"><strong>Metaphor</strong></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td valign="top" align="right">(a)</td>
<td valign="top">The cup to Dionysus as shield to Ares.</td>
<td valign="top">To call the cup “the shield of Dionysus”
or the shield “the cup of Ares” is a metaphor.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td valign="top" align="right">(b)</td>
<td valign="top">Old age to life as the evening to day</td>
<td valign="top">To call old age “the evening of the life”
or the evening “old age of the day” is a metaphor</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td valign="top" align="right">(c)</td>
<td valign="top">Sowing to seed as <em>X</em> to sun rays, while the
action of the sun in scattering his rays is nameless; still this
process bears to the sun the same relation as sowing to the seed.</td>
<td valign="top">To call (a nameless) <em>X</em> “sowing of sun
rays” is a metaphor by analogy</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td valign="top" align="right">(d)</td>
<td valign="top">= (a)</td>
<td valign="top">To call the shield “a cup without wine” is
also a metaphor by analogy.</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>

Examples (a) and (b) obey the optional instruction that metaphors can
be qualified by adding the term to which the proper word is relative 
(cp. “the shield <em>of Ares</em>,” “the evening 
<em>of life</em>”). In example (c), there is no proper name for
the thing that the metaphor refers to. In example (d) the relation of
analogy is not, as in the other cases, indicated by the domain to 
which an item is referred to, but by a certain negation (for example 
“without name”); the negations make clear that the term 
is not used in its usual sense.</p>

<p>

Metaphors are closely related to similes; but as opposed to the later
tradition, Aristotle does not define the metaphor as an abbreviated 
simile, but, the other way around, the simile as a metaphor. The 
simile differs from the metaphor in the form of expression: while in 
the metaphor something is identified or substituted, the simile 
compares two things with each other, using words as 
“like,” “as”, etc. For example, “He 
rushed as a lion” is, according to Aristotle, a simile, but 
“The lion rushed” is a metaphor.</p>

<p>

While in the later tradition the use of metaphors has been seen as a 
matter of mere decoration, which has to delight the hearer, Aristotle
stresses the cognitive function of metaphors. Metaphors, he says, 
bring about learning (<em>Rhet.</em> III.10, 1410b14f.). In order to 
understand a metaphor, the hearer has to find something common 
between the metaphor and the thing the metaphor refers to. For 
example, if someone calls the old age “stubble”, we have 
to find a common genus to which old age and stubble belong; we do not
grasp the very sense of the metaphor until we find that both, old age
and stubble, have lost their bloom. Thus, a metaphor not only refers 
to a thing, but simultaneously describes the thing in a certain 
respect. This is why Aristotle says that the metaphor brings about 
learning: as soon as we understand why someone uses the metaphor 
“stubble” to refer to old age, we have learned at least 
one characteristic of old age.</p>
