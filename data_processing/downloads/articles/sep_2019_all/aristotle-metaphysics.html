<h1>Aristotle’s Metaphysics</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Sun Oct 8, 2000; substantive revision Wed Jun 15, 2016</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
The first major work in the history of philosophy to bear the title
“Metaphysics” was the treatise by Aristotle that we have
come to know by that name. But Aristotle himself did not use that
title or even describe his field of study as
‘metaphysics’; the name was evidently coined by the first
century C.E. editor who assembled the treatise we know as
Aristotle’s <em>Metaphysics</em> out of various smaller
selections of Aristotle’s works. The title
‘metaphysics’—literally, ‘after the
<em>Physics</em>’—very likely indicated the place the
topics discussed therein were intended to occupy in the philosophical
curriculum. They were to be studied after the treatises dealing with
nature (<em>ta phusika</em>). In this entry, we discuss the ideas that
are developed in Aristotle’s treatise. </p>

<h2 id="SubjMattArisMeta">1. The Subject Matter of Aristotle’s Metaphysics</h2>

<p>
Aristotle himself described his subject matter in a variety of ways:
as ‘first philosophy’, or ‘the study of being qua
being’, or ‘wisdom’, or ‘theology’. A
comment on these descriptions will help to clarify Aristotle’s
topic. </p>

<p>
In <em>Metaphysics</em> Α.1, Aristotle says that “all men
suppose what is called wisdom (<em>sophia</em>) to deal with the first
causes (<em>aitia</em>) and the principles (<em>archai</em>) of
things” (981b28), and it is these causes and principles that he
proposes to study in this work. It is his customary practice to begin
an inquiry by reviewing the opinions previously held by others, and
that is what he does here, as Book Α continues with a history of the
thought of his predecessors about causes and principles.</p>

<p>
These causes and principles are clearly the subject matter of what he
calls ‘first philosophy’. But this does not mean the
branch of philosophy that should be studied first. Rather, it concerns
issues that are in some sense the most fundamental or at the highest
level of generality. Aristotle distinguished between things that are
“better known to us” and things that are “better
known in
 themselves,”<sup>[<a href="notes.html#1" name="note-1">1</a>]</sup>
 and maintained that we should begin our study of a given topic with
things better known to us and arrive ultimately at an understanding of
things better known in themselves. The principles studied by
‘first philosophy’ may seem very general and abstract, but
they are, according to Aristotle, better known in themselves, however
remote they may seem from the world of ordinary experience. Still,
since they are to be studied only by one who has already studied
nature (which is the subject matter of the <em>Physics</em>), they are
quite appropriately described as coming “after the
<em>Physics</em>.”</p>

<p>
Aristotle’s description ‘the study of being qua
being’ is frequently and easily misunderstood, for it seems to
suggest that there is a single (albeit special) subject
matter—being qua being—that is under investigation. But
Aristotle’s description does not involve two things—(1) a
study and (2) a subject matter (being qua being)—for he did not
think that there is any such subject matter as ‘being qua
being’. Rather, his description involves three things: (1) a
study, (2) a subject matter (being), and (3) a manner in which the
subject matter is studied (qua being).</p>

<p>
Aristotle’s Greek word that has been Latinized as
‘qua’ means roughly ‘in so far as’ or
‘under the aspect’. A study of <em>x</em> qua <em>y</em>,
then, is a study of <em>x</em> that concerns itself solely with the
<em>y</em> aspect of <em>x</em>. So Aristotle’s study does not
concern some recondite subject matter known as ‘being qua
being’. Rather it is a study of being, or better, of
beings—of things that can be said to be—that studies them
in a particular way: as beings, in so far as they are beings.</p>

<p>
Of course, first philosophy is not the only field of inquiry to study
beings. Natural science and mathematics also study beings, but in
different ways, under different aspects. The natural scientist studies
them as things that are subject to the laws of nature, as things that
move and undergo change. That is, the natural scientist studies things
qua movable (i.e., in so far as they are subject to change). The
mathematician studies things qua countable and measurable. The
metaphysician, on the other hand, studies them in a more general and
abstract way—qua beings. So first philosophy studies the causes
and principles of beings qua beings. In Γ.2, Aristotle adds that
for this reason it studies the causes and principles of substances
(<em>ousiai</em>). We will explain this connection in Section 3
below.</p>

<p>
In Book Ε, Aristotle adds another description to the study of the
causes and principles of beings qua beings. Whereas natural science
studies objects that are material and subject to change, and
mathematics studies objects that although not subject to change are
nevertheless not separate from (i.e., independent of) matter, there is
still room for a science that studies things (if indeed there are any)
that are eternal, not subject to change, and independent of matter.
Such a science, he says, is theology, and this is the
“first” and “highest” science.
Aristotle’s identification of theology, so conceived, with the
study of being qua being has proved challenging to his interpreters.
</p>

<p>
Finally, we may note that in Book Β, Aristotle delineates his subject
matter in a different way, by listing the problems or perplexities
(<em>aporiai</em>) he hopes to deal with. Characteristic of these
perplexities, he says, is that they tie our thinking up in knots. They
include the following, among others: Are sensible substances the only
ones that exist, or are there others besides them? Is it kinds or
individuals that are the elements and principles of things? And if it
is kinds, which ones: the most generic or the most specific? Is there
a cause apart from matter? Is there anything apart from material
compounds? Are the principles limited, either in number or in kind?
Are the principles of perishable things themselves perishable? Are the
principles universal or particular, and do they exist potentially or
actually? Are mathematical objects (numbers, lines, figures, points)
substances? If they are, are they separate from or do they always
belong to sensible things? And (“the hardest and most perplexing
of all,” Aristotle says) are unity and being the substance of
things, or are they attributes of some other subject? In the remainder
of Book Β, Aristotle presents arguments on both sides of each of these
issues, and in subsequent books he takes up many of them again. But it
is not always clear precisely how he resolves them, and it is possible
that Aristotle did not think that the <em>Metaphysics</em> contains
definitive solutions to all of these perplexities.</p>

<h2 id="Cate">2. The Categories</h2>

<p>
To understand the problems and project of Aristotle’s
<em>Metaphysics</em>, it is best to begin with one of his earlier
works, the <em>Categories</em>. Although placed by long tradition
among his logical works (see the discussion in the entry on
 <a href="../aristotle-logic/index.html#Cat">Aristotle’s logic</a>),
 due to its analysis of the terms that make up the propositions out of
which deductive inferences are constructed, the <em>Categories</em>
begins with a strikingly general and exhaustive account of the things
there are (<em>ta onta</em>)—beings. According to this account,
beings can be divided into ten distinct categories. (Although
Aristotle never says so, it is tempting to suppose that these
categories are mutually exclusive and jointly exhaustive of the things
there are.) They include substance, quality, quantity, and relation,
among others. Of these categories of beings, it is the first,
substance (<em>ousia</em>), to which Aristotle gives a privileged
position.</p>

<p>
Substances are unique in being independent things; the items in the
other categories all depend somehow on substances. That is, qualities
are the qualities of substances; quantities are the amounts and sizes
that substances come in; relations are the way substances stand to one
another. These various non-substances all owe their existence to
substances—each of them, as Aristotle puts it, exists only
‘in’ a subject. That is, each non-substance “is in
something, not as a part, and cannot exist separately from what it is
in” (<em>Cat</em>. 1a25). Indeed, it becomes clear that
substances are the subjects that these ontologically dependent
non-substances are ‘in’.</p>

<p>
Each member of a non-substance category thus stands in this inherence
relation (as it is frequently called) to some substance or
other—color is always found in bodies, knowledge in the soul.
Neither whiteness nor a piece of grammatical knowledge, for example,
is capable of existing on its own. Each requires for its existence
that there be some substance in which it inheres.</p>

<p>
In addition to this fundamental inherence relation across categories,
Aristotle also points out another fundamental relation that obtains
between items within a single category. He describes this as the
relation of “being said of a subject,” and his examples
make clear that it is the relation of a more general to a less general
thing within a single category. Thus, man is ‘said of’ a
particular man, and animal is ‘said of’ man, and
therefore, as Aristotle points out, animal is ‘said of’
the particular man also. The ‘said of’ relation, that is
to say, is transitive (cf. 1b10). So the genus (e.g., animal) is
‘said of’ the species (e.g., man) and both genus and
species are ‘said of’ the particular. The same holds in
non-substance categories. In the category of quality, for example, the
genus (color) is ‘said of’ the species (white) and both
genus and species are ‘said of’ the particular white.
There has been considerable scholarly dispute about these particulars
in nonsubstance categories. For more detail, see the supplementary
document:</p>

<blockquote>
 <a href="supp1.html" name="return-1">Nonsubstantial Particulars</a>
 </blockquote>

<p>
The language of this contrast (‘in’ a subject vs.
‘said of’ a subject) is peculiar to the
<em>Categories</em>, but the idea seems to recur in other works as the
distinction between accidental vs. essential predication. Similarly,
in works other than the <em>Categories</em>, Aristotle uses the label
‘universals’ (<em>ta katholou</em>) for the things that
are “said of many;” things that are not universal he calls
‘particulars’ (<em>ta kath’ hekasta</em>). Although
he does not use these labels in the <em>Categories</em>, it is not
misleading to say that the doctrine of the <em>Categories</em> is that
each category contains a hierarchy of universals and particulars, with
each universal being ‘said of’ the lower-level universals
and particulars that fall beneath it. Each category thus has the
structure of an upside-down
 tree.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#2" name="note-2">2</a>]</sup>
 At the top (or trunk) of the tree are the most generic items in that
 category<sup>[<a href="notes.html#3" name="note-3">3</a>]</sup>
 (e.g., in the case of the category of substance, the genus plant and
the genus animal); branching below them are universals at the next
highest level, and branching below these are found lower levels of
universals, and so on, down to the lowest level universals (e.g., such
<em>infimae species</em> as man and horse); at the lowest
level—the leaves of the tree—are found the individual
substances, e.g., this man, that horse, etc.</p>

<p>
The individuals in the category of substance play a special role in
this scheme. Aristotle calls them “primary substances”
(<em>prôtai ousiai</em>) for without them, as he says, nothing
else would exist. Indeed, Aristotle offers an argument
(2a35–2b7) to establish the primary substances as the
fundamental entities in this ontology. Everything that is not a
primary substance, he points out, stands in one of the two relations
(inhering ‘in’, or being ‘said of’) to primary
substances. A genus, such as animal, is ‘said of’ the
species below it and, since they are ‘said of’ primary
substances, so is the genus (recall the transitivity of the
‘said of’ relation). Thus, everything in the category of
substance that is not itself a primary substance is, ultimately,
‘said of’ primary substances. And if there were no primary
substances, there would be no “secondary” substances
(species and genera), either. For these secondary substances are just
the ways in which the primary substances are fundamentally classified
within the category of substance. As for the members of non-substance
categories, they too depend for their existence on primary substances.
A universal in a non-substance category, e.g., color, in the category
of quality, is ‘in’ body, Aristotle tells us, and
therefore in individual bodies. For color could not be
‘in’ body, in general, unless it were ‘in’ at
least some particular bodies. Similarly, particulars in non-substance
categories (although there is not general agreement among scholars
about what such particulars might be) cannot exist on their own. E.g.,
a determinate shade of color, or a particular and non-shareable bit of
that shade, is not capable of existing on its own—if it were not
‘in’ at least some primary substance, it would not exist.
So primary substances are the basic entities—the basic
“things that there are”—in the world of the
<em>Categories</em>.</p>

<h2 id="RoleSubsStudBeinQuaBein">3. The Role of Substance in the Study of Being Qua Being</h2>

<p>
The <em>Categories</em> leads us to expect that the study of being in
general (being qua being) will crucially involve the study of
substance, and when we turn to the <em>Metaphysics</em> we are not
disappointed. First, in <em>Metaphysics</em> Γ Aristotle argues
in a new way for the ontological priority of substance; and then, in
Books Ζ, Η, and Θ, he wrestles with the problem of what
it is to be a substance. We will begin with Γ’s account of
the central place of substance in the study of being qua being. </p>

<p>
As we noted above, metaphysics (or, first philosophy) is the science
which studies being qua being. In this respect it is unlike the
specialized or departmental sciences, which study only part of being
(only some of the things that exist) or study beings only in a
specialized way (e.g., only in so far as they are changeable, rather
than in so far as they are beings).</p>

<p>
But ‘being’, as Aristotle tells us in Γ.2, is
“said in many ways”. That is, the verb ‘to be’
(<em>einai</em>) has different senses, as do its cognates
‘being’ (<em>on</em>) and ‘entities’
(<em>onta</em>). So the universal science of being qua being appears
to founder on an equivocation: how can there be a single science of
being when the very term ‘being’ is ambiguous?</p>

<p>
Consider an analogy. There are dining tables, and there are tide
tables. A dining table is a table in the sense of a smooth flat slab
fixed on legs; a tide table is a table in the sense of a systematic
arrangement of data in rows and columns. But there is not a single
sense of ‘table’ which applies to both the piece of
furniture at which I am writing these words and to the small booklet
that lies upon it. Hence it would be foolish to expect that there is a
single science of tables, in general, that would include among its
objects both dining tables and tide tables. Tables, that is to say, do
not constitute a single kind with a single definition, so no single
science, or field of knowledge, can encompass precisely those things
that are correctly called ‘tables’.</p>

<p>
If the term ‘being’ were ambiguous in the way that
‘table’ is, Aristotle’s science of being qua being
would be as impossible as a science of tables qua tables. But,
Aristotle argues in Γ.2, ‘being’ is not ambiguous in
this way. ‘Being’, he tells us, is ‘said in many
ways’ but it is not merely (what he calls)
‘homonymous’, i.e., sheerly ambiguous. Rather, the various
senses of ‘being’ have what he calls a ‘<em>pros
hen</em>’ ambiguity—they are all related to a single
central sense. (The Greek phrase ‘<em>pros hen</em>’ means
“in relation to one.”)</p>

<p>
Aristotle explains his point by means of some examples that he takes
to be analogous to ‘being’. Consider the terms
‘healthy’ and ‘medical’. Neither of these has
a single definition that applies uniformly to all cases: not every
healthy (or medical) thing is healthy (medical) in the same sense of
‘healthy’ (‘medical’). There is a range of
things that can be called ‘healthy’: people, diets,
exercise, complexions, etc. Not all of these are healthy in the same
sense. Exercise is healthy in the sense of being productive of health;
a clear complexion is healthy in the sense of being symptomatic of
health; a person is healthy in the sense of having good health.</p>

<p>
But notice that these various senses have something in common: a
reference to one central thing, health, which is actually possessed by
only some of the things that are spoken of as ‘healthy’,
namely, healthy organisms, and these are said to be healthy in the
primary sense of the term. Other things are considered healthy only in
so far as they are appropriately related to things that are healthy in
this primary sense.</p>

<p>
The situation is the same, Aristotle claims, with the term
‘being’. It, too, has a primary sense as well as related
senses in which it applies to other things because they are
appropriately related to things that are called ‘beings’
in the primary sense. The beings in the primary sense are substances;
the beings in other senses are the qualities, quantities, etc., that
belong to substances. An animal, e.g., a horse, is a being, and so is
a color, e.g, white, a being. But a horse is a being in the primary
sense—it is a substance—whereas the color white (a
quality) is a being only because it qualifies some substance. An
account of the being of anything that is, therefore, will ultimately
have to make some reference to substance. Hence, the science of being
qua being will involve an account of the central case of
beings—substances.</p>

<h2 id="FundPrinAxio">4. The Fundamental Principles: Axioms</h2>

<p>
Before embarking on this study of substance, however, Aristotle goes
on in Book Γ to argue that first philosophy, the most general of
the sciences, must also address the most fundamental
principles—the common axioms—that are used in all
reasoning. Thus, first philosophy must also concern itself with the
principle of non-contradiction (PNC): the principle that “the
same attribute cannot at the same time belong and not belong to the
same subject and in the same respect” (1005b19). This, Aristotle
says, is the most certain of all principles, and it is not just a
hypothesis. It cannot, however, be proved, since it is employed,
implicitly, in all proofs, no matter what the subject matter. It is a
first principle, and hence is not derived from anything more basic.
</p>

<p>
What, then, can the science of first philosophy say about the PNC? It
cannot offer a proof of the PNC, since the PNC is presupposed by any
proof one might offer—any purported proof of the PNC would
therefore be circular. Aristotle thus does not attempt to prove the
PNC; in the subsequent chapters of Γ he argues, instead, that it
is impossible to disbelieve the PNC. Those who would claim to deny the
PNC cannot, if they have any beliefs at all, believe that it is false.
For one who has a belief must, if he is to express this belief to
himself or to others, say something—he must make an assertion.
He must, as Aristotle says, signify something. But the very act of
signifying something is possible only if the PNC is accepted. Without
accepting the PNC, one would have no reason to think that his words
have any signification at all—they could not mean one thing
rather than another. So anyone who makes any assertion has already
committed himself to the PNC. Aristotle thus does not argue that the
PNC is a necessary truth (that is, he does not try to prove the PNC);
rather, he argues that the PNC is indubitable. (For more on the PNC,
see the discussion in the entry on
 <a href="../aristotle-logic/index.html#NonConMet">Aristotle’s logic</a>)</p>
 
<h2 id="WhatSubs">5. What is Substance?</h2>

<p>
In the seventeen chapters that make up Book Ζ of the
<em>Metaphysics</em>, Aristotle takes up the promised study of
substance. He begins by reiterating and refining some of what he said
in Γ: that ‘being’ is said in many ways, and that
the primary sense of ‘being’ is the sense in which
substances are beings. Here, however, he explicitly links the
secondary senses of ‘being’ to the non-substance
categories. The primacy of substance leads Aristotle to say that the
age-old question ‘What is being?’ “is just the
question ‘What is substance?’” (1028b4). </p>

<p>
One might have thought that this question had already been answered in
the <em>Categories</em>. There we were given, as examples of primary
substances, an individual man or horse, and we learned that a primary
substance is “what is neither in a subject nor said of a
subject” (2a10). This would seem to provide us with both
examples of, and criteria for being, primary substances. But in
<em>Metaphysics</em> Ζ, Aristotle does not seem to take either
the examples or the criteria for granted.</p>

<p>
In Ζ.2 he recounts the various answers that have been given to
the question of which things are substances—bodies (including
plants, animals, the parts of plants and animals, the elements, the
heavenly bodies), things more basic than bodies (surfaces, lines, and
points), imperceptible things (such as Platonic Forms and mathematical
objects)—and seems to regard them all as viable candidates at
this point. He does not seem to doubt that the clearest examples of
substances are perceptible ones, but leaves open the question whether
there are others as well.</p>

<p>
Before answering this question about examples, however, he says that
we must first answer the question about criteria: what is it to be a
substance (<em>tên ousian prôton ti estin</em>)? The
negative criterion (“neither in a subject nor said of a
subject”) of the <em>Categories</em> tells us only which things
are substances. But even if we know <em>that</em> something is a
substance, we must still say what <em>makes</em> it a
substance—what the cause is of its being a substance. This is
the question to which Aristotle next turns. To answer it is to
identify, as Aristotle puts it, the substance <em>of</em> that
thing.</p>

<h2 id="SubsMattSubj">6. Substance, Matter, and Subject</h2>

<p>
Ζ.3 begins with a list of four possible candidates for being the
substance of something: essence, universal, genus, and subject.
Presumably, this means that if <em>x</em> is a substance, then the
substance of <em>x</em> might be either (i) the essence of <em>x</em>,
or (ii) some universal predicated of <em>x</em>, or (iii) a genus that
<em>x</em> belongs to, or (iv) a subject of which <em>x</em> is
predicated. The first three candidates are taken up in later chapters,
and Ζ.3 is devoted to an examination of the fourth candidate: the
idea that the substance of something is a subject of which it is
predicated. </p>

<p>
A subject, Aristotle tells us, is “that of which everything else
is predicated, while it is itself not predicated of anything
else” (1028b36). This characterization of a subject is
reminiscent of the language of the <em>Categories</em>, which tells us
that a primary substance is not predicated of anything else, whereas
other things are predicated of it. Candidate (iv) thus seems to
reiterate the <em>Categories</em> criterion for being a substance. But
there are two reasons to be wary of drawing this conclusion. First,
whereas the subject criterion of the <em>Categories</em> told us that
substances were the ultimate subjects of predication, the subject
criterion envisaged here is supposed to tell us what the substance
<em>of</em> something is. So what it would tell us is that if
<em>x</em> is a substance, then the substance of <em>x</em>—that
which makes <em>x</em> a substance—is a subject that <em>x</em>
is predicated of. Second, as his next comment makes clear, Aristotle
has in mind something other than this <em>Categories</em> idea. For
the subject that he here envisages, he says, is either matter or form
or the compound of matter and form. These are concepts from
Aristotle’s <em>Physics</em>, and none of them figured in the
ontology of the <em>Categories</em>. To appreciate the issues
Aristotle is raising here, we must briefly compare his treatment of
the notion of a subject in the <em>Physics</em> with that in the
<em>Categories</em>.</p>

<p>
In the <em>Categories</em>, Aristotle was concerned with subjects of
predication: what are the things we talk about, and ascribe properties
to? In the <em>Physics</em>, his concern is with subjects of change:
what is it that bears (at different times) contrary predicates and
persists through a process of change? But there is an obvious
connection between these conceptions of a subject, since a subject of
change must have one predicate belonging to it at one time that does
not belong to it at another time. Subjects of change, that is, are
also subjects of predication. (The converse is not true: numbers are
subjects of predication—six is even, seven is prime—but
not of change.)</p>

<p>
In the <em>Categories</em>, individual substances (a man, a horse)
were treated as fundamental subjects of predication. They were also
understood, indirectly, as subjects of change. (“A substance,
one and the same in number, can receive contraries. An individual man,
for example, being one and the same, becomes now pale and now dark,
now hot and now cold, now bad and now good” 4a17–20.)
These are changes in which substances move, or alter, or grow. What
the <em>Categories</em> did not explore, however, are changes in which
substances are generated or destroyed. But the theory of change
Aristotle develops in the <em>Physics</em> requires some other subject
for changes such as these—a subject of which substance is
predicated—and it identifies matter as the fundamental subject
of change (192a31–32). Change is seen in the <em>Physics</em> as
a process in which matter either takes on or loses form.</p>

<p>
The concepts of matter and form, as we noted, are absent from the
<em>Categories</em>. Individual substances—this man or that
horse—apart from their accidental characteristics—the
qualities, etc., that inhere in them—are viewed in that work as
essentially simple, unanalyzable atoms. Although there is metaphysical
structure to the fact that, e.g., <em>this horse is white</em> (a
certain quality inheres in a certain substance), the fact that
<em>this is a horse</em> is a kind of brute fact, devoid of
metaphysical structure. This horse is a primary substance, and
<em>horse</em>, the species to which it belongs, is a secondary
substance. But there is no predicative complex corresponding to the
fact that this is a horse in the way that there is such a complex
corresponding to the fact that this horse is white.</p>

<p>
But from the point of view of the <em>Physics</em>, substantial
individuals are seen as predicative complexes (cf. Matthen 1987b);
they are hylomorphic compounds—compounds of matter and
form—and the subject criterion looks rather different from the
hylomorphic perspective. <em>Metaphysics</em> Ζ.3 examines the
subject criterion from this perspective.</p>

<p>
Matter, form, and the compound of matter and form may all be
considered subjects, Aristotle tells us, (1029a2–4), but which
of them is substance? The subject criterion by itself leads to the
answer that the substance of <em>x</em> is an entirely indeterminate
matter of which <em>x</em> is composed (1029a10). For form is
predicated of matter as subject, and one can always analyze a
hylomorphic compound into its predicates and the subject of which they
are predicated. And when all predicates have been removed (in
thought), the subject that remains is nothing at all in its own
right—an entity all of whose properties are accidental to it
(1029a12–27). The resulting subject is matter from which all
form has been expunged. (Traditional scholarship calls this
“prime matter,” but Aristotle does not here indicate
whether he thinks there actually is such a thing.) So the subject
criterion leads to the answer that the substance of <em>x</em> is the
formless matter of which it is ultimately composed.</p>

<p>
But Aristotle rejects this answer as impossible (1029a28), claiming
that substance must be “separate”
(<em>chôriston</em>) and “some this” (<em>tode
ti</em>, sometimes translated “this something”), and
implying that matter fails to meet this requirement. Precisely what
the requirement amounts to is a matter of considerable scholarly
debate, however. A plausible interpretation runs as follows. Being
separate has to do with being able to exist independently (<em>x</em>
is separate from <em>y</em> if <em>x</em> is capable of existing
independently of <em>y</em>), and being some this means being a
determinate individual. So a substance must be a determinate
individual that is capable of existing on its own. (One might even
hold, although this is controversial, that on Aristotle’s
account not every “this” is also “separate.” A
particular color or shape might be considered a determinate individual
that is not capable of existing on its own—it is always the
color of shape of some substance or other.) But matter fails to be
simultaneously both <em>chôriston</em> and <em>tode ti</em>. The
matter of which a substance is composed may exist independently of
that substance (think of the wood of which a desk is composed, which
existed before the desk was made and may survive the disassembly of
the desk), but it is not as such any definite individual—it is
just a quantity of a certain kind of matter. Of course, the matter may
be construed as constituting a definite individual substance (the wood
just <em>is</em>, one might say, the particular desk it composes), but
it is in that sense not separate from the form or shape that makes it
that substance (the wood cannot be that particular desk unless it is
<em>a</em> desk). So although matter is in a sense separate and in a
sense some this, it cannot be both separate and some this. It thus
does not qualify as the substance of the thing whose matter it is.</p>

<h2 id="SubsEsse">7. Substance and Essence</h2>

<p>
Aristotle turns in Ζ.4 to a consideration of the next candidate
for substance: essence. (‘Essence’ is the standard English
translation of Aristotle’s curious phrase <em>to ti ên
einai</em>, literally “the what it was to be” for a thing.
This phrase so boggled his Roman translators that they coined the word
<em>essentia</em> to render the entire phrase, and it is from this
Latin word that ours derives. Aristotle also sometimes uses the
shorter phrase <em>to ti esti</em>, literally “the what it
is,” for approximately the same idea.) In his
 <a href="../aristotle-logic/index.html#DefEss">logical works</a>,
 Aristotle links the notion of essence to that of definition
(<em>horismos</em>)—“a definition is an account
(<em>logos</em>) that signifies an essence” (<em>Topics</em>
102a3)—and he links both of these notions to a certain kind of
<em>per se</em> predication (<em>kath’ hauto</em>, literally,
“in respect of itself”)—“what belongs to a
thing in respect of itself belongs to it in its essence (<em>en
tôi ti esti</em>)” for we refer to it “in the
account that states the essence” (<em>Posterior</em>
<em>Analytics</em>, 73a34–5). He reiterates these ideas in
Ζ.4: “there is an essence of just those things whose
<em>logos</em> is a definition” (1030a6), “the essence of
a thing is what it is said to be in respect of itself”
(1029b14). It is important to remember that for Aristotle, one defines
things, not words. The definition of tiger does not tell us the
meaning of the word ‘tiger’; it tells us what it is to be
a tiger, what a tiger is said to be in respect of itself. Thus, the
definition of tiger states the essence—the “what it is to
be” of a tiger, what is predicated of the tiger <em>per se</em>.
</p>

<p>
Aristotle’s preliminary answer (Ζ.4) to the question “What
is substance?” is that substance is essence, but there are
important qualifications. For, as he points out, “definition
(<em>horismos</em>), like ‘what it is’ (<em>ti esti</em>),
is said in many ways” (1030a19). That is, items in all the
categories are definable, so items in all the categories have
essences—just as there is an essence of man, there is also an
essence of white and an essence of musical. But, because of the
<em>pros hen</em> equivocity of ‘is’, such essences are
secondary—“definition and essence are primarily
(<em>protôs</em>) and without qualification
(<em>haplôs</em>) of substances” (1030b4–6). Thus,
Ζ.4 tells us, it is only these primary essences that are
substances. Aristotle does not here work out the details of this
“hierarchy of essences” (Loux, 1991), but it is possible
to reconstruct a theory of such a hierarchy on the basis of subsequent
developments in Book Ζ.</p>

<p>
In Ζ.6, Aristotle goes on to argue that if something is
“primary” and “spoken of in respect of itself
(<em>kath’ hauto legomenon</em>)” it is one and the same
as its essence. The precise meaning of this claim, as well as the
nature and validity of the arguments offered in support of it, are
matters of scholarly controversy. But it does seem safe to say that
Aristotle thinks that an “accidental unity” such as a pale
man is not a <em>kath’ hauto legomenon</em> (since pallor is an
accidental characteristic of a man) and so is not the same as its
essence. <em>Pale man</em>, that is to say, does not specify the
“what it is” of any primary being, and so cannot be an
essence of the primary kind. As Ζ.4 has already told us,
“only species of a genus have an essence”
(1030a11–12) in the primary sense. <em>Man</em> is a species,
and so there is an essence of man; but <em>pale man</em> is not a
species and so, even if there is such a thing as the essence of pale
man, it is not, at any rate, a primary essence.</p>

<p>
At this point there appears to be a close connection between the
essence of a substance and its species (<em>eidos</em>), and this
might tempt one to suppose that Aristotle is identifying the substance
of a thing (since the substance of a thing is its essence) with its
species. (A consequence of this idea would be that Aristotle is
radically altering his conception of the importance of the species,
which in the <em>Categories</em> he called a secondary substance, that
is, a substance only in a secondary sense.) But such an identification
would be a mistake, for two reasons. First, Aristotle’s point at
1030a11 is not that a species is an essence, but that an essence of
the primary kind corresponds to a species (e.g., <em>man</em>) and not
to some more narrowly delineated kind (e.g., <em>pale man</em>).
Second, the word ‘<em>eidos</em>’, which meant
‘species’ in the logical works, has acquired a new meaning
in a hylomorphic context, where it means ‘form’
(contrasted with ‘matter’) rather than
‘species’ (contrasted with ‘genus’). In the
conceptual framework of <em>Metaphysics</em> Ζ, a universal such
as <em>man</em> or <em>horse</em>—which was called a species and
a secondary substance in the <em>Categories</em>—is construed as
“not a substance, but a compound of a certain formula and a
certain matter, taken universally” (Ζ.10, 1035b29–30). The
<em>eidos</em> that is primary substance in Book Ζ is not the
species that an individual substance belongs to but the form that is
predicated of the matter of which it is
 composed.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#4" name="note-4">4</a>]</sup></p>
 
<h2 id="SubsHyloComp">8. Substances as Hylomorphic Compounds</h2>

<p>
The role of form in this hylomorphic context is the topic of
Ζ.7–9. (Although these chapters were almost certainly not
originally included in Book Ζ—there is no reference to
them, for example, in the summary of Ζ given in Η.1, which
skips directly from Ζ.6 to Ζ.10—they provide a link
between substance and form and thus fill what would otherwise be a gap
in the argument.) Since individual substances are seen as hylomorphic
compounds, the role of matter and form in their generation must be
accounted for. Whether we are thinking of natural objects, such as
plants and animals, or artifacts, such as houses, the requirements for
generation are the same. We do not produce the matter (to suppose that
we do leads to an infinite regress) nor do we produce the form (what
could we make it out of?); rather, we put the form into the matter,
and produce the compound (Ζ.8, 1033a30–b9). Both the matter and
the form must pre-exist (Ζ.9, 1034b12). But the source of motion in
both cases—what Aristotle calls the “moving cause”
of the coming to be—is the form. </p>

<p>
In artistic production, the form is found in the soul of the artisan,
for “the art of building is the form of the house”
(1034a24) and “the form is in the soul” (1032b23) of the
artisan. For example, the builder has in mind the plan or design for a
house and he knows how to build; he then “enmatters” that
plan or design by putting it into the materials out of which he builds
the house. In natural production, the form is found in the parent,
where “the begetter is the same in kind as the begotten, not one
in number but one in form—for man begets man”
(1033b30–2). But in either case, the form pre-exists and is not
produced (1033b18).</p>

<p>
As for what is produced in such hylomorphic productions, it is
correctly described by the name of its form, not by that of its
matter. What is produced is a house or a man, not bricks or flesh. Of
course, what is made of gold may still be described in terms of its
material components, but we should call it not “gold” but
“golden” (1033a7). For if gold is the matter out of which
a statue is made, there was gold present at the start, and so it was
not gold that came into being. It was a statue that came into being,
and although the statue is golden—i.e., made of gold—it
cannot be identified with the gold of which it was made.</p>

<p>
The essence of such a hylomorphic compound is evidently its form, not
its matter. As Aristotle says “by form I mean the essence of
each thing, and its primary substance” (1032b1), and “when
I speak of substance without matter I mean the essence”
(1032b14). It is the form of a substance that makes it the kind of
thing that it is, and hence it is form that satisfies the condition
initially required for being the <em>substance of</em> something. The
substance of a thing is its form.</p>

<h2 id="SubsDefi">9. Substance and Definition</h2>

<p>
In Ζ.10 and 11, Aristotle returns to the consideration of essence
and definition left off in Ζ.6, but now within the hylomorphic
context developed in Ζ.7–9. The main question these
chapters consider is whether the definition of <em>x</em> ever
includes a reference to the matter of <em>x</em>. If some definitions
include a reference to matter, then the link between essence and form
would seem to be weakened. </p>

<p>
Aristotle begins Ζ.10 by endorsing the following principle about
definitions and their parts: “a definition is an account, and
every account has parts, and part of the account stands to part of the
thing in just the same way that the whole account stands to the whole
thing” (1034b20–22). That is, if <em>y</em> is a part of a
definable thing <em>x</em>, then the definition of <em>x</em> will
include as a part something <em>z</em> that corresponds to <em>y</em>.
Indeed, <em>z</em> must stand to <em>y</em> in the same relation that
the definition of <em>x</em> stands in to <em>x</em>; that is,
<em>z</em> is the definition of <em>y</em>. So, according to this
principle, the definition of a thing will include the definitions of
its parts.</p>

<p>
In a way, this consequence of the principle seems very plausible,
given Aristotle’s idea that it is universals that are definable
(Ζ.11, 1036a29). Consider as a definiendum a universal, such as
<em>man</em>, and its definiens, <em>rational</em> <em>animal</em>.
The parts of this definiens are the universals <em>rational</em> and
<em>animal</em>. If these parts are, in turn, definable, then each
should be replaced, in the definition of <em>man</em>, with its own
definition, and so on. In this way the complete and adequate
definition of a universal such as <em>man</em> will contain no parts
that are further definable. All proper, or completely analyzed,
definitions are ultimately composed of simple terms that are not
further definable.</p>

<p>
But the implication of this idea for the definitions of hylomorphic
compounds is obvious: since matter appears to be a part of such a
compound, the definition of the compound will include, as a part, the
definitions of its material components. And this consequence seems
implausible to Aristotle. A circle, for example, seems to be composed
of two semicircles (for it obviously may be divided into two
semicircles), but the definition of <em>circle</em> cannot be composed
of the definitions of its two semicircular parts. For, as Aristotle
points out (1035b9), <em>semicircle</em> is defined in terms of
<em>circle</em>, and not the other way around. His point is well
taken, for if circles were defined in terms of semicircles, then
presumably semicircles would be defined in terms of the
quarter-circles of which they are composed, and so on, <em>ad
infinitum</em>. The resulting infinite regress would make it
impossible to define <em>circle</em> at all, for one would never reach
the ultimate “simple” parts of which such a definition
would be composed.</p>

<p>
Aristotle flirts with the idea of distinguishing between different
senses in which one thing can be a part of another (1034b33), but
instead proposes a different solution: to specify carefully the whole
of which the matter is allegedly a part. “The bronze is part of
the compound statue, but not of the statue spoken of as form”
(1035a6). Similarly, “the line when divided passes away into its
halves, and the man into bones and muscle and flesh, but it does not
follow that they are composed of these as parts of their
essence” (1035a17–20). Rather, “it is not the
substance but the compound that is divided into the body and its parts
as into matter” (1035b21–2).</p>

<p>
In restating his point “yet more clearly” (1035b4),
Aristotle notes parenthetically another important aspect of his theory
of substance. He reiterates the priority of form, and its parts, to
the matter into which a compound is divided, and notes that “the
soul of animals (for this is the substance of living things) is their
substance” (1035b15). The idea recurs in Ζ.11, where he
announces that “it is clear that the soul is the primary
substance and the body is matter” (1037a5). It is further
developed, in the <em>Metaphysics</em>, in Ζ.17, as we will see
below, and especially in <em>De Anima</em>. For more detail on this
topic, see Section 3 of the entry on
 <a href="../aristotle-psychology/">Aristotle’s psychology</a>.</p>
 
<p>
Returning now to the problem raised by the apparent need to refer to
matter in the definition of a substance, we may note that the solution
Aristotle offered in Ζ.10 is only partially successful. His point
seems to be that whereas bronze may be a part of a particular statue,
neither that particular batch of bronze nor even bronze in general
enters into the essence of statue, since being made of bronze is no
part of what it is to be a statue. But that is only because statues,
although they must be made of some kind of matter, do not require any
particular kind of matter. But what about kinds of substances that do
require particular kinds of matter? Aristotle’s distinction
between form and compound cannot be used in such cases to isolate
essence from matter. Thus there may after all be reasons for thinking
that reference to matter will have to intrude into at least some
definitions.</p>

<p>
In Ζ.11, Aristotle addresses just such a case (although the
passage is difficult and there is disagreement over its
interpretation). “The form of man is always found in flesh and
bones and parts of this kind,” Aristotle writes (1036b4). The
point is not just that each particular man must be made of matter, but
that each one must be made of matter of a particular kind—flesh
and bones, etc. “Some things,” he continues, “surely
are a particular form in a particular matter” (1036b23), so that
it is not possible to define them without reference to their material
parts (1036b28). Nevertheless, Aristotle ends Ζ.11 as if he has
defended the claim that definition is of the form alone. Perhaps his
point is that whenever it is essential to a substance that it be made
of a certain kind of matter (e.g., that man be made of flesh and
bones, or that “a saw cannot be made of wool or wood,”
Η.4, 1044a28) this is in some sense a formal or structural
requirement. A kind of matter, after all, can itself be analyzed
hylomorphically—bronze, for example, is a mixture of copper and
tin according to a certain ratio or formula (<em>logos</em>), which is
in turn predicated of some more generic underlying subject. The
reference to matter in a definition will thus always be to a certain
kind of matter, and hence to a predicate, rather than a subject. At
any rate, if by ‘matter’ one has in mind the ultimate
subject alluded to in Ζ.3 (so-called ‘prime matter’),
there will be no reference to it in any definition, “for this is
indefinite” (1037a27).</p>

<p>

 <a name="Unity"></a>
 Ζ.12 introduces a new problem about definitions—the
so-called “unity of definition.” The problem is this:
definitions are complex (a definiens is always some combination of
terms), so what accounts for the definiendum being <em>one</em> thing,
rather than many (1037b10)? Suppose that man is defined as
<em>two-footed animal</em>; “why is this one and not
many—<em>two-footed</em> and <em>animal</em>?”
(1037b13–14). Presumably, Aristotle has in mind his discussion
in Ζ.4 of such “accidental unities” as a pale man.
The difference cannot be that our language contains a single word
(‘man’) for a two-footed animal, but no single word for a
pale man, for Aristotle has already conceded (1029b28) that we might
very well have had a single term (he suggests <em>himation</em>,
literally ‘cloak’) for a pale man, but that would still
not make the formula ‘pale man’ a definition nor <em>pale
man</em> an essence (1030a2).</p>

<p>
Aristotle proposes a solution that applies to definitions reached by
the “method of division.” According to this method (see
 <a href="../aristotle-logic/index.html#MetDiv">Aristotle’s logic</a>),
 one begins with the broadest genus containing the species to be
defined, and divides the genus into two sub-genera by means of some
differentia. One then locates the definiendum in one of the
sub-genera, and proceeds to divide this by another differentia, and so
on, until one arrives at the definiendum species. This is a classic
definition by genus and differentia. Aristotle’s proposal is
that “the division should be by the differentia of the
differentia” (1038a9). For example, if one uses the differentia
<em>footed</em> to divide the genus <em>animal</em>, one then uses a
differentia such as <em>cloven-footed</em> for the next division. If
one divides in this way, Aristotle claims, “clearly the last (or
completing, <em>teleutaia</em>) differentia will be the substance of
the thing and its definition” (1038a19). For each
“differentia of a differentia” entails its predecessor
(being cloven-footed entails being footed), and so the long chain of
differentiae can be replaced simply by the last differentia. As
Aristotle points out, “saying <em>footed two-footed animal</em>
… is saying the same thing more than once”
(1038a22–24).</p>

<p>
This proposal shows how a long string of differentiae in a definition
can be reduced to one, but it does not solve the problem of the unity
of definition. For we are still faced with the apparent fact that
genus + differentia constitutes a plurality even if the differentia is
the last, or “completing,” one. It is not surprising,
then, that Aristotle
 <a href="#UnitReco">returns to the problem of unity</a>
 later (Η.6) and offers a different solution.</p>

<h2 id="SubsUniv">10. Substances and Universals</h2>

<p>
At this point, we seem to have a clear idea about the nature of
substantial form as Aristotle conceives of it. A substantial form is
the essence of a substance, and it corresponds to a species. Since it
is an essence, a substantial form is what is denoted by the definiens
of a definition. Since only universals are definable, substantial
forms are universals. That substantial forms are universals is
confirmed by Aristotle’s comment, at the end of Ζ.8, that
“Socrates and Callias are different because of their matter
… but they are the same in form” (1034a6–8). For
them to be the same in form is for them to have the same form, i.e.,
for one and the same substantial form to be predicated of two
different clumps of matter. And being “predicated of many”
is what makes something a universal (<em>De Interpretatione</em>
17a37). </p>

<p>
But Ζ.13 throws our entire understanding into disarray. Aristotle
begins by returning to the candidates for the title of <em>ousia</em>
introduced in Ζ.3, and points out that having now discussed the
claims of the subject and the essence, it is time to consider the
third candidate, the universal. But the remainder of the chapter
consists of a barrage of arguments to the conclusion that universals
are not substances.</p>

<p>
Ζ.13 therefore produces a fundamental tension in Aristotle’s
metaphysics that has fragmented his interpreters. Some maintain that
Aristotle’s theory is ultimately inconsistent, on the grounds
that it is committed to all three of the following propositions:</p>

<blockquote>

<table>
<tbody><tr>
  <td>(i)</td>
  <td>Substance is form.</td> </tr>
<tr>
  <td>(ii)</td>
  <td>Form is universal.</td> </tr>
<tr>
  <td>(iii)</td>
  <td>No universal is a substance.</td> </tr>
</tbody></table>
</blockquote>

<p>
Others have provided interpretations according to which Aristotle does
not maintain all of (i)–(iii), and there is a considerable
variety of such interpretations, too many to be canvassed here. But
there are two main, and opposed, lines of interpretation. According to
one, Aristotle’s substantial forms are not universals after all,
but each belongs exclusively to the particular whose form it is, and
there are therefore as many substantial forms of a given kind as there
are particulars of that kind. According to the other,
Aristotle’s arguments in Ζ.13 are not intended to show that
no universal is a substance, <em>tout court</em>, but some weaker
thesis that is compatible with there being only one substantial form
for all of the particulars belonging to the same species. Proponents
of particular forms (or essences) include Sellars 1957, Harter 1975,
Hartman 1977, Irwin 1988, Witt 1989b. Opponents include Woods 1967,
Owen 1978, Code 1986, Loux 1991, Lewis 1991. </p>

<p>
It would be foolish to attempt to resolve this issue within the
confines of the present entry, as it is perhaps the largest, and most
disputed, single interpretative issue concerning Aristotle’s
<em>Metaphysics</em>. I will, instead, mention some of the main
considerations brought up on each side of this dispute, and give my
reasons for thinking that substantial forms are universals.</p>

<p>
The idea that substantial forms are particulars is supported by
Aristotle’s claims that a substance is “separate and some
this” (<em>chôriston kai tode ti</em>, Ζ.3), that
there are no universals apart from their particulars (Ζ.13), and that
universals are not substances (Ζ.13). On the other side, the idea that
substantial forms are universals is supported by Aristotle’s
claims that substances are, <em>par excellence</em>, the definable
entities (Ζ.4), that definition is of the universal (Ζ.11), and that
it is impossible to define particulars (Ζ.15).</p>

<p>
In my opinion, the indefinability of particulars makes it impossible
for substantial forms to be particulars. If there were a substantial
form that is unique to some sensible particular, say Callias, then the
definition corresponding to that form, or essence, would apply
uniquely to Callias—it would define him, which is precisely what
Aristotle says cannot be done. The question, then, is whether the
evidence against substantial forms being universals can be countered.
This is less clear, but the following considerations are relevant. (1)
Aristotle’s claim that a substantial form is an individual
(<em>tode ti</em>) does not exclude its being a universal
(<em>katholou</em>). Universals are contrasted with particulars
(<em>kath’ hekasta</em>), not individuals (although Aristotle
does sometimes ignore the distinction between <em>tode ti</em> and
<em>kath’ hekaston</em>). What makes something a <em>tode
ti</em> is its being a fully determinate thing, not further
differentiable; what makes something a <em>kath’ hekaston</em>
is its being a particular thing, unrepeatable, and not predicated of
anything else. There is thus the possibility of a universal <em>tode
ti</em>—a fully determinate universal not further divisible into
lower-level universals, but predicated of numerous particulars. (2)
The claim that there are no universals apart from particulars needs to
be understood in context. When Aristotle asserts (1038b33) that
“there is no animal apart from the particulars (<em>ta
tina</em>)” he is just as likely to be referring to the
particular <em>kinds</em> of animals as he is to particular specimens.
If so, his point may be that a generic kind, such as animal, is
ontologically dependent on its species, and hence on the substantial
forms that are the essences of those species. (3) The arguments of
Ζ.13 against the substantiality of universals are presented as
part of a give-and-take investigation of the perplexities involved in
the notion of substantial form. It is not clear, therefore, whether
the blanket claim “No universal is a substance” is
intended to be accepted without qualification. Indeed, a closer
examination of the arguments may show that qualifications are required
if the arguments are to be cogent. For example, the argument at
1038b11–15 is based on the premise that the substance of
<em>x</em> is peculiar (<em>idion</em>) to <em>x</em>. It then draws
the conclusion that a universal cannot be the substance of all of its
instances (for it could not be <em>idion</em> to all of them), and
concludes that it must be the substance “of none.” But
note that this conclusion does not say that no universal can be a
substance, but only that no universal can be the substance of any of
its instances (cf. Code 1978). Aristotle’s point may be that
since form is predicated of matter, a substantial form is predicated
of various clumps of matter. But it is not the substance of those
clumps of matter, for it is predicated accidentally of them. The thing
with which it is uniquely correlated, and of which it is the
substance, is not one of its instances, but is the substantial form
<em>itself</em>. This conclusion should not be surprising in light of
Aristotle’s claim in Ζ.6 that “each substance is one
and the same as its essence.” A universal substantial form just
is that essence.</p>

<h2 id="SubsCausBein">11. Substance as Cause of Being</h2>

<p>
In Ζ.17 Aristotle proposes a new point of departure in his effort
to say what sort of a thing substance is. The new idea is that a
substance is a “principle and a cause” (<em>archê
kai aitia</em>, 1041a9) of being. Before looking at the details of his
account, we will need to make a brief detour into Aristotle’s
theory of causes. The relevant texts are <em>Physics</em> II.3,
<em>Posterior</em> <em>Analytics</em> II.11, and <em>Metaphysics</em>
Α.3 and Δ.2. See also the entry on
 <a href="../aristotle-natphil/">Aristotle’s natural philosophy</a>
 and Section 2 of the entry on
 <a href="../aristotle-psychology/">Aristotle’s psychology</a>.</p>
 
<p>
The word <em>aitia</em> (“cause” or, perhaps better,
“explanation”), Aristotle tells us, is “said in many
ways.” In one sense, a cause is “that out of which a thing
comes to be, and which persists; e.g., bronze, silver, and the genus
of these are causes of a statue or a bowl” (<em>Physics</em>
194b24). A cause in this sense has been traditionally called a
<em>material</em> cause, although Aristotle himself did not use this
label. In a second sense, a cause is “the form … the
account of the essence” (194b27), traditionally called the
<em>formal</em> cause. A third sense, traditionally called the
<em>efficient</em> cause, is “the primary source of change or
rest” (194b30). In this sense, Aristotle says, an adviser is the
cause of an action, a father is the cause of his child, and in general
the producer is the cause of the product. Fourth is what is
traditionally called the <em>final</em> cause, which Aristotle
characterizes as “the end (<em>telos</em>), that for which a
thing is done” (194b33). In this sense, he says, health is the
cause of walking, since we might explain a person’s walking by
saying that he walks in order to be healthy—health is what the
walking is <em>for</em>. Note that, as in this case, “things may
be causes of one another—hard work of fitness, and fitness of
hard work—although not in the same sense: fitness is what hard
work is for, whereas hard work is principle of motion” (195a10).
So hard work is the efficient cause of fitness, since one becomes fit
by means of hard work, while fitness is the final cause of hard work,
since one works hard in order to become fit.</p>

<p>
Although Aristotle is careful to distinguish four different kinds of
cause (or four different senses of ‘cause’), it is
important to note that he claims that one and the same thing can be a
cause in more than one sense. As he puts it, “form, mover, and
<em>telos</em> often coincide” (198a25). And in <em>De
Anima</em> he is perfectly explicit that the soul, which is the form
or essence of a living thing, “is a cause in three of the ways
we have distinguished” (415b10)—efficient, formal, and
final.</p>

<p>
Let us return to Aristotle’s discussion in Ζ.17. The job of
a cause or principle of being, he notes, is to explain why one thing
belongs to another (1041a11); that is, it is to explain some
predicational fact. What needs to be explained, for example, is why
<em>this is a man</em>, or <em>that is a house</em>. But what kind of
a question is this? The only thing that can be a man is a man; the
only thing that can be a house is a house. So we would appear to be
asking why a man is a man, or why a house is a house, and these seem
to be foolish questions that all have the same answer: because each
thing is itself (1041a17–20). The questions must therefore be
rephrased by taking advantage of the possibility of a hylomorphic
analysis. We must ask, e.g., “Why are these things, i.e., bricks
and stones, a house?” (1041a26). The answer Aristotle proposes
is that the cause of being of a substance (e.g., of a house) is the
form or essence that is predicated of the matter (e.g., of the bricks
and stones) that constitute that substance. The essence is not always
just a formal cause; in some cases, Aristotle says, it is also a final
cause (he gives the examples of a house and a bed), and in some cases
an efficient cause (1041a29–30). But in any case “what we
seek is the cause, i.e., the form, by reason of which the matter is
some definite thing; and this is the substance of the thing”
(1041b6–9) and “the primary cause of its being”
(1041b27).</p>

<p>
Notice that the explanandum in these cases (“why is this a
man?” or “why is that a house?”) involves a species
predication (“Callias is a man,” “Fallingwater is a
house”). But the answer Aristotle proposes invokes a hylomorphic
analysis of these questions, in which form is predicated of matter. So
Callias is a man because the form or essence of man is present in the
flesh and bones that constitute the body of Callias; Fallingwater is a
house because the form of house is present in the materials of which
Fallingwater is made. In general, a species predication is explained
in terms of an underlying form predication, whose subject is not the
particular compound but its matter. Form predications are thus more
basic than their corresponding species predications. A substantial
form, as a primary definable, is its own substance, for it is
essentially predicated of itself alone. But the substantial form of a
material compound, because it is predicated (accidentally) of the
matter of the compound, is the cause of the compound’s being the
kind of thing that it is. The form is therefore, in a derivative way,
the substance of the compound, as well.</p>

<h2 id="ActuPote">12. Actuality and Potentiality</h2>

<p>
In <em>Metaphysics</em> Ζ, Aristotle introduces the distinction
between matter and form synchronically, applying it to an individual
substance at a particular time. The matter of a substance is the stuff
it is composed of; the form is the way that stuff is put together so
that the whole it constitutes can perform its characteristic
functions. But soon he begins to apply the distinction diachronically,
across time. This connects the matter/form distinction to another key
Aristotelian distinction, that between potentiality (<em>dunamis</em>)
and actuality (<em>entelecheia</em> or <em>energeia</em>). This
distinction is the main topic of Book Θ.</p>

<p>
Aristotle distinguishes between two different senses of the term
<em>dunamis</em>. In the strictest sense, a <em>dunamis</em> is the
<em>power</em> that a thing has to produce a change. A thing has a
<em>dunamis</em> in this sense when it has within it a “source
of change in something else (or in itself qua other)”
(Θ.1, 1046a12; cf. Δ.12). The exercise of such a power is
a <em>kinêsis</em>—a movement or process. So, for example,
the housebuilder’s craft is a power whose exercise is the
process of housebuilding. But there is a second sense of
<em>dunamis</em>—and it is the one in which Aristotle is mainly
interested—that might be better translated as
‘potentiality’. For, as Aristotle tells us, in this sense
<em>dunamis</em> is related not to movement (<em>kinêsis</em>)
but to actuality (<em>energeia</em>)(Θ.6, 1048a25). A
<em>dunamis</em> in this sense is not a thing’s power to produce
a change but rather its capacity to be in a different and more
completed state. Aristotle thinks that potentiality so understood is
indefinable (1048a37), claiming that the general idea can be grasped
from a consideration of cases. Actuality is to potentiality, Aristotle
tells us, as “someone waking is to someone sleeping, as someone
seeing is to a sighted person with his eyes closed, as that which has
been shaped out of some matter is to the matter from which it has been
shaped” (1048b1–3).</p>

<p>
This last illustration is particularly illuminating. Consider, for
example, a piece of wood, which can be carved or shaped into a table
or into a bowl. In Aristotle’s terminology, the wood has (at
least) two different potentialities, since it is potentially a table
and also potentially a bowl. The matter (in this case, wood) is linked
with potentialty; the substance (in this case, the table or the bowl)
is linked with actuality. The as yet uncarved wood is only potentially
a table, and so it might seem that once it is carved the wood is
actually a table. Perhaps this is what Aristotle means, but it is
possible that he does not wish to consider the wood to be a table. His
idea might be that not only can a piece of raw wood in the
carpenter’s workshop be considered a potential table (since it
can be transformed into one), but the wood composing the completed
table is also, in a sense, a potential table. The idea here is that it
is not the wood qua wood that is actually a table, but the wood qua
table. Considered as matter, it remains only potentially the thing
that it is the matter of. (A contemporary philosopher might make this
point by refusing to identify the wood with the table, saying instead
that the wood only constitutes the table and is not identical to the
table it constitutes.)</p>

<p>
Since Aristotle gives form priority over matter, we would expect him
similarly to give actuality priority over potentiality. And that is
exactly what we find (Θ.8, 1049b4–5). Aristotle
distinguishes between priority in <em>logos</em> (account or
definition), in time, and in substance. (1) Actuality is prior in
<em>logos</em> since we must cite the actuality when we give an
account of its corresponding potentiality. Thus, ‘visible’
means ‘capable of <em>being seen</em>’;
‘buildable’ means ‘capable of <em>being
built</em>’(1049b14–16). (2) As regards temporal priority,
by contrast, potentiality may well seem to be prior to actuality,
since the wood precedes the table that is built from it, and the acorn
precedes the oak that it grows into. Nevertheless, Aristotle finds
that even temporally there is a sense in which actuality is prior to
potentiality: “the actual which is identical in species though
not in number with a potentially existing thing is prior to it”
(1049b18–19). A particular acorn is, of course, temporally prior
to the particular oak tree that it grows into, but it is preceded in
time by the actual oak tree that produced it, with which it is
identical in species. The seed (potential substance) must have been
preceded by an adult (actual substance). So in this sense actuality is
prior even in time.</p>

<p>
(3) Aristotle argues for the priority in substance of actuality over
potentiality in two ways. (a) The first argument makes use of his
notion of final causality. Things that come to be move toward an end
(<em>telos</em>)—the boy becomes a man, the acorn becomes an
oak—and “the actuality is the end, and it is for the sake
of this that the potentiality is acquired ... animals do not see in
order that they may have sight, but they have sight that they may see
... matter exists in a potential state, just because it may come to
its form; and when it exists <em>actually</em>, then it is in its
form” (1050a9–17). Form or actuality is the end toward
which natural processes are directed. Actuality is therefore a cause
in more than one sense of a thing’s realizing its potential. As
we noted in Section 11, one and the same thing may be the final,
formal, and efficient cause of another. Suppose an acorn realizes its
potential to become an oak tree. The efficient cause here is the
actual oak tree that produced the acorn; the formal cause is the
<em>logos</em> defining that actuality; the final cause is the
<em>telos</em> toward which the acorn develops—an actual
(mature) oak tree.</p>

<p>
(b) Aristotle also offers (1050b6–1051a2) an “even
stricter” argument for his claim that actuality is prior in
substance to potentiality. A potentiality is for either of a pair of
opposites; so anything that is capable of being is also capable of not
being. What is capable of not being might possibly not be, and what
might possibly not be is perishable. Hence anything with the mere
potentiality to be is perishable. What is eternal is imperishable, and
so nothing that is eternal can exist only potentially—what is
eternal must be fully actual. But the eternal is prior in substance to
the perishable. For the eternal can exist without the perishable, but
not conversely, and that is what priority in substance amounts to (cf.
Δ.11, 1019a2). So what is actual is prior in substance to what
is potential.</p>

<h2 id="UnitReco">13. Unity Reconsidered</h2>

<p>
In Η.6, Aristotle returns to the problem of the unity of
definition
 (<a href="#Unity">discussed above in Section 9</a>)
 and offers a new solution based on the concepts of potentiality and
actuality. He begins by pointing out (recalling the language of
Ζ.17) that the things whose unity he is trying to explain are
those “which have several parts and in which the totality is
not, as it were, a mere heap, but the whole is something besides the
parts” (1045a8–10). His task is to explain the unity of
such complexes.</p>

<p>
The problem is insoluble, he says, unless one realizes that “one
element is matter and another is form, and one is potentially and the
other is actually.” Once one realizes this, “the question
will no longer be thought a difficulty” (1045a20–25). He
offers the following example (1045a26–35). Suppose <em>round
bronze</em> were the definition of ‘cloak’. If someone
were to ask “what makes a cloak one thing, a unity?” the
answer would be obvious. For bronze is the matter, and roundness is
the form. The bronze is potentially round, and round is what the
bronze actually is when it has received this form. The cause of the
unity of the cloak (in this sense of ‘cloak’) is just the
cause of bronze being made round. Since the cloak is something that
was produced, or brought into being, there is no cause of its unity
other than the agent who put the form into the matter. Bronze (the
matter) is a potential sphere, and the cloak is an actual sphere. But
<em>round bronze</em> is equally the essence of both the actual sphere
and the potential one. The bronze and the roundness are not two
separate things. The bronze is potentially a sphere, and when it is
made round it constitutes an actual one—a single sphere of
bronze.</p>

<p>
It is easy to see how this hylomorphic analysis explains the unity of
a substantial material particular, since neither the matter nor the
form of such a particular is by itself a single material individual,
and it is only when they are taken together that they constitute such
an individual. But the problem Aristotle is trying to solve concerns
“the unity of the thing whose account we call a
definition” (Ζ.12, 1037b11). And since proper definables are
universals, it remains to be seen how the proposed solution applies to
them. After all, universals are not material objects, and so it is not
clear how they can be viewed as hylomorphic compounds. But Aristotle
has at his disposal a concept that can fill this bill perfectly, viz.,
the concept of intelligible matter (<em>hulê
noêtê</em>). (The main purpose of intelligible matter is
to provide something quasi-material for pure geometrical objects that
are not realized in bronze or stone, for example, to be made of.) So I
surmise that it is for this reason that Aristotle goes on (1045a33) to
introduce matter into the current context. If this is so, we may
conclude that the material component in the definition of a species is
intelligible matter. Elsewhere, he explicitly describes genus as
matter: “the genus is the matter of that of which it is called
the genus” (Ι.8, 1058a23). So a species too, although it is not
itself a material object, can be considered a hylomorphic compound.
Its matter is its genus, which is only potentially the species
defined; its differentia is the form that actualizes the matter. The
genus does not actually exist independently of its species any more
than bronze exists apart from all form. The genus <em>animal</em>, for
example, is just that which is potentially some specific kind of
animal or other. Aristotle concludes (1045b17–21) that
“the proximate matter and the form are one and the same thing,
the one potentially, and the other actually ... the potential and the
actual are somehow one.”</p>

<p>
This solution, of course, applies only to hylomorphic compounds. But
that is all it needs to do, according to Aristotle. For he ends the
chapter by claiming that the problem of unity does not arise for other
kinds of compounds. “All things which have no matter are without
qualification essentially unities” (1045b23).</p>

<p>
I am grateful to István Bodnar for his help in clarifying and
improving my presentation, in the supplement on Nonsubstantial
Particulars, of Frede’s reading of Aristotle’s definition of
‘in a subject’ (<i>Cat</i>. 1a25), and for stressing the
underlying similarity between the Frede and Owen readings.</p>
