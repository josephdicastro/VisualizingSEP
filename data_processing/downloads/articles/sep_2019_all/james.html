(ca. 1895, in <em>The Letters of William James</em>,
ed. by Henry James, Boston, 1920) 

<h1>William James</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Thu Sep 7, 2000; substantive revision Fri Oct 20, 2017</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>

William James was an original thinker in and between the disciplines
of physiology, psychology and philosophy. His twelve-hundred page
masterwork, <em>The Principles of Psychology</em> (1890), is a rich
blend of physiology, psychology, philosophy, and personal reflection
that has given us such ideas as “the stream of thought”
and the baby’s impression of the world “as one great blooming,
buzzing confusion” (PP 462). It contains seeds of pragmatism and
phenomenology, and influenced generations of thinkers in Europe and
America, including Edmund Husserl, Bertrand Russell, John Dewey, and
Ludwig Wittgenstein. James studied at Harvard’s Lawrence Scientific
School and the School of Medicine, but his writings were from the
outset as much philosophical as scientific. “Some Remarks on
Spencer’s Notion of Mind as Correspondence” (1878) and
“The Sentiment of Rationality” (1879, 1882) presage his
future pragmatism and pluralism, and contain the first statements of
his view that philosophical theories are reflections of a
philosopher’s temperament.</p>

<p>

James hints at his religious concerns in his earliest essays and
in <em>The Principles</em>, but they become more explicit in <em>The
Will to Believe and Other Essays in Popular Philosophy</em>
(1897), <em>Human Immortality: Two Supposed Objections to the
Doctrine</em> (1898), <em>The Varieties of Religious Experience</em>
(1902) and <em>A Pluralistic Universe</em> (1909). James oscillated
between thinking that a “study in human nature” such
as <em>Varieties</em> could contribute to a “Science of
Religion” and the belief that religious experience involves an
altogether supernatural domain, somehow inaccessible to science but
accessible to the individual human subject. </p>

<p>

James made some of his most important philosophical contributions in
the last decade of his life. In a burst of writing in 1904–5
(collected in <em> Essays in Radical Empiricism</em> (1912)) he set
out the metaphysical view most commonly known as “neutral
monism,” according to which there is one fundamental
“stuff” that is neither material nor mental.  In
“A Pluralistic Universe” he defends the mystical and
anti-pragmatic view that concepts distort rather than reveal reality,
and in his influential <em>Pragmatism</em> (1907), he presents
systematically a set of views about truth, knowledge, reality,
religion, and philosophy that permeate his writings from the late
1870s onwards.</p>

<h2 id="EarlWrit">2. Early Writings</h2>

<h3 id="RemaSpenDefiMindCorr1878">“Remarks on Spencer’s Definition of Mind as Correspondence” (1878)</h3>

<p>

Although he was officially a professor of psychology when he published
it, James’s discussion of Herbert Spencer broaches characteristic
themes of his philosophy: the importance of religion and the passions,
the variety of human responses to life, and the idea that we help to
“create” the truths that we “register” (E 21). Taking up Spencer’s
view that the adjustment of the organism to the environment is the
basic feature of mental evolution, James charges that Spencer projects
his own vision of what ought to be onto the phenomena he claims to
describe. Survival, James asserts, is merely one of many interests
human beings have: “The social affections, all the various forms of
play, the thrilling intimations of art, the delights of philosophic
contemplation, the rest of religious emotion, the joy of moral
self-approbation, the charm of fancy and of wit—some or all of
these are absolutely required to make the notion of mere existence
tolerable;…” (E 13). We are all teleological creatures at base,
James holds, each with a set of <em>a priori</em> values and
categories. Spencer “merely takes sides with the <em>telos</em> he
happens to prefer” (E 18).</p>

<p>

James’s characteristic empiricism appears in his claim that values and
categories fight it out in the course of human experience, and that
their conflicts “can only be solved <em>ambulando</em>, and not by any
<em>a priori</em> definition.” The “formula which proves to have the
most massive destiny,” he concludes, “will be the true one” (E
17). Yet James wishes to defend his sense that any such formulation
will be determined as much by a freely-acting human mind as by the
world, a position he later (in <em>Pragmatism</em>) calls “humanism”:
“there belongs to mind, from its birth upward, a spontaneity, a
vote. It is in the game, and not a mere looker-on; and its judgments
of the should-be, its ideals, cannot be peeled off from the body of
the cogitandum as if they were excrescences…” (E 21).</p>

<h3 id="SentRati18791882">“The Sentiment of Rationality” (1879, 1882)</h3>

<p>

The substance of this essay was first published in <em>Mind</em> in
1879 and in the <em>Princeton Review</em> in 1882, and then
republished in <em>The Will to Believe and Other Essays in Popular
Philosophy</em> in 1897. Although he never quite says that rationality
is a sentiment, James holds that a sentiment—really a set of
sentiments—is a “mark” of rationality. The philosopher, James
writes, will recognize the rationality of a conception “as he
recognizes everything else, by certain subjective marks with which it
affects him. When he gets the marks, he may know that he has got the
rationality.” These marks include a “strong feeling of ease, peace,
rest” (WB 57), and a “feeling of the sufficiency of the present
moment, of its absoluteness” (WB 58). There is also a “passion for
parsimony” (WB 58) that is felt in grasping theoretical unifications,
as well as a passion for distinguishing, a “loyalty to clearness and
integrity of perception, dislike of blurred outlines, of vague
identifications” (WB 59). The ideal philosopher, James holds, blends
these two passions of rationality, and even some great philosophers go
too far in one direction or another: Spinoza’s unity of all things in
one substance is “barren,” as is Hume’s “‘looseness and
separateness’ of everything…” (WB 60).</p>

<p>

Sentiments of rationality operate not just in logic or science, but in
ordinary life. When we first move into a room, for example, “we do not
know what draughts may blow in upon our back, what doors may open,
what forms may enter, what interesting objects may be found in
cupboards and corners.” These minor uncertainties act as “mental
irritant[s],” which disappear when we come to know our way
around the room, to “feel at home” there (WB 67–8).</p>

<p>

James begins the second part of his essay by considering the case when
“two conceptions [are] equally fit to satisfy the logical demand” for
fluency or unification. At this point, he holds, one must consider a
“practical” component of rationality.  The conception that “awakens
the active impulses, or satisfies other aesthetic demands better than
the other, will be accounted the more rational conception, and will
deservedly prevail” (WB 66). James puts the point both as one of
psychology—a prediction of what will occur—and as one
of judgment, for he holds that it will prevail “deservedly.” </p>

<p>

As in his essay on Spencer, James explores the relations between
temperaments and philosophical theorizing.  Idealism, he holds,
“will be chosen by a man of one emotional constitution,
materialism by another.” Idealism offers a sense of intimacy
with the universe, the feeling that ultimately I “am all.”
But materialists find in idealism “a narrow, close, sick-room
air,” and prefer to conceive of an uncertain, dangerous and wild
universe that has “no respect for our ego.” Let “the
tides flow,” the materialist thinks, “even though they
flow over us” (WB 76).  James is sympathetic both to the idea
that the universe is something we can be intimate with and to the idea
that it is wild and unpredictable.  If he criticizes idealism for its
“sick-room air,” he criticizes reductive forms of
materialism for denying to “our most intimate powers…all
relevancy in universal affairs” (WB 71). The intimacy and the
wildness portrayed in these contrasting philosophies answer to
propensities, passions, and powers in human beings, and the
“strife” of these two forms of “mental
temper,” James predicts, will always be seen in philosophy (WB
76). Certainly it is always seen in the philosophy of William
James. </p>

<h2 id="PrinPsyc">3. The Principles of Psychology</h2>

<p>
 In 1878, James agreed to write a psychology textbook for the American
publisher Henry Holt, but it took him twelve years to produce the
manuscript, and when he did he described it to Holt as “a
loathsome, distended, tumefied, bloated, dropsical mass, testifying to
nothing but two facts: 1st, that there is no such thing as
a <em>science</em> of psychology, and 2nd, that W. J. is an
incapable” (<em>The Letters of William James</em>, ed. Henry
James. (Boston: Little, Brown, 1926, pp. 393–4). Nevertheless,
this thousand page volume of psychology, physiology and philosophy has
proved to be James’s masterwork, containing early statements of his
main philosophical ideas in extraordinarily rich chapters on
“The Stream of Thought,” “The Consciousness of
Self,” “Emotion,” “Will,” and many other
topics.</p>

<p>

James tells us that he will follow the psychological method of
introspection in <em>The Principles</em>, which he defines as “the
looking into our own minds and reporting what we there discover” (PP
185). In fact he takes a number of methodological approaches in the
book.  Early on, he includes chapters on “The Functions of the Brain”
and “On Some General Conditions of Brain Activity” that reflect his
years as a lecturer in anatomy and physiology at Harvard, and he
argues for the reductive and materialist thesis that habit is “at
bottom a physical principle” (PP 110).  As the book moves along, he
involves himself in discussions with philosophers—for example
with Hume and Kant in his hundred-page chapter on the self, and he
finds himself making metaphysical claims that anticipate his later
pragmatism, as when he writes: “<em>There is no property ABSOLUTELY
essential to any one thing</em>.  The same property which figures as
the essence of a thing on one occasion becomes a very inessential
feature on the other” (PP 959).</p>

<p>

Even “introspection” covers a range of reports.  James discusses the
experiments that his contemporaries Wundt, Stumpf and Fechner were
performing in their laboratories, which led them to results such as
that “sounds are less delicately discriminated in intensity than
lights” (PP 513).  But many of James’s most important and
memorable introspective observations come from his own life. For
example:</p>

<blockquote>

The rhythm of a lost word may be there without a sound to clothe
it….  Everyone must know the tantalizing effect of the blank
rhythm of some forgotten verse, restlessly dancing in one’s mind,
striving to be filled out with words (PP 244).

<p>
 Our father and mother, our wife and babes, are bone of our bone and
flesh of our flesh. When they die, a part of our very selves is
gone. If they do anything wrong, it is our shame. If they are
insulted, our anger flashes forth as readily as if we stood in their
place. (PP 280).</p>

<p>
 There is an excitement during the crying fit which is not without a
certain pungent pleasure of its own; but it would take a genius for
felicity to discover any dash of redeeming quality in the feeling of
dry and shrunken sorrow (PP 1061).</p>

<p>
 “<em>Will you or won’t you have it so?</em>” is the most probing
question we are ever asked; we are asked it every hour of the day, and
about the largest as well as the smallest, the most theoretical as
well as the most practical, things. We answer by <em>consents or
non-consents</em> and not by words. What wonder that these dumb
responses should seem our deepest organs of communication with the
nature of things! (PP, p. 1182).  </p>

</blockquote>

<p>

In this last quotation, James tackles a philosophical problem from a
psychological perspective. Although he refrains from answering
the question of whether these “responses” are in fact deep organs of
communication with the nature of things—reporting only that they
seem to us to be so—in his later writings, such as <em>Varieties
of Religious Experience</em> and <em>A Pluralistic Universe</em>, he
confesses, and to some degree defends, his belief that the question
should be answered affirmatively. </p>

<p>

In the deservedly famous chapter on “The Stream of Thought” James
takes himself to be offering a richer account of experience than those
of traditional empiricists such as Hume. He believes relations, vague
fringes, and tendencies are experienced directly (a view he would
later defend as part of his “radical empiricism.”) James finds
consciousness to be a stream rather than a succession of “ideas.”  Its
waters blend, and our individual consciousness—or, as he
prefers to call it sometimes, our “sciousness”—is “steeped and
dyed” in the waters of sciousness or thought that surround it. Our
psychic life has rhythm: it is a series of transitions and
resting-places, of “flights and perchings” (PP 236). We rest when we
remember the name we have been searching for; and we are off again
when we hear a noise that might be the baby waking from her nap.</p>

<p>

Interest—and its close relative, attention—is a major
component not only of James’s psychology, but of the epistemology and
metaphysics that seep into his discussion. A thing, James states in
“The Stream of Thought,” is a group of qualities
“which happen practically or aesthetically to interest us, to
which we therefore give substantive names…”. (PP
274). And reality “<em>means simply relation to our emotional
and active life…whatever excites and stimulates our interest is
real</em>” (PP 924).  Our capacity for attention to one thing
rather than another is for James the sign of an “<em>active</em>
element in all consciousness,…a spiritual
something…which seems to go out to meet these qualities and
contents, whilst they seem to come in to be received by it.” (PP
285). Faced with the tension between scientific determinism and our
belief in our own freedom or autonomy, James—speaking not as a
psychologist but as the philosopher he had become—argues that
science “must be constantly reminded that her purposes are not
the only purposes, and that the order of uniform causation which she
has use for, and is therefore right in postulating, may be enveloped
in a wider order, on which she has no claims at all” (PP
1179).</p>

<p>

In his discussions of consciousness James appears at various times to
be a reductive materialist, a dualist, a proto-phenomenologist, and a
neutral psychologist who wouldn’t dare to consider philosophical
questions. One of the most original layers of <em>The Principles</em>
lies in James’s pursuit of a “pure” description of the stream of
thought that does not presuppose it to be either mental or material, a
pursuit that anticipates not only his own later “radical empiricism,”
but Husserl’s phenomenology.  In his chapter on “Sensation,” for
example, James is at pains to deny that sensations are “in the mind”
and then “by a special act on our part ‘extradited’ or
‘projected’ so as to appear located in an outer world” (PP
678). He argues that our original experiences are objective, that
“only as reflection becomes developed do we become aware of an inner
world at all” (PP 679).  However, the objective world originally
experienced is not the world of spatial relations that we think:
 </p>

<blockquote>
 Certainly a child newly born in Boston, who gets a sensation from the
candle-flame which lights the bedroom, or from his diaper-pin [who]
does not feel either of these objects to be situated in longitude 71
W.  and latitude 42 N.….The flame fills its own place, the pain
fills its own place; but as yet these places are neither identified
with, nor discriminated from, any other places. That comes
later.  For the places thus first sensibly known are elements of
the child’s space-world which remain with him all his life. (PP
681–2)</blockquote>

<p>

James’s chapter on “Habit,” early in the book, begins with
habit as a physical matter but ends by considering its ethical
implications.  James argues that the laws of nature are themselves
habits, “nothing but the immutable habits which the different
elementary sorts of matter follow in their actions and reactions upon
each other” (PP 109).  In our brains, habits are paths of
nervous energy, as rivers and streams are the paths of water’s flow.
At skin level, even a scar is a kind of habit, “more likely to
be abraded, inflamed, to suffer pain and cold, than are the
neighboring parts” (PP 111).  On the psychological level as
well, “any sequence of mental action which has been frequently
repeated, tends to perpetuate itself ...” (PP 116).  Habits are
useful in diminishing the attention that we have to devote to our
actions, thereby allowing us to develop “our higher powers of
mind” (PP 126).  On the social level, habit is “the
enormous fly-wheel of society, its most precious conservative agent.
It alone is what keeps us all within the bounds of ordinance, and
saves the children of fortune from the envious uprisings of the
poor” (PP 125).  The “ethical implications of the law of
habit,” (PP 124) as James sees them, concern which habits we
choose to develop, and when.  Many habits must begin early in life:
“Hardly ever is a language learned after twenty spoken without a
foreign accent” (PP 126).  We should strive to make our
“nervous system our ally instead of our enemy” by forming
as many good habits as we can, as early in life as we can.  Even later
in life, we are to keep our capacity for resolution in shape by every
day or two doing “something for no other reason than that you
would rather not do it” (PP 130).</p>

<p>

 Two noteworthy chapters late in <em>The Principles</em> are “The
Emotions” and “Will.” The first sets out the theory—also
enunciated by the Danish physiologist Carl Lange—that emotion
follows, rather than causes, its bodily expression: “Common-sense
says, we lose our fortune, are sorry and weep; we meet a bear, are
frightened and run; we are insulted by a rival, are angry and
strike. The hypothesis here to be defended says that this order of
sequence is incorrect…that we feel sorry because we cry, angry
because we strike, afraid because we tremble…” (PP
 1065–6). The significance of this view, according to James, is
that our emotions are tied in with our bodily expressions. What, he
asks, would grief be “without its tears, its sobs, its suffocation of
the heart, its pang in the breast-bone?” Not an emotion, James
answers, for a “purely disembodied human emotion is a nonentity” (PP
1068).</p>

<p>

In his chapter on “Will” James opposes the theory of his
contemporary Wilhelm Wundt that there is one special feeling—a
“feeling of innervation”—present in all
intentional action.  In his survey of a range of cases, James
finds that some actions involve an act of resolve or of outgoing
nervous energy, but others do not. For example:</p>

<blockquote>I sit at table after dinner and find myself from time to
time taking nuts or raisins out of the dish and eating them. My
dinner properly is over, and in the heat of the conversation I am
hardly aware of what I do; but the perception of the fruit, and
the fleeting notion that I may eat it, seem fatally to bring the act
about. There is certainly no express fiat here;… (PP
1131).</blockquote>

<p>

The chapter on “Will” also contains striking passages that
anticipate the concerns of <em>The Varieties of Religious
Experience</em>:  about moods, “changes of heart,”
and “awakenings of conscience.”  These, James
observes, may affect the “whole scale of values of our motives
and impulses” (PP 1140). </p>

<h2 id="EssaPopuPhil">4. Essays in Popular Philosophy</h2>

<p>

James’s popular and influential, <em>The Will to Believe and Other
Essays in Popular Philosophy</em>, published in 1897, collects
previously published essays from the previous nineteen years,
including “The Sentiment of Rationality” (discussed
above), “The Dilemma of Determinism,” “Great Men and
Their Environment” and “The Moral Philosopher and the
Moral Life.” The title essay—published just two years
earlier—proved to be controversial for seeming to recommend
irresponsible or irrationally held beliefs.  James later wrote that he
should have called the essay “the <em>right</em> to
believe,” to indicate his intent to <em>justify</em> holding
certain beliefs <em>in certain circumstances</em>, not to claim that
we can (or should) believe things simply by an act of will.</p>

<p>

In science, James notes, we can afford to await the outcome of
investigation before coming to a belief, but in other cases we
are “forced,” in that we must come to some belief even if all the
relevant evidence is not in. If I am on an isolated mountain trail,
faced with an icy ledge to cross, and do not know whether I can make
it, I may be forced to consider the question whether I can or should
believe that I can cross the ledge. This question is not only forced,
it is “momentous”: if I am wrong I may fall to my death, and if I
believe rightly that I can cross the ledge, my holding of the belief
may itself contribute to my success. In such a case, James asserts, I
have the “right to believe”—precisely because such a belief
may help bring about the fact believed in. This is a case “where a
fact cannot come at all unless a preliminary faith exists in its
coming” (WB, 25).</p>

<p>

James applies his analysis to religious belief, particularly to the
possible case in which one’s salvation depends on believing in God in
advance of any proof that God exists. In such a case the belief may be
justified by the outcome to which having the belief leads.  He
extends his analysis beyond the religious domain, however, to a wide
range of secular human life:</p>

<blockquote>A social organism of any sort is what it is because each
member proceeds to his own duty with a trust that the other members
will simultaneously do theirs…. A government, an army, a
commercial system, a ship, a college, an athletic team, all exist on
this condition, without which not only is nothing achieved, but
nothing is even attempted (WB 24).</blockquote>

<p>
Moral questions too are both momentous and unlikely to be sustained by
“sensible proof.” They are not matters of science but of
“what Pascal calls our heart” (WB 22).  James defends our
right to believe in certain answers to these questions anyway.</p>

<p>

Another essay in the collection, “Reflex Action and
Theism,” attempts a reconciliation of science and
religion. James’s expression “reflex action” alludes to
the biological picture of the organism as responding to sensations
with a series of actions. In the higher animals a theoretical or
thinking stage intervenes between sensation and action, and this is
where, in human beings, the thought of God arises. James maintains
that this thought is a natural human response to the universe,
independent of any proof that God exists, and he predicts that God
will be the “centre of gravity of all attempts to solve the
riddle of life” (WB, 116).  He ends the essay by advocating a
“theism” that posits “an ultimate opacity in things,
a dimension of being which escapes our theoretic control” (WB
143).</p>

<p>

<em>The Will to Believe</em> also contains James’s most developed
account of morality, “The Moral Philosopher and the Moral
Life.”  Morality for James rests on 
sentience—without it there are no moral claims and no moral obligations. But
once sentience exists, a claim is made, and morality gets “a
foothold in the universe” (WB 198). Although James insists that
there is no common essence to morality, he does find a guiding
principle for ethical philosophy in the principle that we
“satisfy at all times as many demands as we can” (WB
205). This satisfaction is to be achieved by working towards a
“richer universe…the good which seems most organizable,
most fit to enter into complex combinations, most apt to be a member
of a more inclusive whole” (WB 210). This work proceeds by a
series of experiments, by means of which we have learned to live (for
the most part) without “polygamy and slavery, private warfare
and liberty to kill, judicial torture and arbitrary royal
power.” (WB 205) . However, James holds that there is
“nothing final in any actually given equilibrium of human
ideals, [so that] as our present laws and customs have fought and
conquered other past ones, so they will in their turn be overthrown by
any newly discovered order which will hush up the complaints that they
still give rise to, without producing others louder still” (WB
206).</p>

<p>

James’s essay “On a Certain Blindness in Human Beings,”
published in his <em>Talks to Teachers on Psychology and to Students
on Some of Life’s Ideals</em> in 1899, illustrates another important
element of James’s moral outlook.  The blindness to which James draws
attention is that of one human being to another, a blindness he
illustrates with a story from his own life.  Riding in the mountains
of North Carolina he comes upon a devastated landscape, with no trees,
scars in the earth, here and there a patch of corn growing in the
sunlight.  But after talking to the settlers who had cleared the
forest to make room for their farm, James comes to see it their way
(at least temporarily): not as devastation but as a manifestation of
“duty, struggle, and success.” James concludes: “I
had been as blind to the peculiar ideality of their conditions as they
certainly would also have been to the ideality of mine, had they had a
peep at my strange indoor academic ways of life at Cambridge”
(TT 233–4).  James portrays a plurality of outlooks in the essay
to which he attaches both a metaphysical/epistemological and an
ethical import.  This plurality, he writes:</p>

<blockquote>commands us to tolerate, respect, and indulge those whom
we see harmlessly interested and happy in their own ways, however
unintelligible these may be to us.  Hands off: neither the whole of
truth nor the whole of good is revealed to any single observer,
although each observer gains a partial superiority of insight from the
peculiar position in which he stands.  Even prisons and sick-rooms
have their special revelations (TT 264).</blockquote>

<p>

Although “On a Certain Blindness” is about toleration and the
appreciation of different points of view, James sets out his own
romantic point of view in his choice of heroes in the essay:
Wordsworth and Shelley, Emerson, and W. H. Hudson, all of whom are
said to have a sense of the “limitless significance in natural things”
(TT 244).  Even in the city, there is “unfathomable significance and
importance” (TT 254) in the daily events of the streets, the river,
and the crowds of people. James praises Walt Whitman, “a hoary
loafer,” for knowing how to profit by life’s common opportunities:
after a morning of writing and a bath, Whitman rides the omnibus down
Broadway from 23rd street to Bowling Green and back, just for the
pleasure and the spectacle of it.  “[W]ho knows the more of truth,”
James asks, “Whitman on his omnibus-top, full of the inner joy with
which the spectacle inspires him, or you, full of the disdain which
the futility of his occupation excites?” (TT 252).  James’s interest
in the inner lives of others, and in writers like Tolstoy who share
his understanding of their “mysterious ebbs and flows” (TT 255), leads
him to the prolonged study of human religious experience that he
presented as the Gifford Lectures in 1901–2, published as <em>The
Varieties of Religious Experience</em> in 1902.</p>

<h2 id="VariReliExpe">5. The Varieties of Religious Experience</h2>

<p>

Like <em>The Principles of Psychology</em>, <em>Varieties</em> is “A
Study in Human Nature,” as its subtitle says. But at some five hundred
pages it is only half the length of <em>The Principles of
Psychology</em>, befitting its more restricted, if still large,
scope. For James studies that part of human nature that is, or is
related to, religious experience.  His interest is not in religious
institutions, ritual, or, even for the most part, religious ideas, but
in “the feelings, acts, and experiences of individual men in their
solitude, so far as they apprehend themselves to stand in relation to
whatever they may consider the divine” (V 31).</p>

<p>

James sets out a central distinction of the book in early chapters on
“The Religion of Healthy-Mindedness” and “The Sick
Soul.” The healthy-minded religious person—Walt Whitman
is one of James’s main examples—has a deep sense of “the
goodness of life,” (V 79) and a soul of “sky-blue
tint” (V 80). Healthy-mindedness can be involuntary, just
natural to someone, but often comes in more willful forms. Liberal
Christianity, for example, represents the triumph of a resolute
devotion to healthy-mindedness over a morbid “old hell-fire
theology” (V 91). James also cites the “mind-cure
movement” of Mary Baker Eddy, for whom “evil is simply a
lie, and any one who mentions it is a liar” (V 107). For
“The Sick Soul,” in contrast, “radical evil gets its
innings” (V 163). No matter how secure one may feel, the sick
soul finds that “[u]nsuspectedly from the bottom of every
fountain of pleasure, as the old poet said, something bitter rises up:
a touch of nausea, a falling dead of the delight, a whiff of
melancholy….” These states are not simply unpleasant
sensations, for they bring “a feeling of coming from a deeper
region and often have an appalling convincingness” (V
136).  James’s main examples are Leo Tolstoy’s “My
Confession,” John Bunyan’s autobiography, and a report of
terrifying “dread”—allegedly from a French
correspondent but actually from James himself. Some sick souls never
get well, while others recover or even triumph: these are the
“twice-born.” In chapters on “The Divided Self, and
the Process of Its Unification” and on “Conversion,”
James discusses St. Augustine, Henry Alline, Bunyan, Tolstoy, and a
range of popular evangelists, focusing on what he calls “the
state of assurance” (V 247) they achieve. Central to this state
is “the loss of all the worry, the sense that all is ultimately
well with one, the peace, the harmony, the <em>willingness to be</em>,
even though the outer conditions should remain the same” (V
248).</p>

<p>
<em>Varieties</em>’ classic chapter on “Mysticism” offers
“four marks which, when an experience has them, may justify us
in calling it mystical…” (V 380). The first is
ineffability: “it defies expression…its quality must be
directly experienced; it cannot be imparted or transferred to
others.” Second is a “noetic quality”: mystical
states present themselves as states of knowledge. Thirdly, mystical
states are transient; and, fourth, subjects are passive with respect
to them: they cannot control their coming and going. Are these states,
James ends the chapter by asking, “windows through which the
mind looks out upon a more extensive and inclusive world[?]” (V
428).</p>

<p>

In chapters entitled “Philosophy”—devoted in large part to
pragmatism—and “Conclusions,” James finds that religious
experience is on the whole useful, even “amongst the most important
biological functions of mankind,” but he concedes that this does not
make it true. Nevertheless, James articulates his own 
belief—which he does not claim to prove—that religious experiences
connect us with a greater, or further, reality not accessible in our
normal cognitive relations to the world: “The further limits of our
being plunge, it seems to me, into an altogether other dimension of
existence from the sensible and merely ‘understandable’
world” (V 515).</p>

<h2 id="LateWrit">6. Late Writings</h2>

<h3 id="Prag1907"><em>Pragmatism</em> (1907)</h3> 

<p>

James first announced his commitment to pragmatism in a lecture at
Berkeley in 1898, entitled “Philosophical Conceptions and Practical
Results.” Later sources for <em>Pragmatism</em> were lectures at
Wellesley College in 1905, and at the Lowell Institute and Columbia
University in 1906 and 1907. Pragmatism emerges in James’s book as six
things: a philosophical temperament, a theory of truth, a theory of
meaning, a holistic account of knowledge, a metaphysical view, and a
method of resolving philosophical disputes.</p>

<p>

The pragmatic temperament appears in the book’s opening chapter, where
(following a method he first set out in “Remarks on Spencer’s
Definition of Mind as Correspondence”) James classifies philosophers
according to their temperaments: in this case “tough-minded” or
“tender-minded.” The pragmatist is the mediator between these
extremes, someone, like James himself, with “scientific loyalty to
facts,” but also “the old confidence in human values and the resultant
spontaneity, whether of the religious or romantic type” (P 17). The
method of resolving disputes and the theory of meaning are on display
in James’s discussion of an argument about whether a man chasing a
squirrel around a tree goes around the squirrel too. Taking meaning as
the  “conceivable effects of a practical kind the object may
involve,” the pragmatist philosopher finds that two “practical”
meanings of “go around” are in play: either the man goes North, East,
South, and West of the squirrel, or he faces first the squirrel’s
head, then one of his sides, then his tail, then his other side. “Make
the distinction,” James writes, “and there is no occasion for any
further dispute.”</p>

<p>

The pragmatic theory of truth is the subject of the book’s sixth (and
to some degree its second) chapter. Truth, James holds, is “a species
of the good,” like health. Truths are goods because we can “ride” on
them into the future without being unpleasantly surprised. They “lead
us into useful verbal and conceptual quarters as well as directly up
to useful sensible termini. They lead to consistency, stability and
flowing human intercourse.  They lead away from excentricity and
isolation, from foiled and barren thinking” (103). Although James
holds that truths are “<em>made</em>” (104) in the course of human
experience, and that for the most part they live “on a credit system”
in that they are not currently being verified, he also holds the
empiricistic view that “beliefs verified concretely by
<em>somebody</em> are the posts of the whole superstructure” (P
100).</p>

<p>

James’s chapter on “Pragmatism and Humanism” sets out his
voluntaristic epistemology. “We carve out everything,”
James states, “just as we carve out constellations, to serve our
human purposes” (P, 100). Nevertheless, he recognizes
“resisting factors in every experience of truth-making”
(P, 117), including not only our present sensations or experiences but
the whole body of our prior beliefs. James holds neither that we
create our truths out of nothing, nor that truth is entirely
independent of humanity. He embraces “the humanistic principle:
you can’t weed out the human contribution” (P, 122).  He also
embraces a metaphysics of process in the claim that “for
pragmatism [reality] is still in the making,” whereas for
“rationalism reality is ready-made and complete from all
eternity” (P 123). <em>Pragmatism’s</em> final chapter on
“Pragmatism and Religion” follows James’s line
in <em>Varieties</em> in attacking “transcendental
absolutism” for its unverifiable account of God, and in
defending a “pluralistic and moralistic religion”
(144)based on human experience. “On pragmatistic
principles,” James writes, “if the hypothesis of God works
satisfactorily in the widest sense of the word, it is true”
(143).</p>

<h3 id="PlurUniv1909"><em>A Pluralistic Universe</em> (1909)</h3>

<p>

Originally delivered in Oxford as a set of lectures “On the
Present Situation in Philosophy,” James begins his book, as he
had begun <em>Pragmatism</em>, with a discussion of the temperamental
determination of philosophical theories, which, James states,
“are just so many visions, modes of feeling the whole push
… forced on one by one’s total character and experience, and on
the whole <em>preferred</em>—there is no other truthful
word—as one’s best working attitude” (PU 15). Maintaining
that a philosopher’s “vision” is “the important
thing” about him (PU 3), James condemns the
“over-technicality and consequent dreariness of the younger
disciples at our American universities…” (PU 13).</p>

<p>
  
James passes from critical discussions of Josiah Royce’s idealism and
the “vicious intellectualism” of Hegel to philosophers
whose visions he admires: Gustav Fechner and Henri Bergson. He praises
Fechner for holding that “the whole universe in its different
spans and wave-lengths, exclusions and developments, is everywhere
alive and conscious” (PU, 70), and he seeks to refine and
justify Fechner’s idea that separate human, animal and vegetable
consciousnesses meet or merge in a “consciousness of still wider
scope” (72). James employs Henri Bergson’s critique of
“intellectualism” to argue that the “concrete pulses
of experience appear pent in by no such definite limits as our
conceptual substitutes are confined by. They run into one another
continuously and seem to interpenetrate” (PU 127). James
concludes by embracing a position that he had more tentatively set
forth in <em>The Varieties of Religious Experience</em>: that
religious experiences “point with reasonable probability to the
continuity of our consciousness with a wider spiritual environment
from which the ordinary prudential man (who is the only man that
scientific psychology, so called, takes cognizance of) is shut
off” (PU 135). Whereas in <em>Pragmatism</em> James subsumes
the religious within the pragmatic (as yet another way of successfully
making one’s way through the world), in <em>A Pluralistic
Universe</em> he suggests that the religious offers a superior
relation to the universe.</p>

<h3 id="EssaRadiEmpi1912"><em>Essays in Radical Empiricism</em> (1912)</h3>

<p>

This posthumous collection includes James’s groundbreaking essays on
“pure experience,” originally published in 1904–5.
James’s fundamental idea is that mind and matter are both aspects of,
or structures formed from, a more fundamental stuff—pure
experience—that (despite being called
“experience”) is neither mental nor physical. Pure
experience, James explains, is “the immediate flux of life which
furnishes the material to our later reflection with its conceptual
categories… a <em>that</em> which is not yet any definite <em>
what</em>, tho’ ready to be all sorts of whats…” (ERE
46).  That “whats” pure experience may be are minds and
bodies, people and material objects, but this depends not on a
fundamental ontological difference among these “pure
experiences,” but on the <em>relations</em> into which they
enter.  Certain sequences of pure experiences constitute physical
objects, and others constitute persons; but one pure experience (say
the perception of a chair) may be part both of the sequence
constituting the chair and of the sequence constituting a person.
Indeed, one pure experience might be part of two distinct minds, as
James explains in a chapter entitled “How Two Minds Can Know One
Thing.”</p>

<p>

James’s “radical empiricism” is distinct from his
“pure experience” metaphysics. It is never precisely
defined in the <em>Essays</em>, and is best explicated by a passage
from <em>The Meaning of Truth</em> where James states that radical
empiricism consists of a postulate, a statement of fact, and a
conclusion. The postulate is that “the only things that shall be
debatable among philosophers shall be things definable in terms drawn
from experience,” the  fact is that relations are just as
directly experienced as the things they relate, and the conclusion is
that “the parts of experience hold together from next to next by
relations that are themselves parts of experience” (MT,
6–7).</p>

<p>

James was still working on objections to his “pure
experience” doctrine, replying to critics
of <em>Pragmatism</em>, and writing an introduction to philosophical
problems when he died in 1910.  His legacy extends into psychology and
the study of religion, and in philosophy not only throughout the
pragmatist tradition that he founded (along with Charles Peirce), but
into phenomenology and analytic philosophy. Edmund Husserl incorporated James’s notions of the “fringe” and “halo” into his phenomenology (Moran, pp. 276–80), Bertrand Russell’s <em>The
Analysis of Mind</em> is indebted to James’s doctrine of “pure
experience,” (Russell, 1921, pp. 22–6), Ludwig Wittgenstein learned about “the
absence of the will act” from James’s
<em>Psychology</em> (Goodman, <em>Wittgenstein and William James</em>,
p. 81), and the versions of “neopragmatism” set out by
Nelson Goodman, Richard Rorty and Hilary Putnam are saturated with
James’s ideas. James is one of the most attractive and endearing of
philosophers: for his vision of a “wild,”
“open” universe that is nevertheless shaped by our human
powers and answers to some of our deepest needs, but also, as
Russell observed in his obituary, because of the “large
tolerance and … humanity” with which he sets that vision
out. (<em>The Nation</em> (3 September 1910: 793–4).</p>
