<h1>Retributive Justice</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Wed Jun 18, 2014</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>The concept of retributive justice has been used in a variety of
ways, but it is best understood as that form of justice committed to
the following three principles: (1) that those who commit certain
kinds of wrongful acts, paradigmatically serious crimes, morally
deserve to suffer a proportionate punishment; (2) that it is
intrinsically morally good—good without reference to any other
goods that might arise—if some legitimate punisher gives them
the punishment they deserve; and (3) that it is morally impermissible
intentionally to punish the innocent or to inflict disproportionately
large punishments on wrongdoers. The idea of retributive justice has
played a dominant role in theorizing about punishment over the past
few decades, but many features of it—especially the notions of
desert and proportionality, the normative status of suffering, and the
ultimate justification for retribution—remain contested and
problematic.</p>

<h2><a id="AppRetJus">1. The appeal of retributive justice</a></h2>

<p>The appeal of retributive justice as a theory of punishment rests
in part on direct intuitive support, in part on the claim that it is
better than alternative accounts of punishment, and in part on
arguments tying it to deeper moral principles.</p>

<p>Many share the intuition that those who commit wrongful acts,
especially serious crimes, should be punished even if punishing them
would produce no other good. Consider, for example, a rapist who has
since suffered an illness that has left him physically incapacitated
so that he cannot rape again, and who has enough money to support
himself without resorting to criminal activities. Suppose that this
suffices to ensure that there is no need to deter or incapacitate him
to prevent him from committing serious crimes in the future. Suppose,
in addition, that he will regularly report to a prison to be filmed in
prison garb, thereby conveying the impression that he is living in
prison, though the truth is that he spends his days relaxing and
pursuing his interests on a tropical island. If that ruse were secure
from discovery, then general deterrence could be achieved as
well. Even if the goods normally achieved by punishment are thereby
achieved, is there not still some reason to want him to be punished?
Many find it intuitive that there is (see Moore 1997:
98–101). This intuitive judgment is supported by a widely shared
emotional response to serious crime, which Jeffrie Murphy called
“retributive hatred” (Murphy &amp; Hampton 1988:
ch. 3).</p>

<p>Not only is retributivism in that way intuitively appealing, the
primary set of competitor theories, utilitarian or consequentialist
theories of punishment that focus on deterrence and incapacitation,
seem to confront a deep problem. They have difficulty explaining a
core and intuitively compelling feature of retributivism, namely the
claim that it is always or nearly always impermissible either to
inflict punishment on those who have done no wrong or to inflict
disproportionately large punishments on those who have done some
wrong.  Some respond to this point by adopting a mixed theory,
according to which retributivism provides a necessary condition for
punishment, but consequentialist considerations provide the reasons to
punish (Hart 1968: ch. 1). Such mixed theories can still seem morally
problematic, however, because they seem to justify using people merely
as a means (within retributive limits) for promoting the greater good
(Duff 2001: 13). The thought that punishment treats wrongdoers as they
deserve to be treated addresses this objection to mixed theories.</p>

<p>Both of these sources of appeal have clear limits. The direct
intuition can be challenged with the claim that it is merely the
reflection of a morally dubious psychological propensity to feel an
excess of what Nietzsche, in the <em>Genealogy of Morals,</em>
called <em>ressentiment</em>,</p>

<blockquote><p>a witches brew [of] resentment, fear, anger, cowardice,
hostility, aggression, cruelty, sadism, envy, jealousy, guilt,
self-loathing, hypocrisy and self-deception. (Moore 1997:
120)</p></blockquote>

<p>And the argument that retributivism justifies punishment better
than consequentialism presupposes that punishment is justifiable (for
criticism of this premise, see Golash 2005; Boonin 2008), and that
there are no alternatives that are better than both (for two
alternatives, see Quinn 1985; Tadros 2011).</p>

<p>To respond to these challenges, retributive justice must ultimately
be justified in a larger moral context that shows that it is plausibly
grounded in, or at least connected to, other, deeply held moral
principles. Only in this way should its intuitive appeal be regarded,
in reflective equilibrium, as morally sound. For a discussion of the
prospects for deeper justification, <a href="#QueJus">see section
5</a>.</p>

<h2><a id="BacCon">2. Background concepts</a></h2>

<p>Two background concepts should be addressed before saying more
about retributive justice: (1) punishment, and (2) the sorts of wrongs
for which punishment might be thought deserved.</p>

<h3><a id="Pun">2.1 Punishment</a></h3>

<p>The nature of punishment is the subject of two other entries in
this Encyclopedia (Bedau and Kelly 2010; Duff 2013). The following
comments merely summarize the points that are most important for the
purpose of understanding retributivism.</p>

<p>For an act to count as punishment, it must have four elements.
First, it must impose some sort of cost or hardship on, or at the very
least withdraw a benefit that would otherwise be enjoyed by, the
person being punished.</p>

<p>Second, the punisher must do so intentionally, not as an accident,
and not as a side-effect of pursuing some other end. For example,
while sending a criminal to prison often has foreseeable harmful
effects on the criminal's family, retributivists would say that those
harms do not constitute punishment, not unless they are purposely
inflicted as part of the punishment for the crime.</p>

<p>Some critics of retributivism reject this limitation as an appeal
to a “definitional stop”, which they say is illicitly used
to avoid having to justify the costs of the practice (Hart 1968:
5–6; Christopher 2002: 879–880). The worry is that
retributivists will seek to justify only the purposeful infliction of
hardship on wrongdoers, and will ignore the overall costs of the
practice. But there is no reason to think that retributivists
generally ignore the need to justify the negative effects of
punishment on the innocent. <a href="#StrRetRea">See section
4.5</a>. The retributivist's point is only that the intentional
infliction of harm in the form of punishment has to be justified in a
different way than the collateral damage that may befall the innocent
as a result of punishing the guilty. <a href="#SubSufMeaExpCauSuf">See
section 4.3.3</a>.</p>

<p>Third, the hardship or loss must be imposed in response to what is
believed to be a wrongful act or omission. It is a confusion to take
oneself to be “punishing” another for some fact over which
he has or had no control (Mabbott 1939). One need not be conceptually
confused to take oneself to have reason to intentionally inflict harsh
treatment on another, whether because one wants to look like one is
punishing the guilty (what Rawls 1955 called
“telishment”), or because one is simply oppressing others
on the basis of some trait, say their ethnicity or physical
appearance, that they could not help having. Doing so would presumably
be immoral, but it need not be conceptually confused. What would be
confused is thinking that one is inflicting
“punishment”.</p>

<p>Fourth, the hardship or loss must be imposed, at least in part, as
a way of sending a message of condemnation or censure for what is
believed to be a wrongful act or omission (Feinberg 1970). This
element allows us to distinguish taxes and fees from punishment. Even
if taxes and fees are meant to discourage certain kinds of activities,
they do not convey censure for a wrongful act or omission.</p>

<p>It is interesting to note that crime is not the only legal basis
for meeting out punishment. Torts too can serve that
function. Contemporary tort law has mostly shed the root meaning of
the word, which derives from the Latin <em>tortum</em>, meaning
“wrong” or “injustice”. Tortfeasors are
generally treated not so much as wrongdoers as harm causers, who
simply have a duty to make their victims whole. But damages for
intentional torts sometimes include punitive damages, which carry all
the marks of punishment, though the procedural route to getting them
is vastly different from that of criminal punishment (see Coleman
&amp; Mendlow 2010).</p>

<h3><a id="RelKinWro">2.2 The relevant kinds of wrongs</a></h3>

<p>Not all wrongdoing justifies a punitive response. What kinds of
wrongs can be morally fitting bases for punishment? This is a
much-debated topic, beyond the scope of the present entry
(Shafer-Landau 1996: 289-292; Husak 2008; Asp 2013). Nonetheless, a
few comments may be helpful.</p>

<p>The paradigmatic wrong for which punishment seems appropriate is an
intentional or knowing violation of the important rights of another,
such as murder or rape. It is almost as clear that an attempt to do
the same is a proper basis for punishment, though how to define the
concept of an attempt is highly contested (Duff 1996; Alexander,
Ferzan, and Morse 2009: ch. 6; Yaffe 2010). The more tenuous the
connection to a rights violation, the more controversial punishment
for an act becomes. This is true as well when no rights violation is
in view, as when dealing with a purely regulatory offense. (For a
critical discussion of <em>mala prohibita</em> offenses, see Husak
2008: 103–119.)</p>

<p>The dimension of <em>mens rea</em> also matters for determining
whether conduct can serve as a morally appropriate basis for
punishment (Feinberg 1990: 147–150). As the level of culpability
goes from purpose and knowledge through recklessness to negligence, it
becomes progressively harder to justify a punitive response to any
given rights violation, harm, or inchoate step thereto. It is harder
still if culpability for what criminal lawyers call an element of the
wrong or crime is completely lacking—making the wrong or crime a
matter of strict liability.  Similar points can be made about
ignorance of the law or the moral basis for the claim that the act is
wrongful (on the law, see Husak 2010a; on morality, see Rosen 2004;
Harman 2011).</p>

<p>The most problematic kinds of wrongs for liberal retributivists are
moralistic or paternalistic wrongs. The fundamental reason moralistic
wrongs are thought wrong is that they are taken to flout certain moral
values, or divine commands, regarding proper human behavior. And the
fundamental reason paternalistic wrongs are thought wrong is that they
are self-destructive. Liberals think such matters of virtue and vice
(or sin) are best left to the autonomous individual, and are not
proper bases for punishment.</p>

<p>Many have sought to capture this objection to moralistic and
paternalistic wrongs by appealing to John Stuart Mill's “harm
principle” (Mill 1859: ch. 1). But the harm principle, on any of
a number of interpretations, is too restrictive to be consistent with
retributive justice, which, unlike the harm principle, calls for
giving the wrongdoer his just deserts even if no other good (such as
the prevention of harm) should follow (Tomlin 2014). A broader, more
defensible liberal position is that the wrongs relevant to punishment
have to be a matter of proper public concern for citizens (Duff 2001:
§4.3; Duff 2011).</p>

<p>It is important to keep in mind, however, that retributive justice
is not limited to liberal moral and political philosophy. Retributive
justice may also be deemed appropriate by illiberal persons and inside
distinctly illiberal organizations, ranging from religious groups to
families (Zaibert 2006: 16–24). Illiberal persons and groups may
also make a distinction between wrongs that call for punishment and
those that do not, but they will not draw the distinction in the same
way that liberals would.</p>

<h2><a id="RanMea">3. Range of Meanings</a></h2>

<p>John Cottingham (1979) famously distinguished nine “varieties
of retribution”, arguing that much discussion of retributive
justice is confused because people are not clear what they mean. Most
prominent retributive theorists have since converged more or less on
the first of the meanings given below. Nonetheless, it is worth
briefly following in Cottingham's tracks—though departing
somewhat from Cottingham's list, which was a mix of meanings and
justifications—to be clear about what is meant by
“retributive justice”.</p>

<h3><a id="Ret">3.1 Retributivism</a></h3>

<p>Retributivism, without qualification, involves both positive and
negative desert claims. The positive desert claim holds that wrongdoers
morally deserve punishment for their wrongful acts. This claim comes
in stronger and weaker versions. For example, Michael Moore (1997: 87)
writes: “Retributivism … is the view that punishment is
justified by the desert of the offender”. Jeffrie Murphy (2007:
11) adds a note of qualification, writing: “[A] retributivist is
a person who believes that the primary justification for punishing a
criminal is that the criminal deserves it”. A retributivist
could take an even weaker view, that there is <em>some</em> positive
value in punishing a wrongdoer for his wrongful acts, apart from any
consequences that might arise from doing so.</p>

<p>This positive desert claim is complemented by a negative one: Those
who have done no wrong may not be punished. This prohibits both
punishing those not guilty of wrongdoing (who deserve no punishment),
and punishing the guilty more than they deserve (i.e., inflicting
disproportional punishment).</p>

<p>Of course, the innocent will inevitably sometimes be punished; no
human system can run without mistakes. And retributivists should not
duck what it means to commit such a mistake: it wrongs the innocent
person. But this is not a fatal problem for retributivists. It does
not imply that they risk acting <em>impermissibly</em> if they punish
people. Permissibility is best understood as an action-guiding notion,
not one tied directly to what is objectively justifiable (Scanlon
2008: 47–52). As an action-guiding notion, it must make use of a
relevant standard of proof. If the right standard is met—the
“beyond a reasonable doubt” standard has recently been
called into question (Laudan 2011)—then punishers act
permissibly, even if they unwittingly punish the innocent (see also
Simons 2012: 67–69).</p>

<p>Most contemporary retributivists accept both the positive and the
negative desert claims, along with the thought that it is morally good
if those who deserve punishment get the punishment they deserve.</p>

<h3><a id="NegRet">3.2 Negative retributivism</a></h3>

<p>What has been called “negative” (Mackie 1982),
“minimalist” (Golding 1975), or “weak” (Hart
1968: ch. 1) retributivism is the view that only the negative
component of retributivism is true. It is the view that wrongdoers
forfeit their right not to suffer proportional punishment, but that
the positive reasons for punishment must appeal to some other goods
that punishment achieves, such as deterrence or
incapacitation. Wrongdoing, on this view, is merely a necessary
condition for punishment. The desert of the wrongdoer provides neither
a sufficient condition for nor even a positive reason to punish (see
also Mabbott 1939; Quinton 1954).</p>

<p>Of these three labels, negative retributivism seems the most apt,
as it picks up the idea that wrongdoing <em>negates</em> the right one
otherwise has not to be punished. The alternative labels also risk
confusion with the fact that the positive reasons for punishment that
retributivists generally accept can be stronger or weaker. Differences
along that dimension should not be confused with a position that
denies that guilt, by itself, provides any reason to punish.</p>

<p>The line between negative retributivism and retributivism that
posits a weak positive reason to punish may seem vanishingly small.
Negative retributivism holds that punishment, especially the harsh
treatment aspect of it, must be justified by the instrumental value of
punishment. Depending on how weak the positive desert claim is, a
positive retributivist who seeks to offer an all-things-considered
justification for punishment may need to cite the same instrumental
benefits as a negative retributivist (see <a href="#StrRetRea">section
4.5</a>). For both, a full justification of punishment will be
“mixed”, appealing to both retributive and
consequentialist ideas (Garvey 2004: 449–451).</p>

<p>Nonetheless, there are three reasons it is important to distinguish
the two. First, the challenge of justifying wrongdoers' forfeiture of
the right not to be punished, if they do <em>not</em> deserve to be
punished, is different from the challenge of doing the same if
they <em>do</em> deserve to be punished. Second, it is not clear
whether forfeiture theories can make sense of the proportionality
restrictions that are central to retributivism. That is, if forfeiture
is not tied to some limited positive desert, then further argument is
needed to show that it is limited to a proportional punishment (Duff
2001: 14–16). Third, positive desert arguably makes punishment
respectful of the dignity of the individual in ways that mere
forfeiture does not. Thus it is important to maintain a clear
distinction between retributivism and negative retributivism.</p>

<h3><a id="PayDeb">3.3 Payback as debt</a></h3>

<p>As Cottingham notes, the Latin root of retribution is <em>re</em>
+ <em>tribuo</em>, which means “I pay back”. One way to
understand the notion of paying back is that it concerns paying debts
that are owed. This understanding connects to the commonly shared
retributive thought that a criminal who has been appropriately
punished has “paid his debt to society”.</p>

<p>This idea of a debt owed may be connected to the idea that
criminals have taken unfair advantage of the law-abiding. Punishment
in the form of harsh treatment can then be thought of as pay back in
the sense that it strips away that advantage and restores
the <em>status quo ante</em> that was wrongfully disturbed.</p>

<p>There are numerous problems with this as a substantive theory of
why harsh treatment might be deserved—<a href="#FaiFreRid">see
section 5.2</a>. For present purposes, the important point is that
this notion of payback is better understood as a theory that purports
to explain why punishment is deserved, rather than as providing the
meaning of retributive justice.</p>

<h3><a id="LexTalPayResKin">3.4 <em>Lex talionis</em>: Payback as response in kind</a></h3>

<p>Another meaning of payback is concerned not with paying a debt but
with giving wrongdoers a response in kind. This is the Biblical idea
of “an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth”
(<em>Exodus</em> 21: 23–25; <em>Leviticus</em>
24:17–20). Kant also endorses, in a somewhat different way, this
notion of punishment. Invoking the principle of equality for
punishment, Kant writes: “whatever undeserved evil you inflict
upon another within the people, that you inflict upon yourself”
(1797: 141). Thus, he who steals “deprives himself (by the
principle of retribution) of security in any property…. [and
if] he has committed murder he must die” (ibid.: 142).</p>

<p><em>Lex talionis</em> provides a controversial principle of
proportionality (for more on proportionality, <a href="#Pro">see
section 4.4</a>). But as with the previous conception of payback, one
should not confuse the concept of payback with the concept of
retribution. Retributive justice includes a commitment to punishment
that is proportional to the crime. But retributive justice cannot be
reduced to a measure of proportionality (Moore 1997: 88).</p>

<h3><a id="LimRet">3.5 Limiting Retributivism</a></h3>

<p>“Limiting retributivism” is not so much a conception of
retributivism as a view about the limits of retributivism as a theory
of punishment. It is retributivism with the addition of skepticism
about our ability to make any but the most general statements about
proportionality (see N. Morris 1982: 182–87, 196–200;
Frase 2005: 77; Slobogin 2009: 671). Utilitarian or consequentialist
considerations, it is proposed, should be consulted to fill in the gap
left by the supposed vagueness of proportionality.</p>

<p>This view may move too quickly to invoke utilitarian or
consequentialist considerations. Even if our ability to discern
proportionality constraints is crude in absolute terms, comparative
proportionality may leave relatively little leeway with regard to what
punishments are morally defensible in a given jurisdiction (Robinson
2003; von Hirsch and Ashworth 2005: 180–185; von Hirsch
2011: 212)—<a href="#Pro">see section 4.4</a>. Nonetheless, insofar
as the constraints of proportionality seem inherently vague,
retributivists may have to make some sort of peace with the thesis of
limiting retributivism.</p>

<h3><a id="RetCriJus">3.6 Retrospective criminal justice</a></h3>

<p>It is commonly said that the difference between utilitarian and
retributive theories of punishment is that the former is prospective,
looking to the good that punishment may accomplish, while the latter
is retrospective, seeking to do justice for what a wrongdoer has done.
That is <em>a</em> difference between the two, but retributivism
should not be reduced to the claim that it is punishment in response
to a past crime. Other theories may refer to the fact that wrongdoers
have already done something in virtue of which it is proper to punish
them without thereby being retributivist. See, e.g., Quinn 1985 (it is
rational to threaten people with punishment for crimes, and that
rationality is transmitted to punishment if they go ahead and commit
crimes); Tadros 2011 (criminals have a duty to endure punishment to
make up for the harm they have caused).</p>

<h3><a id="SubVen">3.7 Sublimated vengeance</a></h3>

<p>Retributivism has also often been conflated with revenge or the
desire for vengeance. But the two concepts should not be confused.
Robert Nozick drew five distinctions between the two, including that
revenge is personal but retribution is not, and that</p>

<blockquote><p>[r]evenge involves a particular emotional tone,
pleasure in the suffering of another, while retribution either need
involve no emotional tone, or involves another one, namely, pleasure
at justice being done. (1981: 367)</p></blockquote>

<p>These imply that even if no one wanted to take
 revenge on a wrongdoer, there could still be a retributive reason to
 punish him (Moore 1997: 89).</p>

<p>These distinctions do not imply that the desire for revenge plays
no motivational role leading people to value retributive
justice. Perhaps retributive justice is the sublimated, generalized
version of the thirst for revenge. The two are nonetheless
different. As George Fletcher wrote (2000: 417), retributivism
“is not to be identified with vengeance or revenge, any more
than love is to be identified with lust”.</p>

<h3><a id="SafValStoVig">3.8 Safety valve to stop vigilantism</a></h3>

<p>Finally, some have thought that retributive justice is simply a
name for the way the law takes over punishment from private groups,
who would otherwise engage in vigilante justice, with no due process,
no respect for proportionality, and the worrisome risk of a cycle of
vendettas. This view actually expresses a utilitarian justification
for punishment, which should not be confused with retributivism (Moore
1997: 89–90).</p>

<h2><a id="RanIss">4. Range of issues</a></h2>

<p>This section will address six issues that arise for those trying to
make sense of retributive justice: (1) the nature of the desert claim
and questions it raises; (2) the proper identity of the punisher; (3)
the normative status of suffering; (4) the meaning of proportionality;
(5) the strength of retributive reasons; and (6) whether retributivism
should be thought of as a consequentialist or deontological
theory.</p>

<h3><a id="Des">4.1 Desert</a></h3>

<p>Desert has been analyzed into a three-way relationship between the
person who deserves something, what she deserves, and that in virtue
of which she deserves it. These can usefully be cast, respectively, as
the desert subject, the desert object, and the desert basis (Feinberg
1970; Berman 2011: 437). A fourth dimension should also be noted: the
person or persons who can appropriately give, or have a duty to give,
the desert subject what she deserves. I call these persons desert
agents. They raise a distinct set of issues, which are addressed
in <a href="#WhoMayPun">section 4.2</a>.</p>

<h4><a id="DesSub">4.1.1 <em>The desert subject</em></a></h4>

<p>Retributivism presents no special puzzles about who is the desert
subject: the wrongdoer. What may be particularly problematic for
retributivism is the claim that certain kinds of persons (children or
the insane) or entities (states or corporations) can deserve
punishment. (For contrasting views on the last possibility, see French
1979; Narveson 2002.)</p>

<h4><a id="DesObj">4.1.2 <em>The</em> <em>desert object</em></a></h4>

<p>The desert object has already been discussed
in <a href="#Pun">section 2.1</a>: punishment. There is, of course,
much to be said about what punishments are deserved for what wrongs. I
highlight here three issues that are particularly salient for
retributivists. First, is the question of whether the retributivist
can justify inflicting harsh treatment in addition to
censure—<a href="#QueJus">see section 5</a>. This is tied to the
relevance of suffering, which is discussed
in <a href="#MorPuzSuf">section 4.3</a>. Second, is the challenge of
identifying proportional punishments—discussed
in <a href="#Pro">section 4.4</a>.</p>

<p>To those two familiar problems we can add one more: Can
retributivists make sense of punishments that do not aim to inflict
suffering, but that reflect the idea that a wrongdoer's particular
acts make her unfit to retain certain rights going forward?  Consider,
for example, the rights to vote, to bear arms, or to be free from
preventive detention. The U.S. Supreme Court has held that the loss of
these rights need not be punitive. But arguably such
losses <em>are</em> punitive, and can be accounted for within a
retributive framework as long as they are not merely a reflection of
society's fear of what the person may do in the future, but carry a
message of censure and are proportionate to the wrongdoer's prior
wrongful action (Walen 2011; for a different view of how the line
between punitive and non-punitive sanctions should be drawn, see Chiao
2013). However, even if such losses can, as a class, be justified as
retributive punishments, individual instances of them may be
substantively unjustifiable (see, e.g., Lippke 2001, on the loss of
the right to vote).</p>

<p>One more matter should be mentioned under the heading of the desert
object: namely the idea put forward by some retributivists, that
wrongdoers have a “right to be punished” such that not
punishing them wrongs them (Hegel 1821; Morris 1968). It is important
to be clear about what this right is. It would be ludicrous to hold
that an executive wrongs a wrongdoer by showing him mercy and
pardoning him. What is meant is that wrongdoers have the right to be
treated as the kind of being who can be held responsible and punished,
rather than as sick or dangerous beasts. <a href="">See section
4.1.3.1</a>.</p>

<h4><a id="DesBas">4.1.3 <em>The</em> <em>desert basis</em></a></h4>

<p>The desert basis has already been discussed
in <a href="#RelKinWro">section 2.2</a>: a certain kind of wrong. The
focus of the discussion at this point is on two puzzles about the
existence of a desert basis. The first puzzle concerns how humans,
given the fact that our choices are grounded in our brain activity,
and that our brains are parts of the physical world, can have the sort
of free will necessary to <em>deserve</em> punishment at all. The
second puzzle concerns why, even if they deserve punishment, that fact
should make it permissible for anyone to take on the role of giving
them the punishment they deserve.</p>

<h5>4.1.3.1 <em>Physical laws and desert</em></h5>

<p>The laws of physics might be thought to imply that we are no more
free and responsible for our “choices”, and therefore no more capable of
deserving punishment, than any other physical object, be it a falling
tree or a wild animal. One can resist this move by arguing that while
we are physical beings, most of us have the capacity to use reason to
think about our options, to weigh reasons for and against them, and to
choose—these being the key abilities for being responsible
agents who can <em>deserve</em> punishment if they choose to do wrong
(Morse 2004). But this invites the reply that even in normally
functioning adults the attribution of responsibility for choices is an
illusion (Smilansky 2000). None of us are ultimately responsible for
our genes (or our cells) and the environment in which we were born and
raised, and yet those two factors, combined with the situations we
happen to face and a certain amount of quantum randomness, determine
what we do.  Upon closer inspection, the agent dissolves and all we
are left with is a brain responding to stimulus in a way fully
consistent with the underlying physical laws (Greene and Cohen 2011;
Vihvelin 2011).</p>

<p>Michael McKenna's (2009) entry in this Encyclopedia surveys a range
of possible responses to this argument. Assessing these is beyond the
scope of this entry. Two types of compatibilist response, however,
deserve special mention. One is the view introduced by P.F. Strawson
(1962), and developed by R. Jay Wallace (1994) and Christine Korsgaard
(1996), according to which we normally have good moral reasons to hold
normal adults morally responsible for their choices, while also
holding those who suffer certain informational, rational, or
motivational deficits, or who have been manipulated in certain
ways, <em>not</em> responsible. The basis of this view is that it is
more respectful of normal humans to treat them as beings with the kind
of dignity that comes with being responsible for their choices than
not. Treating normal humans as merely more or less dangerous animals,
whose behavior can hopefully be modified with threats and rewards and,
failing that, who should be more or less fully incapacitated, is to
over-extend the medical model. The medical model should be applied
only to those whose mental capacities are distinctly sub-normal (Hegel
1821: 71 &amp; 246; Morris 1968).</p>

<p>This first approach prioritizes the moral/practical point of view
over the theoretical/metaphysical point of view. But it arguably
trades on theoretical claims about the abilities of normal persons to
make choices as agents. Thus the view may be well complemented by
another sort of view, exemplified by the work of John Martin Fischer
and Mark Ravizza (1998), which focuses on ways in which persons can
exercise meaningful agency by being responsive to reasons (for a
collection of essays discussing this issue, see Nadelhoffer 2013).</p>

<h5>4.1.3.2 <em>The Gap Between Desert and the Right to Punish</em></h5>

<p>Assuming that wrongdoers can, at least sometimes, deserve
punishment, the next question is: why think others may punish them
just because they are deserving? David Dolinko (1991) points out that
there is a difference between someone morally deserving something and
others having a right to give it to her. In one example, he imagines a
father who (perversely) gives his reprobate son almost everything in
his will, and leaves his loving and respectful son a pittance. We may
believe that the loving son <em>deserves</em> to inherit at least half
of his father's estate, but that would not entitle anyone to take
property from the other son to give to him (ibid.: 544). Putting the
point more generally, desert by itself does not justify the violation
of rights. Moreover, since people normally have a right not to suffer
punishment, desert alone should not justify punishing them.</p>

<p>The most promising way to respond to this criticism within a
retributive framework is to distinguish two kinds of desert: desert
that corresponds to a view about what would be a good outcome, and
desert that concerns rights (Hill 1999: 425–426). Dolinko's
example concerns the first kind of desert. If it were modified so that
the executor of the will misread it to give the reprobate son almost
everything, then we would think that the loving son deserved to get
his <em>rightful</em> share under the will. The relevant agents of the
state would then not only have a reason but also a right to take
property from the reprobate son and give it to the loving son. When it
comes to retributivism, then, Dolinko's challenge trades on the
thought that retributivism claims that wrongdoers deserve to suffer in
the sense that their suffering is a good outcome. As will be argued
in <a href="#MorPuzSuf">section 4.3</a>, retributivism is more
properly understood as holding that wrongdoers deserve <em>to be
punished</em>—a claim about what certain others have not only a
reason but a <em>right</em> to do to them.</p>

<h3><a id="WhoMayPun">4.2 Who may punish?</a></h3>

<p>Assuming that wrongdoers deserve to be punished, who has a right to
inflict the punishment? Who, in other words, are the appropriate
desert agents? One might start, as social contract writers like Hobbes
and Locke do, with the view that in the state of nature, the victim
has the right to punish, and that the reasons for creating a state
include reasons for potential victims to transfer that right to the
state (Hobbes 1651: chs. 14 &amp; 18; Locke 1690: ch. 9).</p>

<p>One worry about the social contract view is that it licenses
vigilante punishment. Social contract theorists can handle that by
emphasizing that people not only delegate but <em>transfer</em> their
right to punish, retaining only a vestigial right to punish in the
case of minor punishments, such as would be doled out outside the
criminal justice system, or if the state fails or is unable to act.
Communitarians like Antony Duff (2011: 6), however, object to even a
vestigial right to vigilante punishment. Duff sees the state, which
speaks on behalf of the whole community, as the only proper punisher,
at least in the context of crimes (For an even stronger position along
these lines, see Hegel 1821: §102).</p>

<p>Others take a different view about vigilantes, namely
that <em>anyone</em> is <em>pro tanto</em> entitled to punish a
wrongdoer. Some forfeiture theorists hold that restrictions on the
right to punish someone who has forfeited his right not to be punished
arise only as a matter of political morality (Wellman 2012:
378–80). It is hard to see why a desert theorist could not take
the same position. Indeed, some retributivists think that what
vigilantes do should at least count against the total punishment
someone is due (Husak 1990: 441–442; but see Kolber 2013
(discussed in <a href="#Pro">section 4.4</a>) for a challenge to the
logical implication that vigilantes “punish”).</p>

<p>Even if the state normally has an exclusive right to punish
criminal wrongdoing, questions arise whether it is permitted to punish
if it sustains or fails to address important social injustices (from
distributive injustice to the denial of civil and political rights to
socially disempowered groups). Some think that such conditions call
for mitigation in punishment (von Hirsch and Ashworth 2005: 69). Others
think that they may negate the state's right to punish (Murphy 1973;
Duff 2001: 182–184).</p>

<p>Finally, can the wrongdoer herself be her own punitive desert
agent?  Can she repent and voluntarily take on hardships, and thereby
preempt others' right to punish her? Duff has argued that she cannot
unless she has also suffered public criticism and social
ostracism—and even then, such informal punishment should be
discouraged as a substitute for formal punishment (Duff 2001:
118–120).</p>

<h3><a id="MorPuzSuf">4.3 Moral puzzles of suffering</a></h3>

<p>Retributive justice holds that it is intrinsically (or
non-instrumentally) good that wrongdoers suffer at the hands of
punishers. But as Hart put it, retributive justice</p>

<blockquote><p>appears to be a mysterious piece of moral alchemy
in which the combination of the two evils of moral wickedness and
suffering are transmuted into good. (Hart 1968:
234–235)</p></blockquote>

<p>Moreover, some critics think the view that it is intrinsically good
to inflict suffering is “barbaric” (Tadros 2011: 63).</p>

<p>The core retributivist response to these criticisms has to be that
it is neither absurd nor barbaric to think that the normative valence
of suffering might sometimes be positive. There are, however, reasons
to think that this response is itself defensible only if
retributivists accept two further positions. First, wrongdoers deserve
not merely to suffer but to suffer <em>punishment</em>. Second,
punishment should be calibrated to inflict objective deprivations, not
subjective suffering.</p>

<h4><a id="VarNorValSuf">4.3.1 The variable normative valence of suffering</a></h4>

<p>Retributivists think that deserved suffering should be
distinguished from non-deserved suffering. While the latter is
inherently bad to inflict, the former is inherently good to inflict
(if inflicted by a proper punitive desert agent). Of course, it would
be better if there were no occasion to inflict suffering, but given
that a wrong has been committed, inflicting deserved suffering in
response is better than not doing so (Hegel 1821: §99; Zaibert
2006: 202–216). This can be thought of as an application of John
Rawls's (1972: 31) claim that the right is prior to the good. Just as
desire satisfaction loses its positive value if the desires are
unjust, so suffering loses its negative value if it is deserved. (For
another example of something with a variable normative valence, see
Kant's doctrine of the highest good: happiness in proportion to
virtue. Kant 1788: 115.)</p>

<p><em>Contra</em> Victor Tadros (2013: 261), this response to Hart's
objection does not imply that if a person were already suffering, then
the situation might be made better, on the whole, if the person
engaged in wrongdoing, thereby making the suffering more
valuable. This objection presupposes—wrongly;
see <a href="#SufAbsVerSufThrPun">section 4.3.2</a>—that
retributivists should value the suffering of wrongdoers in the
abstract, as opposed to the suffering inflicted by punishment.
Moreover, even if retributivists valued the suffering of wrongdoers,
detached from any punishment, they could take the position that the
negative value of the wrong outweighs any increased value in the
suffering.</p>

<h4><a id="SufAbsVerSufThrPun">4.3.2 Suffering in the abstract versus suffering through punishment</a></h4>

<p>Some retributivists take the view that what wrongdoing calls for is
the wrongdoer's suffering, whatever causes it. As Mitchell Berman
writes (2013: 87), “the dominant retributivist view” is
“that what wrongdoers deserve is ‘to suffer’”
(see also Zaibert 2013: 43 n.19; but see Kleinig 1973: 67, discussing
the value of <em>imposing</em> suffering). Even though Berman himself
does not quite embrace that view, he embraces a close cousin, namely
that “what wrongdoers deserve … is that their lives go
less well” (2013: 87).</p>

<p>There is something intuitively appealing, if one has retributive
intuitions, about the thought that it is better if a
wrongdoer—especially one who has committed serious
wrongs—lives miserably than if he lives happily. There is
something galling, if one feels the retributive impulse, in the thought that he
might “get away with it”. Nonetheless, it is important to
separate the true retributive thought, that it is good to punish a
wrongdoer so that he does not “get away with it”, from the
quasi-retributive thought, that it is better that he suffer than that
he live happily, even if the suffering is not inflicted by punishment.
This quasi-retributive thought may draw on the same emotional
wellspring as retributivism. But a retributivist—at least one
who rejects the fantasy that God inflicts such suffering as a matter
of cosmic justice—should not base her conception of
retributivism on it.</p>

<p>If retributivism were based on the thought that wrongdoers'
suffering is good in itself, then punishment is not necessary as a
bridge connecting the suffering and the individual bad acts. Suffering
becomes fungible, and a retributivist is left with the need to keep a
whole-life ledger of good and bad acts, for which she wants a person
to have the appropriate amount of whole-life happiness or suffering
(Ezorsky 1972: xxvi; Tadros 2011: 68). But the idea of tracking all of
a person's good and bad deeds, and all of her happiness or suffering,
and aiming to align them is highly problematic. First, it would
undermine the idea that punishment should be doled out for particular
wrongs, as punishers would instead have reason to make up for wrongs
that went unpunished, while keeping track of all good deeds that
should mitigate punishment. Second, it implies that one could bank
good deeds and “earn the ability to commit misdeeds with
impunity” (Alexander 2013: 318). Third, if a desert agent is
optional, then Dolinko's question about how punishers get from desert
to a right to punish re-emerges, for then it looks like desert must
concern good outcomes, not rights—<a href="">see section
4.1.3.2</a>. The better position, therefore, relinquishes the illusory
appeal of the idea of cosmic justice—if there is a God, let God
handle cosmic justice—and locates the value of suffering in the
context of a desert agent giving a wrongdoer the punishment he
deserves for a particular wrong.</p>

<h4><a id="SubSufMeaExpCauSuf">4.3.3 Subjective suffering or measures expected to cause suffering</a></h4>

<p>Adam Kolber, no retributivist, argues that retributivists cannot
escape a subjective approach to punishment, one which, he argues, also
causes problems for them.</p>

<blockquote><p>To be retributively punished, the person punished
must find the punishment aversive and the severity of the punishment
is at least partly a function of how aversive he finds it. (2009: 215)</p></blockquote>

<p>Kolber continues:</p>

<blockquote><p>Retributivists who fail to consider variation in
offenders' actual or anticipated experiences of punishment are not
measuring punishment severity properly and are therefore punishing
disproportionally. (ibid.; see also Bronsteen et al. 2009:
1068–1072)</p></blockquote>

<p>Yet, such variation would be intuitively problematic for
retributivists, calling, for example, for short sentences for those
who would suffer a lot in prison, even if they would pose a danger to
society, and for extra harsh treatment for those who find prison easy
to handle.</p>

<p>Many retributivists disagree with Kolber's claim that the
subjective experience of suffering of particular individuals should be
a significant concern for them. As Andrew von Hirsch and Andrew
Ashworth put it:</p>

<blockquote><p>What makes punishments more or less onerous is not
any identifiable sensation; rather, it is the degree to which those
sensations interfere with people's legitimate interests</p></blockquote>

<p>—interests people generally share, such as
in</p>

<blockquote><p>freedom of movement, choice regarding …
activities, choice of associates, privacy, and so on. (von Hirsch and
Ashworth 2005: 147; see also Gray 2010; Markel and Flanders
2010).</p></blockquote>

<p>Kolber's argument also has a flaw in it. He starts with two sound
premises: (a) that some experience more suffering with a given
punishment than others, and (b) that such differences must be
justified. But his conclusion—that retributivists must justify
imposing greater subjective suffering on some rather than
others <em>as a matter of retributive justice—</em>does not
follow. As was pointed out in <a href="#Pun">section 2.1</a>,
punishment must be intentional; what results as a mere side-effect of
punishment is not itself part of the punishment. Retributivists can
intend to impose punishments that will generally be experienced as
more severe the more serious the wrong for which they are
imposed—for example, longer prison terms or more austere
prisons—knowing but not intending that different people will
experience the same term in the same prison differently.</p>

<p>Of course, even unintended differences in suffering are morally
significant. But they can justifiably be caused if (a) the punishment
that leads to them is itself deserved, (b) the importance of giving
wrongdoers what they deserve is sufficiently high, and (c) the
problems with eliminating the unintended differences in experienced
suffering are too great to be overcome. This last condition is
arguably the case with regard to most variations in the experience of
punishment. The reason is that individual tailoring has a number of
problems that would be hard to overcome: (1) it invites gaming the
system; (2) it would be perceived by some as unfair because those who
claim to be extra sensitive would seem to be given undo leniency, and
that would lead to resentment and extra conflict; (3) it would
undermine predictability, and it would likely lead to abuse of power;
and (4) with regard to those who are relatively insensitive to
punishment, it would seem to call for brutality or torture that the
state should not want to condone. It can also be less problematic to
cause most variations in the experience of punishment than it may at
first seem if people are to some degree responsible for their own
hypersensitivity—compare Rawls's thought that people are
responsible for their own preferences (Rawls 1975: 261). Finally, the
state <em>should</em> accommodate people who would suffer extreme
trauma from normal punishments, but that does not imply that the
punishers should try to tailor the subjective experience of suffering
to be proportional to the crime.</p>

<h3><a id="Pro">4.4 Proportionality</a></h3>

<p>Retributive justice holds that it would be bad to punish a
wrongdoer <em>more</em> than she deserves, where what she deserves
must be in some way proportional to the gravity of her
crime. Inflicting disproportionate punishment wrongs her just as, even
if not quite as much as, punishing an innocent person wrongs her
(Gross 1979: 436).</p>

<p>The possibility of punishing <em>less</em> than deserved is also
normatively significant, but it provides a much weaker constraint.
First, it does not seem to <em>wrong</em> anyone in particular (see
Duus-Otterström 2013: 472–475). One might think that the victims
of crime are wronged if wrongdoers are not punished. Arguably this
view was held by Kant (1797: 142) who wrote that if a people do not
insist on the execution of murderers, “blood guilt” would
“cling” to them “as collaborators in this public
violation of justice”—though this text might better be
read as an assertion that the people have an obligation to do justice,
not for the victim, but for the integrity of the law (see Hill 1999:
443).  But the view that it wrongs victims not to punish wrongdoers
confuses vengeance, which is victim-centered, with retributivism,
which is agent-centered: concerned with giving the wrongdoer the
punishment <em>he</em> deserves (see Paul Robinson's 2008 contrast
between vengeful and deontological conceptions of deserved
punishment). Second, it is clear that in any criminal justice system
that allows plea-bargaining, intentional deviations below desert will
have to be tolerated. Russell Christopher (2003) has argued that
retributivists cannot accept plea-bargaining. But he bases his
argument on a number of unsound assumptions, including that
“[r]etributivism imposes an absolute duty to punish culpable
wrongdoers whenever the opportunity arises” (ibid.: 101), and
that punishing a wrongdoer less than he deserves violates his
“right to punishment” (ibid.: 128–129). Both of
these have been rejected above. Christopher correctly notes that
retributivists desire to treat equally culpable people alike (ibid.:
131). But this desideratum can be sacrificed for the sake of other
goods, as long as no one is punished to a disproportionately large
degree.</p>

<p>This leaves two fundamental questions that an account of
proportionality must address: how should we measure the gravity of a
wrong, and how can a punishment be “proportional” to it?
After these are address in <a href="#MeaGraWro">sections 4.4.1</a>
and <a href="#PunProCri">4.4.2</a>, criticisms of retributivism based
on problems with proportionality will be addressed
in <a href="#CriRetBasProPro">4.4.3</a>.</p>

<h4><a id="MeaGraWro">4.4.1 Measuring the gravity of a wrong</a></h4>

<p>Two dimensions of wrongdoing figure most prominently in its
gravity: the magnitude of the harm or wrong inflicted or risked, and
the culpability of the wrongdoer for bringing it about or risking
it. The difficulty, as regards proportionality, is in bringing these
two dimensions together into a single dimension of
“gravity”. Consider Hart's question (1968: 162): “Is
negligently causing the destruction of a city worse than the
intentional wounding of a single policeman?”</p>

<p>Other complexities only add to that fundamental difficulty. First,
does it matter if harm is caused, or is the gravity of the wrong set
fully by the wrong risked or intended? (For the position that harm
does not matter, see Feinberg 1995; Alexander, Ferzan, and Morse 2009;
for a criticism of that view, see Levy 2005; Walen 2010. The Model
Penal Code, 5.05(1), aspires to reject the relevance of harm caused,
but does not do so completely.)</p>

<p>Second, what significance, if any, should be given to the
difference between being punished for the first time, and having been
punished before and then having committed the same or a similar wrong
again? Many retributivists resist the idea that past convictions
should matter, on the grounds that having been punished already, more
severe punishment for the next wrong would effectively constitute
double punishment for the first (Fletcher 2000: 462; Singer 1979:
ch. 5). Others think there is a way around this problem. One approach
is to hold the repeat offender guilty of a culpable omission: the
failure “to organize his life in a way that reduces the risk of
his reoffending” (Lee 2009: 578).  Another is to defend a
first-offender discount, reflecting human susceptibility to temptation
(frailty). This discount would progressively diminish for subsequent
comparable offenses, effectively raising the offender's culpability
(von Hirsch and Ashworth 2005: 148–155), and it would apply only
to lesser wrongs, as it is hard to sympathize with frailty when it
comes to serious crimes such as rape or murder (Duff 2001: 169). Both
versions of a recidivist premium should be distinguished from Duff's
view that persistent dangerous offenders may effectively forfeit their
right to be treated as equal citizens (ibid.: §4.2).</p>

<p>Third, do the background conditions in which a wrongdoer acts
affect her culpability for a particular wrong? Some think that coming
from a severely deprived or “rotten social background”
undermines a wrongdoer's culpability (Bazelon 1976; Delgado 1985;
Gardner 1998; Delgado 2011). Others think coming from such a
background is a “tragedy, but it should not be a defense to
crime” (Morse 2011). Others distinguish ways in which it might
be relevant to punishment, not because it limits what a proportional
punishment can be, but because it calls for compassion (von Hirsch and
Ashworth 2005: §5.3.1) or disqualification of the
state—<a href="#WhoMayPun">see section 4.2</a>.</p>

<p>Despite all these sources of complication (and there are others;
see Feinberg 1995: 132), there is empirical evidence that people
across a wide range of demographics can rank order even subtle
variations of “core wrongs…—physical aggression,
takings without consent, and deception in exchanges—” with
surprising consistency (Robinson and Kurzban 2007: 1892). These subtle
variations involve, for example, two thefts differing primarily only
in that one involved sneaking into an open garage while the other
involved breaking into a locked house (ibid.: 1895). Not every one of
the complicating variables just mentioned was tested in the studies,
but extreme concerns about arbitrariness in rankings are somewhat
alleviated by them.</p>

<h4><a id="PunProCri">4.4.2 Punishment proportional to a crime</a></h4>

<p>There are two basic senses of proportionality: cardinal and
ordinal.  Cardinal proportionality sets absolute measures for
punishment that is proportional to a given crime; ordinal
proportionality requires only that more serious crimes should be
punished more severely.</p>

<p><em>Lex Talionis</em> (<a href="#LexTalPayResKin">section 3.4</a>)
offers a theory of cardinal proportionality. In its traditional
form—an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth—it seems
implausible, both for being too lenient in some cases (take $10 from a
thief who stole $10), and too extreme in others (repeatedly torture
and rape someone who had committed many such acts himself). Kant
proposed what might be thought a better version, saying that the thief
should lose not just the value of what he stole, but instead all
rights to property (1797: 142), and prohibiting those forms of
“mistreatment that could make the humanity in the person
suffering it into something abominable” (ibid.). Nonetheless,
his measure for theft swings to the overly punitive side, leaving the
convicted thief a dependent on the state, and thereby “reduced
to the status of a slave for a certain time, or permanently if the
state sees fit” (ibid.). Others have tried to
rehabilitate <em>lex talionis</em>, arguing, for example, that it can
be rendered plausible if interpreted to call for punishment that
“possess[es] some or all of the characteristics that made the
offense wrong” (Waldron 1992: 35). But however one spells out
the wrong-making characteristics, it seems likely that <em>lex
talionis</em> will provide a measure either too vague to be of much
help (see Shafer-Landau 1996: 299–302; 2000: 197–198), or
too specific to be plausible (at least in some cases).</p>

<p>A purely ordinal approach, however, also has problems. If all that
were required to do justice is to rank order wrongs by their gravity
and then provide a mapping onto a range of punishments that likewise
went from lighter to more serious—respecting the norms of
rank-ordering and parity—then neither the range of punishments
from a fine of $1 up to a fine of $100, nor from 40 years to 60 years
in prison, would provide disproportionate punishment, no matter what
the crimes. This seems wrong. Murder should not be punished with a
$100 fine, and littering should not be punished with 40 years in
prison.  Some vague degree of cardinality therefore seems to be called
for, punishing grave wrongs with heavy penalties and minor wrongs with
light penalties.</p>

<p>The possibility of anchoring certain punishments within these broad
bands of acceptable cardinal values, and then using ordinal
proportionality to fill in the spaces between these anchor points,
arguably provides for an acceptable and complete scale of proportional
punishment (see Kleinig 1973: 123–124). If one believes that it
is also possible to have a sense for relative degree of gravity, then
such an anchored ordinal system can prevent clustering near any anchor
point, and provide a fairly precise, plausible scale of proportional
punishment that could be used in any given jurisdiction (von Hirsch and
Ashworth 2005: §9.3). It is worth emphasizing that such a scale
would not have universal application. It would depend on a
jurisdiction choosing certain anchor points within the acceptable
ranges, and thus would apply only within that jurisdiction. But if
such jurisdictional variation can be tolerated, then the scales so
provided would be far less vague and open to consequentialist input in
setting punishment than the scale embraced by limiting
retributivism—<a href="#LimRet">see section 3.5</a>.</p>

<p>Parsimony adds downward normative pressure to the range of
anchoring points. The idea is that since punishment involves
suffering, it should be inflicted as minimally as possible, consistent
with the vague limits of cardinal desert and any other goals
(including deterrence and incapacitation) that should be cited to help
provide a full justification for punishment. Any excessive
punishment, it can be argued, is a sign of cruelty. Some think that
retributivism is inherently inclined towards cruel harshness (Dolinko
1991; Garland 2001; Whitman 2003; Ristroff 2009), but this is a
mistake (Robinson 2008; Flanders 2010; Gray and Huber 2010;
Duus-Otterström 2013).  Importantly, parsimony is not to be confused
with mercy. Mercy involves giving a wrongdoer less than she deserves
out of compassion or humanitarian concern for her wellbeing (Hampton
in Murphy and Hampton 1988: 158–159; Gray 2010: 1692). Parsimony
is a reason for lowering the scale of punishments from which one can
determine what a wrongdoer deserves, again within any given
jurisdiction.</p>

<p>While the idea of a scale of punishments may suggest a certain
linear simplicity, it is important to keep in mind that the severity
of a punishment depends on at least two dimensions: the degree of
harshness, and its duration or repetition (for corporal punishment).
One might think that duration and harshness can simply be traded off,
but retributivists have reason favor shorter, harsher punishments over
longer, more lenient ones (Tomlin forthcoming). In brief, it is bad,
from a retributive point of view, if a wrongdoer does not get the
punishment he deserves, and the longer it takes for him to get the
full punishment he deserves, the greater the chance that he will
either die or change in such a way that it is no longer reasonable to
punish him for what he did.</p>

<h4><a id="CriRetBasProPro">4.4.3 Criticisms of retributivism based on problems with proportionality</a></h4>

<p>Greg Roebuck and David Wood (2011) claim that it is incumbent on
punishers to <em>demonstrate</em> that the punishment they propose to
inflict is not disproportionately large. Given that moral anchoring
can provide at best a very rough set of guidelines for proportional
punishment, and that the methods of extrapolating from or
interpolating between them are also highly underdetermined, they argue
that no one can meet this burden. Therefore, a retributive commitment
to proportionality would require the abolition of punishment.</p>

<p>This critique rests on the premise that there might be true
proportional punishments that any actual punishment might exceed, no
matter how parsimonious the scale of punishment on which it rests. But
a more plausible reading of the vagueness of anchors and the process
of reasoning from them is that they provide an acceptable range in
which to build an internally consistent schedule of punishments. Thus
a more reasonable conclusion to draw, in the face of epistemic
uncertainty, is that any given schedule of punishments should stick to
the lower end of the intuitively acceptable spectrum of punishments
(Duus-Otterström 2013).</p>

<p>Claire Finkelstein (2004) raises a different sort of
proportionality-based objection to retributivism, one based on the
shortcomings of <em>lex talionis</em>. She claims that
“retributivists' theory of punishment was supposed itself to
answer the question of which punishments are morally acceptable and
which are not” (ibid.: 213). <em>Lex talionis</em> at least
promised to explain what sorts of punishments are justified, but if it
fails, as it does, then it seems that retributivism cannot account for
why we find certain punishments acceptable—primarily
imprisonment, fines, community service, probation, the loss of certain
rights, and possibly the death penalty—and reject others, such
as torture, shaming punishments, or forced sterilization (ibid.:
212–213).</p>

<p>The problem with Finkelstein's objection is that she assigns to
retributivists a task that they have no reason to accept.  Yes, proportionality should rule out
certain punishments on the ground that they are disproportionately
large. But there is no reason for retributivists not to look to other
criteria, such as respect for human dignity, to prohibit those forms
of punishment that seem cruel or degrading.  (Determining how to
handle the death penalty, however—determining whether it can
ever be a proportional punishment and whether it is ruled out as cruel
or degrading—is a particularly thorny problem, beyond the scope
of this entry. For a brief survey of the difficulty, see Edmundson
2002.)</p>

<p>Adam Kolber (2013) raises the most difficult proportionality-based
criticism of retributivism. He that starts from the observation that
countries that use pre-trial detention seem universally to give those
who are convicted credit for the time they have served. For example,
if someone gets a sentence of a year, and has spent six months in jail
in pre-trial detention, he would have to serve only six additional
months.  Serving the full year, after spending six months in jail
already, would seem to be a disproportionate sentence. But it is very
hard to explain the intuition that this practice is morally required
in any way other than by recognizing that harsh treatment inflicted in
connection with a crime is relevant to the size of the punishment,
even if it wasn't intended as punishment at the time it was
inflicted. If, however, harsh treatment inflicted in connection with a
crime counts towards the size of the punishment, then we seem to be
thrown back onto the sort of view about suffering rejected
in <a href="#SubSufMeaExpCauSuf">section 4.3.3</a>, the view that what
matters is how much a person suffers, whether or not the suffering was
inflicted as part of a punishment.</p>

<p>Some of the problems with the view that suffering itself is what a
retributivist should care about have already been mentioned. But one
more should be brought up here, namely the implication for
post-sentence deprivations, such as being subject to preventive
detention if one is predictably very dangerous. One might argue
that the punishment in those cases includes losing the normative
status of benefiting from the presumption of innocence after serving
one's term of punitive detention (Walen 2011). But if actual detention
matters for proportionate sentencing in the pre-trial context, it must
matter as well for the post-sentence context, and this would make it
effectively impossible to pursue both proportionate punishment and
post-sentence detention.</p>

<p>This is a difficult problem for retributivists. They might want to
respond by saying that liberty deprivation that is not intended as
punishment can be justified if and only if two conditions are met: (1)
punishment is, all things considered, justified, and (2) these other
deprivations can be avoided only at the cost of giving up punishment
or causing even worse consequences or independent rights
violations—<a href="#SubSufMeaExpCauSuf">see section
4.3.3</a>. But if they respond to Kolber this way, retributivists
cannot claim (contra Husak 1990) that their commitment to
proportionality requires them to give credit for pre-trial detention,
as pre-trial detention is not meant to be punitive. Perhaps they have
other reasons for giving credit for pre-trial detention at sentencing,
perhaps reasons of mercy or fairness. But it would be an odd sort of
requirement of mercy, as mercy is usually taken to be
discretionary. And if called for as a matter of fairness, it is
unclear why fairness does not require the other accommodations that
Kolber notes and that nonetheless seem counter-intuitive. This is not
to say that retributivists could not come up with an adequate response
to Kolber, but they have work to do.</p>

<h3><a id="StrRetRea">4.5 Strength of retributive reasons</a></h3>

<p>How strong are retributive reasons? As was argued
in <a href="#NegRet">section 3.2</a>, even if they are weak, the
presence of positive desert makes a difference to the justification of
punishment. It affects how one understands whether punishment respects
the dignity of the punished wrongdoer. And it might affect how one
understands the forfeiture of the right <em>not</em> to be
punished. These issues concern whether the practice of punishment can
be morally justified. It is a separate question, however, whether
positive desert plays much of a role in establishing an
all-things-considered reason to punish. If positive desert provides a
strong reason for action, then there might be little to no need for
non-retributive reasons to justify punishment; if positive desert
provides a weak reason to punish, then punishment may often not be
justified unless there are strong non-retributive reasons to
punish.</p>

<p>To be more precise, there are actually two ways the strength or
weakness of retributive reasons can be significant. It may (a) affect
whether an individual wrongdoer should be punished, even if no
instrumental good (primarily deterrence and incapacitation) would
thereby be achieved, but it may also (b) affect whether institutions
of punishment should be established, even if no instrumental goods
would thereby be achieved. It may be relatively easy to justify
punishing a wrongdoer by appeal to positive desert, even if his
punishment yields no instrumental benefits, if the institutions of
punishment are already up, running, and paid for (Moore 1997:
100–101; Husak 2000: 995). It is another matter to claim that
the institutions of punishment, given all their costs, can be
justified by positive desert alone. The point of saying this is not to
suggest, in the spirit of Hart (1968: 9) that the justification of
institutions of criminal justice should be purely
consequentialist. The retributivist sees desert as a reason for
setting up the institutions as well as for punishing the individual
wrongdoer (Moore 1997: 154). The point is merely that one should be
clear about just what one is assessing when weighing costs and
benefits.</p>

<p>The primary costs of establishing the institutions of criminal
punishment are:</p>

<ol type="a">
<li>Financial: (according the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics,
states spent over $38 billion on corrections in 2001) with
corresponding opportunity costs (that money could have been spent on
schools, medical research, infrastructure, or taxpayer refunds, to
name only a few alternatives);</li>

<li>Errors (convicting the innocent, disproportionately punishing the
guilty, and punishing those who deserve no punishment under laws that
overcriminalize);</li>

<li>The risk of the abuse of power (political and other forms of
oppressive uses of the criminal justice system); and</li>

<li>Collateral harm to innocents (e.g., the families of convicts who
lose the support from those who are punished). (See Husak 2000 for the
first three.)</li>
</ol>

<p>It is implausible that these costs can be justified simply by the
importance of punishing wrongdoers as they deserve to be punished. The
only plausible way to justify these costs is if criminal punishment
has large instrumental benefits in terms of crime prevention (Husak
2000; Cahill 2011).</p>

<p>Importantly, this point is not lost even on those retributivists
who are least inclined to cite instrumental benefits in support of
punishment. For example, Michael Moore says:</p>

<blockquote><p>in any accounting about setting up institutions to
achieve justice, against enforcement and other costs we must balance
any benefits. One obvious benefit punishment gives is crime
prevention, through deterrence, education, and incapacitation. (Moore
1997: 151)</p></blockquote>

<p>The interesting question, at the end of the day, then, is whether,
given that institutions of punishment exist, there is a range of cases
for which the instrumental costs of punishment exceed the benefits,
but the intrinsic value of deserved punishment nonetheless justifies
extending punishment to this range of wrongdoers. The point is not
that punishment could be justified in such cases only if there is a
retributive justification for doing so. Institutional commitments to
punish certain kinds of wrongdoers <em>might</em> justify doing so
even if the costs outweigh the benefits. They might do so if the
institutions cannot be more finely tailored to track the line between
efficient and inefficient punishment. Nevertheless, those are the
sorts of cases in which the strength of retributivist reasons to
punish are mostly likely to make a difference.</p>

<h3><a id="RetConVerRetDeo">4.6 Retributive consequentialism versus retributive deontology</a></h3>

<p>Retributivism seems to contain both a deontological and a
consequentialist element. Its negative desert element is
deontological.  It is a conceptual, not a deontological, point that
one cannot punish another whom one believes to be innocent
(<a href="#Pun">section 2.1</a>). But it is a deontological point that
an avenue of justification for harsh treatment is opened up
if one believes that the person is guilty and therefore forfeits his
right not to be so treated. A negative retributivist would, at that
point, recognize that a certain class of consequentialist goals,
having to do with deterrence and incapacitation, can now be cited to
justify punishing the wrongdoer. A retributivist would add the element
of positive desert to the justificatory reasons that a negative
retributivist would cite. Both are to be contrasted with
consequentialists who reject both the restriction on using people
merely as a means of deterring others, and the existence of a liberty
right not to be incapacitated even if believed to be dangerous, and
who therefore do not see the need to cite any rights forfeiture to
justify harsh treatment as long as it is a lesser evil.</p>

<p>Insofar as retributivism holds that it is intrinsically good if a
legitimate punisher punishes the guilty, it seems to have a
consequentialist element. This good has to be weighed against other
possible goods to decide what it would be best to do. Thus most
retributivists would accept that it is justifiable to forego punishing
one deserving person if doing so would make it possible to punish two
equally deserving people, or one more deserving person—as
happens on a regular basis in plea-bargaining (Moore 1997: 157–158; Berman 2011:
451–452). <a href="#Pro">See section 4.4</a>.</p>

<p>Moore entertains the idea that one could take an absolutist sort of
deontological attitude towards the positive duty to punish. In that
spirit, one could assert that it is always wrong to make the sorts of
tradeoffs made in plea-bargaining, or indeed in deciding to devote
resources to anything other than punishing the guilty if those
resources might help ensure that the guilty are punished. Obviously,
this position is too extreme to be of any practical use unless one is
a “threshold deontologist”, willing to put aside
deontological restrictions when the harm of abiding by them is too
great (Moore 1997: 158). This, however, is an implausibly brittle form
of deontology—absolutist until it snaps. A more plausible view
of deontology is one in which deontological reasoning determines how
and when consequences count (Kumm and Walen 2014). For example,
it is a deontological claim that it is harder to justify causing harm
than allowing harm, but that does not mean that it is a violation of a
deontological constraint to cause a small harm in the course of
preventing a larger one. Likewise, a retributivist can hold that there
is a deontological reason to punish the guilty, while acknowledging
that that reason should be weighed against other reasons when
determining whether to devote resources to punishment or other
valuable goals.</p>

<p>Mitch Berman (2011) has argued that retributivism can appropriately
be understood not just as having a consequentialist element, but as
having an instrumentalist element, namely that punishment is a
valuable tool in achieving the suffering that a wrongdoer
deserves. But he argues that retributivism can also be understood as
non-instrumentalist if the desert object is punishment, not
suffering. It would be non-instrumentalist because punishment would
not be a means to achieving the good of suffering; it would be good in
itself. As argued in <a href="#MorPuzSuf">section 4.3</a>, punishment,
not suffering, should be thought of as the proper retributive desert
object, and thus the instrumentalist conception should be
rejected.</p>

<h2><a id="QueJus">5. The question of justification</a></h2>

<p>The principal focus of concern with justifying retributivism is
justifying its desert object. If censure and harsh treatment are
deserved in the way discussed in <a href="">section 4.1.3.2</a>, then
forfeiture of the right not to be punished seems unproblematic. The
question is, can we justify the claim that wrongdoers deserve censure
and harsh treatment?</p>

<p>Censure is surely the easier of the two. It respects the wrongdoer
as a responsible agent to censure her, and it respects the victim (if
there is one) to stand up for her as someone whose rights should have
been respected. The core challenge for justifying retributivism, then,
is justifying the claim that harsh treatment is equally deserved.</p>

<p>As Michael Moore (1997: 106) points out, there are two general
strategies for justifying retributive harsh treatment: (1) showing how
such treatment “follows from some yet more general principle of
justice that we think to be true”, and (2) showing that it fits
with a theory of punishment that “best accounts for those of our
more particular judgments that we also believe to be
true”. These will be handled in reverse order.</p>

<h3><a id="ConOurConJud">5.1 Conformity with our considered judgments</a></h3>

<p>The argument here has two prongs. First, most people intuitively think that
it is important to punish wrongdoers with proportional harsh
treatment, even if no other good would thereby be brought
about. Second, there is no reason to doubt that these intuitions are
reliable.</p>

<p>It seems clear that the vast majority of people share the
retributive intuition that makes up the first prong (Moore 1997: 101).
The weakness of this strategy is in prong two. There is good reason to
suspect that retributive intuitions are merely the reflection of
emotions, such as a thirst for vengeance, that are morally dubious.
They may be deeply grounded in our species as part of our evolutionary
history, but that fact by itself is insufficient to consider them
morally reliable—compare other deeply engrained emotional
impulses, such as tribalism, that are clearly morally problematic
(Bloom 2013). Moreover, the label vengeance is not merely used as a
pejorative; a retributive or vengeful response to wrongdoing has to
confront moral arguments that it is a misplaced reaction. Foremost
among these is the argument that we do not <em>really</em> have free
will—<a href="">see section 4.1.3.1</a>. Respect for the dignity
of wrongdoers as agents may call for censuring them when they do
wrong, and with requiring them to make reparations when those can be
made. It is unclear, however, why it calls, in addition, for harsh
treatment.  Rather, sympathy for wrongdoers as products of their
brains and environment seems to call for mercy and forgiveness (for a
contrary view, see Levy forthcoming).</p>

<p>Moore (1997: 145) has an interesting response to this sort of
criticism. He turns to the first-person point of view. He imagines
that he has committed some horrible violent crime, and then says that
he hopes his response “would be that I would feel guilty unto
death”. As a result, he hopes that he would <em>welcome</em>
punishment for having committed such a crime. Moore then turns the
table and says that one should resist the “elitist and
condescending” temptation to withhold that judgment from others
(ibid.: 148).</p>

<p>This is a rhetorically powerful move, but at the end of the day, it
is a question begging one. It presupposes that guilt and the desire to
be punished is appropriate. But why accept that, rather than the view
that they are just an internalization of a morally indefensible
reaction to wrongdoing, or, as Nietzsche (1887: 60) put it, “bad
conscience, … the will to self-violation”. Consider what
Jeffrie Murphy (2007: 18) said, as a mature philosopher, looking back
on his own efforts to justify retributivism:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[M]y enthusiasm for settling scores and restoring balance through
retributive justice may in part have been extensions of what Nietzsche
called ‘a soul that squints’—the soul of a
shopkeeper or an accountant. If I had been a kinder person, a less
angry person, a person of more generous spirit and greatness of soul,
would robust retributivism have charmed me to the degree that it at
one time did? I suspect not.</p></blockquote>

<p>The point is not to say that this first justificatory strategy
fails. It is to say that it does not succeed on its own. It needs to
be supplemented by a theoretical justification for punitive harsh
treatment that ties it to a more general set of principles of justice.
Only in this way can one feel confident that retributive intuitions
are a form of insight into retributive justice, rather than the
crabbed judgments of a squinty soul.</p>

<h3><a id="FaiFreRid">5.2 Fairness and free riding</a></h3>

<p>Arguably the most popular theoretical framework for justifying
retributivism in the past fifty years or so has been Herbert Morris's
(1968) appeal to fairness. The idea is that it is to our mutual
benefit to live in society, and that to be in society, we have to
accept certain limits on our behavior. </p><blockquote><p> If a person
fails to exercise self-restraint even though he might have… he
renounces a burden which others have voluntarily assumed and thus
gains an advantage which others, who have restrained themselves, do
not possess. (ibid.: 33)</p></blockquote>

<p>His unfair advantage should be erased by “exacting the
debt” (ibid.: 34). This is done with harsh treatment.</p>

<p>Though influential, the problems with this account are serious.
First, it is unclear that criminals have advantages that others have
forsaken. Suppose someone murders another in a moment of anger,
triggered by a minor offense. Does he get the “advantage”
of getting to express his anger? What if most people feel they can
express their anger sufficiently in such situations by expressing it
in words? Then it seems that the only advantage he has is being able
to express his anger violently. But if most people do not, at least
not upon reflection, wish to do that sort of thing, then he is not
renouncing a burden that others too wish to renounce.</p>

<p>Even if there is some sense in which he gains an advantage over
others, such as the advantage of being free to use violence, what
would then be the proper measure of bringing him back in line? To see
the problem, compare how “far ahead” such a murderer is
likely to get to the advantages someone might get by economic
fraud. Fraud may produce a much greater advantage, but we normally
think that violence is the greater crime. (Davis 1993 challenges this
framing of the advantage gained, suggesting the right test is the
value a crime would find at an auction of licenses to commit crimes;
Shafer-Landau 1996: 303 rejects this solution as equally
implausible.)</p>

<p>More problematically yet, it seems to be fundamentally missing the
point to say that the crime of, for example, murder is, at bottom,
free riding rather than unjustly killing another. (For these and
related criticisms, see Braithwaite &amp; Pettit 1990: 158–159;
Dolinko 1991: 545–549; Murphy 2007: 13–14.)</p>

<p>An alternative interpretation of Morris's idea is that the relevant
benefit is the opportunity to live in a relatively secure state, and
the wrong is not the gaining of an extra benefit but the failure to
accept the burdens that, collectively, make that benefit
possible. Punishment then removes the benefit that the wrongdoer
cannot fairly lay claim to, having shirked the burden that it was his
due to carry (see Westen forthcoming). This interpretation avoids
first of the problems outlined above. But it still has difficulty
accounting for the thought that a crime such as murder is not
fundamentally about free riding. Moreover, it has difficulty
accounting for proportional punishment in a plausible way. Presumably,
the measure of a proportional punishment would be something like this:
the greater the shirking of one's duty to accept the burdens of
self-restraint, the larger should be one's punishment. But how do we
measure the degree of shirking? By the harm one causes or risks
causing, by the benefit one receives, or by the degree to which
respecting the burden shirked would have been burdensome? Only the
first corresponds with a normal retributive notion of punishment, but
this alternative reading seems to point to one of the latter two
meanings as the measure of unjust gain. In addition, this view seems
to imply that one who entered a secure society from some sort of
failed state, and who has not yet benefited from the secure state,
cannot be punished if he commits violent criminal acts in the secure
state. This is quite an odd implication, though one that a social
contract theorist might be willing to accept.</p>

<p>For another attempt to develop a better Morris-like view, making
the wrong the undermining of the conditions of trust, see Dimock 1997:
41.  For a criticism, see Korman 2003. For an attempt to build on
Morris's idea, translating the basic wrong into flouting legitimate,
democratic law, see Markel 2011.</p>

<h3><a id="VinVicDefWro">5.3 Vindicating victims by defeating wrongdoers</a></h3>

<p>Jean Hampton tried to improve upon the unfair advantage theory by
focusing on the idea that what wrongdoers (at least those who have
victims) do is an affront <em>to</em> the victim, not just to the
whole community. Her view is that punishment must somehow annul this
affront.  As she puts it:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If I have value equal to that of my assailant, then that must be
made manifest after I have been victimized. By victimizing me, the
wrongdoer has declared himself elevated with respect to me, acting as
a superior who is permitted to use me for his purposes. A false moral
claim has been made… The retributivist demands that the false
claim be corrected. The lord must be humbled to show that he isn't the
lord of the victim. … [R]etributive punishment is the defeat of
the wrongdoer at the hands of the victim (either directly or
indirectly through an agent of the victim's, e.g., the state) that
symbolizes the correct relative value of wrongdoer and victim. It is a
symbol that is conceptually required to reaffirm a victim's equal
worth in the face of a challenge to it. (Murphy and Hampton 1988:
125–126)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This theory too suffers some serious problems. First, why think
that a wrongful act seriously challenges the equal moral standing of
all? It may imply that the wrongdoer thinks of himself as above either
the law in general or his victim in particular. But he's simply
mistaken.  Unless there is a danger that people will believe he is
right, it is not clear why there is a pressing need to correct
him.</p>

<p>Second, even if the message is offensive in a way that calls for
correction, why isn't the solution simply to reaffirm the moral status
of the victim, to censor the wrongdoer, and perhaps to require the
wrongdoer to make compensation? The answer may be that “actions
speak louder than words”. Perhaps some punishment may then be
necessary to show that we really mean it when we say that he was
mistaken. But why wouldn't it be sufficient to inflict “the
punishment”—whatever that is—to reinforce the point?
It's unclear why the punishment should rise above some baseline-level,
in proportion with the gravity of the wrong, to show that “we
mean it”.</p>

<p>Third, the message of equality through turning the tables seems
peculiar. If the victim, with the help of others, gets to take her
turn being lord, it is not clear how that sends the message of
equality, rather than simply the message that <em>this</em> particular
wrongdoer lost in the competition to be “lord”.</p>

<p>Fourth, Hampton seems to have fallen into a trap that also was a
problem for Morris, namely substituting one wrong for another. The
wrong of being raped is not the <em>message</em> that the rapist
sends; it is the rape. (For variations on these criticisms, see
Dolinko 1991: 551–554; for Hampton's replies to her critics, see Hampton 1992.)</p>

<h3><a id="ComThe">5.4 Communication theories</a></h3>

<p>Antony Duff (2001 and 2011) offers a communication theory according
to which punishment is necessary to communicate censure for
wrongdoing.  It might be objected that his theory is too narrow to
provide a justificatory framework for retributivism generally, because
it is framed as a theory for <em>legal</em> punishment, meted out by a
state that governs a community of equal citizens. (The same applies to
the similar theory developed by Markel 2011.) But arguably it could be
extended to any community.</p>

<p>Putting that issue aside, the main question is whether the theory
can account for harsh treatment. As Duff raises the issue:</p>

<blockquote><p>Censure can … be communicated by
‘hard treatment’ punishments …—by
imprisonment, by compulsory community service, by fines and the like,
which are burdensome independently of their censorial meaning…:
but why should we choose such methods of communication, rather than
methods that do not involve hard treatment? (Duff 2013)</p></blockquote>

<p>One answer he gives is that:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[P]enal hard treatment [is] an essential aspect of the enterprise
of moral communication itself. Punishment, on this view, should aim
not merely to communicate censure to the offender, but to persuade the
offender to recognize and repent the wrong he has done, … and
to make apologetic reparation to those whom he wronged. [The] hard
treatment aspects [of his punishment], the burden it imposes on him,
should serve both to assist the process of repentance and reform, by
focusing his attention on his crime and its implications, and as a way
of making the apologetic reparation that he
owes. (ibid.)</p></blockquote>

<p>The problem, however, as Duff is well aware, is that it is not
clear why “hard treatment [is] a <em>necessary</em> aspect of a
communicative enterprise” (ibid., emphasis added). One might
think it is enough if harsh treatment <em>can</em> constitute an
important part of communicating to both the wrongdoer and the rest of
the community the censure that the wrongdoer deserves. The worry,
however, is that it may not suffice to say that harsh treatment is one
possible method of communicating censure. Given the normal moral
presumptions against imposing suffering on others, it may be necessary
to show that without suffering censure <em>cannot</em> be fully or
properly communicated.</p>

<p>That may be a particularly difficult thing to show, given that a
wrongdoer might voluntarily repent, reform and make reparations,
without the help of any punishment. Duff can try to take that into
account by saying that certain formalities in punishment, including
both censure and the taking on of burdens beyond those of making
material reparations, are necessary to repair the social damage done
by a crime. The question then is whether this doesn't beg the question
in favor of a sort of retributive impulse that seeks to see the
wrongdoer suffer before declaring that society and the wrongdoer are
reconciled.</p>

<p>Finally, it is peculiar to say that an apology can be forced and at
the same time be both meaningful to the hearer and respectful of the
speaker (von Hirsch &amp; Ashworth 2005: 94).</p>

<h2><a id="Con">6. Conclusion:</a></h2>

<p>Retributive justice has a deep grip on the punitive intuitions of
most people. Nevertheless, it has been subject to wide-ranging
criticism. Arguably the two most telling criticisms are (1) that its
proportionality constraint cannot be met without sacrificing intuitive
plausibility, and (2) that theoretical accounts of why wrongdoers
positively deserve harsh treatment are inadequate.</p>

<p>If the second of these criticisms is correct, then retributive
justice provides an incomplete theory of punishment, one that at most
explains why wrongdoers deserve censure and forfeit the
right <em>not</em> to be punished up to some proportional limit. To
justify actually inflicting harsh treatment, it may be necessary to
appeal to other explanations of (1) why harsh treatment is
instrumentally valuable, and (2) why harsh treatment is consistent
with respect for the wrongdoer.</p>

<p>This second prong may lead back, however, to a search for a better
justification for retributivism. This is because the most plausible
alternatives seem unable to account for it. They may seem to come
close if they invoke something like institutional desert to replace
moral desert. They can then hold, roughly, that a wrongdoer cannot
reasonably complain that institutions that threaten proportional
punishment if he does wrong, and then follow through on the threat if
he is duly convicted of wrongdoing, treat him unjustly (Quinn 1985;
Hill 1999; Finkelstein 2004; Bedau and Kelly 2010: §4). Surely
there is utility in having such institutions, and a person should have
a fair chance to avoid punishment—with the rare exception of
false convictions—simply by avoiding wrongdoing. Nevertheless,
this sort of justification of <em>legal</em> or <em>institutional</em>
desert cannot straightforwardly explain the proportionality limit. For
that the idea of retributive justice may be essential.</p>

<p>In other words, even if (a) there is utility in threatening people
with punishment if they choose to do wrong, (b) people have a fair
chance to avoid punishment by choosing not to do wrong, and (c) those
who choose to do wrong deserve punishment within some institutional
framework, it is not clear how an institutional account can come up
with the restriction that only proportional punishment may be
threatened.</p>

<p>This limitation to proportional punishment is central to
retributivism. The negative desert claim holds that only that much
punishment may be inflicted, and the positive desert claim holds that
that much punishment, but no more,
is <em>morally</em> <em>deserved</em> and in that sense respectful of
the wrongdoer. Thus unless one is willing to give up on the idea that
morality imposes a proportionality limit and on the importance of
positive moral desert for justifying punishment up to that point as
respectful of the individual—both intuitively difficult to give
up—there is reason to continue to take notion of retributive
justice, and the project of justifying it, seriously.</p>
