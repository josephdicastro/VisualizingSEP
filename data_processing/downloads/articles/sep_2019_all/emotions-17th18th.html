<h1>17th and 18th Century Theories of Emotions</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Thu May 25, 2006; substantive revision Fri Oct 15, 2010</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>

Early modern philosophy in Europe and Great Britain is awash with
discussions of the emotions: they figure not only in philosophical
psychology and related fields, but also in theories of
epistemic method, metaphysics, ethics, political theory and practical
reasoning in general. Moreover, interest in the emotions links
philosophy with work in other, sometimes unexpected areas, such as
medicine, art, literature, and practical guides on everything from
child-rearing to the treatment of subordinates. Because of the breadth
of the topic, this article can offer only an overview, but perhaps it
will be enough to give some idea how philosophically rich and
challenging the conception of the emotions was in this period. Most
attention will be devoted to the familiar figures of early modern
philosophy and how they conceived of the emotions as valuable, even
indispensable aspects of embodied human life, which were largely
constitutive of the self and identity that matter to us
practically.</p>

<p>

A word of caution is in order: there is a plethora of source material,
and this entry is offered as a survey for organizing that
material. Alas, much worthy material must be excluded here. This
article and its supplements are designed for readers browsing for
specific information, as well as those hardy souls who may wish to
read it straight through. The main document offers a thematic overview
of early modern discussions of the emotions. Separate links lead to
documents devoted to the pre-history of the topic, as well as to some
of the most important individual figures in early modern
philosophy.</p>

<h3><a name="DifApp">1.1 Difficulties of Approach:</a></h3> 

<p>

Even recognizing some early modern writings on the emotions for what
they are is no easy task. In part, this is due to diverging and
rapidly changing vocabularies for talking about the
emotions. Seventeenth century philosophers favored talk of
‘passion’ and ‘affect,’ while their eighteenth
century counterparts made increasing use of ‘sentiment.’
None of these terms (or their French and Latin cognates) carried the
meaning they now do or that ‘emotion’ has come to bear
(which did not have a primarily psychological sense until the nineteenth
century). It is also easy to overlook the role early modern philosophy
gives to ‘calm’ emotions, if we concentrate on the current
notion of passions as violent, turbulent and overwhelming. In general,
early modern philosophers tended to prefer their emotions calm, but
took turbulence to mark only certain kinds of passions. Another
difficulty arises from the seemingly ambivalent nature early modern
philosophers granted to the emotions. ‘Passion,’ in
particular, is connected with a kind of receptivity, but how the
passions are receptive and what they are receptive to tend to cross
over various comfortable divisions taken to mark early modern
philosophy: mind and body; perception and will; reason, judgment and
desire; occurrent consciousness and confused dispositions;
representations and presentations; private and social; nature and
convention; and even what is internal and what external to
subjectivity.</p>

<h3><a name="PhiBac">1.2 Philosophical Background</a></h3> 

<p>

Early modern discussions of the emotions are deeply indebted to
earlier sources.  Aristotle was particularly important (much more so
than Plato), influencing early modern theories both directly and
through Stoic, medical, Ciceronian, and Scholastic approaches
(especially that of Aquinas). Stoicism, likewise, was transmitted both
from Latin authors and from the neo-Stoic revival of the
16<sup>th</sup> century (represented, e.g., by Justus Lipsius, and in
some moods, Montaigne).  As in other areas of philosophy, however,
those sources met a mixed reception. Aristotle's classification
of the faculties of the soul and his location of the emotions among
the appetites of the sensitive part remained commonplaces, as did
Aquinas's further distinction between the irascible and
concupiscible passions. But they were also soundly rejected by some of
the most famous philosophers, starting with Descartes. Similarly, even
those thinkers who seem to owe the most to Stoicism (i.e., Descartes
and Spinoza) explicitly criticized certain of its doctrines, including
the view that the passions are erroneous judgments. Different sorts of
criticism proceeded from thinkers such as Pascal and Malebranche who
borrowed from Augustine a sense of human insufficiency for virtue and
happiness that put them at odds with Stoic, Skeptical and Epicurean
ideals of the autonomous life of the sage. And many aspects of the
systematic treatments of Aquinas and later Scholastic authors were
both continued and attacked, often by the same authors.</p>

<p>

Other ancient sources were also important, even when they were subject
to less discussion or criticism. The theory of the humors and animal
spirits of the Hippocratic and Galenist medical traditions offered
much of the basic vocabulary for early modern discussions of the
physiology of the emotions. Rhetorical works, such as those by
Aristotle and Cicero, provided a great deal of material for
taxonomizing and manipulating the emotions. (Indeed, some of the
distinctive early modern practice of generating long lists of
emotions, as well as many of the forms of classification, can be
traced to these sources.) Popular treatises, such as those by Juan
Luis Vives, were sometimes discussed openly. And there were important
discussions of particular emotions in Renaissance works, such as the
treatment of love and melancholy by the Florentine humanists, or that
of “glory” [<em>gloria</em>] by Machiavelli and
Montaigne. These sources overlap in ways that are not always
consistent and can be difficult to trace: for instance, we find
Spinoza probably paraphrasing a passage from Montaigne (III Def of the
Affects XLIV), where Montaigne criticizes Cicero's ambitions for
“glory” by directly quoting the Latin author (Montaigne,
1958, 187) – all without anything like citation of sources.</p>

<p>

The very vocabulary available to early modern theorists is marked by
their historical legacy. The terms ‘passion,’
‘perturbation,’ and ‘affect’ are all rooted in
choices made by Latin authors such as Augustine, Cicero and Seneca for
translating the Greek <em>pathos</em> used by Aristotle. In contrast,
‘sentiment,’ which came to be used with increasing
frequency by eighteenth century British and French authors, seems
distinctively modern. Debates about whether to classify emotions among
appetites, judgments, or volitions originated in the models of
Aristotle, the Stoics and Augustine, although counting them among
perceptions may constitute a somewhat novel approach. Early modern
associations between the emotions and the body also owed an enormous
amount to ancient and medieval sources, as did the connection between
emotions and motives for action. Such connections often underlay the
long-running debate inherited by the early moderns about the
epistemic, eudaimonistic and ethical value of the emotions, a central
issue of which is the degree to which we can govern our
emotions. Although the evaluations of pre-modern theorists diverged
enormously, there was a generally positive view of pleasurable
emotions (although they were often classified separately from other
passions). This is a view shared by many seventeenth and
eighteenth-century philosophers, who often played up the holistic
functionality of emotions. Even so, the early moderns seem to have
inherited a strong sense of the value of various forms of emotional
tranquility – something worth bearing in mind for understanding
the changing uses of ‘passion.’</p>

<h2><a name="ConEarModThePas">2. The Context of Early Modern Theories of the Passions</a></h2>

<h3><a name="ChaVoc">2.1 Changing Vocabulary</a></h3>

<p>

Every philosopher of the early modern period developed distinctive
terms of art for discussing the emotions. Still, some vocabulary was
general currency. The most common term for describing the emotions in
the seventeenth century was undoubtedly ‘passion,’ perhaps
because of the influence of Descartes's <em>Passions of the Soul</em>
(1649), perhaps because of a general tendency to see the emotions as
receptive, passive states. It was not the only term used:
‘affect’ and ‘sentiment’ also appeared, as did
‘perturbation,’ or ‘emotion,’ although these
are not usually terms of art, and ‘emotion’ usually meant
little more than ‘motion.’ The choice of terminology often
marked intellectual allegiances: Descartes saw himself as introducing
a new theory, in which “passions” are a species of
perception, while Spinoza's “affects” signaled his debt to
Stoic ethics, as well as distinctive features of his metaphysics. In
his <em>Pensées</em> (1670), Pascal introduced
“feelings” or “sentiments”
[<em>sentiment</em>], sometimes contrasting them with the corrupted
passions and marking his neo-Augustinian understanding of love (see
<em>Pensées</em> 680, 531).</p>

<p>

‘Sentiment’ was a particularly popular term in British
philosophy of the eighteenth century, as was ‘affection.’
These terms were sometimes used interchangeably with and sometimes in
contrast to ‘passions.’ In the latter case,
‘sentiments’ or ‘affections’ specified calm
emotions, perhaps tempered by reflection or refined in some other way;
whereas, ‘passion’ indicated a raw, uncorrected emotion,
which may be ‘violent’ in the sense of either agitating
us, or being unresponsive to reason. Bernard Mandeville, for instance,
spoke of humans as “a compound of passions” in
his <em>Fable of the Bees</em> (1714), emphasizing that our emotions
are disorganized, fleeting and not subject to correction. Hume, in
contrast, often used “sentiment” for the class of refined
and reflective emotions that are the basis for our moral and aesthetic
judgments. The contrast between these terms is not confined to
philosophy. Sarah Fielding's novel <em>The Adventures of David
Simple</em>, first published in 1744 and wildly popular in its day,
frequently used “passions” to describe forceful,
idiosyncratic emotions and desires, particularly those that mark the
personality of a character, while reserving “sentiment”
for calmer, shared affects and judgments. By 1762, Henry Home, Lord
Kames, termed “every thought prompted by a passion” a
“sentiment” (<i>Elements of Criticism</i>,
chap. xvi).  </p>

<p>

The developments in vocabulary took place against a background of
shared associations and assumptions about the emotions.  Emotions were
commonly connected with passivity, and what lay outside of our direct
control. They were also associated with various forms of perception,
even as they were sometimes granted an intentional and judgment-like
structure. Emotions were typically assumed to have directions and to
provide motives for action. Given this cluster, philosophers often
emphasized one or another of the features associated with the
emotions. Although no philosophical questions were settled by word
choice alone, the preferred vocabulary can reveal much about
the choice of emphasis.</p>

<p>

Still, it is worth bearing in mind that the available vocabulary may
not fully capture what we now think of as emotion, affect, or
mood. Sometimes it didn't even capture the range of affective states
recognized by early modern philosophers. Descartes, for instance,
wrote of “internal” or “intellectual”
emotions, which are not passions proper, but certainly have affective
components, as well as being causally intertwined with the true
passions. Spinoza distinguished “affects” from various
emotions and moods that for him indicated “strength of
mind,” while reserving a special status for
“beatitude.” On the other hand, ‘passion’
didn't even begin to get its contemporary flavor of violent, often
sexually-charged emotions until the middle of the eighteenth century
(at the earliest), and so what counted as a passion can sometimes come
as a surprise. Hobbes included “competition” and
“glory” among his passions, and many favorite early modern
passions are quite placid, such as ‘wonder,’ or ‘the
love of truth.’ There was also a whole special vocabulary for
affective states that were recognized by various medical traditions,
ranging from ‘splenetic humour’ to general
‘melancholy.’</p>

<h3><a name="Tax">2.2 Taxonomies</a></h3>

<p>

Seventeenth-century accounts are rife with long inventories of
emotions, although the list-making urge may have dampened a bit by the
eighteenth century, or at least the pretensions to exhaustive
cataloguing. Compared to his contemporaries, Descartes seems temperate
with a docket of a mere six simple passions, although he also
constructed a host of complex ones out of these six. Hobbes offered a
list of about thirty in the <em>Leviathan</em> (1651), and more than
twenty-five in The <em>Elements of Law</em> (ms. 1640). The head count
for Spinoza is a bit trickier to determine, but the third book of
his <em>Ethics</em> (ms. 1675) defines at least forty affects. Locke's
short discussion in Book II, chap. XX of the <em>Essay Concerning
Human Understanding</em> (1690) treats eleven; whereas
Hume's <i>Treatise</i> and “Dissertation on the Passions” (1757)
described about ten broad passions, as well as numerous sub-species
and adjuncts, even before turning to the moral or aesthetic
sentiments. This tendency is not simply found among the great early
modern systems-builders. In the seventeenth century in particular,
just about everybody (and their maiden aunt and bachelor uncle) seems
to have joined in the hunt for new and distinctive lists of
emotions. For instance, large portions of Thomas Wright's <em>The
Passions of the Mind In General</em> (1604) and Nicholas Coeffeteau's
<em>Tableau des passions humaines, de leurs causes et leurs
effets</em> (ms. 1621) are devoted to such lists. A short play of
1630, <i>Pathomachia; or the Battel of Affections</i>, even makes
proper taxonomy the motor of what little drama it possesses.</p>

<p>

The proliferation of lists can be at least partly explained by the
proliferation of schemes of classification. Again, the attention to
principles of classification is most marked in the seventeenth-century
theorists, in part because of the taxonomic connections they saw
between the treatment of the passions and their scientific ambitions
in other areas, and in part because of the attacks launched against
the systems of previous, e.g., scholastic, thinkers.  Descartes, for
instance, singled out Aquinas's division of the passions into the
concupiscible and irascible for express and explicit criticism. But
making his case required constructing an alternative classification
more in accord with his reformist account of the soul and its
faculties. Despite the efforts of those on the cutting edge of passion
theory, however, the Aquinian distinction remained a commonplace bit
of early modern folk psychology (see Wright, Burton, even Henry
More). Then too, many early modern authors borrowed, and borrowed
heavily, from Stoic and Thomist classifications. Hobbes and Locke, for
instance, both drew from Aquinas's enumeration of eleven passions, as
did Jacques Bossuet in
<em>Traité de la connaissance de Dieu et de soi-même</em>
(ms.  after 1670; see Gardiner 1970, 205).</p>

<p>

Many time-honored principles of classification clearly decreased in
importance during the early modern period. In particular, the
possibility of psychic conflict, especially that which could generate
competing motives for action, had been a common device in ancient and
medieval theories for distinguishing among passions, kinds of
passions, and faculties of the soul in general. This principle played
some role for Descartes in distinguishing between movements coming
from the body and those originating in the soul, and it was deployed
sporadically by other theorists. But the practice died out over the
course of the two centuries, as theorists came to recognize the
possibility that a single, or similar, emotional source might produce
conflicting motions or tendencies, both in the individual and across
societies. Indeed, some emotions were characterized exactly by such
conflict or turbulence. Descartes's description of regret is one such
example. A somewhat happier case is the emotions generated by tragedy,
as explained by philosophers from Malebranche to Hume.</p>

<p>

Perhaps the most basic division in play is evaluative, i.e., whether
the emotion is good or bad. This was hardly an innovation. But early
modern philosophers came to understand that division in two different
ways – either an emotion is directed at good or evil as an
object, or the emotion itself is affectively good or bad, pleasurable
or painful. Many distinctively modern theories subsumed the former
under the latter: both the naturalistic theories of Hobbes and
Spinoza, on the one hand, and the moral sense theories of Hutcheson
and Hume, on the other, held that we project the value of the object
from the affective quality of the emotion, although Hume allows for
complications in how we experience the valences of a passion as
belonging to self or other, using such mechanisms as sympathy and
comparison. Some authors also identified neutral emotions:
‘wonder’ is a common example, deriving largely from
Descartes, although anticipated in Sir Kenelme Digby's <i>Two
Treatises</i> (1644).</p>

<p>

Some philosophers singled out a particular passion, or group of
passions, to head off their taxonomies. In rather different ways, that
was the role of wonder for Descartes, and of glory for
Hobbes. Malebranche took there to be an irreducible element of love in
every passion. An even more common organizing device was to divide the
passions into simple and complex. Not only did this impose a
manageable order on the many recognized passions, it allowed
explanation to be focused on the simplest cases, with the expectation
that other emotions would fall into line, either as compounds,
offspring, or species of the simples. The simple passions themselves
were organized into contrasting groups, based on their evaluative
character. Schemes of this kind can be found in Descartes,
Malebranche, Spinoza, Thomas Wright, and to a lesser extent, Hume.</p>

<p>

Many other forms of classification were tied closely to the particular
interests of individual authors. This is particularly the case with
those eighteenth-century British authors who argued against Hobbes
and Mandeville that the very
possibility of morality requires that we be capable of genuinely
benevolent emotions. For this reason, distinctions between
self-directed and other-directed emotions and between anti-social and
sociable emotions were a common point of organization and contention.
Similar concerns also generated a distinction between idiosyncratic
affects and emotions that could be cultivated to be broadly shared; in
particular, emotions were often divided into the raw and immediate and
those that involve an element of reflection. This distinction lent
itself also to those philosophers concerned with the historical and
social development of humans, as evident in many works of
Rousseau. For instance, the <em>Discourse on the Origin of
Inequality</em> (1755) presents a kind of natural history tracing the
genesis of many emotions through changes in social structure; works
such as <em>Emile</em> (1762), <em>La Nouvelle Heloise</em> (1761),
and the <em>Confessions</em> (1782) treat the affective maturation and
socialization of individuals, as well as the management and effects of
the emotions. But for all his genealogical concerns, Rousseau, and
indeed many other eighteenth-century authors, showed a good deal less
interest in taxonomizing the emotions according to principled systems
than did their predecessors.</p>

<h3><a name="PhiIssTheEmo">2.3 Philosophical Issues in Theories of the Emotions</a></h3>

<p>

Few areas of early modern philosophy remained untouched by at least
some theory of the emotions. What follows is simply a cursory overview
of some issues of general interest. But since early modern
understandings of the emotions often made unexpected connections
between diverse areas of philosophy, we may find that investigation
reshapes our map of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century philosophy.
Certainly, the understanding of the emotions produced in one area of
philosophy was not isolated from their treatment in other areas.</p>

<p>

That is true of how the emotions figured in much of
seventeenth-century metaphysics. Locating the emotions within their
distinctive ontologies was an important, but sometimes challenging
task for philosophers such as Descartes, Malebranche, and Spinoza. In
doing so, they often tapped a broad metaphysical distinction between
the active and the passive, which sometimes supported, and sometimes
undermined those ontologies (see James 1997). The emotions also inform
various approaches to the relation between mind and body, whether
Descartes's dualism, Hobbes's materialism, Spinoza's parallelism, or
those of philosophers who refused to take a stand on the
issue. Indeed, attempts to accommodate the emotions sometimes led to
novel and intricate pictures of the relations between soul and body:
Walter Charleton's <em>Natural History of the Passions</em> (1674,
2<sup>nd</sup> ed., 1701), for instance, posits two souls, one that is
rational and immaterial and one that is sensitive and extended,
mediating between the rational soul and the body. The emotions were
also important in accounts of personal identity, whether that is
understood ontologically in the cases of Descartes and Spinoza, or
psychologically in the case of Hume.</p>

<p>

Theories of the emotions played a role – often a pivotal one
– in the important early modern debates about causation and the
proper forms of explanation. As part of their embrace of the new
science, many seventeenth century philosophers considered the emotions
to be susceptible, at least in part, to mechanical
explanation. Although Descartes offered a teleological defense of our
propensities to experience emotions, his account of their
physiological underpinnings is mechanistic. Malebranche too considered
the functions of the emotions and the way in which that functioning
has been corrupted, but emphasized that the emotions are communicated
through strictly mechanical operations. Hobbes and Spinoza went yet
further, rejecting any talk of final causation in order to treat the
behavior of the emotions as completely continuous with bodily
movements, and indeed reducing the appearance of goal-driven behavior
to the motions of the passions. In contrast, Shaftesbury criticized
Locke and Descartes for failing to appreciate the natural teleology of
our emotional constitution, and dismissed all physiological accounts
as beside the point. Many other British philosophers showed less
interest in the metaphysics of explanation and more in defending an
empiricist account of the origins of our ideas. But the rejection of
innate ideas often drove them to focus explanations of the emotions on
the hydraulics by which pains and pleasures push our ideas. This
naturalistic approach was particularly marked in eighteenth-century
associationist psychology, often hand in hand with
‘Newtonian’ ambitions to produce a “science of
man:” examples include Hume's <em>Treatise of Human Nature</em>
(1739-40), and such lesser-known works as David Hartley's
<em>Observations on Man, his Frame, his Duty, and his
Expectations</em> (1749) and an anonymous tract of 1741, <em>An
Enquiry into the Origin of Human Appetites and Affections, Showing How
Each Arises from Association: for the use of young gentlemen at the
universities</em> (cited in Gardiner 1970, 221), as well as in the
works of Condillac.</p>

<p>

As we might expect, emotions loomed large in the philosophical
psychology of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.  One question
addressed by almost every philosopher was where to locate the emotions
in our psychological equipment. Following Descartes, seventeenth
century philosophers tended to subsume the emotions under
perception. ‘Perception’ must be broadly understood,
however; what is crucial is that the emotions involve the exercise of
a receptive faculty, especially insofar as their causes lie in the
body, or more generally, outside of the receptive animal.  Spinoza,
admittedly, allowed that we may be adequate causes of some of our
affects, and took all our emotions to involve judgments. But on his
view, judgments are not different in kind from perceptions, although
their epistemic status is determined by whether we are active and
adequate or merely passive, inadequate causes of our perceptions.
Descartes, too, attributed an at least proto-propositional,
representative structure to emotions. This structure, however, is
independent of and prior to the volitions of assent or denial that
generate real judgment. The emotions thus remain among the perceptions
belonging to the intellect, although they provide material for
judgment. Nonetheless, since perceptions were typically granted a
complex representational and intentional structure, most seventeenth
century authors connected them closely with judgments.</p>

<p>

Eighteenth century theorists, on the other hand, often identified
emotions specifically with <i>sense</i>-perceptions. Indeed, Hutcheson
multiplied the number of our sense-faculties to accommodate the wide
variety of affects he recognizes. Many philosophers also supposed a
haptic aspect to emotions, approaching them as a variety of
feeling. Most notably, Hume maintained that a
distinctive feature of the passions and sentiments is that they touch,
or strike upon the mind more forcibly than other
perceptions.</p>

<p>

More generally, eighteenth-century theories shift gradually from
characterizing emotions primarily by how they represent their
intentional contents to considering their qualitative phenomenology,
the special ‘feel’ of the emotions. Hume, for one,
stressed that our passions are “simple and uniform
impressions” with characteristic affective qualities Still, this
is at most a change in emphasis, since many did allow that emotions
typically have some kind of object. Hume, in particular, attributed a
rather complicated content to the indirect passions that show a
“double relation of impressions and ideas.” But the
atomistic tendencies of British psychology following Locke spelled
difficulty for accounts of intentional content, and many philosophers
emphasized features of our emotions that are non-intentional.
Emotions still retained important connections to judgment, however,
since judgments themselves, especially moral and political ones, were
often considered simply expressions of sentiment.</p>

<p>

For all their disagreements about the nature of judgment, early modern
philosophers reached near-consensus in taking emotion to motivate our
practical and theoretical endeavors. Because they provide at least
some of the motives for action, the emotions were central to
investigations of our practical reasoning and to moral philosophy. In
particular, eighteenth-century spectator- and judgment-centered moral
theories gave the emotions a double role for our moral judgments:
insofar as they represent the enduring dispositions of character
expressed in actions, they are the objects of moral evaluations; but
they also generate the judgments themselves. In a somewhat different
vein, many philosophers took our emotions to be the engine driving our
theoretical reasoning: both wonder (for Descartes) and curiosity (for
Hume) perform this function. Indeed, almost any philosopher
investigating efficient causation in our psychology found an important
place for our emotions, whether Hobbes considering our internal
motions, or the associationist psychologists of the eighteenth
century.</p>

<p>

As crucial bits of our psychology, the emotions are also important to
epistemology. Here, though, the position of many early modern
philosophers has often been misunderstood, especially when it is
assumed that they oppose reason to the emotions, to the detriment of
the latter. (We might call this the ‘Mr. Spock’ gloss on
early modern philosophy.) It is true that many philosophers held that
the emotions can sometimes lead our reasoning astray, and they offer
various epistemic techniques to minimize this cognitive interference.
Malebranche, for instance, imbedded his account of the passions in the
reforming project of <em>The Search After Truth</em> (1674-5), and
many accounts of method, e.g., Arnauld's and Nicole's <em>Logic, or
the Art of Thinking</em> (1662), included an account of the emotions
as an indispensable part of their epistemic techniques. But none of
these accounts assumed that the emotions are inevitably disruptive
to our reason, however important it may be to temper them. Descartes
particularly emphasized the functionality of our passions, first for
practical, but also for theoretical reasoning, and suggested that
proper discipline should allow us to maximize the epistemic value of
the emotions. Malebranche and Spinoza were less sanguine about our
chances of doing so, but even Malebranche maintained that the passions
are functional in several respects. Hobbes, on the other hand, mounted
a number of contrasts between passions and the “common
measure” of reason. But these seem somewhat at odds with his
claims about the operation of the passions in driving mental activity.
Here it is worth considering Spinoza's account of the relation between
reason and the affects, for it offers a kind of
gloss on Hobbes. It is, Spinoza maintained, only our passive emotions
that can produce conflict with the dictates of our reason; our active
affects accord well with reason. Hume, of course, denied that it makes
any sense to speak of a conflict between reason and passion, when he
declared that reason not only is “but ought only to be”
the slave to the passions – a dictum that seems to apply to
theoretical as well as practical reason. Later eighteenth-century
philosophers developed the view that our reasoning faculties, and
particularly our language, are a historical development from our
emotions; this seems to have been the view of Condillac and
Rousseau.</p>

<p>

One of the most important contexts for understanding the epistemic
strengths and weaknesses attributed to the emotions lies in their
relation to the imagination. Accounts of what exactly this faculty is
changed dramatically from the seventeenth to the eighteenth centuries,
but in one way or another, the emotions were commonly understood to
interact closely with the imagination. On some views, the imagination
provides a conduit between the emotions and the body. Both pre-modern
and modern folk medicine held that experiencing strong emotions could
affect the imagination of a pregnant woman in such a way as to leave
marks on her fetus. Indeed, so close was the connection supposed to be
that simply imagining emotionally-fraught situations could mark the
development of the fetus, and there was a substantial literature of
eighteenth-century manuals instructing mothers-to-be on the proper
control of their affective states. (See Smith 2006 and Kukla 2005.)
Descartes made mention of such views, and more generally saw the
imagination as an important tool for managing the emotions: picturing
things in the imagination could have affective results, so
manipulating the imagination is an effective way of controlling our
emotions and their effects. The view taken of the interaction between
emotions and imagination changed with shifts in how the faculty of the
imagination – and the relation between mind and body in general
–were understood. Hume, for instance, considered the imagination
to be the faculty of composing, decomposing, and associating ideas, in
contrast to the impressions among which passions were
numbered. Nonetheless, there is still some role for the imagination in
producing and manipulating affects, and vice-versa. The imagination is
also a crucial mechanism in the social communication of the passions,
a topic considered by both Malebranche and Hume.</p>

<p>

The physiology of the emotions and their implications for medicine was
another important theme in early modern philosophy. (Here too the
imagination has a role to play.) Descartes considered the emotions
central to the treatment of both mental and bodily illness. In doing
so, he joined a long and popular medical tradition treating the
emotions, including Robert Burton's <em>Anatomy of Melancholy</em>
(1621) and William Falconer's <em>A Dissertation on the Influence of
the Passions upon the Disorders of the Body</em> (1788). Burton's work
was conservative, if eclectic, in its approach to
understanding the soul and using the machinery of humours and spirits
to explain emotion and temperament. But many other writers
borrowed piecemeal from the language of humours and spirits, sometimes
embedding it in new physiological accounts, sometimes simply using it
to describe various affects. Descartes and Malebranche, for instance,
spoke of the animal spirits, but also used such new tools as Harvey's
discovery of the circulation of the blood to explain the bodily
effects of emotions.</p>

<p>

The affective aspects of mental disorders are matters of particular
interest. Some of that interest may have been personal, since
‘melancholy’ was widely taken to be a special affliction
of the learned, a point that puts some of Hume's discussion of the
emotional effects of skepticism in context.  ‘Enthusiasm,’
particularly religious enthusiasm, also garnered a great deal of
attention, considered as a matter of excessive and contagious emotion
that could be based in bodily disorders. But since many philosophers
of the eighteenth century followed Shaftesbury in refusing to consider
the physiology of the emotions, they relegated the bodily causes,
components and effects to the attention of ‘anatomists,’
rather than of philosophers. More generally, the sort of humour-driven
approach to medicine and pathology that informed many
seventeenth-century accounts of the emotions declined among eighteenth
century philosophers.</p>

<p>

Some of the most important issues raised by the emotions in early
modern philosophy are practical, especially those concerning practical
reason, the pursuit of happiness and moral philosophy. As we have
seen, the emotions were generally seen as motivating. They are not
necessarily the only sources of motivation: Descartes and Malebranche
considered reason to offer motivations of its own, as did Pascal, who
also admitted other sources of motivation. But many other
philosophers, such as Hobbes, Hutcheson and Hume took the emotions to
be the driving source of our practical reason. None of them, however,
maintained that the emotions were immune to training and refinement,
and indeed all early modern philosophers took it as important for both
morality and happiness that we do train our emotions. The practical
philosophies offered by Descartes, Malebranche and Spinoza are
particularly concerned with the pursuit of happiness, which they
assume involves both managing and cultivating the emotions. This is
what Descartes called “pursuing virtue” and
Spinoza “freedom from bondage,” but they shared the view
that the emotions are crucial to the good life, conceived both
eudaimonistically and morally.</p>

<p>

The pursuit of happiness was also an issue for British philosophers
such as Shaftesbury and Hutcheson, although it sometimes paled next to
their interests in moral evaluation. Shaftesbury argued vehemently
that “virtue and interest coincide,” because he maintained
that happiness depends on a preponderance of pleasant affects, and the
emotions carrying moral worth are themselves pleasant. Yet he had to
argue the point, since he did not understand virtue primarily in terms
of individual flourishing. Hutcheson also considered how the passions
contribute or detract from our happiness. But Shaftesbury, Hutcheson
and Hume expended even more effort to explain how we make judgments of
moral worth, starting with the emotions issuing from our moral
senses. For it is only through our emotions that we can be responsive
to the moral qualities we evaluate. For this reason, they may all seem
committed to a ‘sentimentalist’ moral
philosophy. Hutcheson and Hume did indeed oppose the moral
‘rationalists,’ arguing that there is no independent
quality in actions or persons to which emotions are sensitive. But
their position presupposes a very particular understanding of the
nature of our senses and of the ontological status of the secondary
qualities to which they are receptive. In contrast, Shaftesbury, often
suggests both that there are moral and aesthetic qualities intrinsic
to the external world, and that we access those qualities through our
emotions. On this view, our emotions, at least when functioning as
they should, are simply our natural equipment for picking up salient
features of the world.</p>

<p>

Early modern philosophy held a special place for the emotions in its
political and social theory (see Kahn, Saccamano &amp; Coli,
2006). Indeed, there was a popular early modern genre of
‘how-to’ books about techniques for governing others by
managing their emotions. Likewise, a great deal of political
philosophy concerned the management of the emotions by social
institutions and authorities, with Hobbes and Mandeville being just
two of the most obvious examples. But there are also deeper issues
about what role the emotions might play in making social order
possible. Many philosophers held that the emotions facilitated social
interaction: Descartes suggested something of the sort in his analyses
of such passions as love and generosity.  Malebranche was even more
clearly committed to the view, holding that the communication of the
emotions is crucial to social organization, ranking and
cohesion. Hobbes and Spinoza, in contrast, found the grounds of much
interpersonal conflict in the emotions, and even diagnosed specific
emotions as inherently disruptive to social order, e.g., glory for
Hobbes. But by the same token, there are many passions that Hobbes
stated “incline us to peace,” and Spinoza allowed that
insofar as people agree in affects, they agree in nature.
Eighteenth-century philosophers tended to evaluate the social effects
of the emotions in terms of whether they were self- or other-directed,
with Shaftesbury and Hutcheson arguing against Mandeville that our
most natural emotions were other-directed. In his <i>Philosophical
Enquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful</i>
(1759), Edmund Burke distinguished between the passions directed at
self-preservation and those belonging to society, but spends the
lion's share of his time on the latter. The issue is somewhat more
complicated in Hume, but he does seem to take the development of our
emotions and their susceptibility to a standard of appropriateness to
be indispensable to many of the “artifices” that make
social life possible. A different twist is provided by Rousseau's
contrast between two kinds of self-directed affection, <em>amour de
soi</em> and <em>amour propre</em>, of which the former, but not the
latter seems consistent with compassion for others.</p>

<p>

The place of the emotions in early modern aesthetic theories deserves
a separate treatment. The representation of the emotions was
considered a proper object, sometimes <em>the</em> object, of
aesthetic criticism. It was also the subject of many practical manuals
in the arts; there is, for instance, an extensive seventeenth-century
literature stemming from discussions in the French Royal Academy of
Painting and Sculpture about how to depict facial expressions and
bodily gestures in ways that would allow the deciphering of emotional
states. Here the representation of the emotions serves both narrative
and didactic purposes.</p>

<p>

Another commonplace of early modern aesthetics was the importance of
exciting emotions in the audience for a work of art. This is a common
theme in musical aesthetics, which borrowed heavily from rhetorical
treatises. Baroque composers developed an entire theory of affects,
and of musical figures to express those affects, for just this
end. (See the <em>Grove Dictionary of Music</em>.) Another version of
this theme appears in philosophical discussions of tragedy; since it
is assumed that the dramatic depiction of emotions excites the same
emotions in the audience, tragic drama presents a bit of a puzzle. It
seems odd that we should enjoy the experience, and even enjoy it in
proportion to the distress it invokes. Malebranche, Hutcheson and Hume
are just a few to address this puzzle by developing accounts of the
meta-pleasures afforded to us by the exercise of our emotions.</p>

<p>

Eighteenth-century aesthetics moved away somewhat from the view that
the arts should carefully control our emotions, although the notion
that artworks both express and excite emotions remained.  Particularly
interesting in this regard is the development of the concept of the
sublime. As Burke explains it, the experience of the sublime
transgresses categories of pain and pleasure and explains much of our
response to dramatic tragedy. Here it seems that aesthetic, and other
distinctive experiences can produce emotions that are <em>sui
generis</em>, a view that gives aesthetics a particular importance for
any understanding of the emotions.</p>

<p>

Several of the most important discussions of the emotions in the early
modern period involved women, who sometimes raised specific concerns
relevant to their status as women. That is the case with Princess
Elisabeth of Bohemia, whose correspondence pushed Descartes to write
on the passions, while pursuing a lengthy discussion of the impact of
the emotions on health and reasoning and our ability to control
them. Elisabeth also seems to have inspired other writers on the
emotions, serving as the dedicatee for the <em>Treatise of the
Passions and Faculties of the Soul of Man</em> (1640) of Edward
Reynolds, the Bishop of Norwich. Both Mary Astell in <i>Letters
Concerning the Love of God</i> (1695) and Damaris Cudworth, Lady
Masham, in <i>Discourse Concerning the Love of God</i> (1696) took
issue with the Malebranchean account of love offered by John Norris,
albeit to very different degrees and from different approaches. Later
in the eighteenth century, Mary Wollstonecraft's criticisms of
Rousseau specifically addressed some of his views about emotional
development and the sexual division of labor in the sentimental
education of children. However, since some recent authors have turned
to early modern discussions to understand how the emotions can be
conceptually gendered, we should note that many women philosophers of
this period showed no particular interest in the emotions. It does not
seem to have been considered a special area of expertise for
women.</p>

<p>

Although early modern philosophy did not seem to associate concepts of
the emotions with gender just as we now do, there is still a great
deal of gender-baggage to investigate. Many authors took the position
that there were important sexual differences in the disposition to
feel specific emotions. Malebranche allowed that there are many such
differences, not just between the sexes, but for different ages,
fortunes and stations in life; indeed, it is differences between
individuals' “stations in life” that do the most work for
him in explaining variations in affective susceptibilities. Other
authors laid such variations at the doorstep of bodily composition,
especially the constitution of the brain, and took the relevant
differences to be especially and intrinsically marked between the
sexes (although they could also typify class and rank). In <em>Les
Characteres des Passions</em> (1648-62), Marin Cureau de la Chambre
discussed the effects that the liquid humours in the brain could have
on emotional temperament, taking it as an explanation of why some
people (women, as well as children and drunkards) cry more readily
than others.</p>

<p>

Some more distinctively gendered and more evaluatively loaded claims
about the emotions appeared in the eighteenth century, particularly in
aesthetic theory. Shaftesbury is a bit of a villain here, contrasting
true taste with the trivial sentiments of merely feminine taste. Some
authors even distinguished aesthetic qualities and emotions through
gendered contrasts, as when feminine beauty is opposed to the
masculine sublime (with, of course, the preference going to the
sublime). But despite such gendered accounts of particular emotions,
there seems little to suggest that early modern philosophy associated
emotion as such with the feminine.</p>

<h3>Acknowledgments</h3>

<p>

Initial work on these entries was supported by a fellowship from
Stanford Humanities Center during the academic year 2002-03, helped by
an able Undergraduate Research Fellow, Jason Rosensweig, who prepared
some bibliographic materials. I have also benefited from the research
assistance of Edwin Etieyibo in the summer of 2005, who cheerfully
took on many onerous tasks. Thanks also go to the editorial staff at
the Stanford Encyclopedia and to Doug Jesseph, who was a particularly
patient and hard-working subject editor. Much of the work for the
updated version of 2010 was done by John Kardosh, who combed through
the entire entry, catching mistakes and offering insightful comments;
I thank him and the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of
Canada, which provided support.</p>
