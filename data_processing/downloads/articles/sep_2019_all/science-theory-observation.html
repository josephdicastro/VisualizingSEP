<h1>Theory and Observation in Science</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Tue Jan 6, 2009; substantive revision Tue Mar 28, 2017</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
Scientists obtain a great deal of the evidence they use by observing
natural and experimentally generated objects and effects. Much of the
standard philosophical literature on this subject comes from
20<sup>th</sup> century logical empiricists, their followers, and
critics who embraced their issues and accepted some of their
assumptions even as they objected to specific views. Their discussions
of observational evidence tend to focus on epistemological questions
about its role in theory testing. This entry follows their lead even
though observational evidence also plays important and philosophically
interesting roles in other areas including scientific discovery, the
development of experimental tools and techniques, and the application
of scientific theories to practical problems.</p>

<p>
The issues that get the most attention in the standard philosophical
literature on observation and theory have to do with the distinction
between observables and unobservables, the form and content of
observation reports, and the epistemic bearing of observational
evidence on theories it is used to evaluate. This entry discusses
these topics under the following headings:</p>

<h2><a name="Int">1. Introduction</a></h2>

<p>
Reasoning from observations has been important to scientific practice
at least since the time of Aristotle who mentions a number of sources
of observational evidence including animal dissection (Aristotle(a)
763a/30–b/15, Aristotle(b) 511b/20–25). But philosophers
didn’t talk about observation as extensively, in as much detail, or in
the way we have become accustomed to, until the 20<sup>th</sup>
century when logical empiricists transformed philosophical thinking
about it.</p>

<p>
The first transformation was accomplished by ignoring the implications
of a long standing distinction between observing and experimenting. To
experiment is to isolate, prepare, and manipulate things in hopes of
producing epistemically useful evidence. It had been customary to
think of observing as noticing and attending to interesting details of
things perceived under more or less natural conditions, or by
extension, things perceived during the course of an experiment. To
look at a berry on a vine and attend to its color and shape would be
to observe it. To extract its juice and apply reagents to test for the
presence of copper compounds would be to perform an experiment.
Contrivance and manipulation influence epistemically significant
features of observable experimental results to such an extent that
epistemologists ignore them at their peril. Robert Boyle (1661), John
Herschell (1830), Bruno Latour and Steve Woolgar (1979), Ian Hacking
(1983), Harry Collins (1985) Allan Franklin (1986), Peter Galison
(1987), Jim Bogen and Jim Woodward (1988), and Hans-Jörg
Rheinberger(1997), are some of the philosophers and philosophically
minded scientists, historians, and sociologists of science who gave
serious consideration to the distinction between observing and
experimenting. The logical empiricists tended to ignore it.</p>

<p>
A second transformation, characteristic of the linguistic turn in
philosophy, was to shift attention away from things observed in
natural or experimental settings and concentrate instead on the logic
of observation reports. The shift developed from the assumption that a
scientific theory is a system of sentences or sentence like structures
(propositions, statements, claims, and so on) to be tested by
comparison to observational evidence. Secondly it was assumed that the
comparisons must be understood in terms of inferential relations. If
inferential relations hold only between sentence like structures, it
follows that theories must be tested, not against observations or
things observed, but against sentences, propositions, etc. used to
report observations. (Hempel 1935, 50–51. Schlick 1935)</p>

<p>
Friends of this line of thought theorized about the syntax, semantics,
and pragmatics of observation sentences, and inferential connections
between observation and theoretical sentences. In doing so they hoped
to articulate and explain the authoritativeness widely conceded to the
best natural, social and behavioral scientific theories. Some
pronouncements from astrologers, medical quacks, and other pseudo
scientists gain wide acceptance, as do those of religious leaders who
rest their cases on faith or personal revelation, and rulers and
governmental officials who use their political power to secure assent.
But such claims do not enjoy the kind of credibility that scientific
theories can attain. The logical empiricists tried to account for this
by appeal to the objectivity and accessibility of observation reports,
and the logic of theory testing.</p>

<p>
Part of what they meant by calling observational evidence objective
was that cultural and ethnic factors have no bearing on what can
validly be inferred about the merits of a theory from observation
reports. So conceived, objectivity was important to the logical
empiricists’ criticism of the Nazi idea that Jews and Aryans have
fundamentally different thought processes such that physical theories
suitable for Einstein and his kind should not be inflicted on German
students. In response to this rationale for ethnic and cultural
purging of the German educational system the logical empiricists
argued that because of its objectivity, observational evidence, rather
than ethnic and cultual factors should be used to evaluate scientific
theories.(Galison 1990). Less dramatically, the efforts working
scientists put into producing objective evidence attest to the
importance they attach to objectivity. Furthermore it is possible, in
principle at least, to make observation reports and the reasoning used
to draw conclusions from them available for public scrutiny. If
observational evidence is objective in this sense , it can provide
people with what they need to decide for themselves which theories to
accept without having to rely unquestioningly on authorities.</p>

<p>
Francis Bacon argued long ago that the best way to discover things
about nature is to use experiences (his term for observations as well
as experimental results) to develop and improve scientific theories
(Bacon1620 49ff). The role of observational evidence in scientific
discovery was an important topic for Whewell (1858) and Mill (1872)
among others in the 19<sup>th</sup> century. Recently, Judaea Pearl,
Clark Glymour, and their students and associates addressed it
rigorously in the course of developing techniques for inferring claims
about causal structures from statistical features of the data they
give rise to (Pearl, 2000; Spirtes, Glymour, and Scheines 2000). But
such work is exceptional. For the most part, philosophers followed
Karl Popper who maintained, contrary to the title of one of his best
known books, that there is no such thing as a ‘logic of
discovery’.(Popper 1959, 31) Drawing a sharp distinction between
discovery and justification, the standard philosophical literature
devotes most of its attention to the latter.</p> Although theory
testing dominates much of the standard philosophical literature on
observation, much of what this entry says about the role of
observation in theory testing applies also to its role in inventing,
and modifying theories, and applying them to tasks in engineering,
medicine, and other practical enterprises.

<p>
Theories are customarily represented as collections of sentences,
propositions, statements or beliefs, etc., and their logical
consequences. Among these are maximally general explanatory and
predictive laws (Coulomb’s law of electrical attraction and repulsion,
and Maxwellian electromagnetism equations for example), along with
lesser generalizations that describe more limited natural and
experimental phenomena (e.g., the ideal gas equations describing
relations between temperatures and pressures of enclosed gasses, and
general descriptions of positional astronomical regularities).
Observations are used in testing generalizations of both kinds.</p>

<p>
Some philosophers prefer to represent theories as collections of
‘states of physical or phenomenal systems’ and laws. The
laws for any given theory are</p>

<blockquote>
…relations over states which determine…possible
behaviors of phenomenal systems within the theory’s scope. (Suppe
1977, 710)
</blockquote>

<p>
So conceived, a theory can be adequately represented by more than one
linguistic formulation because it is not a system of sentences or
propositions. Instead, it is a non-linguistic structure which can
function as a semantic model of its sentential or propositional
representations. (Suppe 1977, 221–230) This entry treats
theories as collections of sentences or sentential structures with or
without deductive closure. But the questions it takes up arise in
pretty much the same way when theories are represented in accordance
with this semantic account.</p>

<h2><a name="WhaDoObsRepDes">2. What do observation reports describe?</a></h2>

<p>
One answer to this question assumes that observation is a perceptual
process so that to observe is to look at, listen to, touch, taste, or
smell something, attending to details of the resulting perceptual
experience. Observers may have the good fortune to obtain useful
perceptual evidence simply by noticing what’s going on around them,
but in many cases they must arrange and manipulate things to produce
informative perceptible results. In either case, observation sentences
describe perceptions or things perceived.</p>

<p>
Observers use magnifying glasses, microscopes, or telescopes to see
things that are too small or far away to be seen, or seen clearly
enough, without them. Similarly, amplification devices are used to
hear faint sounds. But if to observe something is to perceive it, not
every use of instruments to augment the senses qualifies as
observational. Philosophers agree that you can observe the moons of
Jupiter with a telescope, or a heart beat with a stethoscope. But
minimalist empiricists like Bas Van Fraassen (1980, 16–17) deny
that one can observe things that can be visualized only by using
electron (and perhaps even) light microscopes. Many philosophers don’t
mind microscopes but find it unnatural to say that high energy
physicists observe particles or particle interactions when they look
at bubble chamber photographs. Their intuitions come from the
plausible assumption that one can observe only what one can see by
looking, hear by listening, feel by touching, and so on. Investigators
can neither look at (direct their gazes toward and attend to) nor
visually experience charged particles moving through a bubble chamber.
Instead they can look at and see tracks in the chamber, or in bubble
chamber photographs.</p>

<p>
The identification of observation and perceptual experience persisted
well into the 20<sup>th</sup> century—so much so that Carl
Hempel could characterize the scientific enterprise as an attempt to
predict and explain the deliverances of the senses (Hempel 1952, 653).
This was to be accomplished by using laws or lawlike generalizations
along with descriptions of initial conditions, correspondence rules,
and auxiliary hypotheses to derive observation sentences describing
the sensory deliverances of interest. Theory testing was treated as a
matter of comparing observation sentences describing observations made
in natural or laboratory settings to observation sentences that should
be true according to the theory to be tested. This makes it imperative
to ask what observation sentences report. Even though scientists often
record their evidence non-sententially, e.g., in the form of pictures,
graphs, and tables of numbers, some of what Hempel says about the
meanings of observation sentences applies to non-sentential
observational records as well.</p>

<p>
According to what Hempel called the phenomenalist account, observation
reports describe the observer’s subjective perceptual experiences.</p>

<blockquote>
…Such experiential data might be conceived of as being
sensations, perceptions, and similar phenomena of immediate
experience. (Hempel 1952, 674)
</blockquote>

<p>
This view is motivated by the assumption that the epistemic value of
an observation report depends upon its truth or accuracy, and that
with regard to perception, the only thing observers can know with
certainty to be true or accurate is how things appear to them. This
means that we can’t be confident that observation reports are true or
accurate if they describe anything beyond the observer’s own
perceptual experience.
 <a name="checkthis"></a>Presumably
 one’s confidence in a conclusion should not exceed one’s confidence
in one’s best reasons to believe it. For the phenomenalist it follows
that reports of subjective experience can provide better reasons to
believe claims they support than reports of other kinds of evidence.
Furthermore, if C.I. Lewis had been right to think that probabilities
cannot be established on the basis of dubitable evidence, (Lewis 1950,
182) observation sentences would have no evidential value unless they
report the observer’s subjective
 experiences.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#1" name="note-1">1</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
But given the expressive limitations of the language available for
reporting subjective experiences we can’t expect phenomenalistic
reports to be precise and unambiguous enough to test theoretical
claims whose evaluation requires accurate, fine- grained perceptual
discriminations. Worse yet, if experiences are directly available only
to those who have them, there is room to doubt whether different
people can understand the same observation sentence in the same way.
Suppose you had to evaluate a claim on the basis of someone else’s
subjective report of how a litmus solution looked to her when she
dripped a liquid of unknown acidity into it. How could you decide
whether her visual experience was the same as the one you would use
her words to report?</p>

<p>
Such considerations led Hempel to propose, contrary to the
phenomenalists, that observation sentences report ‘directly
observable’, ‘intersubjectively ascertainable’ facts
about physical objects</p>

<blockquote>
…such as the coincidence of the pointer of an instrument with a
numbered mark on a dial; a change of color in a test substance or in
the skin of a patient; the clicking of an amplifier connected with a
Geiger counter; etc. <em>(ibid.)</em>
</blockquote>

<p>
Observers do sometmes have trouble making fine pointer position and
color discriminations but such things are more susceptible to precise,
intersubjectively understandable descriptions than subjective
experiences. How much precision and what degree of intersubjective
agreement are required in any given case depends on what is being
tested and how the observation sentence is used to evaluate it. But
all things being equal, we can’t expect data whose acceptability
depends upon delicate subjective discriminations to be as reliable as
data whose acceptability depends upon facts that can be ascertained
intersubjectively. And similarly for non-sentential records; a drawing
of what the observer takes to be the position of a pointer can be more
reliable and easier to assess than a drawing that purports to capture
her subjective visual experience of the pointer.</p>

<p>
The fact that science is seldom a solitary pursuit suggests that one
might be able to use pragmatic considerations to finesse questions
about what observation reports express. Scientific
claims—especially those with practical and policy
applications—are typically used for purposes that are best
served by public evaluation. Furthermore the development and
application of a scientific theory typically requires collaboration
and in many cases is promoted by competition. This, together with the
fact that investigators must agree to accept putative evidence before
they use it to test a theoretical claim, imposes a pragmatic condition
on observation reports: an observation report must be such that
investigators can reach agreement relatively quickly and relatively
easily about whether it provides good evidence with which to test a
theory (Cf. Neurath 1913). Feyerabend took this requirement seriously
enough to characterize observation sentences pragmatically in terms of
widespread decidability. In order to be an observation sentence, he
said, a sentence must be contingently true or false, and such that
competent speakers of the relevant language can quickly and
unanimously decide whether to accept or reject it on the basis what
happens when they look, listen, etc. in the appropriate way under the
appropriate observation conditions (Feyerabend 1959, 18ff).</p>

<p>
The requirement of quick, easy decidability and general agreement
favors Hempel’s account of what observation sentences report over the
phenomenalist’s. But one shouldn’t rely on data whose only virtue is
widespread acceptance. Presumably the data must possess additional
features by virtue of which it can serve as an epistemically
trustworthy guide to a theory’s acceptability. If epistemic
trustworthiness requires certainty, this requirement favors the
phenomenalists. Even if trustworthiness doesn’t require certainty, it
is not the same thing as quick and easy decidability. Philosophers
need to address the question of how these two requirements can be
mutually satisfied.</p>

<h2><a name="ObsExcPerPro">3. Is observation an exclusively perceptual process?</a></h2>

<p>
Many of the things scientists investigate do not interact with human
perceptual systems as required to produce perceptual experiences of
them. The methods investigators use to study such things argue against
the idea—however plausible it may once have seemed—that
scientists do or should rely exclusively on their perceptual systems
to obtain the evidence they need. Thus Feyerabend proposed as a
thought experiment that if measuring equipment was rigged up to
register the magnitude of a quantity of interest, a theory could be
tested just as well against its outputs as against records of human
perceptions (Feyerabend 1969, 132–137).</p>

<p>
Feyerabend could have made his point with historical examples instead
of thought experiments. A century earlier Helmholtz estimated the
speed of excitatory impulses traveling through a motor nerve. To
initiate impulses whose speed could be estimated, he implanted an
electrode into one end of a nerve fiber and ran a current into it from
a coil. The other end was attached to a bit of muscle whose
contraction signaled the arrival of the impulse. To find out how long
it took the impulse to reach the muscle he had to know when the
stimulating current reached the nerve. But</p>

<blockquote>
[o]ur senses are not capable of directly perceiving an individual
moment of time with such small duration…
</blockquote>

<p>
and so Helmholtz had to resort to what he called ‘artificial
methods of observation’ (Olesko and Holmes 1994, 84). This meant
arranging things so that current from the coil could deflect a
galvanometer needle. Assuming that the magnitude of the deflection is
proportional to the duration of current passing from the coil,
Helmholtz could use the deflection to estimate the duration he could
not see (<em>ibid</em>). This ‘artificial observation’ is
not to be confused e.g., with using magnifying glasses or telescopes
to see tiny or distant objects. Such devices enable the observer to
scrutinize visible objects. The miniscule duration of the current flow
is not a visible object. Helmholtz studied it by looking at and seeing
something else. (Hooke (1705, 16–17) argued for and designed
instruments to execute the same kind of strategy in the
17<sup>th</sup> century.) The moral of Feyerabend’s thought experiment
and Helmholtz’s distinction between perception and artificial
observation is that working scientists are happy to call things that
register on their experimental equipment observables even if they
don’t or can’t register on their senses.</p>

<p>
Some evidence is produced by processes so convoluted that it’s hard to
decide what, if anything has been observed. Consider functional
magnetic resonance images (fMRI) of the brain decorated with colors to
indicate magnitudes of electrical activity in different regions during
the performance of a cognitive task. To produce these images, brief
magnetic pulses are applied to the subject’s brain. The magnetic force
coordinates the precessions of protons in hemoglobin and other bodily
stuffs to make them emit radio signals strong enough for the equipment
to respond to. When the magnetic force is relaxed, the signals from
protons in highly oxygenated hemoglobin deteriorate at a detectably
different rate than signals from blood that carries less oxygen.
Elaborate algorithms are applied to radio signal records to estimate
blood oxygen levels at the places from which the signals are
calculated to have originated. There is good reason to believe that
blood flowing just downstream from spiking neurons carries appreciably
more oxygen than blood in the vicinity of resting neurons. Assumptions
about the relevant spatial and temporal relations are used to estimate
levels of electrical activity in small regions of the brain
corresponding to pixels in the finished image. The results of all of
these computations are used to assign the appropriate colors to pixels
in a computer generated image of the brain. The role of the senses in
fMRI data production is limited to such things as monitoring the
equipment and keeping an eye on the subject. Their epistemic role is
limited to discriminating the colors in the finished image, reading
tables of numbers the computer used to assign them, and so on.</p>

<p>
If fMRI images record observations, it’s hard to say what was
observed—neuronal activity, blood oxygen levels, proton
precessions, radio signals, or something else. (If anything is
observed, the radio signals that interact directly with the equipment
would seem to be better candidates than blood oxygen levels or
neuronal activity.) Furthermore, it’s hard to reconcile the idea that
fMRI images record observations with the traditional empiricist notion
that much as they may be needed to draw conclusions from observational
evidence, calculations involving theoretical assumptions and
background beliefs must not be allowed (on pain of loss of
objectively) to intrude into the process of data production. The
production of fMRI images requires extensive statistical manipulation
based on theories about the radio signals, and a variety of factors
having to do with their detection along with beliefs about relations
between blood oxygen levels and neuronal activity, sources of
systematic error, and so on.</p>

<p>
In view of all of this, functional brain imaging differs, e.g., from
looking and seeing, photographing, and measuring with a thermometer or
a galvanometer in ways that make it uninformative to call it
observation at all. And similarly for many other methods scientists
use to produce non-perceptual evidence.</p>

<p>
Terms like ‘observation’ and ‘observation
reports’ don’t occur nearly as much in scientific as in
philosophical writings. In their place, working scientists tend to
talk about <em>data</em>. Philosophers who adopt this usage are free
to think about standard examples of observation as members of a large,
diverse, and growing family of data production methods. Instead of
trying to decide which methods to classify as observational and which
things qualify as observables, philosophers can then concentrate on
the epistemic influence of the factors that differentiate members of
the family. In particular, they can focus their attention on what
questions data produced by a given method can be used to answer, what
must be done to use that data fruitfully, and the credibility of the
answers they afford.(Bogen 2016)</p>

<p>
It is of interest that records of perceptual observation are not
always epistemically superior to data from experimental equipment.
Indeed it is not unusual for investigators to use non-perceptual
evidence to evaluate perceptual data and correct for its errors. For
example, Rutherford and Pettersson conducted similar experiments to
find out if certain elements disintegrated to emit charged particles
under radioactive bombardment. To detect emissions, observers watched
a scintillation screen for faint flashes produced by particle strikes.
Pettersson’s assistants reported seeing flashes from silicon and
certain other elements. Rutherford’s did not. Rutherford’s colleague,
James Chadwick, visited Petterson’s laboratory to evaluate his data.
Instead of watching the screen and checking Pettersson’s data against
what he saw, Chadwick arranged to have Pettersson’s assistants watch
the screen while unbeknownst to them he manipulated the equipment,
alternating normal operating conditions with a condition in which
particles, if any, could not hit the screen. Pettersson’s data were
discredited by the fact that his assistants reported flashes at close
to the same rate in both conditions (Steuwer 1985, 284–288).</p>

<p>
Related considerations apply to the distinction between observable and
unobservable objects of investigation. Some data are produced to help
answer questions about things that do not themselves register on the
senses or experimental equipment. Solar neutrino fluxes are a
frequently discussed case in point. Neutrinos cannot interact directly
with the senses or measuring equipment to produce recordable effects.
Fluxes in their emission were studied by trapping the neutrinos and
allowing them to interact with chlorine to produce a radioactive argon
isotope. Experimentalists could then calculate fluxes in solar
neutrino emission from Geiger counter measurements of radiation from
the isotope. The epistemic significance of the neutrinos’
unobservability depends upon factors having to do with the reliability
of the data the investigators managed to produce, and its validity as
a source of information about the fluxes. It’s validity will depend,
among many other things, on the correctness of the investigators ideas
about how neutrinos interact with chlorine (Pinch 1985). But there are
also unobservables that cannot be detected, and whose features cannot
be inferred from data of any kind. These are the only unobservables
that are epistemically unavailable. Whether they remain so depends
upon whether scientists can figure out how to produce data to study
them. The history of particle physics (see e.g. Morrison 2015) and
neuro-science (see e.g., Valenstein 2005).</p>

<h2><a name="HowObsEviMigTheLad">4. How observational evidence might be theory laden</a></h2>

<p>
Empirically minded philosophers assume that the evidential value of an
observation or observational process depends on how sensitive it is to
whatever it is used to study. But this in turn depends on the adequacy
of any theoretical claims its sensitivity may depend on. For example
we can challenge the use of a thermometer reading, <i>e</i>, to
support a description, prediction, or explanation of a patient’s
temperature, <i>t</i>, by challenging theoretical claims, <i>C</i>,
having to do with whether a reading from a thermometer like this one,
applied in the same way under similar conditions, should indicate the
patient’s temperature well enough to count in favor of or against
<i>t</i>. At least some of the <i>C</i>will be such that regardless of
whether an investigator explicitly endorses, or is even aware of them,
her use of e would be undermined by their falsity. All observations
and uses of observations evidence are theory laden in this sense. (Cf.
Chang 2005), Azzouni 2004.) As the example of the thermometer
illustrates, analogues of Norwood Hanson’claim that seeing is a theory
laden undertaking apply just as well to equipment generated
observations.(Hanson 1958, 19). But if all observations and
observational processes are theory laden, how can they provide reality
based, objective epistemic constraints on scientific reasoning? One
thing to say about this is that the theoretical claims the epistemic
value of a parcel of observational evidence depends on may be may be
quite correct. If so, even if we don’t know, or have no way to
establish their correctness, the evidence may be good enough for the
uses to which we put it. But this is cold comfort for investigators
who can’t establish it. The next thing to say is that scientific
investigation is an ongoing process during the course of which
theoretical claims whose unacceptability would reduce the epistemic
value of a parcel of evidence can be challenged and defended in
different ways at different times as new considerations and
investigative techniques are introduced. We can hope that the
acceptability of the evidence can be established relative to one or
more stretches of time even though success in dealing with challenges
at one time is no guarantee that all future challenges can be
satisfactorily dealt with. Thus as long as scientists continue their
work there need be no time at which the epistemic value of of a parcel
of evidence can be established once and for all. This should come as
no surprise to anyone who is aware that science is fallible. But it is
no grounds for skepticism. It can be perfectly reasonable to trust the
evidence available at present even though it is logically possible for
epistemic troubles to arise in the future.</p>

<p>
Thomas Kuhn (1962), Norwood Hanson (1958), Paul Feyerabend (1959) and
others cast suspicion on the objectivity of observational evidence in
another way by arguing that one can’t use empirical evidence to teat a
theory without committing oneself to that very theory. Although some
of the examples they use to present their case feature equipment
generated evidence, they tend to talk about observation as a
perceptual process. Kuhn’s writings contain three different versions
of this idea.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
<strong>K1</strong>. Perceptual Theory Loading. Perceptual
psychologists, Bruner and Postman, found that subjects who were
briefly shown anomalous playing cards, e.g., a black four of hearts,
reported having seen their normal counterparts e.g., a red four of
hearts. It took repeated exposures to get subjects to say the
anomalous cards didn’t look right, and eventually, to describe
them correctly. (Kuhn 1962, 63). Kuhn took such studies to indicate
that things don’t look the same to observers with different
conceptual resources. (For a more up-to-date discussion of theory
and conceptual perceptual loading see Lupyan 2015.) If so, black hearts
didn’t look like black hearts until repeated exposures somehow
allowed subjects to acquire the concept of a black heart. By analogy,
Kuhn supposed, when observers working in conflicting paradigms look at
the same thing, their conceptual limitations should keep them from
having the same visual experiences (Kuhn 1962, 111, 113–114,
115, 120–1). This would mean, for example, that when Priestley
and Lavoisier watched the same experiment, Lavioisier should have seen
what accorded with his theory that combustion and respiration are
oxidation processes, while Priestley’s visual experiences should
have agreed with his theory that burning and respiration are processes
of phlogiston release.</p>

<p>
<strong>K2</strong>. Semantical Theory Loading: Kuhn argued that
theoretical commitments exert a strong influence on observation
descriptions, and what they are understood to mean (Kuhn 1962, 127ff,
Longino 1979,38-42). If so, proponents of a caloric account of heat
won’t describe or understand descriptions of observed results of heat
experiments in the same way as investigators who think of heat in
terms of mean kinetic energy or radiation. They might all use the same
words (e.g., ‘temperature’) to report an observation
without understanding them in the same way.</p>

<p>
<strong>K3</strong>. Salience: Kuhn claimed that if Galileo and an
Aristotelian physicist had watched the same pendulum experiment, they
would not have looked at or attended to the same things. The
Aristotelian’s paradigm would have required the experimenter to
measure</p>

<blockquote>
…the weight of the stone, the vertical height to which it had
been raised, and the time required for it to achieve rest (Kuhn 1992,
123)
</blockquote>

<p>
and ignore radius, angular displacement, and time per swing (Kuhn
1962, 124).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
These last were salient to Galileo because he treated pendulum swings
as constrained circular motions. The Galilean quantities would be of
no interest to an Aristotelian who treats the stone as falling under
constraint toward the center of the earth (Kuhn 1962, 123). Thus
Galileo and the Aristotelian would not have collected the same data.
(Absent records of Aristotelian pendulum experiments we can think of
this as a thought experiment.)</p>

<h2><a name="SalTheSta">5. Salience and theoretical stance</a></h2>

<p>
Taking K1, K2, and K3 in order of plausibility, K3 points to an
important fact about scientific practice. Data production (including
experimental design and execution) is heavily influenced by
investigators’ background assumptions. Sometimes these include
theoretical commitments that lead experimentalists to produce
non-illuminating or misleading evidence. In other cases they may lead
experimentalists to ignore, or even fail to produce useful evidence.
For example, in order to obtain data on orgasms in female stumptail
macaques, one researcher wired up females to produce radio records of
orgasmic muscle contractions, heart rate increases, etc. But as
Elisabeth Lloyd reports, “… the researcher … wired
up the heart rate of the male macaques as the signal to start
recording the female orgasms. When I pointed out that the vast
majority of female stumptail orgasms occurred during sex among the
females alone, he replied that yes he knew that, but he was only
interested in important orgasms” (Lloyd 1993, 142). Although
female stumptail orgasms occuring during sex with males are atypical,
the experimental design was driven by the assumption that what makes
features of female sexuality worth studying is their contribution to
reproduction (Lloyd 1993, 139).</p>

<p>
Fortunately, such things don’t always happen. When they do,
investigators are often able eventually to make corrections, and come
to appreciate the significance of data that had not originally been
salient to them. Thus paradigms and theoretical commitments actually
do influence saliency, but their influence is neither inevitable nor
irremediable.</p>

<h2><a name="SemTheLoa">6. Semantic theory loading</a></h2>

<p>
With regard to semantic theory loading (K2), it’s important to bear in
mind that observers don’t always use declarative sentences to report
observational and experimental results. They often draw, photograph,
make audio recordings, etc. instead or set up their experimental
devices to generate graphs, pictorial images, tables of numbers, and
other non-sentential records. Obviously investigators’ conceptual
resources and theoretical biases can exert epistemically significant
influences on what they record (or set their equipment to record),
which details they include or emphasize, and which forms of
representation they choose (Daston and Galison 2007,115–190
309–361). But disagreements about the epistemic import of a
graph, picture or other non-sentential bit of data often turn on
causal rather than semantical considerations. Anatomists may have to
decide whether a dark spot in a micrograph was caused by a staining
artifact or by light reflected from an anatomically significant
structure. Physicists may wonder whether a blip in a Geiger counter
record reflects the causal influence of the radiation they wanted to
monitor, or a surge in ambient radiation. Chemists may worry about the
purity of samples used to obtain data. Such questions are not, and are
not well represented as, semantic questions to which K2 is relevant.
Late 20<sup>th</sup> century philosophers may have ignored such cases
and exaggerated the influence of semantic theory loading because they
thought of theory testing in terms of inferential relations between
observation and theoretical sentences. </p>

<p>
With regard to sentential observation reports, the significance of
semantic theory loading is less ubiquitous than one might expect. The
interpretation of verbal reports often depends on ideas about causal
structure rather than the meanings of signs. Rather than worrying
about the meaning of words used to describe their observations,
scientists are more likely to wonder whether the observers made up or
withheld information, whether one or more details were artifacts of
observation conditions, whether the specimens were atypical, and so
on.</p>

<p>
Kuhnian paradigms are heterogeneous collections of experimental
practices, theoretical principles, problems selected for
investigation, approaches to their solution, etc. Connections between
components are loose enough to allow investigators who disagree
profoundly over one or more theoretical claims to agree about how to
design, execute, and record the results of their experiments. That is
why neuroscientists who disagreed about whether nerve impulses
consisted of electrical currents could measure the same electrical
quantities, and agree on the linguistic meaning and the accuracy of
observation reports including such terms as ‘potential’,
‘resistance’, ‘voltage’ and
‘current’.</p>

<h2><a name="OpeObsRep">7. Operationalization and observation reports</a></h2>

<p>
The issues this section touches on are distant, linguistic descendents
of issues that arose in connection with Locke’s view that mundane and
scientific concepts (the empiricists called them ideas) derive their
contents from experience (Locke 1700, 104–121,162–164,
404–408).</p>

<p>
Looking at a patient with red spots and a fever, an investigator might
report having seen the spots, or measles symptoms, or a patient with
measles. Watching an unknown liquid dripping into a litmus solution an
observer might report seeing a change in color, a liquid with a PH of
less than 7, or an acid. The appropriateness of a description of a
test outcome depends on how the relevant concepts are operationalized.
What justifies an observer to report having observed a case of measles
according to one operationalization might require her to say no more
than that she had observed measles symptoms, or just red spots
according to another.</p>

<p>
In keeping with Percy Bridgman’s view that</p>

<blockquote>
…in general, we mean by a concept nothing more than a set of
operations; the concept is synonymous with the corresponding sets of
operations. (Bridgman 1927, 5)
</blockquote>

<p>
one might suppose that operationalizations are definitions or meaning
rules such that it is analytically true, e.g., that every liquid that
turns litmus red in a properly conducted test is acidic. But it is
more faithful to actual scientific practice to think of
operationalizations as defeasible rules for the application of a
concept such that both the rules and their applications are subject to
revision on the basis of new empirical or theoretical developments. So
understood, to operationalize is to adopt verbal and related practices
for the purpose of enabling scientists to do their work.
Operationalizations are thus sensitive and subject to change on the
basis of findings that influence their usefulness (Feest, 2005).</p>

<p>
Definitional or not, investigators in different research traditions
may be trained to report their observations in conformity with
conflicting operationalizations. Thus instead of training observers to
describe what they see in a bubble chamber as a whitish streak or a
trail, one might train them to say they see a particle track or even a
particle. This may reflect what Kuhn meant by suggesting that some
observers might be justified or even required to describe themselves
as having seen oxygen, transparent and colorless though it is, or
atoms, invisible though they are. (Kuhn 1962, 127ff) To the contrary,
one might object that what one sees should not be confused with what
one is trained to say when one sees it, and therefore that talking
about seeing a colorless gas or an invisible particle may be nothing
more than a picturesque way of talking about what certain
operationalizations entitle observers to say. Strictly speaking, the
objection concludes, the term ‘observation report’ should
be reserved for descriptionsthat are neutral with respect to
conflicting operationalizations.</p>

<p>
If observational data are just those utterances that meet Feyerabend’s
decidability and agreeability conditions, the import of semantic
theory loading depends upon how quickly, and for which sentences
reasonably sophisticated language users who stand in different
paradigms can non-inferentially reach the same decisions about what to
assert or deny. Some would expect enough agreement to secure the
objectivity of observational data. Others would not. Still others
would try to supply different standards for objectivity.</p>

<h2><a name="PerTheLad">8. Is perception theory laden?</a></h2>

<p>
The example of Pettersson’s and Rutherford’s scintillation screen
evidence (above) attests to the fact that observers working in
different laboratories sometimes report seeing different things under
similar conditions. It’s plausible that their expectations influence
their reports. It’s plausible that their expectations are shaped by
their training and by their supervisors’ and associates’ theory driven
behavior. But as happens in other cases as well, all parties to the
dispute agreed to reject Pettersson’s data by appeal to results of
mechanical manipulations both laboratories could obtain and interpret
in the same way without compromising their theoretical
commitments.</p>

<p>
Furthermore proponents of incompatible theories often produce
impressively similar observational data. Much as they disagreed about
the nature of respiration and combustion, Priestley and Lavoisier gave
quantitatively similar reports of how long their mice stayed alive and
their candles kept burning in closed bell jars. Priestley taught
Lavoisier how to obtain what he took to be measurements of the
phlogiston content of an unknown gas. A sample of the gas to be tested
is run into a graduated tube filled with water and inverted over a
water bath. After noting the height of the water remaining in the
tube, the observer adds “nitrous air” (we call it nitric
oxide) and checks the water level again. Priestley, who thought there
was no such thing as oxygen, believed the change in water level
indicated how much phlogiston the gas contained. Lavoisier reported
observing the same water levels as Priestley even after he abandoned
phlogiston theory and became convinced that changes in water level
indicated free oxygen content (Conant 1957, 74–109).</p>

<p>
The moral of these examples is that although paradigms or theoretical
commitments sometimes have an epistemically significant influence on
what observers perceive, it can be relatively easy to nullify or
correct for their effects.</p>

<h2><a name="HowDoObsDatBeaAccTheCla">9. How do observational data bear on the acceptability of theoretical claims?</a></h2>

<p>
Typical responses to this question maintain that the acceptability of
theoretical claims depends upon whether they are true (approximately
true, probable, or significantly more probable than their competitors)
or whether they “save” observable phenomena. They then try
to explain how observational data argue for or against the possession
of one or more of these virtues.</p>

<p>
Truth. It’s natural to think that computability, range of application,
and other things being equal, true theories are better than false
ones, good approximations are better than bad ones, and highly
probable theoretical claims are better than less probable ones. One
way to decide whether a theory or a theoretical claim is true, close
to the truth, or acceptably probable is to derive predictions from it
and use observational data to evaluate them. Hypothetico-Deductive
(HD) confirmation theorists propose that observational evidence argues
for the truth of theories whose deductive consequences it verifies,
and against those whose consequences it falsifies (Popper 1959,
32–34). But laws and theoretical generalization seldom if ever
entail observational predictions unless they are conjoined with one or
more auxiliary hypotheses taken from the theory they belong to. When
the prediction turns to be false, HD has trouble explaining which of
the conjuncts is to blame. If a theory entails a true prediction, it
will continue to do so in conjunction with arbitrarily selected
irrelevant claims. HD has trouble explaining why the prediction
doesn’t confirm the irrelevancies along with the theory of
interest.</p>

<p>
Ignoring details, large and small, bootstrapping confirmation theories
hold that an observation report confirms a theoretical generalization
if an instance of the generalization follows from the observation
report conjoined with auxiliary hypotheses from the theory the
generalization belongs to. Observation counts against a theoretical
claim if the conjunction entails a counter-instance. Here, as with HD,
an observation argues for or against a theoretical claim only on the
assumption that the auxiliary hypotheses are true (Glymour 1980,
110–175).</p>

<p>
Bayesians hold that the evidential bearing of observational evidence
on a theoretical claim is to be understood in terms of likelihood or
conditional probability. For example, whether observational evidence
argues for a theoretical claim might be thought to depend upon whether
it is more probable (and if so how much more probable) than its denial
conditional on a description of the evidence together with background
beliefs, including theoretical commitments. But by Bayes’ theorem, the
conditional probability of the claim of interest will depend in part
upon that claim’s prior probability. Once again, one’s use of evidence
to evaluate a theory depends in part upon one’s theoretical
commitments. (Earman 1992, 33–86. Roush 2005, 149–186)</p>

<p>
Francis Bacon (Bacon 1620, 70) said that allowing one’s commitment to
a theory to determine what one takes to be the epistemic bearing of
observational evidence on that very theory is, if anything, even worse
than ignoring the evidence altogether. HD, Bootstrap, Bayesian, and
related accounts of conformation run the risk of earning Bacon’s
disapproval. According to all of them it can be reasonable for
adherents of competing theories to disagree about how observational
data bear on the same claims. As a matter of historical fact, such
disagreements do occur. The moral of this fact depends upon whether
and how such disagreements can be resolved. Because some of the
components of a theory are logically and more or less
probabilistically independent of one another, adherents of competing
theories can often can find ways to bring themselves into close enough
agreement about auxiliary hypotheses or prior probabilities to draw
the same conclusions from the evidence.</p>

<p>
Saving observable phenomena. Theories are said to save observable
phenomena if they satisfactorily predict, describe, or systematize
them. How well a theory performs any of these tasks need not depend
upon the truth or accuracy of its basic principles. Thus according to
Osiander’s preface to Copernicus’ <em>On the Revolutions,</em> a locus
classicus, astronomers ‘…cannot in any way attain to true
causes’ of the regularities among observable astronomical
events, and must content themselves with saving the phenomena in the
sense of using</p>

<blockquote>
…whatever suppositions enable …[them] to be computed
correctly from the principles of geometry for the future as well as
the past…(Osiander 1543, XX)
</blockquote>

<p>
Theorists are to use those assumptions as calculating tools without
committing themselves to their truth. In particular, the assumption
that the planets rotate around the sun must be evaluated solely in
terms of how useful it is in calculating their observable relative
positions to a satisfactory approximation.</p>

<p>
Pierre Duhem’s <em>Aim and Structure of Physical Theory</em>
articulates a related conception. For Duhem a physical theory</p>

<blockquote>
…is a system of mathematical propositions, deduced from a small
number of principles, which aim to represent as simply and completely,
and exactly as possible, a set of experimental laws. (Duhem 1906, 19)
</blockquote>

<p>
‘Experimental laws’ are general, mathematical descriptions
of observable experimental results. Investigators produce them by
performing measuring and other experimental operations and assigning
symbols to perceptible results according to pre-established
operational definitions (Duhem 1906, 19). For Duhem, the main function
of a physical theory is to help us store and retrieve information
about observables we would not otherwise be able to keep track of. If
that’s what a theory is supposed to accomplish, its main virtue should
be intellectual economy. Theorists are to replace reports of
individual observations with experimental laws and devise higher level
laws (the fewer, the better) from which experimental laws (the more,
the better) can be mathematically derived (Duhem 1906, 21ff).</p>

<p>
A theory’s experimental laws can be tested for accuracy and
comprehensiveness by comparing them to observational data. Let EL be
one or more experimental laws that perform acceptably well on such
tests. Higher level laws can then be evaluated on the basis of how
well they integrate EL into the rest of the theory. Some data that
don’t fit integrated experimental laws won’t be interesting enough to
worry about. Other data may need to be accommodated by replacing or
modifying one or more experimental laws or adding new ones. If the
required additions, modifications or replacements deliver experimental
laws that are harder to integrate, the data count against the theory.
If the required changes are conducive to improved systematization the
data count in favor of it. If the required changes make no difference,
the data don’t argue for or against the theory.</p>

<h2><a name="DatPhe">10. Data and phenomena</a></h2>

<p>
It is an unwelcome fact for all of these ideas about theory testing
that data are typically produced in ways that make it impossible to
predict them from the generalizations they are used to test, or to
derive instances of those generalizations from data and non ad hoc
auxiliary hypotheses. Indeed, it’s unusual for many members of a set
of reasonably precise quantitative data to agree with one another, let
alone with a quantitative prediction. That is because precise,
publicly accessible data typically cannot be produced except through
processes whose results reflect the influence of causal factors that
are too numerous, too different in kind, and too irregular in behavior
for any single theory to account for them. When Bernard Katz recorded
electrical activity in nerve fiber preparations, the numerical values
of his data were influenced by factors peculiar to the operation of
his galvanometers and other pieces of equipment, variations among the
positions of the stimulating and recording electrodes that had to be
inserted into the nerve, the physiological effects of their insertion,
and changes in the condition of the nerve as it deteriorated during
the course of the experiment. There were variations in the
investigators’ handling of the equipment. Vibrations shook the
equipment in response to a variety of irregularly occurring causes
ranging from random error sources to the heavy tread of Katz’s
teacher, A.V. Hill, walking up and down the stairs outside of the
laboratory. That’s a short list. To make matters worse, many of these
factors influenced the data as parts of irregularly occurring,
transient, and shifting assemblies of causal influences.</p>

<p>
With regard to kinds of data that should be of interest to
philosophers of physics, consider how many extraneous causes
influenced radiation data in solar neutrino detection experiments, or
spark chamber photographs produced to detect particle interactions.
The effects of systematic and random sources of error are typically
such that considerable analysis and interpretation are required to
take investigators from data sets to conclusions that can be used to
evaluate theoretical claims.</p>

<p>
This applies as much to clear cases of perceptual data as to machine
produced records. When 19<sup>th</sup> and early 20<sup>th</sup>
century astronomers looked through telescopes and pushed buttons to
record the time at which they saw a moon pass a crosshair, the values
of their data points depended, not only upon light reflected from the
moon, but also upon features of perceptual processes, reaction times,
and other psychological factors that varied non-systematically from
time to time and observer to observer. No astronomical theory has the
resources to take such things into account. Similar considerations
apply to the probabilities of specific data points conditional on
theoretical principles, and the probabilities of confirming or
disconfirming instances of theoretical claims conditional on the
values of specific data points.</p>

<p>
Instead of testing theoretical claims by direct comparison to raw
data, investigators use data to infer facts about phenomena, i.e.,
events, regularities, processes, etc. whose instances, are uniform and
uncomplicated enough to make them susceptible to systematic prediction
and explanation (Bogen and Woodward 1988, 317). The fact that lead
melts at temperatures at or close to 327.5 C is an example of a
phenomenon, as are widespread regularities among electrical quantities
involved in the action potential, the periods and orbital paths of the
planets, etc. Theories that cannot be expected to predict or explain
such things as individual temperature readings can nevertheless be
evaluated on the basis of how useful they they are in predicting or
explaining phenomena they are used to detect. The same holds for the
action potential as opposed to the electrical data from which its
features are calculated, and the orbits of the planets in contrast to
the data of positional astronomy. It’s reasonable to ask a genetic
theory how probable it is (given similar upbringings in similar
environments) that the offspring of a schizophrenic parent or parents
will develop one or more symptoms the DSM classifies as indicative of
schizophrenia. But it would be quite unreasonable to ask it to predict
or explain one patient’s numerical score on one trial of a particular
diagnostic test, or why a diagnostician wrote a particular entry in
her report of an interview with an offspring of a schizophrenic
parents (Bogen and Woodward, 1988, 319–326).</p>

<p>
The fact that theories are better at predicting and explaining facts
about or features of phenomena than data isn’t such a bad thing. For
many purposes, theories that predict and explain phenomena would be
more illuminating, and more useful for practical purposes than
theories (if there were any) that predicted or explained members of a
data set. Suppose you could choose between a theory that predicted or
explained the way in which neurotransmitter release relates to
neuronal spiking (e.g., the fact that on average, transmitters are
released roughly once for every 10 spikes) and a theory which
explained or predicted the numbers displayed on the relevant
experimental equipment in one, or a few single cases. For most
purposes, the former theory would be preferable to the latter at the
very least because it applies to so many more cases. And similarly for
theories that predict or explain something about the probability of
schizophrenia conditional on some genetic factor or a theory that
predicted or explained the probability of faulty diagnoses of
schizophrenia conditional on facts about the psychiatrist’s training.
For most purposes, these would be preferable to a theory that
predicted specific descriptions in a case history.</p>

<p>
In view of all of this, together with the fact that a great many
theoretical claims can only be tested directly against facts about
phenomena, it behooves epistemologists to think about how data are
used to answer questions about phenomena. Lacking space for a detailed
discussion, the most this entry can do is to mention two main kinds of
things investigators do in order to draw conclusions from data. The
first is causal analysis carried out with or without the use of
statistical techniques. The second is non-causal statistical
analysis.</p>

<p>
First, investigators must distinguish features of the data that are
indicative of facts about the phenomenon of interest from those which
can safely be ignored, and those which must be corrected for.
Sometimes background knowledge makes this easy. Under normal
circumstances investigators know that their thermometers are sensitive
to temperature, and their pressure gauges, to pressure. An astronomer
or a chemist who knows what spectrographic equipment does, and what
she has applied it to will know what her data indicate. Sometimes it’s
less obvious. When Ramon y Cajal looked through his microscope at a
thin slice of stained nerve tissue, he had to figure out which if any
of the fibers he could see at one focal length connected to or
extended from things he could see only at another focal length, or in
another slice.</p>

<p>
Analogous considerations apply to quantitative data. It was easy for
Katz to tell when his equipment was responding more to Hill’s
footfalls on the stairs than to the electrical quantities is was set
up to measure. It can be harder to tell whether an abrupt jump in the
amplitude of a high frequency EEG oscillation was due to a feature of
the subjects brain activity or an artifact of extraneous electrical
activity in the laboratory or operating room where the measurements
were made. The answers to questions about which features of numerical
and non-numerical data are indicative of a phenomenon of interest
typically depend at least in part on what is known about the causes
that conspire to produce the data.</p>

<p>
Statistical arguments are often used to deal with questions about the
influence of epistemically relevant causal factors. For example, when
it is known that similar data can be produced by factors that have
nothing to do with the phenomenon of interest, Monte Carlo
simulations, regression analyses of sample data, and a variety of
other statistical techniques sometimes provide investigators with
their best chance of deciding how seriously to take a putatively
illuminating feature of their data.</p>

<p>
But statistical techniques are also required for purposes other than
causal analysis. To calculate the magnitude of a quantity like the
melting point of lead from a scatter of numerical data, investigators
throw out outliers, calculate the mean and the standard deviation,
etc., and establish confidence and significance levels. Regression and
other techniques are applied to the results to estimate how far from
the mean the magnitude of interest can be expected to fall in the
population of interest (e.g., the range of temperatures at which pure
samples of lead can be expected to melt).</p>

<p>
The fact that little can be learned from data without causal,
statistical, and related argumentation has interesting consequences
for received ideas about how the use of observational evidence
distinguishes science from pseudo science, religion, and other
non-scientific cognitive endeavors.First, scientists aren’t the only
ones who use observational evidence to support their claims;
astrologers and medical quacks use them too. To find epistemically
significant differences, one must carefully consider what sorts of
data they use, where it comes from, and how it is employed. The
virtues of scientific as opposed to non-scientific theory evaluations
depend not only on its reliance on empirical data, but also on how the
data are produced, analyzed and interpreted to draw conclusions
against which theories can be evaluated. Secondly, it doesn’t take
many examples to refute the notion that adherence to a single,
universally applicable “scientific method” differentiates
the sciences from the non-sciences. Data are produced, and used in far
too many different ways to treat informatively as instance of any
single method. Thirdly, it is usually, if not always, impossible for
investigators to draw conclusions to test theories against
observational data without explicit or implicit reliance on
theoretical principles. This means that when counterparts to Kuhnian
questions about theory loading and its epistemic significance arise in
connection with the analysis and interpretation of observational
evidence, such questions must be answered by appeal to details that
vary from case to case.</p>

<h2><a name="Con">11. Conclusion</a></h2>

<p>
Grammatical variants of the term ‘observation’ have been
applied to impressively different perceptual and non-perceptual
process and to records of the results they produce. Their diversity is
a reason to doubt whether general philosophical accounts of
observation, observables, and observational data can tell
epistemologists as much as local accounts grounded in close studies of
specific kinds of cases. Furthermore, scientists continue to find ways
to produce data that can’t be called observational without stretching
the term to the point of vagueness.</p>

<p>
It’s plausible that philosophers who value the kind of rigor,
precision, and generality to which l logical empiricists and other
exact philosophers aspired could do better by examining and developing
techniques and results from logic, probability theory, statistics,
machine learning, and computer modeling, etc. than by trying to
construct highly general theories of observation and its role in
science. Logic and the rest seem unable to deliver satisfactory,
universally applicable accounts of scientific reasoning. But they have
illuminating local applications, some of which can be of use to
scientists as well as philosophers.</p>
