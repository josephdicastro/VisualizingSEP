<h1>Nicolas Malebranche</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Fri May 24, 2002; substantive revision Tue Nov 28, 2017</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>

The French Cartesian Nicolas Malebranche was hailed by his
contemporary, Pierre Bayle, as “the premier philosopher of our
age.” Over the course of his philosophical career, Malebranche
published major works on metaphysics, theology, and ethics, as well as
studies of optics, the laws of motion and the nature of color. He is
known principally for offering a highly original synthesis of the views
of his intellectual heroes, St. Augustine and René Descartes.
Two distinctive results of this synthesis are Malebranche’s doctrine
that we see bodies through ideas in God and his occasionalist
conclusion that God is the only real cause.</p>

<h2><a name="LifWor">1. Life and Works</a></h2>

<p>

Malebranche was born in Paris on August 6, 1638, one month prior to
Louis XIV, and died, also in Paris, on October 13, 1715, six weeks
after the great French monarch. Malebranche was one of many children
born to his mother, Catherine de Lauzon, the sister of a Viceroy of
Canada, and his father, also Nicolas Malebranche, a secretary to Louis
XIII. As in the case of Descartes and Pascal, Malebranche was born in
frail health. His particular affliction was a severe malformation of
the spine, and due to this condition as well as his weak lungs he
needed to be tutored at home until the age of sixteen. Subsequently he
was a student at the Collège de la Marche, and after graduating
he went to study theology at the Sorbonne. His education left him with
a distaste for a scholasticism that focused on the work of Aristotle.
Thus, in 1660 he decided to leave the universities and to enter the
Oratory, a religious congregation founded in 1611 by the Augustinian
theologian Pierre Bérulle (1575–1629). At the Oratory in Paris,
Malebranche studied ecclesiastical history, linguistics, and the Bible,
and with his fellow students also immersed himself in the work of
Augustine. He was ordained a priest on September 14, 1664.</p>

<p>

There is the story that in the same year in which he was ordained,
Malebranche happened in a Paris bookstall upon a posthumous edition of
Descartes’s <em>Traité de l’homme</em> (<em>Treatise on
Man</em>) which provides a sketch of a mechanistic account of the
physiology of the human body. Malebranche’s early biographer, Father
Yves André, reported that he was so “ecstatic” on
reading this account that he experienced “such violent
palpitations of the heart that he was obliged to leave his book at
frequent intervals, and to interrupt his reading of it in order to
breathe more easily” (André 1886, 11–12).  While
André does not indicate why Malebranche was so moved, one can
speculate that he had discovered in this text a way to investigate the
natural world without relying on a stagnant Aristotelian
scholasticism. In any case, after his encounter with <em>L’homme</em>
Malebranche devoted himself to a decade-long study of the Cartesian
method and its results in mathematics and natural philosophy.</p>

<p>

The fruit of this study is a two-volume work bearing the title,
<em>De la recherche de la vérité. Où l’on traitte
de la nature de l’esprit de l’homme, et de l’usage qu’il en doit faire
pour eviter l’erreur dans les sciences</em> (<em>Search after Truth. In
which is treated the nature of the human mind and the use that must be
made of it to avoid error in the sciences</em> ) (1674–75). It is
primarily this text which provides the basis for Malebranche’s
reputation in the modern period. As its full title indicates, the
<em>Recherche</em> focuses on the principal sources of human error and
on the method for avoiding those errors and for finding the truth. The
first five books enumerate the various errors deriving from the senses,
imagination, pure understanding, inclinations and passions,
respectively, and a sixth book is devoted to the Cartesian method of
avoiding such errors through attention to clear and distinct ideas. The
centerpiece of the third book, on pure understanding, is a defense of
the claim that the ideas through which we perceive bodies exist in God.
Tucked away in the final book, on method, is a critique of “the
most dangerous error of the ancients,” namely, the Aristotelian
position that there are secondary causes in nature distinct from
God.</p>

<p>

The first volume of the <em>Recherche</em>, containing the first
three books, drew an immediate response in 1675 from the abbé
Simon Foucher (1644–1696), canon of Sainte Chapelle of Dijon. Foucher
was an “academic skeptic” who attacked the assumption that
ideas in us can represent objects distinct from us (see Foucher 1675).
The Cartesian Benedictine Robert Desgabets (1610–1678) replied to
Foucher by insisting that the Cartesian rule that clear and distinct
ideas are true presupposes that our thoughts correspond to real
external objects. In brief prefaces added to the second volume of the
<em>Recherche</em>, Malebranche chastised both thinkers for failing to
read the work they were discussing, noting in particular that he had
explicitly argued in the <em>Recherche</em> that the ideas we perceive
exist in God rather than in us.</p>

<p>

Malebranche solicited written responses to the <em>Recherche</em>
modeled on the sets of objections published with Descartes’s
<em>Meditations</em>. Perhaps put off by Malebranche’s harsh treatment
of Foucher and Desgabets, his critics offered instead only informal
objections channeled through mutual friends. In 1678, Malebranche
appended to the <em>Recherche</em> a set of sixteen
<em>Eclaircissements</em>, or clarifications, that respond to these
objections. Among the more important objections addressed are those
that concern Malebranche’s assertion that we have a freedom to
“consent” to certain motives for action
(“Eclaircissement I”), his claim that reason provides no
conclusive demonstration of the existence of the material world
(“Eclaircissement VI”), his doctrine of the vision of
ideas in God (“Eclaircissement X”), his conclusion that we
know our own soul through a confused consciousness rather than through
a clear idea of its nature (“Eclaircissement XI”), and his
occasionalist thesis that God is the only true cause
(“Eclaircissement XV”). The final 1712 edition includes
the addition of a seventeenth Eclaircissement that defends the
importance “not only for knowledge of nature but also for
knowledge of religion and morals” of the view, only hinted at in
the initial edition of the <em>Recherche</em>, that God acts for the
most part through “general volitions” (<em>volontez
générales</em>) and acts though “particular
volitions” (<em>volontez particulières</em>) only in the
exceptional case of miracles.</p>

<p>

Malebranche developed this last point in his 1680 <em>Traité de
la nature et de la grâce</em> (<em>Treatise on Nature and
Grace</em>). He published this work over the objections of the
Jansenist theologian and Cartesian philosopher Antoine Arnauld
(1612–1694), who was disturbed by what he saw as
Malebranche’s denial of the assertion in the Scriptures and the
tradition of God’s attention to particular details in matters of
grace. Arnauld responded to the publication of <em>Nature et
grâce</em> by engaging in open combat, and the ensuing battle
became one of the major intellectual events of the day. His opening
salvo was the 1683 <em>Des vraies et des fausses idées</em>
(<em>On True and False Ideas</em>), which attacks not <em>Nature et
grâce</em> but rather the
<em>Recherche</em> (see Arnauld 1683). Arnauld’s strategy here was to
undermine Malebranche’s influence in theological matters by revealing
the inadequacy of his philosophical views. In particular, he attacked
Malebranche’s assumption that ideas are “representative
beings” distinct from our perceptions, offering instead the
position, which he plausibly ascribed to Descartes, that ideas are
simply a feature of the perceptual modifications of our soul. This
argument reflects a sympathy for Descartes’ views that dates back to
Arnauld’s set of comments on the <em>Meditations</em>.</p>

<p>

The same year that Arnauld presented his initial critique,
Malebranche published the <em>Méditations chretiennes et
métaphysiques</em> (<em>Christian and Metaphysical
Meditations</em>), in which “the Word” (i.e., the Second
Person of the Trinity) offers a summary of his system that highlights
the central role that God plays in both metaphysics and morality. This
work was in some ways a follow up to his <em>Conversations
chrétiennes</em> (<em>Christian Conversations</em>), published
in 1677. In that earlier text, Malebranche presented a defense of the
Christian religion that emphasizes the Augustinian theme of our
dependence on God for knowledge and happiness. In 1684, Malebranche
further developed his views on moral theory in the <em>Traité de
morale</em> (<em>Treatise on Ethics</em>), in which he argued that
moral virtue requires a love of the “immutable order” that
God reveals to those who seek to know it.</p>

<p>

In 1684, Malebranche also responded to Arnauld’s
<em>Idées</em>, and after a further exchange on the topic of the
nature of ideas the debate turned to the theological issues concerning divine
providence, grace and miracles. The battle became increasingly bitter,
and as a result of a campaign on the part of Arnauld and his
supporters, Malebranche’s <em>Nature et grâce</em> was put on the
Catholic <em>Index librorum prohibitorum</em> (<em>Index of Prohibited
Books</em>) in 1690 (the <em>Recherche</em> was added in 1709). The
Malebranche-Arnauld polemic continued even after Arnauld’s death in
1694, with the publication in 1704 of two letters Arnauld wrote in
1699 and of Malebranche’s responses to those letters.</p>

<p>

In 1688, Malebranche published his <em>Entretiens sur la
métaphysique et la religion</em> (<em>Dialogues on Metaphysics
and Religion</em>), a concise summary of his main metaphysical
doctrines of the vision in God and occasionalism that also addresses
the problem of evil. In 1696, he appended to this text the
<em>Entretiens sur la mort</em> (<em>Dialogues on Death</em>), which he
composed after a life-threatening illness.</p>

<p>

In 1692, Malebranche published a short study, the <em>Lois de la
communication des mouvements</em> (<em>Laws of the Communication of
Motions</em>), in which he endorsed Descartes’s law of the
conservation of the quantity of motion but offered rules governing
collision that, unlike Descartes’s own rules, involve no appeal to a
force in bodies to remain at rest. In correspondence with Malebranche,
Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646–1716) emphasized difficulties with
Descartes’s conservation law, and that correspondence led Malebranche
to insert into a 1700 edition of the <em>Lois</em> the admission that
experience reveals that such a law does not hold.</p>

<p>

In 1693, Malebranche responded to the criticisms of the
<em>Recherche</em> in the 1690 <em>Systême de philosophie</em>
(<em>System of Philosophy</em>) of the French Cartesian Pierre-Sylvain
Régis (1632–1707). Régis had defended an account of
ideas similar to the one that Arnauld had defended against Malebranche
during the 1680s, and Arnauld used the Régis-Malebranche
exchange as an occasion to return to the issue of ideas during the
last year of his life. Despite their dispute, Malebranche and
Régis were both appointed as honorary members of the Paris
Académie des sciences when it was reorganized in
1699. Malebranche presented an inaugural lecture to the
Académie that defends against Descartes an account of color in
terms of the frequency of vibrations of light. In later published
versions of the lecture, Malebranche revised his discussion to take
into account the theory of the nature of color in the work of Sir
Isaac Newton.</p>

<p>

In 1697, Malebranche published the <em>Traité de l’amour
de Dieu</em> (<em>Treatise on the Love of God</em>) with <em>Trois
lettres à Lamy</em> (<em>Three Letters to Lamy</em>), in which
he rejected the claim in the Benedictine François Lamy
(1636–1711) that the <em>Traité de morale</em> supports the
“quietist” position that moral action derives from a disinterested
“pure love of God.” This rejection of Lamy’s quietism
provided the basis for Malebranche’s reconciliation with the famous
French cleric, Jacques-Bénigne Bossuet (1627–1704). Bossuet had
earlier enlisted the aid of François de Fénelon
(1651–1715) in writing against Malebranche’s occasionalism and his
appeals to God’s “general will,” but later became a bitter
enemy of Fénelon’s quietism.</p>

<p>

With the support of the apostolic vicar in China, Malebranche
published in 1708 an <em>Entretien d’un philosophe chrétien et
d’un philosophe chinois, sur l’existence et la nature de Dieu</em>
(<em>Dialogue between a Christian Philosopher and a Chinese Philosopher
on the Existence and Nature of God</em>). A sixth and last edition of
the <em>Recherche</em> appeared in 1712, and in 1715 Malebranche
published his final work, <em>Réflexions sur la prémotion
physique</em> (<em>Reflections on Physical Premotion</em>), in which he
responded to the claim of the abbé Laurent-François
Boursier (1679–1749) that occasionalism leads naturally to the
Thomistic position that God determines our action by means of a
“physical premotion.” In his response, Malebranche defended
the claim, present from the first edition of the <em>Recherche</em>,
that our free action involves a “consent” that God does not
determine.</p>

<p>

The <em>Œuvres complètes de Malebranche</em> [OC], which
consists of 20 volumes, is the standard critical edition of
Malebranche’s writings. In France, Malebranche has always been a
major figure in the history of early modern philosophy, and there is
an extensive earlier literature on him from this country; see, for
instance, Gouhier (1926), Gueroult (1939), Gouhier (1948), Gueroult
(1955–59), Robinet (1955), Rodis-Lewis (1963), and Robinet
(1965). This is supplemented by the important discussion in
Alquié (1974), and there is a continuation of substantive
French scholarship on Malebranche in works such as Moreau (1999),
Bardout (1999), Bardout (2000), and Pellgrin (2006).  Despite the
relative neglect of him in the corresponding Anglophone literature
during the earlier part of the twentieth century, Malebranche has
become increasingly popular among English-language scholars more
recently.  This change is indicated by the presence of recent English
translations of his writings; see Malebranche [DM], [DC], [TE],
[DMR], and [ST]. More recent book-length studies of Malebranche in English
include McCracken (1983), Jolley (1990), Nadler (1992), Schmaltz
(1996), Nadler (2000), Pyle (2003), and Peppers-Bates (2009), which
add to earlier trail-blazing studies such as Walton (1972) and Radner
(1978).  Easton, Lennon and Sebba (1991) is a comprehensive
bibliography of work on Malebranche in various languages. This work
supersedes the bibliography in volume 20 of Malebranche [OC], which
had superseded Sebba (1959). </p>

<h2><a name="IdeVisGod">2. Ideas and the Vision in God</a></h2>

<p>

In a section of the third book of the <em>Recherche</em> devoted to
“the nature of ideas,” Malebranche argued for his famous
doctrine of the vision in God. More precisely, the thesis in this
section is that we see external objects by means of ideas in God. The
argument for this thesis begins with the claim at the beginning of this
section that “everyone agrees that we do not perceive objects
external to us by themselves” since it can hardly be the case
that “the soul should leave the body to stroll about the heavens
to see the objects present there” (Malebranche [OC], 1:413).
Arnauld later took exception to this starting point, countering that
“ideas, taken in the sense of representative beings, distinct
from perceptions, are not needed by our soul in order to see
bodies” (Arnauld 1683, 18). His main objection is that
Malebranche stacked the deck in favor of his doctrine that we see ideas
of bodies in God by assuming from the start that these ideas are
distinct from our own perceptions.</p>

<p>

In developing his own position, Arnauld appealed to Descartes’
distinction in “Meditation III” between the formal reality
of an idea as a perceptual modification of mind and its objective
reality as something that represents an object. Arnauld insisted that a
representative idea is simply the objective reality of a perception,
and thus not something distinct from that perception. However, it is
important to note that Malebranche’s definition of an idea does not
rule out such a position from the start. As he himself insisted to
Arnauld, the claim that we must perceive external objects through ideas
leaves open the question of whether an idea is “<em>a modality of
the soul</em>, according to the opinion of M. Arnauld; an <em>express
species</em>, according to certain philosophers, or an <em>entity
created with the soul</em>, according to others; or finally
<em>intelligible extension rendered sensible by color or light,</em>
according to my opinion” (Malebranche [OC], 6:95).</p>

<p>

Malebranche’s description of his own opinion goes beyond what can be
found in the original edition of the <em>Recherche</em>. However, his
description of the other alternatives is drawn directly from this text.
In particular, Malebranche had argued there that there are only four
alternatives to the conclusion that we see bodies through ideas in God:
(1) Bodies transmit resembling species to the soul; (2) Our soul has
the power to produce ideas when triggered by non-resembling bodily
impression; (3) Ideas are created with the soul or produced in it
successively by God; and (4) Our soul sees both the essence and the
existence of bodies by considering its own perfections. Malebranche
told Arnauld that since this list constitutes “an exact division
… of all the ways in which we can see objects” and since
each of the alternative accounts yields “manifest
contradictions,” his argument from elimination serves to
demonstrate the doctrine of the vision in God (Malebranche [OC],
6:198–99).</p>

<p>

It is difficult to determine from the <em>Recherche</em> the precise
source of the enumeration. However, Connell (1967) has established that
Malebranche’s argument was drawn from the account of angelic knowledge
in the work of the Spanish scholastic, Francisco Suárez
(1548–1617). Particularly crucial for Malebranche’s enumeration is
Suárez’s claim that angels must know material objects through
species that God adds to their mind given that God alone can know them
through His own substance. In light of this claim, we can take
Malebranche’s first three hypotheses to cover the various ways in which
we could perceive bodies through immaterial species
“superadded” to our soul, and his fourth hypothesis to
cover the possibility that we perceive bodies in the perfections of our
soul. In arguing against the last hypothesis, Malebranche noted that
since a finite being can see in itself neither the infinite nor an
infinite number of beings (as Suárez had argued in the case of
angels), and since we in fact perceive both the infinite and infinity
in external objects, it must be that we see these objects by means of
perfections contained in the only being that can possess an infinity of
ideas, namely, God Himself.</p>

<p>

Malebranche took the conclusion here to confirm the view in
“an infinity of passages” in Augustine that “we see
God” in knowing eternal truths. This appeal to the Augustinian
theory of divine illumination provides the basis for an argument for
the vision in God that bypasses the unusual enumeration in the
<em>Recherche</em>. This more direct argument is introduced in
“Eclaircissement X,” where Malebranche urged that the ideas
we perceive must exist in an “immutable and necessary
Reason” since they are themselves immutable and necessary
(Malebranche [OC], 3:129f). Malebranche emphasized that the
Augustinian view that eternal truths derive from uncreated features of
the divine intellect conflicts directly with the voluntarist conclusion
in Descartes that these truths derive rather from God’s free and
indifferent will. Particularly in his exchanges with Arnauld,
Malebranche attempted to present his doctrine of the vision in God as a
natural consequence of Descartes’ account of ideas. However, his
Augustinian argument serves to show that Descartes himself could not
have accepted this doctrine. Moreover, such an argument reveals the
most fundamental reason for Malebranche’s rejection of Arnauld’s
Cartesian identification of ideas with our own perceptions. Since
Malebranche identified these ideas with necessary and immutable
essences, and since he held that these ideas derive their necessity and
immutability from the divine intellect, he concluded that Arnauld’s
position can only result in a radical subjectivism that renders
impossible any sort of a priori knowledge of the material world.</p>

<p>

“Eclaircissement X” also introduces the notion of
“intelligibile extension” mentioned in Malebranche’s claim
to Arnauld quoted above concerning his own opinion.  According to this
Eclaircissement, God has a single ideal extension that serves to
represent particular bodies to Him. Arnauld objected that this
position involves a retraction of the claim in the <em>Recherche</em>
that we perceive bodies by means of distinct ideas in God. In
response, Malebranche insisted that his view all along was that God
represents particular bodies by means of His own simple
“absolute being.” For Arnauld, however, the view that God
contains extension in this way is objectionable since it is connected
to the heretical view in the work of the Dutch thinker Benedict
Spinoza that God is extended substance. The charge of Spinozism
reappears in Malebranche’s 1713–14 correspondence with one of his
former students, J.J. Dortous de Mairan (1678–1771), who later became
the Secretary of the Académie des sciences. As in the case of
Arnauld, so in this correspondence Malebranche vigorously denied this
charge. In both cases, he responded by emphasizing that the infinite
and indivisible ideal extension that exists in God differs from the
finite and divisible extension in the material world. (For more on
Malebranche’s notion of intelligible extension, see Reid 2003; cf. the
different interpretation of this notion in Nolan 2012.)</p>

<p>

A final feature of Malebranche’s doctrine of the vision in God is
connected to the notion in his writings of the “efficacious
idea” (<em>idée efficace</em>). As first noted in Robinet
(1965), this notion became entrenched in Malebranche’s system around
1695, after his encounter with his Cartesian critic Régis. In
his <em>Systême de philosophie</em>, Régis had challenged
the claim in the preface to the <em>Recherche</em> that our mind is
united to God in a manner that “raises the mind above all
things” and is the source of “its life, its light, and its
entire felicity” (Malebranche [OC], 1:9). While he granted the
commonplace claim that God must create and conserve our soul,
Régis denied that we are enlightened by means of a union with
ideas of bodies in God. Rather, he insisted that God conserves in us
ideas that derive directly from the bodies they represent. In the 1693
<em>Réponse à Régis</em> (<em>Response to
Régis</em>), Malebranche emphasized his Augustinian position
that we can be instructed as to the nature of bodies only through a
union with God. However, he put a new spin on this position when he
noted that the union with God involves an “affecting” or
“touching” of our mind by God’s idea of extension.</p>

<p>

Already in the 1688 <em>Entretiens sur la métaphysique</em>,
Malebranche had suggested that the union with God can be explicated in
terms of a causal relation between God’s ideas and our mind. After
1695, he developed this suggestion by introducing the notion of
“pure” or non-sensory intellectual perceptions that are
produced by God’s efficacious idea of extension. Yet he also stressed
in this later period that such an idea is the causal source of our
sensations. One advantage of this extension of the doctrine of
efficacious ideas to sensations is that it yields a fairly clear
explanation of Malebranche’s claim to Arnauld that an idea is
“intelligible extension rendered sensible by color or
light.” Prior to 1695, Malebranche explained how intelligible
extension is so rendered by appealing somewhat obscurely to the fact
that the soul “attaches” colors to a non-sensory idea.
However, the theory of efficacious ideas allowed him to say that this
idea is rendered sensible by causing in us the appropriate sensations
of color and light. The claim that we see ideas in God is thus
transformed into the claim that our soul has intellectual and sensory
perceptions that yield an understanding of the truth concerning bodies
in virtue of their causal relation to God’s idea of extension. Drawing
on Robinet’s results, one scholar has concluded that while Malebranche
started with the vision <em>in</em> God, he ended with a vision
<em>by</em> God (Alquié 1974, 209).</p>

<h2><a name="CarDua">3. Cartesian Dualism</a></h2>

<p>

Malebranche told Arnauld that it was Augustine’s authority
“which has given me the desire to put forth <em>the new
philosophy of ideas</em>” (Malebranche [OC], 6:80). By
contrast, he emphasized in the preface of the <em>Recherche</em> that
Augustine had failed to see that sensible qualities “are not
clearly contained in the idea we have of matter,” adding that
“the difference between mind and body has been known with
sufficient clarity for only a few years” (Malebranche [OC],
1:20). The allusion here is to Descartes’s recent discovery of an idea
of matter that reveals that its nature consists in extension alone.
This idea dictates that sensible qualities such as colors, tastes and
odors that are not reducible to modes of extension cannot exist
external to mind. But since these qualities exist in the mind, and in
particular in the mind’s perception of the qualities, the mind itself
must be distinguished from body. In this way the Cartesian idea of
matter reveals “the difference between mind and body.”</p>

<p>

In the initial book of the <em>Recherche</em>, on the senses,
Malebranche proposed that the erroneous belief in the Aristotelians as
well as in Augustine that sensible qualities exist in bodies has its
source in a misuse of “natural judgments” that help in the
conservation of the human body. Here he was following Descartes’
account in “Meditation VI” of the “teachings of
nature,” and in particular the claim there that the purpose of
sensations is not to teach us about the nature of bodies but simply to
inform us of what is beneficial or harmful to the human composite. Just
as Descartes had urged that erroneous beliefs about the nature of body
can be avoided by attending to the clear and distinct perceptions of
the intellect, so Malebranche counseled that we avoid error by
attending to what the clear idea of matter reveals to us about the
nature of body. As we have seen, Malebranche had Augustinian reasons
for saying that the idea that so instructs us exists in God. By his own
admission, however, the conclusion that the idea that instructs us is
an idea of <em>extension</em> derives from the recent discoveries of
Descartes.</p>

<p>

Malebranche emphasized that the clear idea of extension must be
distinguished from our confused sensations. One point he wanted to make
is that the idea exists in God while the sensations are only
modifications of our mind. However, his emphasis on the fact that this
idea is “pure” or non-sensory indicates that our experience
of the material world has an intellectual component. We have seen that
his late doctrine of the efficacious idea involved the position that we
have pure intellectual perceptions produced by God’s intellectual idea
of extension. But his mature position that this idea is also the cause
of our sensations allows for the claim that our most basic sensory
contact with the material world has an intellectual component.</p>

<p>

We know that Malebranche’s doctrine of the vision in God conflicts
with Descartes’ doctrine of the creation of the eternal truths.
However, there are further departures from orthodox Cartesianism that
are linked to two qualifications of this doctrine. The first
qualification is that God’s idea of extension can reveal only the
nature of bodies and not their existence. This qualification is not
explicit in the initial edition of the <em>Recherche</em>, which says
only that the existence of properties of bodies external to us is
“very difficult to prove” (Malebranche [OC], 1:122).
Foucher had objected that Malebranche has no good reason to affirm
the external existence of these properties. In “Eclaircissement
VI,” Malebranche urged that the idea of extension does reveal the
possible existence of the material world, and that Descartes has shown
that we have a probable argument for its actual existence deriving from
our natural propensity to believe that there are bodies. However, he
conceded in this text—without crediting Foucher—that
neither he nor Descartes can provide an argument from reason that
demonstrates “with evidence” or “with geometric
rigor” that this belief is true. His conclusion is that such an
argument must appeal to faith in the veracity of the report in the
Scriptures that God has created the heavens and the earth.</p>

<p>

According to the second qualification of the vision in
God—which is found in the original edition of the
<em>Recherche</em>—we perceive the nature of our soul not through
a clear idea in God, but only through a confused “consciousness
or inner sensation” (<em>conscience ou sentiment
intérieur</em>). Malebranche accepted the Cartesian commonplace
that consciousness reveals immediately the existence of the soul. He
allowed that we know the nature of our soul to consist in thought,
moreover, and he embraced the Cartesian conclusion that the soul as a
thinking thing is distinct from body as an extended thing. Yet he
insisted that we know that the soul is distinct from the body not by
means of any direct insight into the nature of thought, but rather by
seeing that thought is not contained in the idea of matter. More
generally, Malebranche claimed that our lack of access to a clear idea
of the soul is evident from the fact that we do not have knowledge of
thought that matches our knowledge of the mathematical features of
bodies. This last point turns on its head Descartes’ own conclusion in
“Meditation II” that the nature of the human mind is
“better known” than the nature of body; for Malebranche, it
is the nature of body that is better known than the nature of mind.</p>

<p>

In “Eclaircissement XI,” Malebranche attempted to counter
“the authority of Descartes” by arguing that the
Cartesians themselves must admit that they have only a confused
awareness of the nature of the sensory modifications of the soul. He
noted that while the intellectual idea allows the various modes of
extension to be related in a precise manner, there is no clear scale
on which we can order our sensations of different shades of the same
color, not to mention our sensations of sensible qualities of
different kinds. Malebranche took the confusion in the sensations to
reveal a confusion in our perception of the nature of the soul. He
added that Cartesians can discern that sensible qualities are
modifications of an immaterial soul only by seeing that they are
“not clearly contained in the idea we have of matter.” For
a discussion sympathetic to Malebranche’s critique of Descartes’s
account of our knowledge of mind, see Schmaltz (1996); for more recent
discussions that defend Descartes against this critique, see Nolan and
Whipple (2005) and LoLorodo (2005).</p>

<h2><a name="Occ">4. Occasionalism</a></h2>

<p>

Malebranche is known for his occasionalism, that is, his doctrine
that God is the only causal agent, and that creatures merely provide
the “occasion” for divine action. On the old textbook
account, occasionalism was an <em>ad hoc</em> response to the purported
problem in Descartes of how substances as distinct in nature as mind
and body are can causally interact. According to this account,
Malebranche was driven by this problem with Cartesian dualism to
propose that it is God who brings it about that our sensations and
volitions are correlated with motions in our body.</p>

<p>

However, occasionalism was already an old doctrine at the time that
Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274) wrote against it. (There is a helpful
survey, in German, of the earlier history of occasionalism in Perler
and Rudolph 2000.) Thomas indicated that the primary concern of the
occasionalists was to strengthen the assertion of God’s
omnipotence. Though he allowed that God must “concur” with
creatures in producing effects, Thomas also claimed that there is
reason to conclude that creatures are true secondary causes. For
instance, he urged that it is more in accord with divine greatness to
say that God communicates His power to creatures.  Moreover, he
claimed that it is simply evident to the senses that creatures have
the power to bring about effects. Thomas also argued that if there
were no natures in creatures that explain effects, there could be no
true scientific explanation of effects through their natural
causes.</p>

<p>

Malebranche was concerned to respond to all of these arguments against
occasionalism, particularly as they were developed in the work of
scholastics such as Suárez. Against the first point that God’s
greatness requires the communication of His power, he countered that
it is in fact idolatrous to attribute divine power to creatures.
Malebranche’s argument that God alone can produce effects relies on
the assumption that “a true cause … is one such that the
mind perceives a necessary connection [<em>liaison
nécessaire</em>] between it and its effects” (Malebranche
[OC], 2:316). He claimed that there is such a connection neither
among bodily states, nor between bodily and mental states, nor among
mental states. In all of these cases, one can deny the connections
without contradiction.  There can be a necessary causal connection in
only one case, namely, the connection between the volitions of an
omnipotent agent and its upshots. Thus, only such an agent, namely,
God, can be a true cause. (For different interpretations of this
argument, cf. Lee 2008 and Ott 2008).</p>

<p>

In the <em>Entretiens sur la métaphysique</em>, Malebranche
offered a different argument based on Descartes’s suggestion in
“Meditation III” that God conserves the world by
continuously creating it. The argument begins with the claim that God
must create bodies in some particular place and in determinate
relations of distance to other bodies. If God conserves a body by
creating it in the same place from moment to moment, that body remains
at rest, and if he conserves it by creating it in different places from
moment to moment, it is in motion. We cannot even create motion in our
own bodies. Rather, it is God who must produce it on the occasion of
volitional states. Moreover, it is not motions in our brain that cause
our sensory states, but God who produces them on the occasion of the
presence of such motions. Finally, I have indicated the view in the
<em>Entretiens</em> that God produces our intellectual states through
the union of our mind with His “intelligible extension.”
While the argument from the necessity of the causal connection yields
the result that only an omnipotent being can be a cause, the argument
here is that only that being which creates/conserves the world can
cause various bodily and mental states. However, both arguments
converge on the conclusion, which Malebranche claimed to find in
Augustine, that all creatures depend entirely on God. (For further
discussion of Malebranche’s various arguments for occasionalism, see
Lee 2007 and Lee 2008.)</p>

<p>

The second scholastic argument against occasionalism appealed to the
purported fact that it is evident to the senses that creatures have
causal power. For Malebranche, however, this argument is no more
persuasive than the argument that bodies must have colors and tastes
since our senses tell us that they do. As indicated above, Malebranche
offered Cartesian grounds for thinking that the purpose of our
sensations is not to reveal the true nature of the material world, but
rather to indicate what is helpful or harmful to our body. Malebranche
held that our attribution of causal powers to bodies manifests in
particular an attachment to the body that is an effect of original sin.
Due to this attachment, we take objects in the material world to be a
cause of our happiness rather than God.</p>

<p>

In “Eclaircissement XV,” Malebranche responded to the
scholastic point that occasionalism renders scientific explanation
impossible by appealing to the fact that God is not an arbitrary agent,
but acts in accord with His wisdom. This wisdom dictates that He act
“almost always” by means of a “general and
efficacious will.” Such a will produces effects that are
perfectly law-like. For instance, God acts by a general will in
producing changes in bodies in accord with the law of the communication
of motion. Malebranche did allow that God can produce miracles by
“particular volitions” that are not law-like. However, he
emphasized that there are relatively few such volitions in God. Thus,
we can offer scientific explanations that appeal to the laws of motion
that reflect the nature of God’s general will.</p>

<p>

There is an important non-scholastic objection to Malebranche’s
occasionalism in the work of Bernard le Bovier de Fontenelle
(1657–1757), who was to become the perpetual secretary of the Paris
Académie des Sciences. In his 1686 <em>Doutes sur le
système physique des causes occasionelles</em>, Fontenelle
argued that Malebranche’s mechanistic physics is incompatible with his
occasionalism.  This is so because according to mechanism, bodily
collision necessitates change in motion.  But then bodily collision
satisfies Malebranche’s main requirement for being a true cause
insofar as it has a necessary connection to its effect; thus the
conflict with occasionalism. In his 1688 <em>Entretien sur la
métaphysique</em>, Malebranche offered the response that the
laws governing the bodily effects of collision derive from God’s will
rather than from the nature of bodies (Malebranche [OC],
12:164). For different assessments of this response to Fontenelle,
cf. Downing (2005) and Schmaltz (2008).</p>

<p>

Malebranche was not the first Cartesian to endorse occasionalism.
There were followers of Descartes such as Louis de la Forge
(1632–1666) and Claude Clerselier (1614–1684) who stressed that God
must be the cause of the communication of motion in bodily collisions
given the passivity of Cartesian matter. These Cartesians attempted to
preserve some room for the action of finite minds on body, but the
Cartesian Geraud de Cordemoy (1626–1684) went further in claiming that
only God can cause changes in the material world. However, none of
these thinkers went as far as Malebranche in arguing that God must
produce all real changes in nature. Moreover, Malebranche is
distinctive in providing an explanation of God’s action that
distinguishes His general will from His particular volitions. For a recent discussion of issues connected to Malebranche’s notion of particular volitions, see Walsh and Stencil (2016).</p>

<h2><a name="The">5. Theodicy</a></h2>

<p>

The presence of various evils in the world is problematic for anyone
who claims that this world was created by a God who has infinite
power, knowledge and goodness. However, the problem is particularly
acute for an occasionalist such as Malebranche who holds that God is
the only true cause of effects in nature. Malebranche offered a
theodicy that addresses the problem of evil by emphasizing that in the
“order of nature” God acts for the most part through His
general will.  In <em>Nature et grâce</em>, he started by
admitting that God could have acted by particular volitions to prevent
natural evils such as malformed offspring (a fitting example given his
own malformed spine), and thus could have produced a more perfect
world than He actually did create. In correspondence with Leibniz,
Malebranche emphasized this point in distinguishing his theodicy from
Leibniz’s (see Schmaltz 2010). However, Malebranche also claims that
God could have created a more perfect world only by departing from
simple laws, thereby sacrificing the simplicity and uniformity of
action that is a supreme mark of His wisdom. God produces the natural
evils that follow from simple laws not because He wills those
particular effects, but because He wills a world that best reflects
His wisdom by possessing the most effects governed by the fewest
laws.</p>

<p>

In his <em>Réflexions</em> on Malebranche’s <em>Nature et
grâce</em>, Arnauld objected to what he took to be the
suggestion in his target text that God has concern only for general
features of the world and does not will the details of His
effects. For Arnauld, divine providence requires that God intend all
of the particularities of the world He creates. In the recent
Anglophone literature, there is a debate over whether Arnauld’s
critique is based on a proper interpretation of Malebranche.  This
debate was promoted by the claim in Nadler (1993) that when
Malebranche says that God acts by means of general laws or volitions,
he means only that God has volitions in accord with general laws, and
that his doctrine of God’s continual creation in the
<em>Entretiens sur la métaphysique</em> in fact requires
distinct volitions for distinct effects (cf. the development of this
interpretation in Pessin 2001 and Stencil 2011). Other commentators
have countered that Arnauld was correct in thinking that Malebranche’s
claim in <em>Nature et grâce</em> that God acts by relatively
few general volitions involves a rejection of the position that He has
volitions for each particular effect . Some evidence for this view is
provided by the fact that Malebranche emphasized that the laws
themselves are “efficacious,” and that God employs
relatively few volitions in producing effects in the order of nature
(see Black 1997, Jolley 2002, and Schmaltz 2003).</p>

<p>

Malebranche insisted that God’s general will is operative not only
in the order of nature, but also in the “order of grace.”
However, he noted that the production of effects in the latter order
also involves human action that is free in the strong sense of not
being determined by anything external to the agent. His appeal to this
sort of freedom is in fact central to his solution to the problem of
moral evil, that is, the compatibility of sin with God’s goodness.
According to Malebranche, God is not responsible for sinful action
since such action derives not from Him but from sinful agents. Arnauld
objected that this solution is “more pelagian than anything in
Pelagius,” and that one must side with Augustine, who declared
Pelagianism a heresy. Malebranche responded that he did not follow
Pelagius in denying the importance of grace, and that Augustine himself
had emphasized our freedom in action.</p>

<p>

Malebranche also held that it is obvious by “inner
sensation” that we are genuinely free. However, there is some
question whether this introspective report is compatible with
Malebranche’s occasionalist claim that God is the only real cause.
This question has generated considerable discussion in the recent
Anglophone literature (cf. Schmaltz 2005, Greenberg 2008 and 2015, and
Peppers-Bates 2009). Malebranche did hold that God alone is the cause
of our inclination to love “the good in general.” However,
he also insisted that we are free to “consent” to the
stopping of that inclination at a particular object other than
God. Such consent results in an “absolute and intrinsic”
love of that object that is sinful given that this love is worthy only
of God. The consent is free because one is always able to suspend
consent and to search for objects more worthy of our love.</p>

<p>

There is the claim that Malebranche’s account of consent remained
essentially the same over the course of his philosophical career (see
Kremer 2000, 206).  However, there is some reason to think that this
account in fact was subject to significant development. In the initial
discussion of freedom in the <em>Recherche</em>, there is the
suggestion that consent consists in our “determination” of
our natural inclination toward the good in general (Malebranche
[OC], 1:46). However, this suggestion conflicts with the claim in
the very same text that it is God who directs our natural inclination
toward particular objects prior to any free act on our part. Indeed,
in his later discussion of freedom in “Eclaircissement I,”
Malebranche held that our freedom consists not in an active turning of
our natural inclination, but rather in the inactivity of our resting
with a particular good (Malebranche [OC], 3:548). This view is
further developed in the <em>Traité de morale</em>, which in
the case of free action distinguishes between the <em>force</em>
involved in the search for truth and the <em>liberté</em> that
directs this search.  Free acts of consent fall under the latter,
whereas the former involves the dispositions of our free inclinations
that God produces in us on the occasion of these acts (Malebranche
[OC], 11:70). In contrast to his earlier suggestion that our free
acts involve either a turning of our natural inclination or an
inactivity coupled with such an inclination, Malebranche’s view here
is that such acts are inactivities coupled with a distinct sort of
free inclination. There are different answers to the question of
whether this account serves to reconcile Malebranche’s occasionalism
with his claim that we have genuine freedom of action; cf. Schmaltz
(2005), which defends the coherence of Malebranche’s final position on
this issue (in line with the earlier view in Laporte 1951), and
Greenberg (2015), which argues that this position is not fully
consistent.</p>

<h2><a name="MorThe">6. Moral Theory</a></h2>

<p>

The theocentrism that is evident in Malebranche’s doctrines of the
vision in God and occasionalism would lead us to expect that God plays
a central role in his moral theory. This expectation is borne out by
his discussion in the <em>Traité de morale</em>. Indeed,
Malebranche’s two doctrines are present in that work. The vision in God
is reflected in the insistence there that moral duties are dictated by
“relations of perfection” revealed in God’s wisdom. As in
the case of necessary truths concerning body, so in the case of moral
truths Malebranche unequivocally rejected Cartesian voluntarism. The
doctrine of occasionalism is reflected in Malebranche’s insistence that
God is our greatest good since He alone can cause our happiness. This
point indicates that Malebranche took moral action to require a
consideration not only of abstract relations of perfection, but also
the happiness of the self.</p>

<p>

Malebranche starts from the Augustinian position that morality
concerns the proper ordering of our love. Given the importance of human
freedom for his theodicy, it is not surprising that Malebranche
insisted that the love required for moral action involve the free
exercise of the will. His version of the “good will” is one
that freely strives to be guided in action by objective relations of
perfection that hold among the various objects of love. God is the most
perfect being, and hence the most worthy of our love, while human
beings are more perfect than mere material beings, and thus more worthy
of our love. When the intensity of our love matches the order among
perfections, we have a right love that provides the basis for virtue,
that is, a habitual inclination to love objects according to their
perfections.</p>

<p>

Malebranche held that due to original sin, we are inclined not to
right love directed by our perception of relations of perfection in
God’s wisdom, but rather to a disordered love directed by bodily
pleasures deriving from the soul-body union. This is the counterpart to
the disordered inclination of our will to make judgments about the
nature of the material world that are based on sensations deriving from
the union. For Malebranche, a corrective to both of these disorders of
the will is to attend to clear ideas that exist in God.</p>

<p>

Malebranche sometimes suggested that disordered love of bodily
pleasure derives from self-love. Encouraged by this suggestion, one of
his followers, François Lamy, claimed that his position leads
to the quietist view in Fénélon that moral conduct
requires a “pure love of God” that involves no concern for
the self or its pleasure. This position, which Lamy himself endorsed,
was later condemned by the Catholic Church, due in large part to a
campaign against Fénélon directed by his critic,
Bossuet. But Malebranche insisted that such a position directly
conflicts with his own view that pleasure itself is a good that is
required as a motive for action. When critics such as Arnauld and
Régis charged that this view results in hedonism, Malebranche
responded that it is only ordered pleasures that bring the greatest
good. This response is reflected in his claim to Lamy that a
disordered love of self is to be contrasted not with pure love of God,
but rather with an ordered love that seeks happiness in the
contemplation of the greatest good, God. In emphasizing the need for
this sort of love of God, Malebranche was returning to his view in the
preface to the <em>Recherche</em> that it is through a union with God
that the mind “receives its life, its light, and its entire
felicity.” For more on Malebranche’s engagement with quietism,
see Montcheuil (1947). But cf. the critical evaluation of Montcheuil’s
decidedly pro-Malebranche view of this exchange with Lamy in Dreyfus
(1958), 318–22. There is a recent discussion of the relation of Malebranche to quietism in Walsh and Lennon (2012).</p>

<p>

Bardout (2000), 111–62, includes the argument that Malebranche’s
exchange with Lamy on pure love in fact marks a transition in his
thought from a “metaphysical morality” that stresses the
purely intelligible nature of our moral end, to a “sensible
morality” that stresses a conception of that end in terms of the
cause of our pleasure. However, this shift may not be as dramatic as
in the case of Malebranche’s conception of freedom. For the view that
God is our sole good insofar as He is the sole cause of our pleasure
is present already in the first edition of the <em>Recherche</em>
(Malebranche [OC], 172–73). Even so, there is reason to think that
this view becomes increasingly important to Malebranche’s moral
theory.</p>
