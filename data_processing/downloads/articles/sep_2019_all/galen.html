<h1>Galen</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Fri Mar 18, 2016</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
Galen (<em>Galēnos</em>, 129–c. 200 CE) was primarily a medical
author, but had a deep engagement with and influence on the
philosophical debates of his time. He wrote many works of logic and
ethics, and also addressed those and other philosophical
questions—especially of epistemology, causation in the natural
world, and philosophy of mind—in his medical-scientific
writings. His medical, and in some contexts his philosophical, work
had enormous influence throughout the medieval period and even later,
both in Europe and (through Arabo-Islamic transmission) beyond.
Largely ignored by the intellectual world, including philosophers,
since the Scientific Revolution, he has recently attracted
considerable scholarly attention, especially for his work on
scientific knowledge, his contribution to logic, and his discussions
of ethics, moral psychology and the mind-body problem.</p>

<p>
Galen was one of the most prolific intellectuals of western antiquity,
his works extending to 21 volumes of roughly 1000 pages each in the
standard Greek edition (with a few additional works surviving only in
Arabic, Syriac, Hebrew or Latin translations)—a total of more
than 4 million words. While most of his scientific and medical
writings survive, many of his specialist works of philosophy do not.
He is an extremely adversarial author, a vigorous participant in the
highly rhetorical and learned competitive intellectual culture of
second-century-CE Rome (the so-called “Second Sophistic”);
and he is extremely prone to digression. He often expresses his own
views through the twin media of polemic against his opponents and
textual interpretation and commentary on his intellectual heroes
(especially Plato and Hippocrates). And, in spite of his profound
knowledge of the Greek philosophical tradition and
“classic” philosophical texts and his engagement with
philosophical terminology and modes of argument, he does not define
himself as a philosopher, often expressing hostility towards
“school” practitioners of philosophy.</p>

<p>
The above very brief introduction to the study of “Galen the
philosopher” may also serve as a preliminary warning of the
peculiar challenges that any such study faces: the vast body of texts,
many both diffuse in structure and unexamined by modern scholarship;
the wide range of genres (most not primarily philosophical),
dialectical contexts and rhetorical arguments from which his
philosophical views must be reconstructed; his eclectic and
decontextualized use of philosophical terminology for his own
purposes; certain specific losses amongst his specialist treatises of
philosophy.</p>

<h2 id="Life">1. Life</h2>

<p>
Galen was born into the intellectual and social elite of the
culturally Greek city of Pergamon (near the northwest coast of Roman
Asia, in present-day Turkey) in 129 CE, the son of an architect. He
lays great stress on his own early education in mathematics and
geometry, and on his passion for logic (<em>Lib. Prop.</em> 14/11;
<em>Aff. Pecc. Dig.</em> I.8), seeing these disciplines as providing a
model of secure proof lacking from the philosophical debates of the
post-Hellenistic schools which were dominant in his day. From the age
of fourteen, however, he also acquired a significant education in
philosophy. This involved attendance at the (closely text-based)
lecture courses of professors of one or more of the four established
philosophical schools: Platonist, Aristotelian, Stoic, Epicurean;
indeed, Galen mentions an adherent of each as part of his early
education. From the age of sixteen he also commenced his medical
studies, although study of philosophy continued concurrently. After
his father’s death in 149 he undertook an educational journey of
several years, involving periods in Smyrna, Corinth and Alexandria, to
study with the foremost medical teachers of the time. This study also
involved a strong textual element, and—alongside actual anatomy
(for which Alexandria remained a major centre, although dissection at
this period was restricted to non-human animals)—Galen acquired
an in-depth knowledge of the medical, as well as the philosophical,
writings of his predecessors.</p>

<p>
In 157 he returned to his home city, taking up an official post as
doctor to the gladiators, before moving to Rome in the early 160s,
where—after one more brief period back in Pergamon—he
settled permanently. At Rome Galen seems to have developed his status
very quickly amongst the socio-intellectual elite—which
significantly included devotees of philosophy, in particular
Aristotelians (Singer 2014). Galen quickly shone as a self-publicizing
medical practitioner; he also gave public lectures and anatomical
demonstrations in a highly competitive intellectual environment (see
<em>Praen.</em>; Barton 1994; Mattern 2008; Von Staden 1995, 1997).
Much of his anatomical work, as well as the inception of two great
works central to the establishment of his reputation, <em>The Function
of the Parts of the Body</em> (<em>UP</em>) and <em>The Doctrines of
Hippocrates and Plato</em> (<em>PHP</em>), belongs to this early
period. The former text aims to establish the purposive, indeed
divine, construction, understood in relation to its particular
function (<em>chreia</em>), of every anatomical feature of the body
(see further
 <a href="#Caus">section 5</a>
 below), and explicitly models itself on Aristotelian biological work.
The latter constitutes both an exposition of Platonic tripartite
psychology, with a vigorous polemic against the Stoic monist
alternative, and a synthesis of this Platonic view with Galen’s
physiology of brain, heart and liver (see further below,
 <a href="#Mind">section 7</a>);
 it contains an account of the famous experiment whereby the function
of the brain (in Galen’s terms, the fact that it is the seat of
the “leading-part” of the soul) is demonstrated by
ligation of the spinal cord of a live pig.</p>

<p>
Adopted as court physician by the emperor Marcus Aurelius (who ruled
161–180), then co-reigning with Lucius Verus, Galen was also
fortunate to be spared a lengthy military campaign with the two
emperors in central Europe; to this period (169–76), indeed, he
ascribes the writing-up of a large number of his major works in
scientific and medical theory. </p>

<p>
Galen’s court career apparently continued through the reigns of
Marcus’ successors, Commodus (180–92) and Septimius
Severus (193–211); this later phase of his career includes some
of his major medical works, in particular: the magnum opus <em>The
Method of Healing</em> (<em>MM</em>); and much of his extremely
voluminous series of writings on drugs, and equally voluminous body of
commentaries on Hippocrates (together constituting nearly half his
extant output). Galen lived through both Commodus’ notorious
reign of terror and a disastrous fire, in 192, in which he lost a
substantial personal library: both experiences are described in the
recently-discovered ethical work, <em>Avoiding Distress</em>
(<em>Ind.</em>), which also adds to our knowledge of his extraordinary
scholarly activity (including not least his work on the Aristotelian
tradition). It is possible, but not certain, that Galen’s extant
ethical writings should also be dated to this later phase of his life
(after 192). Towards the end of his life, certainly, he wrote a
“philosophical testament”, <em>My Own Doctrines</em>
(<em>Prop. Plac.</em>), which gives a concise but important insight
into his attitudes to a range of philosophical questions (see below,
 <a href="#LimiPurpKnow">§3.4</a>).</p>
 
<p>
Galen amassed a considerable fortune, including a second home in
Campania; he must have had considerable intellectual influence on
medical life at Rome, although such influence is not attested until a
considerably later period. The traditional date of his death is around
200, but some later sources suggest that he was still alive more than
ten years after this.</p>

<h2 id="GaleCorp">2. Philosophy and the Galenic Corpus</h2>

<h3 id="RoleCorp">2.1 Role of Philosophy in the corpus</h3>

<p>
We may identify three central roles of philosophy in Galen’s
work. One, to which he himself gives particular prominence, is the
theory of demonstration: this underlies explanations and accounts in
the natural world, enables the person trained in it to distinguish
secure from merely probable or downright fallacious arguments, and
guarantees the reliability of propositions arrived at through its
correct application. A second is that Galen’s scientific and
medical accounts themselves—of the theory of physical elements,
for example, or of causation and change—engage with existing
philosophical debates (e.g., between continuum theorists and atomists,
or between teleologists and mechanists); and that he here relies
strongly on philosophical explanatory categories (e.g.,
<em>telos</em>, the form-matter distinction). Philosophical
technical language and argumentation are also to the fore in
specifically medical realms, such as the theory of
health or the classification of types of pulse: here too we find a
constant drive towards definition and linguistic disambiguation,
highly complex schemes of subdivision, and the employment of
philosophical vocabulary (e.g., <em>ousia</em>, <em>eidos</em>,
<em>sumbebēkos</em>).</p>

<p>
Thirdly, there are those areas of philosophy which are not of direct
importance to scientific or medical knowledge, but constitute separate
intellectual domains, in which Galen nevertheless wishes to make a
distinctive contribution. Particularly relevant here is the domain of
ethics; one may regard some of his efforts in logic and linguistic
studies in the same light.</p>

<p>
The area of “psychology” or philosophy of mind, meanwhile,
in a sense comes under both the second and the third heading:
Galen’s discussions of mind or soul (<em>psychē</em>) are
situated in a complex relationship both with the philosophical,
especially Platonic, tradition and with Galen’s medical and
physiological theories.</p>

<h3 id="CorpCurr">2.2 Corpus and Curriculum</h3>

<p>
The role of philosophy in Galen will be better understood through a
consideration of the order of his own books which the author suggests
(<em>Lib. Prop.</em> and in <em>Ord. Lib. Prop</em>.) to the aspiring
doctor: a sort of ideal curriculum of study which at the same time
implies an “order of knowledge”, a conceptual relationship
between different intellectual areas.</p>

<p>
First comes demonstration. Knowledge of demonstration is necessary for
reliable scientific knowledge and for the discernment of fallacious
arguments. But interestingly Galen here envisages <em>two</em>
possible pathways for this first phase of the curriculum. For one who
aspires to true knowledge, a thorough understanding of Galen’s
logical magnum opus, <em>Demonstration</em>, is essential. But there
is a more practical compromise: the less logically ambitious or adept
may—taking as his starting-point the “introductory”
methodological work, <em>SI</em>—proceed to the next stage
without that thorough grounding. <em>Some</em> logical training is
envisaged here too; but Galen is interestingly optimistic about the
ability of the non-philosophical layperson to arrive at the truth on
the basis of common conceptions and a basic ability to follow
arguments (such ability being contrasted with the tendency of
sectarian philosophers to create or succumb to sophistic fallacies);
key here is that the person in question should have acquired a solid
education in the traditional Greek “fundamentals”, which
involved mathematics and logic. But this latter person
will—following a Platonic distinction—only be able to
aspire to correct opinion, not to secure knowledge.</p>

<p>
The next stage is represented by anatomy, which is in turn followed by
the study of the function (<em>chreia</em>), capacities
(<em>dunameis</em>) and activities of the parts which anatomy reveals.
Capacities both “of nature” (<em>phusikai</em>) and
“of the soul” (<em>psuchikai</em>) are considered here:
the important work <em>Nat. Fac.</em> is especially relevant to the
former, <em>PHP</em> and <em>The Motion of Muscles</em> (<em>Mot. Musc.</em>) to the
latter; study of <em>UP</em> should follow here too.</p>

<p>
Galen then proceeds—under the heading “necessary to read
before the <em>The Method of Healing</em>”—to take a new
starting-point, in physical theory. Study of the fundamental elements
of the cosmos and biological world (discussed in <em>Hipp. Elem.</em>)
should be followed by their study in the specifically animal, and
human, context (in <em>Temp.</em>—a major and very influential
work of Galenic theory). From this point there is again a dual
pathway: the third book of <em>Temp.</em>, with its discussion of the
nature of change brought about by drugs, may lead into specialist
pharmacological study; alternatively, this may be bypassed in favour
of a series of works on health and disease in the human body, which in
turn lead into works on clinical practice, and on diagnostic and
prognostic procedures.</p>

<p>
Galen thus envisages an intellectual progress from the study of the
abstract and fundamental to the particular and individual, and
recommends that (at least ideally) a secure knowledge of demonstration
should underlie the whole paedagogic procedure. In clinical and
diagnostic/prognostic contexts, however, knowledge will be stochastic
and “for the most part”, not secure and certain as in the context of the
propositions provided by demonstrations.</p>

<p>
There are then also works and areas of enquiry which stand outside
this curriculum, and which Galen lists under separate headings. Such,
in particular, are the works of ethics; Galen lists more than 25, of
which only two (<em>Aff. Pecc. Dig.</em> and <em>Ind.</em>) survive in
full, although <em>PHP</em> also contains much relevant material.
(Some of the titles are tantalizing, in terms of what we have lost
from Galen’s ethics: <em>What Follows from Each Chosen Aim in
Life</em>; <em>The Epicureans</em>; <em>Against Favorinus’
Attack on Socrates.</em>)</p>

<p>
Also outside the main curriculum is a huge body of works on logic and
linguistic matters—again, nearly all lost. The titles testify to
an exceptional engagement, not only with logical and methodological
questions, but also with specific texts of “the ancients”
in logic: those of Aristotle and his school, especially, but also
those of the Stoics; and there were texts devoted to Plato’s
argumentation.</p>

<h2 id="EpisDemoScieMethHumaKnow">3. Epistemology: Demonstration, Scientific Method, Human Knowledge</h2>

<p>
Central to Galen’s notion of scientific knowledge and method is
the theory of demonstration. We shall therefore begin our discussion
of Galen’s epistemology with a consideration of his theory and
practice of demonstration, before proceeding to consider other aspects
of his views on scientific method, and, finally, his views on the
nature, limits and purpose of human knowledge more generally.</p>

<h3 id="DemoApodTheoPrac">3.1. Demonstration (<em>apodeixis</em>): Theory and Practice</h3>

<p>
We shall best understand Galen’s notion of demonstration in
relation to scientific knowledge by considering some examples of what
he presents as demonstrative in actual argumentative contexts; but
first let us consider the key theoretical features. (See Barnes 1991;
Hankinson 1991 and 2008a; Havrda 2015; Morison 2008; Tieleman 1996,
Ch. 1.) Galen believes that the highest-level, most reliable kind of
knowledge (<em>epistēmē</em>) is arrived at through
“scientific demonstration” (<em>epistēmonikē
apodeixis</em>). A key criterion for Galen is that the premisses
employed for a demonstration in relation to a subject, <i>f</i>, must
be “taken from the essence itself” of <i>f</i> (e.g.,
<em>PHP</em> II.2, 108; <em>Temp.</em> II.2, 53). Here, the
Aristotelian term “essence” (<em>ousia</em>) is closely
related to the notion of definition: the requirement is that when
attempting a demonstration, any premiss one puts forward which
purports to have general validity in relation to <i>f</i>s must be a
proposition which relates to what <i>f</i>s in their fundamental
nature or definition <em>are</em>, not one about <i>f</i>s’
incidental features (let alone—a recurrent concern—one
based on some misunderstanding due to a homonymous usage of the term
“<i>f</i>”). Further, the premisses for an
<em>epistēmonikē apodeixis</em> must be propositions the truth of
which is evident, either to reason or to sense-perception.</p>

<p>
Following Aristotelian logic, moreover, Galen is committed to the
project of presenting such demonstrations in syllogistic form.</p>

<p>
A central example of Galenic demonstration is the extended proof of
the location of the parts or principles of the soul, in <em>PHP</em>.
These are three: the rational (<em>logistikon</em>) or leading-part
(<em>hēgemonikon</em>), located, Galen argues, in the brain; the
“spirited” (<em>thumoeides</em>), located in the heart;
and the desiderative (<em>epithumētikon</em>), located in the liver.
Galen claims that the proof that the <em>hēgemonikon</em> resides in
the brain (and not, as in particular the Stoics think, the heart)
admits of scientific demonstration.</p>

<p>
In a passage late in the work (VIII.1, 484–6), summing up its
central argument, the demonstration is formulated in the following
syllogism:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
where the source of the nerves is, there is the <em>hēgemonikon</em>
<br />
but the source of the nerves is in the brain
<br />
the <em>hēgemonikon</em>, then, is in the brain. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This formulation indicates not only Galen’s commitment to the
demonstrative-syllogistic method of presentation, but also some of its
problems. First, if we consider this syllogism in the light of the
conceptual features outlined above, we would expect the first premiss
to be, or to arise from, a proposition evident to reason; that is to
say, this premiss should be either self-evident or follow directly
from the accepted nature, or definition, of <em>hēgemonikon</em>. The
second premiss, then, contributes the results of some empirical
observation—something evident to sense-perception. The
conclusion will follow inescapably from the conjunction of the two.
But can the first premiss here be regarded as definitional or analytic
in the required sense? The nerves are not, surely, part of an accepted
definition or common conception of what the <em>hēgemonikon</em> is
in its very nature—or at least, could only become so after a
considerable length of argument, itself involving empirical inputs and
various forms of reasoning (for example from plausibility and from
analogy). Nor could one say, conversely, that the statement is evident
to the senses: that would be to conflate a statement of empirical
information with a statement derived in abstract terms from one of our
fundamental conceptions (the nature of the <em>hēgemonikon</em>), as
well as to trespass on the domain of the second premiss in this
particular syllogism, for it is this that contains the result of the
anatomical and physiological observations in animals.</p>

<p>
In fact, Galen’s view of the definition, or fundamental
conception, of the <em>hēgemonikon</em> is given much earlier in the
work: it is “the source of perception and of voluntary
motion” (<em>PHP</em> II.3, 110, also VII.1, 430). It is on this
conception, which Galen takes to be universally agreed, even by his
opponents, that the greater part of the argument against those
(cardiocentric, monist) opponents and in favour of Galen’s
(encephalocentric, tripartite) theory depends: cardiocentrism is shown
to be wrong on the basis of that agreed conception. Thus,
Galen’s demonstration in <em>PHP</em> proceeds largely by taking
the universally agreed conception of a term (<em>hēgemonikon</em>),
and showing that a particular factual proposition about that
term—namely, that the <em>hēgemonikon</em> is in the
brain—follows from that conception, in conjunction with further
evidence (partly empirical evidence, partly further agreed
conceptions). The process of reasoning from that universally agreed
perception to the cast-iron syllogism with which Galen presents us at
the culmination of the argument, however, is a complex one, much less
clearly accessible to representation in formal logical terms. The
relative role of “starting-points taken directly from the
<em>ousia</em> of the subject” and empirical observations or
further evidence seems much more complex than the theoretical
syllogistic framing of them would allow.</p>

<p>
This point leads us to some further consideration of the nature of the
“evident” starting-points. Allowing that Galen is
justified in his reliance on empirical evidence, things evident to the
senses (see further below on his anti-Skeptical arguments), we still
need to analyse further what propositions may count as evident to
reason. Relevant here is his own classification, already mentioned, of
different grades of argument on the basis of different kinds of
premiss. In language indebted to Aristotle (in particular to his
<em>Sophistical Refutations</em> and <em>Topics</em>) and the
Aristotelian tradition, though in its precise formulation apparently
unique to Galen, he lists four: epistemonic, dialectical, rhetorical
and sophistic (<em>PHP</em> II.3, 110–12; II.8, 156–8).
This last type, which relies on ambiguity or linguistic confusion,
need not detain us further. The first type corresponds to the category
which we have already considered, that of “proceeding directly
from the <em>ousia</em> itself of the subject under enquiry”.
Dialectical premisses are ones which do not proceed thus directly
from the <em>ousia</em> of the subject, but which may nonetheless be
useful for the training of the young, for refuting sophists, for
leading to discoveries or for producing <em>aporia</em>. Rhetorical
premisses derive from generally accepted (<em>endoxa</em>) or everyday
examples or inductions, or from the evidence of witnesses (which may
include laypersons, poets or philosophers).</p>

<p>
Moreover, there are propositions which Galen firmly believes, and
which indeed are central to his physiological system, which he does
<em>not</em> claim to be able to establish on the basis of epistemonic
premisses; these “do not have such an evident
demonstration” as the former (<em>PHP</em> VI.3, 373; cf.
VIII.1, 486–8), yet it seems in these cases that the lower-grade
demonstration is regarded as adequate. Such, in particular, are the
proofs of the location of the remaining two parts of the soul, the
spirited (in the heart) and the desiderative (in the liver). The proof
of the location of the rational in the brain—which famously
involves vivisectional experiments on animals, showing their loss of
speech and mobility when the spinal cord is ligated—Galen takes
to be epistemonic. The propositions that the heart is in the seat of
the spirited, meanwhile, and that the liver is the seat of the
desiderative, rely on premisses which are not based directly on the
<em>ousia</em> of the subject, but rather (again using Aristotelian
terminology), on its “specific properties”
(<em>sumbebēkota idiai</em>). What this means in effect is that Galen
must here rely on proofs from plausibility and analogy: for example,
that the heart is the seat of the spirited part of the soul (related
to responses of anger and indignation) gains plausibility from the
fact that one observes perturbations of the heart in certain particular
excited states of mind; that the liver is the seat of the desiderative
(which may be equated with the nutrititive and reproductive) is
supported by the proposition that it is the source of the veins, and
this proposition in turn relies on an analogy with plants: the bigger
(trunk) is the source of the smaller (branches).</p>

<p>
Yet how clear-cut is the distinction between the first and the second,
or even between the first and the third, categories of premiss? To put
it another way: might not a proposition which Galen defines as
proceeding directly from the essence of the subject, that is to say,
presumably, as evident to reason, from a different perspective be
defined as dialectical or indeed rhetorical? To take Galen’s
clearest specific example in <em>PHP</em>, that the
<em>hēgemonikon</em> is the source of perception and voluntary
motion, the only <em>explicit</em> grounds given for accepting it are
that it is accepted universally, even by Galen’s opponents
(II.3, 110). This, one might think, would put it in the category of
<em>endoxon</em>; or at least, it is difficult to see on what grounds
Galen might be able to advance the distinction between endoxic
propositions and irrefutably self-evident ones. To put it simply, at a
certain point arguments from consensus seem to be involved in the
justification of propositions as “evident to reason”.</p>

<p>
There are parallel problems for the role of demonstration in another
important Galenic area, that of fundamental physical theory. Galen
wishes to present his view as having been “demonstrated”,
especially by the text of <em>Elements According to Hippocrates</em>
(<em>Hipp. Elem.</em>), and indeed the first part of that work is an
attempt to establish a rigorous logical method for the foundation of
the theory. The problem is that this form of clear logical
argumentation takes us only as far as the refutation of Atomism (as
Galen understands it); that is, it is a proof of the plurality of
types of fundamental component of the universe. When he moves from
that argument against Atomism/Monism, or for pluralism in general, to
the argument for the specific number and nature of the elements of his
own theory, however, the argument is much less straightforward. Again,
that he takes his theory, at least in its essentials, to be not only
true but deducible from evident facts and/or common conceptions, seems
clear; but the precise nature and status of the arguments—and
indeed of Galen’s claims for them, see further
 <a href="#LimiPurpKnow">§3.4</a>—are
 much less so.</p>

<h3 id="MediScieMethEmpiVersRati">3.2 Medical-Scientific Method: Empiricism Versus “Rationalism”</h3>

<p>
We have considered Galen’s views on the establishment of secure
theoretical knowledge about the natural world. We turn to his views on
scientific method in the more specifically medical context. Galen
names three medical “sects”, in relation to which he
positions his own methodology: the Dogmatists or Rationalists
(<em>dogmatikoi</em>, <em>logikoi</em>), the Empiricists
(<em>empeirikoi</em>) and the Methodists (<em>methodikoi</em>); and he
explores the differences between them especially in <em>SI</em>. In
fact, only the latter two names correspond to self-styled groupings
with explicit school doctrines; the term Rationalist or Dogmatist,
meanwhile, is a catch-all referring to any doctor who functions with a
(non-Methodist) theory regarding the internal workings of the body.
(See Walzer and Frede 1985, introduction; Hankinson 1991 and 2008a.)
The Methodists are a specific, theoretically minimalist sect, who
conceptualize the pathology of the body in terms of two basic
“commonalities” (<em>koinotētes</em>), consisting in
increased fluidity or increased restriction through the pathways
(<em>poroi</em>) of the body; the Empiricists avoid any statement
about physiology, their treatments being based on an inductive
procedure (but with no theoretical commitment) from similarity with
past cases, the “transition from the similar”
(<em>metabasis tou homoiou</em>); a Dogmatist may be any
(non-Methodist) physician with a theory about the internal workings of
the body and about disease aetiology.</p>

<p>
Galen’s greatest hostility is towards Methodists: their theory
is simply wrong. The extremity of Galen’s reaction here seems in
part related to their very simplicity. For Galen, medicine is a large
and complex art requiring years of training in both logical and
clinical disciplines; the Methodists (possibly a consciously
anti-intellectual movement representing a non-elite group in society)
provocatively claimed that the art could be taught in six months;
their minimalist theoretical framework hugely reduces the range of
both empirical inputs and theoretical distinctions that can be
considered relevant.</p>

<p>
Galen believes that the Empiricist position, avoiding any statement
about unseen entities and basing itself entirely on experience
(<em>empeiria</em>, <em>peira</em>), will lead to the correct
therapeutic result in many cases. Faced with a choice between being a
pure Empiricist and adopting an erroneous theory, one should
infinitely prefer the former. However, Galen’s view remains that
theoretical knowledge of the internal workings of the body <em>is</em>
possible—that is, one can deduce facts about the non-evident
(<em>adēla</em>) on the basis of one’s observations. Further,
this knowledge of the workings of the body, its <em>phusis</em>, gives
one an understanding of pathology—in particular, a
differentiated pathology based on a knowledge of the different
internal parts and the different forms diseases may take in them, despite
superficially similar symptoms—which will in some cases enable
one to make the right diagnosis, and therefore prescribe the correct
treatment, where the Empiricist would not.</p>

<h3 id="LeveEpisCert">3.3 Levels of Epistemic Certainty</h3>

<p>
Galen is committed to the possibility of secure knowledge of the
physical world. In <em>Opt. Doc.</em>, in response to contemporary
Greek epistemological debates, he rejects Skeptical arguments that
encourage us to doubt one’s natural evaluative faculty
(<em>kritērion</em>), or to advance arguments on both sides of any
argument in order to reach suspension of judgement; he also attacks
the Stoic terminology of the “apprehensive” or
“kataleptic” (<em>katalēptikē</em>) impression, a kind
of cognitive experience which is so clear as to be self-guaranteeing.
(But he seems to regard the distinction between
“kataleptic” and his preferred term, “securely
knowable”, as purely verbal, rather than of philosophical
interest. Relatedly, he mentions, but does not seem to feel a serious
philosophical challenge from, the Skeptical objection that one may
believe one has a reliable perception also in dreams or in mentally
deranged states.)</p>

<p>
Galen is exercised to assert the reliability of one’s
fundamental intuitions and sense-perceptions (what is trustworthy in
itself, <em>ex heautou pista</em>), on the one hand, while giving an
explanation of human disagreement on matters of fact and theory, on
the other. His view is that while we are endowed with a naturally
reliable evaluative faculty (<em>kritērion</em>), there is a right
and a wrong way of training this; the former will, in particular,
enable one to distinguish true from false arguments. (Training of the
individual faculties of sense perception—for example,
touch—is also of great importance, especially for the aspiring
doctor.) Galen uses an analogy with other specialist skills
(<em>technai</em>): a music teacher or gymnastic trainer, equally,
relies on the pupil’s trust in his own natural
<em>kritērion</em>, but this does not mean that performance will be
error-free. Rather, teaching in these contexts—as in that of
logical argument and knowledge acquisition—is a constant process
of supervision and correction of errors.</p>

<p>
Galen also theorizes in an original way the relationship between
empirical inputs and the conceptual framework within which they are
assessed; in particular, with his concept of “qualified
experience” (<em>diōrismenē peira</em>; see van der Eijk 1997)
he asserts that empirical data can only lead to the truth in the
context of a theoretical framework arrived at through reason.</p>

<p>
Above, we considered the role of logical demonstration. We should
consider further the role of mathematics and geometry: Galen looks to
these as providing a model of the possibility of certain knowledge,
and a refutation of Skepticism. He recommends a training in these
disciplines, where “the fact itself bears witness of its truth,
once discovered”—i.e., where one cannot doubt the
rightness of the solution one has reached—for anyone interested
in truth-giving enquiry (<em>Aff. Pecc. Dig.</em> II.3, 290–2;
II.4–5, 299–305). A key example is that of the building of
a sundial: if one has done it correctly, the facts
themselves—e.g., that the sun hits the first line at daybreak
and the last at dusk—confirm that.</p>

<p>
So, Galen is optimistic about the attainability of reliable knowledge.
Yet the examples of mathematics and geometry at the same time point to
the most obvious challenge to this epistemological optimism. For,
surely, the gulf between the level of certainty available in those areas
and that and that possible in the study of the biological world, let
alone in the medical examination of individual cases, is an enormous
one.</p>

<p>
Galen seems remarkably confident about the possibility of secure
knowledge, even in areas where he is able to produce little that looks
like a “demonstration”: to the above case of element
theory we might add, for example, the confident classification of
pathological states and their signs or, indeed, the quantificatory
account of drugs and their dosages in the pharmacological work. In all
such cases, it seems, a method proceeding from reliable empirical
starting-points and applying sound logical method (and where relevant
training the perceptual senses) may lead to secure knowledge.</p>

<p>
On the other hand, in clinical practice we make the transition from
propositions of universal validity—the sort which Galen believes
himself able to arrive at in the way seen above, through the
application of logical method on the basis of evident
starting-points—to the particular case; and Galen problematizes
this difference between general or universal (<em>katholou</em>) and
individual or particular (<em>idion</em>) (Chiaradonna 2013, van der
Eijk 2008). Each individual case is different; moreover, the existence
is acknowledged of empirical experiences which are not expressible in
words (<em>Dig. Puls.</em> III.3, 914). This suggests a conclusion of
considerable epistemological interest, namely that there are
individual phenomena which cannot be fully incorporated in the
universal scientific account.</p>

<p>
Central to the understanding of clinical practice, too, is that we are
here dealing with a system of symptoms or signs; and inference from
signs cannot give one the same kind of secure knowledge that is
available for propositions arrived at through demonstration. Galen
here engages in what was already a complex and sophisticated area of
discussion, drawing on both Hippocratic texts (e.g., in the discussion
of signs in his commentary on the Hippocratic <em>Prognosticon</em>)
and debates in Hellenistic philosophy and medicine (Allen 2001,
Hankinson 2008a, van der Eijk 2008). As we have seen Galen, unlike the
Empiricists, believes that the observation of bodily signs—a
complex range, for the ancient doctor—enables the expert to make
inferences about the underlying bodily state and causal conditions.
The term <em>endeixis</em> here refers to the “indication”
that the observed body gives, both of what has caused its present
state, and of the appropriate treatment.</p>

<p>
Galen remains confident about epistemic success in this area too; yet
it is important to make the appropriate distinctions in relation to
certainty and demonstrability.</p>

<h3 id="LimiPurpKnow">3.4 Limits and Purposes of Knowledge</h3>

<p>
Galen claims that in his youth—partly in response to the
confusion caused by mutually contradictory philosophical sects, all
claiming certainty on unprovable issues—he nearly succumbed to
the lures of Skepticism (<em>Lib. Prop.</em> 14/11, 18). The above
possibility of certainty, as provided by mathematics and geometry, is
what saved him. But an understanding of the limits of human knowledge
is as important as the project of acquiring it in those areas where
that is possible. Galen is scathing about those who commit themselves
rashly on insufficient evidence, and about philosophers who debate
propositions on which demonstrative knowledge is impossible (such as
the existence and nature of the void outside the cosmos) (<em>Aff.
Pecc. Dig.</em> II.6–7, 308–13). Here, one criterion to
which he appeals in refusing to make pronouncements on certain
questions is their lack of relevance to “medicine or
ethical/practical philosophy” (e.g., <em>Prop. Plac.</em> 15,
120; <em>PHP</em> IX.9, 600).</p>

<p>
Yet the value of knowledge is not justified purely in pragmatic terms.
In <em>Prop. Plac.</em>, Galen puts forward a more subtle, tripartite
division of areas of knowledge: (1) matters on which he claims that it
is possible to have, and that he has, certain knowledge; (2) matters
on which he claims no knowledge; and (3) matters on which he claims
only to be able to advance to the “plausible”, but where
the attempt to gain knowledge is still worthwhile, even though they
are <em>not</em> of direct practical value (<em>Prop. Plac.</em> 14,
114–17). This last category is in a sense the most interesting
and Galenically distinctive. Such knowledge, he suggests, “would
adorn the art, if knowledge could be obtained”; he seems here to
associate this category with element theory. If so, this
acknowledgement of a limitation on certainty will affect our view of
Galen’s “demonstrations” in this area
 (<a href="#DemoApodTheoPrac">§3.1</a>
 above). Perhaps, although it is not apparent from his
dedicated—and highly polemical—discussions in <em>Hipp.
Elem.</em> and in <em>HNH</em>, this is after all an area where he
admits to something less than scientific certainty, at least in
detail.</p>

<p>
One area in which Galen openly asserts his ignorance is that of the
“substance/essence (<em>ousia</em>) of the soul”: is it a
non-bodily substance, as Plato thought, or composed of physical
elements? (See further
 <a href="#SubsPowe">§6.4</a>
 on <em>ousia</em> and §7 on soul-theory.) In spite of some strong
apparently physicalist statements in this area, Galen consistently
throughout the corpus denies that he knows the answer to this question
(Donini 2008; Singer 2013: 32–33 and Ch. 4). The case is similar
in response to the question, how information is transmitted into the
embryo in the process of conception and foetal development. That one
needs to invoke some form of “intelligent design” is, to
Galen, absolutely clear. But precisely who or what is responsible?
<em>How</em> does the infant acquire, from birth or even before, the
ability to perform all its innate functions? In an interestingly
open-ended discussion in <em>Foet. Form.</em> (6, 196–201),
Galen ends with a genuine <em>aporia</em>: all existing options within
the tradition—the Platonic “world soul” extending
throughout matter, the presence of a rational soul in a pre-rational
animal, a plurality of souls for each individual muscle
function—have consequences which make them unattractive; but he
does not himself claim to have the answer.</p>

<p>
We are left with a challenging and distinctive epistemological
position, explicitly asserting the limitations to human knowledge in
certain metaphysical or higher-level physical areas of enquiry, but
anti-Skeptic and committed to the fundamental knowability of the
physical world, as well as to the value of the quest for knowledge in
areas where reasoning on the basis of clear empirical observation
and/or truths evident to reason makes that possible.</p>

<h3 id="NotiScieProg">3.5 The Notion of Scientific Progress</h3>

<p>
Galen explicitly states that, using theoretical reasoning in
conjunction with empirical evidence, progress in knowledge is
possible. At the same time—a perception typical within
Graeco-Roman culture—he regards the pathway from the
“ancients”, in particular Hippocrates, to the moderns as
in general a downward one, and “more recent”, in relation
to medical or scientific authors, is usually a term of disapprobation.
He does, however, claim that progress in relation to the ancients is
possible, and indeed that he has achieved it, in two chief senses. One
is that, for example in anatomy, he has made certain specific
discoveries unknown to his predecessors; the other, more substantial
in his presentation, is the project of giving solid demonstrative form
to propositions which (according to Galen) were known to the ancients,
but either stated by them without demonstration, or actually omitted
from their writings (<em>Opt. Med.</em> 4, 34; Hankinson 1994a).</p>

<p>
It is important to consider the historically specific attitude to
authority—to “the ancients”—which is in play
here. As we have seen, Galen apparently regards certain propositions
as evident to reason which we might rather think are
“endoxic”, or indeed simply well established in
traditional thought. More specifically, Galen has an enormous explicit
admiration for certain authors already regarded as classical in his
time, most especially Hippocrates and Plato, and devotes lengthy texts
to their exegesis. He is both influenced by previous authors and
exercised to present his own views as consistent with a body of
traditional thought. But his latter process is not a straightforward
or uncritical one: different sets of authors are lined up as authority
in different contexts; and authors highly respected in certain
contexts become the object of fierce criticism in others. (On these
issues see Lloyd 1988; Singer 1996 and 2013, Ch. 4; Vegetti 1999; Von
Staden 2009.) Galen explicitly states that he does not rely on
Hippocrates, “as others do”, uncritically or
reverentially, but rather quotes him because he sees “that his
demonstrations are secure” (<em>QAM</em> 9, 399–400). So,
too, with Plato: although agreeing with much of Platonic doctrine as
he understands it, and in a sense appearing to present himself
“tribally” as a Platonist, Galen is quite capable of
disagreeing with Plato on points of detail.</p>

<p>
Yet the very fact that Galen’s major treatise on
psycho-physiology, <em>PHP</em>, is formally presented as a
reconciliation of Hippocrates’ and Plato’s views is
telling—as indeed is the huge volume of exegetical work on
Hippocrates, and on Aristotelian logic. In practice, arguments from
authority have considerable value for Galen, at least as a persuasive
tool, in spite of his explicit denials of that authority status; and there are
probably cultural reasons for his devotion to Plato and Hippocrates in
particular. However, his claim not to be a slavish sectarian is borne
out; and no one—not Aristotle, not Plato, not even
Hippocrates—is exempt from criticism in particular contexts.
</p>

<h2 id="LogiHistCont">4. Logic: Historical Contribution</h2>

<p>
We have devoted considerable attention to the importance of logic for
Galen in relation to the theory of demonstration and early
intellectual training. Some account should also be given of his
contribution to the broader theoretical study of logic,
because—although not of similar relevance to epistemology or the
theory of science—this contribution is, at least arguably, of
considerable historical importance.</p>

<p>
Certain caveats must be given at the outset. Galen’s most
important work in this area, <em>Demonstration</em> is lost to us
except for fragments (though a shorter work, the important
<em>Introduction to Logic</em> (<em>Inst. Log.</em>), does survive); and the precise nature of
Galen’s innovations, and final views, is a matter of debate
amongst experts (for an overview, as well as an account of different
views, see Morison 2008). In an area of great technical complexity and
interpretive difficulty, we can here attempt no more than the briefest
summary of the main issues and points of discussion. These may be
said, broadly, to revolve around the questions of the nature and
extent of the originality of Galen’s contribution, and of the
way in which he draws upon the work of both Aristotle and the
Stoics.</p>

<p>
Galen’s commentary on Aristotle (in a way consistent with the
approach considered in
 <a href="#NotiScieProg">§3.5</a>)
 involves not just explication but also addition. He claims that in
his commentary on the <em>Categories</em> (again, unfortunately lost)
he added an eleventh category to Aristotle’s ten: that of
“composition”. In the context of Aristotelian syllogistic
logic, meanwhile, there is some suggestion that he felt it necessary
to posit a fourth figure in addition to the Aristotelian three. In
fact, there seems considerable doubt concerning both the value of such
a fourth figure and Galen’s authorship of it (Morison 2008:
85–91); a preferable interpretation may be that references to
this “fourth syllogism” are not to a new categorization
within the system of Aristotle’s simple syllogisms, but rather
(more interestingly) to an original attempt at the analysis of
compound syllogisms, which Galen apparently carried out with specific
reference to certain arguments in Plato.</p>

<p>
No less interpretively challenging is the material concerning the
other main areas of Galen’s contribution, those relating to
hypothetical logic and to the “relational syllogism”. The
subject again resists non-specialist summary; but it seems
uncontroversial, at least, (a) that Galen engages in detail with Stoic
hypothetical syllogistic; (b) that he attacks the Stoics for
particular aspects of their use of it; and (c) that this attack is in
some way related to his own insistence on the priority of
“things” over “expressions” (a motto which
runs through much of Galen’s other work, too, in the context of
discussions of language). A final area of complexity and doubt
concerns the relational syllogism, the introduction of which Galen
claims as his innovation at <em>Inst. Log.</em> 16.
What seems clear is that Galen brought this new type of syllogism
forward in response to what he perceived as inadequacies in both
Aristotelian and Stoic logic; also that he believed it to be of
particular relevance for proofs in geometry and mathematics. An
example of a relational syllogism—from which such relevance is
indeed clear—is:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Theo has twice as many possessions as Dio;
<br />
but Philo has twice as many possessions as Theo;
<br />
therefore, Philo has four times as many possessions as Dio.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
(One puzzling feature of relational syllogisms as presented by Galen
is that he apparently sometimes does and sometimes does not mention
the relevant axiom on which the syllogism depends, as part of the
syllogism.)</p>

<p>
Experts have found Galen’s theoretical contribution to logic not
only interpretively problematic, but also ultimately frustrating in
its failure both to give a clear and consistent account of itself and
to fulfil its ambition systematically to provide what is missing in
the pre-existing tradition. What does seem clear is that Galen made a
distinctive and in some ways influential and challenging contribution
in this area, responding in an original way to both the Aristotelian
and the Stoic logical tradition; and that even in the most abstract
realm of logical analysis he retained a concern for the practical
value of logic and its relatedness to things.</p>

<h2 id="Caus">5. Causation</h2>

<p>
In strongly Aristotelian terms, Galen insists on the importance of
identifying the teleological cause, the “for the sake of the
better”, in accounts of the natural world, especially those
which involve animals and human beings; he also seems strongly
indebted to Aristotle in his presentation of material causation,
specifically of the four-quality or four-element theory which is
central to his accounts of change in the natural world, the biological
world in particular. These two types of causal account run through the
Galenic corpus, receiving different formulations in different
contexts; in
 <a href="#CausNatuWorlTeleDemiMate">§5.2</a>
 below we shall consider them in more detail, and the nature of their
relationship with each other and with other causal schemes. First, we
shall consider the comparatively smaller topic of Galen’s own
explicit discussions of causal schemes and causal terminology.</p>

<h3 id="ExplCateCaus">5.1 Explicit Categorizations of Causes</h3>

<p>
Galen’s causal accounts bear very clear echoes of Aristotle,
both linguistically and in the fundamental approach to causal
explanations in the natural world. At the same time, where Galen gives
an explicit listing of the number of different causes that may be used
in such explanations, he refers explicitly to Plato and seems indebted
to the Platonic tradition. In a passage of <em>UP</em>—the work
which has the strongest Aristotelian echoes in this teleological
sense—he gives a list of five causes, which seems closely
related to one attested elsewhere in Platonist writing: final,
efficient, material, instrumental, formal (<em>UP</em> VI.12; see
Hankinson 1994b and 1998). On the other hand, the list comes in a
dialectical context, and Galen is certainly not in general concerned
to give accounts which mention all five. Of those in this
“official” list, it is the teleological and material that
recur and are of most significance elsewhere. One might ask about the
role of the two other “Aristotelian” causes, the formal
and the efficient. Explicitly, Galen has little role for the latter
(although it is mentioned in an account of the demiurge’s
construction of the body; see further below). As for the formal:
certainly, forms (<em>eidē</em>) are of great importance in
Galen’s biology, where an account of both form and matter is
necessary in the description of animals and their development. Forms,
indeed, have a close conceptual relationship with the teleological
cause, as the way in which design or structure enters the physical
world; at the same time, their relationship with matter and in
particular with the concept of mixture is difficult to extricate (see
further
 <a href="#PhysTheoBiolConc">§6</a>).</p>
 
<p>
Galen also makes use of a further set of causal categories, which are
derived partly from the Stoic philosophical and partly from the
medical tradition. Of particular importance—especially in
medical contexts—are the concepts of “antecedent”
(<em>prokatarktikai</em>) and “preceding”
(<em>proēgoumenai</em>) causes; the further category of
“containing” or “cohesive”
(<em>sunektikai</em>) causes is also discussed. (Galen devoted two
works explicitly to these causal concepts, <em>CP</em> and
<em>CC</em>; see further Hankinson 1994b, 2008a.) While rejecting the
specific Stoic theory to which this last category belongs, namely that
objects require this type of cause as explanation of their
persistence, Galen employs the concept to a limited extent, allowing
that something productive of a particular effect, and co-temporal with
that effect, may be considered its “containing cause”.</p>

<p>
The other two categories are of more significance. They help, for
example, to explain how certain things may be called
“causes” even though they do not always bring about the
effect in question. Antecedent causes are conditions which raise the
likelihood of an outcome in a body (say, the occurrence of a disease);
these are typically external conditions, for example extreme ambient
heat or moisture. But the presence of such causes does not guarantee
the outcome; this will depend on internal differences in the
constitution of the bodies in question, and in particular a preceding
cause will be required to trigger the outcome. Again, Galen uses this
framework in an epistemologically optimistic way, highlighting the
ability of the expert to predict or correctly analyse such an outcome,
given sufficient understanding of all the relevant causal
features.</p>

<h3 id="CausNatuWorlTeleDemiMate">5.2 Causation in the Natural World: Teleological, Demiurgic, Material</h3>

<p>
There is a strong emphasis on teleology in nature, and on the
inadequacy of causal accounts that omit this. The major context for
this is <em>UP</em>, a text explicitly inspired by Aristotle. In this
17-volume magnum opus, Galen goes through the parts of the body one by
one, in each case giving an account which justifies the proposition of
the purposive nature of the construction. Taking Aristotle’s
approach (especially that of <em>Parts of Animals</em>), and the motto
“Nature does nothing in vain”, as starting-points, he is
concerned to prove the perfect, providential nature of the
construction of parts for the benefit of the animal, especially in the
context of humans. Important, from the outset, is to insist upon the
correct direction of causation: we have hands, etc., because we are
intelligent (the view he attributes to Aristotle), not the other way
round (the view he attributes to Anaxagoras) (<em>UP</em> I.3,
69–70).</p>

<p>
As so often in Galen, the polemical aim is of major importance for the
formulation of the argument. The recurrent target is that group of
thinkers who deny intelligence or purpose as an explanans, and omit it
from their causal accounts. Here Galen lumps together: a variety of
ancient Atomist theorists; the followers of the Hellenistic medical
author Erasistratus; and those of the more recent Asclepiades of
Bithynia. All are accused of giving accounts which omit intelligence
in the relevant sense, relying entirely on either spontaneous motions
of bodies or mechanistic explanations of biological processes to
explain the formation and maintenance of the complex processes of the
human body.</p>

<p>
There are further, distinctive features of the teleological account in
<em>UP.</em> One is that—in a highly intriguing and
individualistic discussion which however is not developed in any
detail (<em>UP</em> XI.14)—Galen introduces the notion of the
aesthetic alongside that of function. Some features of the human body
are to be explained not just in terms of its being <em>better</em> for
them to be so, but in terms of their making the body <em>more</em>
<em>beautiful</em>. (Examples are the male foreskin and the buttocks,
both of which hide what would otherwise be unsightly, and the beard in
men.)</p>

<p>
The same chapter is also interesting for the explicit contrast it
makes between intelligent design as Galen, in the post-Platonic Greek
tradition, understands it, and intelligent design as understood in the
Jewish tradition. Here Galen famously contrasts his (Platonic) view
with what he describes as that of the “Mosaic philosophy”,
the creation <em>ex nihilo</em> in which God’s will is the only
relevant cause to which there is no limitation.</p>

<p>
For Galen, the purpose of the divine Craftsman is, certainly, the most
important cause, but the material cause must also be mentioned in a
full account: matter represents the building-blocks used to realize
the design, and in a sense provides a limitation to it. This
interaction between design and material—and the assertion of the
final cause in opposition to those who deny it—are the central
features of Galen’s account. In the (strikingly anthropomorphic)
account of the Craftsman’s construction of the human body at
<em>UP</em> VI.13, however, Galen does indeed incorporate the five
causes listed above. The Craftsman constructs the organs of the body
as they are “because it is better so”, thus also bringing
about the best possible “form”: this covers both final and
formal causes. We must then see how he employs both
“instruments” and “matter” to do so: this will
take account of both instrumental and material causes. and although
the distinction between these too may seem somewhat fluid, it it is
further clarified that we should understand the wet and the dry as
providing the material cause, while the hot and the cold are the
“active instruments” which the Craftsman uses to shape
these. This corresponds to the Aristotelian distinction between the
active and the passive pair amongst the fundamental elements (see
below,
 <a href="#ElemPrinMatt">§6.1</a>).
 In summarizing the five causes at the end of this passage, Galen uses
the phrase “from the Craftsman” instead of
“efficient”.</p>

<p>
Galen explicitly characterizes <em>UP</em> as a hymn to the divine
creator (XVII.2–3, 732–33). This, of course, is not
religion in any conventional sense: rather, it is the fact that one
has gained detailed, in-depth knowledge, both of anatomy and of the
<em>chreia</em> of the parts revealed in anatomy—that is, of the
close, detailed relationship between their their structure and their
functional purpose—that enables one to celebrate the creator
appropriately.</p>

<p>
The question arises, both within the teleological analysis of
<em>UP</em>, and much more broadly throughout the Galenic corpus, of
the relationship between the different causes. Some scholars have seen
a tension between teleology and material causation in Galen (and some
even believed that they could identify a chronological development,
from the “early” position of <em>UP</em>, with its clear
Aristotelian “instrumentalism”, to the apparent
physicalism or materialism of the “late”
<em>QAM</em>—on which see
 <a href="#Mind">§7</a>
 below). (For exploration of the issues see Singer 1997b.)</p>

<p>
To put it at its weakest, we may say that there are discussions of
biological phenomena in which the teleological account appears to
recede and an account in material terms seems to be all that is
thought relevant. But it seems possible to go further.
Whereas—at the risk of simplifying a highly complex
topic—interpretations of Aristotle would tend to stress the
co-existence and co-operation of the different causes, or at least of
the material and the final and/or formal, in causal accounts in the
natural world, certain Galenic passages seem to suggest (while making
specific reference to Aristotle) that different types of causal
account may be applicable at different levels within the natural or
biological world. Considering, in the context of this discussion of
bodily mixture, what constitutes perfection in a human being, Galen
states: </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
the man … must not just be at the median of moisture and
dryness, but must also have the best possible construction
[<em>or</em> “shaping”:
<em>diaplasis</em>]—something which is perhaps a consequence of
that good balance of the four elements, but may have some higher cause
of a more divine nature (<em>Temp.</em> I.9, 229); </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
later, he attacks </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
the failure to regard the natural cause of our construction as a
craftsmanlike power, whereby the parts are formed in a way suited to
the characters of our souls, </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
and goes on to claim that Aristotle raised a doubt as to whether this
craftsmanlike power </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
should be attributed to some more divine cause, rather than just to
hot, cold, dry, and wet (<em>Temp.</em> II.6, 261).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
It seems that material causation is adequate in some areas, while
design-based causation needs to be invoked at a higher level, in
particular when one needs to explain animal and in particular human
structures and their operations.</p>

<p>
Whereas one might think (on Aristotelian grounds) that an account in
terms of the elements should be one that would <em>simultaneously</em>
involve a material and a formal or final account, that is, that they
pick out different aspects of the reality, matter always requiring a
certain sort of organization, which corresponds to the formal or final
account—and, further, such a perception is arguably borne out by
<em>QAM</em>, with its suggested equation of bodily mixture with
<em>eidos</em>, implying that formal account will includes material
elements in an appropriate way (see
 <a href="#MindBodyRela">§7.2</a>
 below)—the above-cited texts seem to suggest that there is a
higher-level cause which is added to the material cause in certain
contexts, in particular, those that involve organic and higher-level
structures.</p>

<p>
Relatedly, Galen at times makes a distinction between bodily features
which were intended as part of the primary design or rationale
(<em>kata prōton logon</em>) and those which follow by necessity,
through physical causation, as a by-product of that design
(<em>Temp.</em> II.5, 253; cf. <em>UP</em> XI.14, 534–36 on how
providential design takes account of necessary physical consequences).
Again, the result of such an analysis would seem to be that not all
features of an animal can be equally part of a teleological account,
or not part of it in the same sense. Certain things seem to happen
spontaneously, or to follow unavoidably from the purposive cause,
though not themselves intended.</p>

<p>
This leads us to a broader question. To what extent can lower-level,
elemental, descriptions constitute full accounts of higher-level
phenomena in the body? Two examples might be used to highlight the
question: would a sufficiently full account of the nature of the
mixture of the brain be an exhaustive account of what is happening in
the <em>psychē</em>? And could a sufficiently full account of the
balance of qualities—the most basic physical level—in a
human body constitute an exhaustive account also (i) of its
higher-level constituents, (ii) of the inception and (iii) of the
nature of the diseases that befall the animal in that state, e.g., of
a particular fever, or other disease state?</p>

<p>
We shall return to the former question under
 <a href="#MindBodyRela">§7.2</a>.
 The answer to the latter is complex, partly because of tendency for
different conceptual areas to be discussed separately (e.g., the
accounts of the composition and “mixture”
(<em>krasis</em>) of the human body, though it includes an account of
“bad-mixtures” (<em>duskrasiai</em>), is separate from
that of fevers, or of melancholy).</p>

<p>
But the three subsections of this question may yield somewhat
different answers. (i) Galen clearly distinguishes three levels of
bodily analysis: qualities/elements, humours and homoeomerous or
uniform parts and organs. (Humours, such as blood or bile, are in a
sense uniform, although in a more detailed distinction of levels, they
constitute a further layer, between elements and uniform parts, see
<em>Hipp. Elem.</em> 8, 126–7.) Here, too, Galen is heavily
indebted to Aristotle (in particular to book II of the <em>Parts of
Animals</em>). A formulation which Galen uses in relation to this
three-level analysis is that the organic parts arise from the
“composition, amount, magnitude and shaping” of the
uniform parts, which in turn depend on a correct balance of the
elements hot, cold, wet and dry (<em>San. Tu.</em> I.1, 3). It seems
clear, although it is not always explicitly stated, that analysis at
the organic level should, in principle, involve the teleological
cause; as we have seen, this may not always be the case of analysis at
lower levels, though Galen is exercised by the problem of how
biological substances or low-level organisms contain within them the
principles which bring about the relevant teleological or functional
aims (see further
 <a href="#Form">§6.2</a>).</p>
 

<p>
In the pathological area it seems more difficult to see the relevance
of the teleological cause. (ii) Galen does seems to think that a
sufficiently full account of the internal and external low-level
conditions should be fully predictive of the disease outcome (this,
then, will be a question of understanding in sufficient detail the
predisposing and antecedent causes). (iii) Certainly fevers are hot
diseases and, moreover, their individual differences—as well as
the treatment indicated—are to a considerable extent explicable
in terms of the terminology of the fundamental qualities. Yet once
they take hold, they function according to a complex rationale (Galen
sometimes uses the term <em>idea</em>, “form” or
“structure”, related to the Aristotelian term for form,
<em>eidos</em>, in reference to such disease entities) and appear to
have their own causal powers; the best interpretation of the Galenic
picture may, however, well be that such powers would in theory (via
some complex hypothetical account which Galen understandably does not
feel the need to consider) be fully explicable in terms of the states
and interactions of fundamental qualities.</p>

<p>
It is worth pursuing this line of enquiry a little further, in
relation to Galen’s account of primary and secondary properties
and of emergent properties. On the one hand, all properties
discernible by the senses can be understood on the basis of the
primary qualities that exist at the elemental level. On the other, it
is an essential part of Galen’s theory of the composition of
living bodies from elements that there are qualitatively different
properties at higher levels—that there are, in our terms,
emergent properties. The fact that we experience pain and sensation,
whereas elemental bodies do not, shows that there has been a
fundamental transformation in their nature, in the process of the
composition of higher-level bodies from lower-level ones. In
principle, then, we might think, the fact that hot, cold, wet and dry
are the relevant explanatory terms at the lowest level would not
necessarily mean that they are helpful terms at the highest
level—that of everyday experience. After all, we talk in
perceptual terms of substances being sharp, acidic, bitter,
etc.—and indeed Galen talks in such terms—without in each
case finding it important to give the causal explanation of those
secondary properties in elemental terms. More than that: we might
expect it to be the case that the use of these elemental terms was
simply not helpful or relevant, precisely because of the Galenic
theorization, just noted, of higher-level or secondary qualities as
different in their nature from those elemental ones.</p>

<p>
Yet what is striking is that in spite of that theoretical apparatus,
which would in principle mean that one might abandon talk in terms of
hot, cold, wet and dry at higher levels of explanation—in
particular, in the advanced medical realm of disease description and
treatment—precisely these terms remain the central ones. Other
descriptive and experiential terms are used, of course; but what is
remarkable is that, precisely in that area where Galen makes his most
elaborate attempt to classify substances according to their properties
and effects, namely in his extremely lengthy accounts of
drugs—accounts which include, one should add, a significant
element of quantificatory analysis—the “scientific”
terms of description remain precisely these: hot, cold, wet and dry.
</p>

<h2 id="PhysTheoBiolConc">6. Physical Theory and Biological Concepts</h2>

<p>
We have already considered Galen’s physical analysis in the
broader context of his causal theory, as well as in relation to his
notions of demonstration. This section will give some further detail
on that physical theory, considering further aspects of Galen’s
account of change in the physical and biological world, as well as the
relevance of the concepts of form and matter, of substance, and of
powers.</p>

<h3 id="ElemPrinMatt">6.1 Elements, Principles, Matter</h3>

<p>
For Galen the fundamental constituents or elements
(<em>stoicheia</em>) of physical bodies are the hot, the cold, the wet
and the dry. It is also legitimate to state that the elements are
fire, air, water and earth; this alternative choice Galen tends to
present as philosophically unimportant: it is just a question of
whether one prefers to talk in terms of qualities
(<em>poiotētes</em>, i.e., the hot, etc.) or of bodies
(<em>sōmata</em>, i.e., fire, etc.).</p>

<p>
Although he describes this difference as largely one of presentation,
the alternative formulation in terms of the cosmic elements (fire,
earth, air, water) is important for Galen, because it is central to
his argument that the only coherent way in which a theory of elements
in the body can be understood is in terms of the <em>extremes</em> of
qualities; and, further, that (since, e.g., the extreme of hot is
fire) such an understanding automatically entails the equivalence of
those elements in the body with the elements outside the body, in the
cosmos: fire, earth, air and water.</p>

<p>
In fact, there is some complexity in Galen’s precise view of
elements, and in particular as to the relationship of fire, air,
earth, water (which henceforward, for convenience, I shall term
“element-bodies”) with hot, cold, wet, dry (henceforward,
“element-qualities”). Although at times he uses the term
<em>stoicheia</em> for both element-bodies and element-qualities, in
his most detailed account, in <em>HNH</em> (I.3; cf. <em>Hipp.
Elem.</em> 6, esp. 112–16), he clarifies that properly speaking
the former are elements, <em>stoicheia</em>, in the sense that they
cannot be physically separated into anything else, but that they are
further <em>conceptually</em> divisible into different
“principles” (<em>archai</em>): specifically, each of the
element-bodies (<em>stoicheia</em>) must be understood as the outcome
of the reception into a substrate, quality-less matter, of the extreme
of a particular quality (that is, the element-qualities).
Galen’s element theory seems in many respects closely modelled
on Aristotle’s; but at this point he adopts terminology
(quality-less matter = <em>apoios hulē</em>) which is Stoic in
origin; the presence of an analogous concept is much less clear in
Aristotle. Moreover, the precise relationship between specific
element-bodies and specific element-qualities is somewhat confusing,
both in terms of Galen’s explicit discussions of it and in terms
of the relationship of his model to the Aristotelian and Stoic
ones.</p>

<p>
To summarize in an interpretively difficult area: Stoic theory has each
element-body corresponding to the extreme of <em>one</em>
element-quality (fire to the hot, etc.); Galen not only seems at times
to highlight such one-to-one correspondences, focussing on the
element-bodies as instantiating the element-qualities in their
“uncombined and unmixed” states; such associations also
seem epistemologically or heuristically crucial for the establishment
of certain features of the human body and their relationship with the
external world: the theoretical extreme of hot automatically leads one
to the concept of fire, for example. On the other hand, it seems clear
from certain passages in <em>Hipp. Elem.</em> and <em>HNH</em> that
Galen remains committed to the Aristotelian view (as outlined in
<em>De generatione et corruptione</em>), whereby each element-body
arises from a <em>pairing</em> of element-qualities (though he does
not seem to follow the Aristotelian doctrine that one element-quality
is <em>dominant</em> in each of these pairings, rather describing each
as present in extreme form).</p>

<p>
Finally, in relation to Galen’s element theory, one should
consider the distinction between the more active and the more passive
elements. This (again Aristotelian) distinction seems not, in general,
to be a feature of the Galenic elements; yet it does play a role in
the account of the purposive construction of the body, whereby the hot
and the cold function as instruments, the dry and the wet as mere
material, for the Craftsman (see above,
 <a href="#CausNatuWorlTeleDemiMate">§5.2</a>).</p>
 
<h3 id="Form">6.2 Form</h3>

<p>
In the description of higher-level bodies—that of animals, in
particular—one must invoke the concept of their form
(<em>eidos</em>). Again we have a Galenic version of an Aristotelian
concept, with form understood as opposed to matter, on the one hand,
and to the broader classificatory category, <em>genos</em>, on the
other.</p>

<p>
Form, we have seen, is a structural concept which for Galen is closely
related to the notion of design and teleological explanation: a
successful account of how the structure of a body is “for the
better” will simultaneously involve an account of its form,
i.e., of the particular way in which matter is purposefully structured
within that body.</p>

<p>
The precise way in which form relates to matter, however, is complex
and resists easy summation. We might rather point to a few contexts in
which Galen invokes form in physical explanations. In embryology, form
represents the component of design (in modern terms, of information)
which is transmitted to the embryo from the parents, as opposed to the
matter out of which it is constructed. It thus becomes an explicit
question (problematized in different ways both in the early text
<em>Sem.</em> and in the late one <em>Foet. Form.</em>), <em>how</em>
the form is present in the matter, and what is the nature of the
process of interaction. In the former text, for example, the process
crucially involves the interaction of <em>pneuma</em> (breath,
containing the formal element) and blood (containing the appropriate
matter); and a distinction is made between <em>ousia</em> (in the
material sense) and the power that moves and shapes it.</p>

<p>
In the account of the different physical composition of different
animals and human beings in <em>Temp.</em>, meanwhile, <em>eidos</em>
is the term used to refer to different species—each of which has
its own different internal organization and range of typical
qualities. This has a particular importance for accurate physical
description, especially of the kind relevant for the doctor: it is by
reference to this <em>eidos</em> that we meaningfully apply adjectives
such as hot or cold to a body. It is not relevant whether they are hot
or cold in some abstract sense, in relation to the whole cosmos, nor
whether they possess those properties by comparison with members of a
different <em>eidos</em>. The assessment of those qualities must be
carried out in relation to a theoretical midpoint specific to that
creature’s <em>eidos</em>, which will have its own possible
range of mixtures, as well as its own optimal mixture. Mixtures
themselves can be classified according to their <em>eidos</em>; and
this same classificatory terminology (we might here use a term like
“types”) may be applied also to such other theoretical items as diseases. And
in <em>QAM</em> (see below,
 <a href="#MindBodyRela">§7.2</a>)
 it is stated, with Aristotelian authority (or perhaps rather: the
view is attributed to the school of Aristotle), that form, in the
context of a certain level of biological analysis, means the same as
mixture; and that this level of biological analysis is that relevant
to the soul itself.</p>

<h3 id="MixtChan">6.3 Mixture and Change</h3>

<p>
The coming-to-be of different physical substances in the world, as
well as their various properties, is explained through the concept of
mixture (<em>krasis</em>). Every physical thing in the world, in
particular the biological world, is composed from mixtures of the
fundamental elements; they are thus appropriately described in terms
of the predominance of one or more qualities (hot, cold, etc.) within
the mixture. Galen holds that higher-level properties come about
through the alteration that may take place in this process of mixture;
at the same time, the fundamental, low-level properties—hot,
cold, wet and dry—which predominate in a given body remain
powerful explanantia of its nature, at the macroscopic, perceptible
level too; and this applies, for example, both to human bodies and to
the various things they may eat and drink, including both food
substances and drugs.</p>

<p>
We should say a little more about the nature of mixture and change. As
in many areas, Galen here tries to avoid some particular intricate and
unanswerable metaphysical debates, while insisting on certain fixed
points. One of the latter, as we have seen, is the four-element
theory; another is the understanding of the physical world as a
continuum, rather than as some set of bodies interspersed with void.
As to the nature of the change that takes place in mixture:
<em>krasis</em> must be understood to be a process in which the
elements involved undergo some fundamental change; it is not a mere
placing alongside each other of tiny quanta of different substances
(as might happen in mixing two powders), whereby those substances
themselves remain in principle capable of being separated, and retain
their original properties. What happens, rather, is that a new
substance arises with distinct properties, and the smallest imaginable
quantum of this new substance would have those distinct properties,
not those of the elements from which it was mixed.</p>

<p>
Here Galen again draws on Stoic terminology, and talks of the
“total mixture” (<em>krasis di’ holōn</em>). In
Stoic theory, this “total mixture” involves the notion
that the two bodies mixed in this particular way co-inhabit one space.
Galen does not commit himself on the precise metaphysical description,
but seems to prefer the formulation that the <em>qualities</em>
(<em>poiotētes</em>) undergo total mixture while the bodies do
not.</p>

<p>
This, then, is Galen’s account of how a new type of substance
comes about through the combination of two other substances. And here
he makes the distinction between the kind of change where a substance
affects another in just one or other of its qualities—heating
it, for example, or heating it and drying it—and another,
observed particularly in the assimilation of food, which involves
change <em>in respect of the whole substance</em> (<em>kath’
holēn tēn ousian</em>, and similar expressions); the distinction is
elaborated in <em>Temp.</em> (III.1, 270; III.4, 277; cf. <em>Hipp.
Elem.</em> 9, 132–9), as well as in Galen’s theoretical
work on the action of drugs, <em>SMT</em>, III.4); at <em>Prop.
Plac.</em> (9, 84–7), he talks of the “specificity”
or “specific quality” (<em>idiotēs</em>) of the substance
considered as a whole. This specific quality, apparently, inheres in
the substance, as something separate from its components; we might say that Galen here comes
close to articulating a notion of emergent properties: such an
<em>idiotēs</em> marks the substance out as qualitatively distinct
from the substances that went into its composition.</p>

<h3 id="SubsPowe">6.4 Substances and Powers</h3>

<p>
This leads us to a more focussed discussion of the notion of
substance, <em>ousia</em>, and also the role in Galen’s
explanations of powers or capacities (<em>dunameis</em>). The
discussion of <em>ousia</em> in Galen is complex, because he uses the
term both to refer to material stuffs of various kinds (as in the
everyday contemporary English usage of the term
“substance”, and in an Aristotelian metaphysical sense, to
refer to something’s essence, what it defintionally is (see
above,
 <a href="#DemoApodTheoPrac">§3.1</a>).
 Thus, <em>ousia</em> is used as synonymous with matter
(<em>hulē</em>), and contrasted with form, in the embryological
treatise <em>Sem.</em>; but the question, “what is the
<em>ousia</em> of the soul?” admits of non-materialist as well
as materialist answers.</p>

<p>
While the question of Galen’s conception of <em>ousia</em> is
complex and under-researched, involving a huge number of potentially
relevant texts, one line of interpretation that seems plausible is
that this very homonymy is in fact significant for Galen’s
metaphyics: that is to say, that although the Aristotelian sense of
<em>ousia</em> is in principle distinct from the
“everyday”, material one, there may be a tendency in Galen
to elide the two usages, to conceive the answer to the question of
something’s <em>ousia</em> in physical terms.</p>

<p>
In either case, different <em>ousiai</em> are items that are
definitionally different, different types of thing, not just
qualitatively different versions or sub-categories of one thing. A
relevant example is that of the three parts of the Platonic tripartite
soul. Although typically referred to as different capacities
(<em>dunameis</em>), it is more correct to state that they are three
different substances (<em>ousiai</em>)—partly because, in fact,
each one of them itself has a number of capacities (<em>PHP</em> VI.3,
374–5; cf. <em>QAM</em> 2, 377 and 4, 386). And, as we have
seen, the notion of a change “in the whole substance” as
opposed to a mere change in qualities is an important one in
Galen’s physics; this gives an account of one type of
thing’s turning into another.</p>

<p>
So, a substance has capacities. This is important for Galen because it
provides him with a way of formulating his natural philosophy in
opposition to either Atomism (random motions of bodies which are
themselves indistinguishable in their properties) or mechanism, in
particular the view attributed to Erasistratus that all processes in
the body can be causally reduced to the mechanical principle of
<em>horror vacui</em> (<em>pros to kenoumenon akolouthia</em>)—a
view attacked at length in <em>Nat. Fac.</em></p>

<p>
Rather, Galen insists, bodies (or substances) in the natural world
have distinct <em>capacities</em>; in particular, there are four such
capacities shared by all plant and animal bodies, the actions of which
account for biological functions such as nutrition in a way which
Atomist or mechanist views cannot. These capacities are: attractive,
retentive, alterative, expulsive (e.g., <em>Nat. Fac.</em>
III.4–8; <em>UP</em> IV.7; <em>Temp.</em> III.1,
269–70).</p>

<p>
Again, we may think in terms of emergent properties: how these natural
capacities come about is not something that Galen is able to explain
in detail, but they are properties of higher-level bodies which are
not present in the elements, and must somehow arise in the former
through the process of composition from the latter. (These latter also
have capacities, but fundamental ones: fire has the capacity of
heating, water of moistening, etc.) It is noteworthy that in a passage
already cited (<em>Prop. Plac.</em> 9, 84–7) the
“internal management” (<em>dioikein</em>) of the parts
according to the natural capacities is closely related to this notion
of activities or functions belonging to a part of the body “in
virtue of its whole substance”.</p>

<p>
Galenic explanations in terms of capacities risk appearing circular;
indeed, their post-Galenic descendants were famously mocked as such by
Molière. Galen in fact admits openly that the statement that a
substance or body “has an <i>f</i>-ic capacity” does not
add anything to the statement that that substance or body “is
capable of <i>f</i>-ing” (<em>QAM</em> 2, 377), even adding that
“we use the term ‘capacity’ when we do not know the
substance (<em>ousia</em>!) of the active cause” (<em>Nat.
Fac.</em> I.4).</p>

<p>
The statement that bodies have capacities, then, can be understood
simply as the acknowledgement of the existence of tendencies to
perform specific activities of functional relevance for the organism.
For Galen, of course, this acknowledgement is intimately linked with
the assertion of purposive design and the denial that Atomism or
mechanism could ever give a satisfactory account of such
properties.</p>

<p>
We can, however, go a little further, and state that there are points,
at least, where Galen attempts to give some more concrete account of
what a capacity is or how it works. At <em>Praes. Puls.</em> II.9,
305–6, he states that “the substance (<em>ousia</em>) of a
capacity is nothing other than a certain mixture”. And we might
relate that formulation to the central, if not definitional, role
given to mixture in the account of the soul’s capacities (see
 <a href="#MindBodyRela">§7.2</a>).</p>
 
<h2 id="Mind">7. Philosophy of Mind</h2>

<p>
Galen’s work on the “soul” (<em>psychē</em>) is
amongst the most interesting aspects of his philosophical-medical
output, and has attracted considerable scholarly attention in the last
40 years (see esp. Gill 2010, Singer 2013, with extensive further
bibliography); at the same time it is an area beset with interpretive
complexities. Galen’s moral psychology, or philosophy of mind,
bases itself strongly on Plato, while also attempting to do justice to
the contemporary state of knowledge in anatomy and physiology, and
also taking on much from both philosophical and medical traditions
which tie the <em>psychē</em> and its pathology closely to a theory
of elements or humours, classifying or conceptualizing its pathology
in terms of physical imbalances of the body (especially of the
brain).</p>

<p>
These complexities, and difficulties of interpretation, have led some
to talk of the uneasy co-existence of different “models of the
soul” in Galen (see Manuli 1986, 1988; Singer 2013:
18–33). Certainly, any study of Galen’s theoretical
accounts of the soul must involve an analysis of many different texts,
both those specifically devoted to the theory of the <em>psychē</em>,
and ones which touch on it in a wide range of different contexts
(physiological, pathological, dietetic, pharmacological); it must also take account of the fact that these
texts belong to quite different technical genres and draw upon a
variety of traditions, intellectual approaches and specialist concepts
and vocabularies; and of the fact that the focus of the argument is radically
different in some of these different contexts. Again, in any attempt
to summarize Galen’s “philosophy of mind”, the
caution should be made that his primary motivation and intellectual
concern throughout nearly all these texts are those of the practising
physician, not those of the theoretical philosopher.</p>

<h3 id="ModePsyc">7.1 Model(s) of the <em>psychē</em></h3>

<p>
Galen is strongly Platonist in central areas of his thought; this
applies in particular to his moral psychology, where he adopts the
Platonic division of the soul into rational and non-rational parts,
the latter being further divided into the spirited
(<em>thumoeides</em>) and the desiderative (<em>epithumētikon</em>).
This fundamental rational/non-rational distinction, and the further
one between the two non-rational parts, are for Galen essential to a
correct conceptualization of the soul and its internal workings, and
in particular to a correct approach to ethics (see further
 <a href="#Ethi">§8</a>
 below).</p>

<p>
Yet Platonic tripartition is also central to Galen’s physiology
of the whole body. The three parts—rational, spirited,
desiderative—correspond to and are located in, respectively, the
brain, the heart and the liver. These are the central organs in
Galen’s physiology, responsible respectively for: rational
thought, perception and voluntary motion; involuntary motions
(especially pulse and respiration) necessary to the maintenance of
life; and blood-production and nutrition. Galen’s adaptation of
the Platonic tripartite soul theory is strikingly original and
intellectually ambitious. (He finds explicit textual justification for
these bodily locations of the soul parts in a passage from
Plato’s <em>Timaeus</em>—although that text is primarily
concerned to give an ethically normative account of the internal
balance of the soul, not to advance a serious or detailed
physiology.)</p>

<p>
We might thus think that, according to this scheme, the
<em>psychē</em> properly belongs within just <em>one</em> part of the
“tripartite soul”, that located in the brain; and indeed
Galen does also (especially in anatomical-physiological contexts) use
<em>psychē</em> and its cognates in this narrower sense to refer to
the brain and its functions.</p>

<p>
There may seem to be a problematic relationship between the tripartite
soul as it is discussed in Galen’s specific ethical works, in
particular <em>Aff. Pecc. Dig.</em>, and this physiological conception
(e.g., in <em>PHP</em>). The former ethical discussions give no
significant account of a bodily aspect to psychic function, while in
the latter context certain features central to that ethical account
are absent or recede. The internal interrelation of the parts, so
essential to the ethical account (see below) is not only absent from
the physiological account; it is quite difficult to see how it could
be mapped onto it.</p>

<p>
The Greek <em>psychē</em> is a broader concept than can be equated
with either “mind” or “soul”: it is the vital
principle—that the presence of which accounts for life in the
body—<em>as well as</em> more specifically the locus of thought
and moral activity. All vital activities, in this sense, can be
defined as “of the <em>psychē</em>”, which is thus
responsible for both (in our terms) mental and physical function. The
<em>hēgemonikon</em> is responsible for intellectual activity and
memory, for voluntary motion and for perception; and each of these is
also to be understood in terms of brain and/or nerve function. It is
tempting, in view of the correlations that Galen explores, both
between the functioning of the rational soul and states of the brain,
and between emotional disturbances and states or activities of the
heart and blood, to see him as advancing either some form of dual
aspect theory or, indeed, a mind-body identity theory. It seems clear,
however, that Galen does not in any clear or consistent way elaborate
such a clear or unified scheme (see further
 <a href="#MindBodyRela">§7.2</a>).</p>
 

<p>
It is important to understand the anatomical-medical, as opposed to
narrowly philosophical, background here. Galen’s theory is
heavily influenced by the work of the Hellenistic medical authors
Herophilus and Erasistratus (third century BCE). This crucially
included the discovery of the nervous system, as well as some detailed
knowledge and theorization of the anatomy and functions of the brain
(all, of course, quite unknown to Plato, with whose theory Galen
attempts to harmonize them); see von Staden 2000. Galen’s
conception of brain, heart and liver as “sources”
(<em>archai</em>) of the three Platonic parts of the soul is
inextricably linked with his anatomical understanding of the three
sets of channels (nerves, arteries, veins) through which they
operate.</p>

<p>
It is also significant that Galen equates Plato’s
<em>logistikon</em> (“rational”) with the
<em>hēgemonikon</em> (“leading-part”): the concepts are
(in origin at least) distinct and derive from different conceptions of
the soul<em>.</em> The latter is a Stoic term, although probably also
prominent in the Hellenistic medical authors just mentioned: it is the
notion of a single “command centre” for the soul, which
communicates to the rest of the body, both receiving the information
of the different sense organs and giving the command (in Stoic
language, the assent) for voluntary actions. Such a single command
centre is not (at least explicitly) present in Plato; similarly,
such a physically centralized psychic concept is at best vaguely
present in Aristotle.</p>

<p>
Galen is centrally concerned to refute the Stoic view of the
<em>hēgemonikon</em> as located in the heart, as against the
Platonic-Galenic view of its location in the brain. In the process,
while asserting his allegiance to Platonic thought on the soul, it is
at least arguable that he adopts a unitary view of the soul and its
“command centre” which is conceptually much closer to the
Stoic one (on this point see Gill 2010).</p>

<h3 id="MindBodyRela">7.2 The Mind-Body Relation</h3>

<p>
Yet it is not quite as simple as that. The physical location of the
other two Platonic soul-parts, spirited and desiderative
(respectively, heart and liver) <em>are</em> important in
Galen’s theory of the <em>psychē</em>—and not just of the
<em>psychē</em> understood as responsible for vital functions. Galen
is not able to make the same close connection, at least
demonstratively (see
 <a href="#DemoApodTheoPrac">§3.1</a>),
 between these other two bodily locations and their psychological
functions as he is for that of the brain; nevertheless, the fact that
the <em>thumoeides</em>—a range of emotional reactions related
to anger, indignation, shame, pride, anxiety, fear—is located in
the heart is shown by a number of examples, both from everyday
experience and from traditional thought.</p>

<p>
Galen exemplifies and expounds this view at length in his refutation
of Chrysippus in <em>PHP</em> II and III; such relationships between
physical states and mental ones are also explored in a range of
medical texts too (see Singer forthcoming). Galen makes (interestingly
precise) attempts at identifying physical correlates for a range of
psychological or emotional states, in terms of the precise actions and
states of heart or blood; yet the texts in question are unclear on the
precise nature of the causal (or identity) relationship. Relevant here
too are the medical discussions in which it is clearly implied that
certain types of physical state—e.g., excess of melancholic
humours—are causative, if not constitutive, of certain mental
states.</p>

<p>
The strongest case for a mind-body identity theory in Galen, however,
is provided by the discussion of the relationship between rational
soul and physical features of the brain, especially in <em>QAM.</em>
The central aim of that work is to demonstrate the extent of the
influence of the body, specifically bodily mixture, on the soul; this
Galen does with examples from medicine (e.g., mental derangements with
physical causes) as well as everyday experience (drunkenness, effects
of physical environment). How, he asks, could a soul which is not
corporeal be be affected by such physical factors, and indeed be
caused to leave the body as a result of certain physical conditions
(<em>QAM</em> 3, 381)? In a number of passages, he suggests not just
the dependence of the soul on bodily mixture, but the identity of the
two:</p>

<ul class="sentag tag2em">

<li><span class="tag">(a)</span><span class="sen"> “Aristotle
says that the soul is form of the body … it is necessary for
him to posit the mixture of these qualities [<em>sc.</em> of matter]
as the form, so that it seems as if the substance of the soul …
will be some mixture …” (<em>QAM</em> 3,
380–1);</span></li>

<li><span class="tag">(b) </span><span class="sen"> ” …
if the reasoning form of the soul is mortal, it too will be a
particular mixture, namely of the brain” (ibid.);</span></li>

<li><span class="tag">(c) </span><span class="sen"> “… it
is better to state … that the mortal part of the soul actually
<em>is</em> precisely this: the mixture of the body”
(<em>QAM</em> 4, 386);</span></li>

<li><span class="tag">(d) </span><span class="sen"> “Andronicus
… says that [the soul] is either a mixture or a capacity
dependent on the mixture; I disapprove of the addition of
‘capacity’ … it is not possible to say anything
other than the mixture …” (ibid.). </span></li>
</ul>

<p>
On this basis, some have taken mind-body identity as representing
Galen’s final position. A consideration of all the relevant
evidence, however, leads to a less clear-cut picture. The apparently
clearest identity statements ((a) and (d) above) come in dialectical
contexts; it is at least arguable that Galen is here asserting the
identity position not as his own but as the correct
<em>Aristotelian</em> conclusion, on the basis of their equation of
soul with form. (It should also be mentioned that the passages in
question are not free from textual and interpretive problems.)
Passages (b) and (c), meanwhile, clearly affirm the identity of the
<em>mortal</em> parts of the soul with bodily mixtures. Now, this
certainly includes the non-rational parts; but, within this same text,
even after (d), Galen leaves open the Platonic possibility that the
(rational) soul is a non-bodily substance. As we have seen
 (<a href="#LimiPurpKnow">§3.4</a>),
 such indeterminacy is consistent with his explicit statements of
ignorance—including in texts later than <em>QAM</em>—on
this very question, the “substance of the soul”. (Those
other statements do not in fact specify that it is only the
<em>rational</em> soul that is at issue; but, as we have seen, Galen
may (somewhat confusingly) use “<em>psychē</em>” with
that narrower reference.) Other relevant evidence is the lack of
clarity, in the medical texts mentioned above, as to the causal
relation between mental events and physical correlates; and that some
kind of interactionist picture seems implied by statements about the
mutually beneficial relationship of soul and body and of their
respective training (especially in <em>San. Tu.</em>, e.g., I.8,
19–21).</p>

<p>
<em>QAM</em> also contains a striking statement of the problem of
physical determinism versus moral responsibility: how can someone
properly be praised or blamed for character qualities, when these are
derived not “from himself” but from bodily mixture?
(<em>QAM</em> 11, 405). This historically distinctive formulation
seems to rely on a definite and uncompromising physicalist view;
again, however, the statement in this form is unique within the
Galenic corpus.</p>

<p>
Any attempt to summarize Galen’s philosophy in this area risks
failing to do justice to his own plurality of formulations. Two
things, at least, are uncontentious: that he makes a strong statement
of the extent to which mental capacities are physically conditioned;
and that he explores the subject in an empirically and physiologically
informed manner unique within Graeco-Roman thought.</p>

<h2 id="Ethi">8. Ethics</h2>

<h3 id="OverModeAppr">8.1 Overall Model and Approach</h3>

<p>
Galen’s theoretical ethics is closely related to his Platonist
conception of the soul. Central is the view that rational and
non-rational psychic capacities must be treated separately, both in
terms of early discipline and education and in terms of our
conceptualization and treatment of their pathologies.
Virtues—although a full or systematic account of these is
elusive—may be understood, Platonically, as consisting in the
proper functioning of each soul part, and in the proper internal
relationship of the parts within the whole. The non-rational
(<em>alogon</em>), if not subject to the discipline of the rational,
will lead the soul into <em>pathos</em> (“affection” or
“passion”), causing actions of uncontrolled greed,
lustfulness or anger. This part is not accessible to rational
discourse, but must rather be subjected to a process of training and
habituation which will make its appetites appropriate. Within the
non-rational, however, there is the further division into desiderative
(<em>epithumētikon</em>) and spirited (<em>thumoeides</em>); although
non-rational (and in undisciplined cases the cause of uncontrolled
rage), the latter also has an instinctive reaction of indignation
against wrongdoing and shameful behaviour, and can so be made the ally
of the rational in carrying out the discipline of the desiderative
part. (This complex relationship within the tripartite soul
enables—for Galen as for Plato—an account of how certain
non-rational drives, in particular reactions of shame and indignation,
may be in conflict with other non-rational drives, e.g., lust or
greed.)</p>

<p>
In <em>Aff. Pecc. Dig.</em>, <em>Ind.</em> and <em>Mor</em>., Galen
strongly suggests—in a way consistent with Platonic and
Aristotelian perceptions—that early habituation and discipline,
as well as the right natural endowments, are crucial to the production
of this appropriate level of desires and right relationship between
rational and non-rational drives within the soul. (There are also
quite close Platonic echoes in his commitment to various forms of
early mathematical and musical training.) At the same time, he
describes in some detail, especially in <em>Aff. Pecc. Dig.</em> I, a
process of moral self-discipline, involving elements of
“cognitive therapy”, which may assist even the mature
person prone to <em>pathos</em> and to distress to remedy his or her
faults. The texts stand within a tradition of works on ethical therapy
and self-improvement, exemplified by such authors as Plutarch, Marcus
Aurelius, Epictetus and Seneca; they offer a range of practical
approaches: daily self-monitoring; adjustment of one’s
expectations; the co-option of a neutral observer to give an objective
assessment of the level of one’s faults and of one’s
progress.</p>

<p>
The focus is on the reduction or elimination of one’s
<em>pathē</em>; here, in spite of the Platonist psychological
framework, Galen is engaging in a discourse developed especially by
Stoic authors, and to some extent adopting their technical language.
This observation leads us on to some further consideration of
Galen’s views and their relationship with the contemporary
ethical discourse.</p>

<h3 id="Path">8.2 The <em>pathē</em></h3>

<p>
A standard point of school conflict in the ethical discourse of
Galen’s time was that between the Stoic insistence on the need
for <em>total</em> eradication of the affections (related to the
doctrinal position that any giving-in to <em>pathos</em> is in fact a
form of madness) and the Platonic-Aristotelian advocacy of a
“moderate level of affectedness” (<em>metriopatheia</em>).
It is perhaps significant that this technical term, employed by
Galen’s “Middle Platonist” contemporaries, does not
appear in his own extant ethics; and indeed, much of the discourse of
both <em>Aff. Pecc. Dig.</em> and <em>Ind.</em> seems consistent with
the aim of <em>eradication</em> of the <em>pathē</em>. On the other
hand, Galen comes down against the necessity of total eradication,
especially in <em>Ind.</em>; here, explicitly engaging with this
ethical question, Galen denies that he could be happy inside the Bull
of Phalaris (a notorious instrument of torture as well as a stock
Epicurean philosophical example), and takes issue with the Stoic
Musonius for his reported welcoming of adversity.</p>

<p>
On the one hand, Galen imposes very high standards in this area,
claiming himself to have been “completely undistressed” by
the fire in which he lost a huge number of valuables, including a
major part of his own writings; in another sense, he manifests a
realistic and down-to-earth approach, asserting that freedom from
distress is possible so long as certain basic human needs are met. He
acknowledges that certain circumstances might deprive him of his moral
equilibrium—exile, for example, or injustice visited upon a
friend—and hopes not to encounter those.</p>

<p>
There is a broader point about <em>pathos</em>: in Aristotle the term
is ethically neutral, referring to emotive or non-rational experience
quite generally; thus, in the <em>Nicomachean Ethics</em>, virtues may
be understood as involving a mean, between an excessive and an
inadequate emotive response. Both the Aristotelian picture and the
term <em>metriopatheia</em> entail an understanding of <em>pathos</em>
as not in itself negative; Galen’s understanding of
<em>pathos</em>, in the ethical context, seems rather in accord with
the Stoic conception: it is in its nature undesirable, to be reduced
or eliminated as far as possible—even if he does not follow the
Stoics in asserting the necessity, or indeed practicability, of its
complete eradication.</p>

<p>
Against this, however, it should be observed that Galen adopts an
Aristotelian-type mean theory in relation to <em>physical</em>
excellence; that he suggests, e.g., in <em>QAM</em>, that physical
states of good balance will accord with good ethical states, and that
in at least one passage, in <em>Temp.</em> he invokes something like
an Aristotelian mean theory in talking of this correspondence between
physical and ethical good balance: the soul of the well-balanced man
will “be at an exact balance between boldness and cowardice,
hesitation and rashness, pity and envy” (<em>Temp.</em> II.1,
233).</p>

<h3 id="DistLup">8.3 Distress (<em>lupē</em>)</h3>

<p>
Galen’s approach to the <em>pathē</em> is not systematic, nor
aimed at giving a detailed classification, as were some Stoic
approaches; however, he does share with the Stoics some classificatory
tendencies. He identifies what seems to be an over-arching category of
<em>pathos</em>, that of distress (<em>lupē</em>). Distress has
relevance to a whole range of individual <em>pathē</em>: grief at
loss, envy of another’s greater success or wealth, annoyance at
a servant’s careless behaviour, all may be considered either as
instances of distress or as giving rise to distress. The ethical
project of controlling the <em>pathē</em> can thus to a large extent,
it seems, be understood as the project of avoidance of distress.
“Freedom from distress” (<em>alupia</em>)—the title
of a recently-discovered work which discusses personal experiences and
approaches to the problem in vivid detail (<em>Ind.</em>)—thus
begins to look quite similar to the Stoic aim of
“unaffectedness” (<em>apatheia</em>). Such unaffectedness
- with the caveats already made as to its achievability in all
cases—does indeed seem to be a part of Galen’s ethical
project. The desire to free oneself from distress, it is also
suggested, may provide a practical <em>starting-point</em> for the
ethical project, for the simple reason that no one actually wishes to
live with distress (whereas people may be happy to live with vices
which do not immediately cause this negative experience).</p>

<h3 id="RatiErroGood">8.4 Rational Errors and the Good</h3>

<p>
Galen’s main extant ethical work, <em>Aff. Pecc. Dig.</em>,
explicitly addresses itself to the correction of both affections
(<em>pathē</em>) and errors (<em>hamartēmata</em>)—that is to
say, to the shortcomings of both the non-rational and the rational
part of the soul. Galen is clear that the domain of ethics covers the
identification and correction of both; yet in the latter
area—that of ethical errors of reason—his discussion is
much less clear. He prefers to focus on intellectual error and
inadequate intellectual training more broadly, in a way which seems
more relevant to the discovery of scientific than to that of ethical
truth. Relatedly, it is difficult to find in Galen a clear answer to
the question of the goal of life, or ultimate good for human beings.
What seems clear is that although he regards freedom from
distress—a condition which may seem very similar to Epicurean
“untroubledness” (<em>ataraxia</em>) or Stoic
“unaffectedness”—as a highly desirable state, this
is at best a precondition for the good life, not constitutive of it.
Galen is committed to the notion that human beings have a
“higher” good than that implied in the Epicurean ideal;
and it seems (though there are textual problems in the passages where
he comes closest to addressing the question) that the good may be
formulated (a) in terms of an approach to the divine, and/or (b) in
terms of the human being’s fulfilment of his or her proper
capacities through appropriate activity of body and soul.</p>

<p>
Galen draws on diverse elements in the philosophical tradition, most
specifically the Platonic tripartite soul and the Stoic
<em>pathē</em>, to advance his own distinctive ethical position,
which consists of two conceptually separate (though mutually
reinforcing) elements. First, one’s non-rational drives must be
subjected to appropriate discipline—a discipline which, without
the unrealistic aim of total eradication of the <em>pathē</em>,
nonetheless imposes high normative standards. Secondly, the rational
part of the soul must be properly educated, and must fulfil its
function appropriately; although a clear definition of the “aim
of life” corresponding to the good of this rational part of the
soul is absent (at least from the extant texts), it is at least
strongly implied that scientific or intellectual enquiry constitutes
the most appropriate, or highest, realm for this fulfilment of its
function.</p>

<h2 id="Theo">9. Theology</h2>

<p>
That Galen is some kind of theist is clear. His philosophical theology
is seen especially in texts such as <em>UP</em> and <em>Foet.
Form.</em>, where he argues that the manifest suitedness of biological
organisms and individual structures—especially those observed in
anatomy—to their functions clearly proves their organization by
some extraordinary, even divine, intelligence. In line with his
epistemic caution, however (see
 <a href="#LimiPurpKnow">§3.4</a>
 above), he is not able to be specific about the nature or identity of
this divine intelligence. The key feature of Galen’s theology is
the role it plays in teleological explanation (although, as we have
seen, the teleological account is at times presented in quite
strikingly anthropomorphic terms).</p>

<p>
Yet there are traces of a more specific theological philosophy. The
view of the heavenly bodies as intelligent appears both in
<em>QAM</em> and in <em>UP</em>; and although it is presented in
somewhat vague terms, it motivates specific philosophical arguments.
The heavenly world is transcendently good and superior; yet it has an
influence—at some remove—on our lower world. (The way in
which the heavenly bodies affect our world includes astrological
influence; although this is not a major part of Galen’s thought,
the existence of such influence is explicitly asserted, for example in
<em>Di. Dec</em>.) Consideration of the relationship between the
heavenly realm and our everyday world leads to two specific types of
conclusion: one, that our consciousness of the operation of a higher
intelligence in this lower world should make us aware how much more
admirable and perfect must be its operation in that higher one
(<em>UP</em> XVII.1, 730); two, that there is a problem in imagining
how the highest intelligence could “stoop” to affect the
operations of the lowest level of biological organisms (<em>Foet.
Form.</em> 6, 201).</p>

<p>
Again there is the distinction to be made between the essentials about
which Galen is certain—here, that there is a purposive
intelligence manifest throughout the universe—and the specifics,
speculation about which may lead ultimately to <em>aporia.</em></p>

<p>
Galen also claims to have had personal experience of the interventions
of specific gods within the Greek polytheistic world (most notably of
Asclepius, the god of medicine). If it seems difficult to reconcile
such a conventional, anthropomorphic manifestation of religion with
the philosophical view of God as a teleological cause or as immanent
Nature, it should perhaps be said that such a co-existence of abstract
theology with traditional individual gods is by no means confined to
Galen, amongst Graeco-Roman philosophical writers (one could mention
both Plato and Epictetus in this context). In any case, it is to the
divine intelligence manifest throughout the universe, rather than to
any individual god, that Galen constantly returns; it is this
intelligence which is the object of his religious—and by the
same token of his intellectual, indeed his
scientific—fervour.</p>
