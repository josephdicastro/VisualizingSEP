<div id="preamble">

<p>

Kurt Friedrich Gödel (b. 1906, d. 1978) was one of the principal
founders of the modern, metamathematical era in mathematical logic. He
is widely known for his Incompleteness Theorems, which are among the
handful of landmark theorems in twentieth century mathematics, but his
work touched every field of mathematical logic, if it was not in most
cases their original stimulus. In his philosophical work Gödel
formulated and defended mathematical Platonism, the view that
mathematics is a descriptive science, or alternatively the view that
the concept of mathematical truth is objective. On the basis of that
viewpoint he laid the foundation for the program of conceptual
analysis within set theory (see below).  He adhered to Hilbert's
“original rationalistic conception” in mathematics (as he
called it);<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-1" id="ref-1">1</a>]</sup>
and he was prophetic in anticipating and emphasizing the importance of
large cardinals in set theory before their importance became
clear.</p>

<h2><a name="BioSke">1. Biographical Sketch</a></h2>

<p>

Kurt Gödel was born on April 28, 1906 in what was then the
Austro-Hungarian city of Brünn, and what is now Brno in the Czech
Republic.</p>

<p>

Gödel's father Rudolf August was a businessman, and his mother
Marianne was a well-educated and cultured woman to whom Gödel
remained close throughout his life, as witnessed by the long and
wide-ranging correspondence between them. The family was well off, and
Gödel's childhood was an uneventful one, with one important
exception; namely, from about the age of four Gödel suffered
frequent episodes of poor health, and the health problems he suffered
then as well as others of various kinds were to plague him his entire
life.</p>

<p>

Health problems notwithstanding, Gödel proved to be an exemplary
student at primary school and later the Gymnasium, excelling
especially in mathematics, languages and religion. Upon his graduation
from the Gymnasium in Brno in 1924 Gödel enrolled in the
University of Vienna, attending lectures on physics, his initial field
of interest, lectures on philosophy given by Heinrich Gomperz, and
lectures on mathematics. Gödel took a number of
physics courses during his undergraduate years, as witnessed by his
university transcript; this is notable in view of Gödel's
subsequent contributions to relativity in 1947. Philipp
Furtwängler, cousin of the great German conductor Wilhelm
Furtwängler, was one of his mathematics professors, and indeed
Furtwängler's course on class field theory almost tempted
Gödel to pursue his studies in that area. Gödel learned his
logic from Rudolph Carnap and from Hans Hahn, eventually graduating
under Hahn with a Dr.phil. in mathematics in 1929. The main theorem of
his dissertation was the completeness theorem for first order
logic (Gödel
 1929).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-2" id="ref-2">2</a>]</sup> </p>

<p>

Gödel's university years also marked the beginning of his
attendance at meetings of the Vienna Circle, a group around Moritz
Schlick that quickly became known as “logical positivists,” a term
coined by Feigl and Blumberg in their 1931 “Logical positivism: A new
movement in European philosophy” (Feigl and Blumberg 1931). Though
Gödel was not himself a logical positivist, those discussions
were a crucial formative influence. </p>

<p>

The 1930s were a prodigious decade for Gödel. After publishing his 1929 dissertation
in 1930, he published his groundbreaking incompleteness theorems in
1931, on the basis of which he was granted his Habilitation in 1932
and a Privatdozentur at the University of Vienna in 1933.</p>

<p> Among his mathematical achievements at the decade's close is the
proof of the consistency of both the Axiom of Choice and Cantor's
Continuum Hypothesis with the Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms for set theory,
obtained in 1935 and 1937, respectively. Gödel also published a
number of significant papers on modal and intuitionistic logic and
arithmetic during this period, principal among which is his “On
intuitionistic arithmetic and number theory,” (Gödel
1933e), in which he showed that classical first order arithmetic is
interpretable in Heyting arithmetic by a simple translation. Other
publications of the 1930s include those on the decision problem for
the predicate calculus, on the length of proofs, and on differential
and projective geometry.</p>

<p>

By the end of the decade both Gödel's
advisor Hans Hahn and Moritz Schlick had died (the latter was
assassinated by an ex-student), two events which led to a personal
crisis for Gödel. Also, his appointment at the University,
that of Privatdozentur, was cancelled, being
replaced by the position “Dozentur neuer Ordnung,” granted to
candidates only after they had passed a racial
 test.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-3" id="ref-3">3</a>]</sup>
 Gödel's three trips the United States during that decade
triggered an investigation. (See Sigmund 2006.)  Finally,
Gödel was found fit for military service by the Nazi government
in 1939.</p>

<p> All of these events were decisive in influencing his decision to
leave Austria in 1940, when he and his wife Adele emigrated to the
United States. This long and difficult episode in their life is
recounted by John Dawson in his biography of Gödel called
“Logical Dilemmas,” (Dawson 1997) as well as by Solomon
Feferman in “Gödel's Life and Work,” (Feferman 1986)
to both of which the reader is referred.</p>

<p>

Upon arrival Gödel took up an appointment as an ordinary member
at the Institute for Advanced Study; he would become a permanent
member of the Institute in 1946 and would be granted his professorship
in 1953. (Gödel and his wife were granted American citizenship in
April 1948.) He would remain at the Institute until his retirement in
1976. The Gödels never returned to Europe.</p>

<p>

Gödel's early years at the Institute were notable for his close
friendship with his daily walking partner Albert Einstein, as well as
for his turn to philosophy of mathematics, a field on which Gödel
began to concentrate almost exclusively from about 1943. The initial
period of his subsequent lifelong involvement with philosophy was a
fruitful one (in terms of publications): in 1944 he published his
first philosophical paper, entitled “On Russell's Mathematical Logic”
(Gödel 1944), and in 1947 he published his second, entitled “What
is Cantor's Continuum Hypothesis?” (Gödel 1947).  In 1949 he
published his third, entitled “A Remark on the Relationship between
Relativity Theory and Idealistic Philosophy.” (Gödel 1949a).
The latter paper coincided with results on rotating universes in
relativity he had obtained in 1949, which were first published in an
article entitled: “An Example of a New Type of Cosmological Solutions
of Einstein's Field Equations of Gravitation.” (Gödel 1949).</p>

<p>

Among Gödel's other significant philosophical works of the 1940's
must be counted his 1941 lecture  entitled “In What Sense is
Intuitionistic Logic Constructive?” (Gödel *1941) in which the
notion: “computable function of finite type” is introduced. A paper
based on the ideas in the lecture entitled “Über eine bisher noch
nicht benützte Erweiterung des finiten Standpunktes,” was
published only in 1958, and the interpretation of Heyting arithmetic
into the quantifier free calculus <em>T</em> in it became known as the “Dialectica
Interpretation,” after the journal in which the article was published
(Gödel 1958).  (For the revision of it from 1972, see Gödel
1995.) Finally the decade saw the beginning of Gödel's intensive
study of Leibniz, which, Gödel reports, occupied the period from
1943 to
 1946.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-4" id="ref-4">4</a>]</sup></p>

<p>

The 1950s saw a deepening of Gödel's involvement with philosophy:
In 1951 Gödel delivered a philosophical lecture at Brown
University, usually referred to as the Gibbs Lecture, entitled “Some
Basic Theorems on the Foundations of Mathematics and Their
Philosophical Implications” (Gödel *1951). From 1953 to 1959
Gödel worked on a submission to the Schilpp volume on Rudolf
Carnap entitled “Is Mathematics a Syntax of Language?” (Gödel
*1953/9-III, Gödel *1953/9-V). Gödel published neither of
these two important manuscripts in his lifetime, although both would
appear on two lists which were found in the Gödel Nachlass,
entitled “Was ich publizieren könnte.” (In English: “What I
could publish.” Both manuscripts eventually appeared in Gödel
1995.)  By the decade's close Gödel developed a serious interest in
 phenomenology.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-5" id="ref-5">5</a>]</sup></p>

<p>

Gödel's final years are notable for his circulation of two
manuscripts: “Some considerations leading to the probable
conclusion that the true power of the continuum is
ℵ<sub>2</sub>,” (Gödel *1970a, *1970b) his attempt
to derive the value of the continuum from the so-called scale axioms
of Hausdorff, and his “Ontologischer Beweis,” (Gödel
*1970) which he entrusted to Dana Scott in 1970 (though it appears to
have been written earlier).  Taken together, the two manuscripts are
the fitting last words of someone who, in a fifty year involvement
with mathematics and philosophy, pursued, or more precisely,
<em>sought the grounds</em> for pursuing those two subjects under the
single heading: “strenge Wissenschaft”—a turn of
mind that had been in place from Gödel's start in 1929, when at
the age of twenty-three he opened his doctoral thesis with some
philosophical remarks.</p>

<p>

Gödel died in Princeton on January 14, 1978 at the age of 71.
His death certificate records the cause of death as
“starvation and inanition, due to personality disorder.” His wife
Adele survived him by three years. </p>

<h2><a name="GodMatWor">2. Gödel's Mathematical Work</a></h2>

<p>

Below is an examination of some of Gödel's main contributions
in logic and set theory. This treatment of Gödel's technical work
is not exhaustive, omitting discussion of Gödel's work in physics
and his work on the decision problem. These will be treated in the
sequel to this entry.</p>

<p>

For a complete chronology of Gödel's work the reader is referred
to that compiled by John Dawson in volume I of Gödel's Collected
Works (Gödel 1986, p. 37).</p>

<h3><a name="ComThe">2.1 The Completeness Theorem</a></h3>

<h4><a name="Int">2.1.1 Introduction</a></h4>

<p>

The completeness question for the first order predicate calculus was
stated precisely and in print for the first time in 1928 by Hilbert
and Ackermann in their text <em>Grundzüge der theoretischen
Logik</em> (Hilbert and Ackermann 1928), a text with which Gödel
would have been quite
 familiar.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-6" id="ref-6">6</a>]</sup></p>

<p>

The question Hilbert and Ackermann pose is whether a certain
explicitly given axiom system for the first order predicate calculus
“…is complete in the sense that from it all logical formulas
that are correct for each domain of individuals can be
derived…” (van Heijenoort 1967, p. 48).</p>

<h4><a name="ProComThe">2.1.2 Proof of the Completeness Theorem</a></h4>

<p>

We give an outline of Gödel's own proof in his doctoral thesis
(Gödel 1929). An essential  difference with earlier
efforts (discussed below and elsewhere, e.g. in Zach 1999), is that Gödel
defines meticulously all the relevant basic concepts.</p>

<p>

A “logical expression” in Gödel's terminology is a well-formed
first order formula without identity. An expression is “refutable” if
its negation is provable, “valid” if it is true in every interpretation
and “satisfiable” if it is true in some interpretation. The
Completeness Theorem is stated as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<strong>Theorem 1</strong>. <br />
 Every valid logical expression is provable. Equivalently, every
logical expression is either satisfiable or refutable.

</blockquote>

<p>

Gödel's proof calculus is that of Hilbert and Ackermann's text.
An expression is in normal form if all the quantifiers occur at the
beginning. The degree of an expression or formula is the number of
alternating blocks of quantifiers at the beginning of the formula,
assumed to begin with universal quantifiers. Gödel shows that if
the completeness theorem holds for formulas of degree <em>k</em> it
must hold for formulas of degree <em>k</em> + 1. Thus the question of
completeness reduces to formulas of degree 1. That is, it is to be
shown that any normal formula (<em>Q</em>)φ of degree 1 is either
satisfiable or refutable, where “(<em>Q</em>)” stands for a
(non-empty) block of universal quantifiers followed by a (possibly
empty) block of existential ones.</p>

<p>

Gödel defines a book-keeping device, a well-ordering of all
tuples of variables arising from a need to satisfy φ as dictated
by (<em>Q</em>). For example, if (<em>Q</em>)φ is
 ∀<em>x</em><sub>0</sub>∃<em>x</em><sub>1</sub>ψ(<em>x</em><sub>0</sub>,
<em>x</em><sub>1</sub>),
 we list the quantifier-free formulas
ψ(<em>x</em><sub><em>n</em></sub>,
<em>x</em><sub><em>n</em>+1</sub>).  (Or more precisely, finite
conjunctions of these in increasing length. See below.) Then in any
domain consisting of the values of the different
<em>x</em><sub><em>n</em></sub>, in which each
ψ(<em>x</em><sub><em>n</em></sub>, <em>x</em><sub>n+1</sub>) is
true, the sentence (<em>Q</em>)φ is clearly true. A crucial lemma
claims the provability, for each <em>k</em>, of the formula
(<em>Q</em>)φ →
(<em>Q</em><sub><em>k</em></sub>)φ<sub><em>k</em></sub>, where the
quantifier free formula φ<sub><em>k</em></sub> asserts the truth
of ψ for all tuples up to the kth tuple of variables arising from
(<em>Q</em>), and
(<em>Q</em><sub><em>k</em></sub>)φ<sub><em>k</em></sub> is the
existential closure of φ<sub><em>k</em></sub>. (See the example
below where the definition of the φ<sub><em>k</em>′</sub>s
is given.) This lemma is the main step missing from the various
earlier attempts at the proof due to Löwenheim and Skolem, and,
in the context of the completeness theorem for first order logic,
renders the connection between syntax and semantics completely
explicit.</p>

<p>

Let us consider an example of how a particular formula would be found
to be either satisfiable or its negation provable, following
Gödel's method: Consider φ = 
 ∀<em>x</em><sub>0</sub>∃<em>x</em><sub>1</sub>ψ(<em>x</em><sub>0</sub>,
<em>x</em><sub>1</sub>), where ψ(<em>x</em><sub>0</sub>,
<em>x</em><sub>1</sub>) is quantifier-free. We show that this is
either refutable or satisfiable. We make the following
definitions:</p>

<blockquote>
<table>
<tbody><tr valign="middle">
<td align="left">φ<sub>0</sub> is the
 expression
 ψ(<em>x</em><sub>0</sub>,
<em>x</em><sub>1</sub>)</td>
</tr>

<tr valign="middle">
<td align="left">φ<sub>1</sub> is the
 expression
 ψ(<em>x</em><sub>0</sub>,
<em>x</em><sub>1</sub>)
 ∧ 

 ψ(<em>x</em><sub>1</sub>,
<em>x</em><sub>2</sub>)</td>
</tr>

<tr valign="middle">
<td align="left">…</td>
</tr>

<tr valign="middle">
<td align="left">φ<sub><em>n</em></sub> is the
 expression
 ψ(<em>x</em><sub>0</sub>,
<em>x</em><sub>1</sub>)
 ∧
 …∧ 
 ψ(<em>x</em><sub><em>n</em></sub>,
<em>x</em><sub><em>n</em>+1</sub>).</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</blockquote>

<p>

The crucial lemma, referred to above, shows that from φ we can
derive for each <em>n</em>,
∃<em>x</em><sub>0</sub>…∃<em>x</em><sub><em>n</em>+1</sub>φ<sub><em>n</em></sub>.
</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
 <strong>Case 1:</strong> For some <em>n</em>,
φ<sub><em>n</em></sub> is not satisfiable. Then, Gödel
argued, using the already known completeness theorem for propositional
 logic,<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-7" id="ref-7">7</a>]</sup> 
 that ¬φ<sub><em>n</em></sub> is provable, and hence so is
∀<em>x</em><sub>0</sub>,…,
 <em>x</em><sub><em>n</em>+1</sub>¬φ<sub><em>n</em></sub>.
Thus ¬∃<em>x</em><sub>0</sub>…∃<em>x</em><sub><em>n</em>+1</sub>φ<sub><em>n</em></sub>
is provable and therefore the  ¬φ is provable,
i.e., φ is refutable in the Hilbert-Ackermann system. (Some partial
results about propositional logic in addition to those already
mentioned include the semantic completeness of the propositional
calculus due to Post (1921), as well as a more general
completeness theorem for the same due to Bernays in 1918; the latter
appears in Bernays' unpublished Habilitationsschrift of 1918; see also
Bernays 1926.)</p>

<p>

<strong>Case 2:</strong> Each φ<sub><em>n</em></sub> is
satisfiable. There are only finitely many possible models with
universe {<em>x</em><sub>0</sub>,…,
<em>x</em><sub>n+1</sub>}. Gödel orders them as a tree by
defining a model <em>M</em> to be below a model <em>M</em>′ if
<em>M</em> is a submodel of <em>M</em>′. In this way we obtain a
tree which is finitely branching but infinite. By König's Lemma
there is an infinite branch <em>B</em>. (In the proof, Gödel
explicitly constructs the branch given by König's Lemma rather
than citing it by name.)  The union of the models on <em>B</em> forms
a model <em>M</em> with universe {<em>x</em><sub>0</sub>,
<em>x</em><sub>1</sub>,…}. Since <em>M</em> satisfies each
φ<sub><em>n</em></sub>, the original formula φ holds in
<em>M</em>. So φ is satisfiable and we are done.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>

Note that the model, in the satisfiability case of Gödel's proof,
is always countable. Thus this proof of the Completeness Theorem gives
also the Löweheim-Skolem Theorem (see below). Gödel extends
the result to countably many formulas and to the case of first order
logic with identity. He also proves the independence of the
axioms.</p>

<p>

In 1930 Gödel published the paper based on his thesis (Gödel
1930) notable also for the inclusion of the compactness theorem, which
is only implicitly stated in the thesis. The theorem as stated by
Gödel in Gödel 1930 is as follows: a countably infinite set
of quantificational formulas is satisfiable if and only if every
finite subset of those formulas is satisfiable. Gödel uses
compactness to derive a generalization of the completeness
theorem.</p>

<p>

The Compactness Theorem was extended to the case of uncountable
vocabularies by Maltsev in 1936 (see Mal'cev 1971), from which the
Upward Löwenheim-Skolem theorem immediately
follows. The Compactness Theorem would become one of the main tools in
the then fledgling subject of model theory.</p>

<h4><a name="ImpConComThe">2.1.3 An Important Consequence of the Completeness Theorem</a></h4>

<p>

A theory is said to be categorical if it has only one model up to
isomorphism; it is λ-categorical if it has only one model of
cardinality λ, up to isomorphism. One of the main consequences
of the completeness theorem is that categoricity fails for Peano
arithmetic and for Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory.</p>

<p>

In detail, regarding the first order Peano axioms (henceforth
<em>PA</em>), the existence of non-standard models of them actually
follows from completeness together with compactness. One constructs
these models, which contain infinitely large integers, as follows: add
a new constant symbol <em>c</em> to the language of arithmetic. Extend
<em>PA</em> to a new theory <em>PA</em>* by adding to it the infinite
collection of axioms: {<em>c</em> &gt; <u>0</u>, <em>c</em> &gt;
<u>1</u>, …}, where, e.g., <u>3</u> is S(S(S(0))). <em>PA</em>*
is finitely consistent (i.e., every finite subset of <em>PA</em>* is
consistent) hence consistent, hence by the Completeness Theorem it has
a model.  </p>

<p>

This simple fact about models of Peano arithmetic was not pointed out
by Gödel in any of the publications connected with the
Completeness Theorem from that time, and it seems not to have been
noticed by the general logic community until much later. Skolem's
definable ultrapower construction from 1933 (see Skolem 1933)
gives a direct construction of a non-standard model of True Arithmetic
(which extends Peano arithmetic, being the set of arithmetic sentences
true in the natural numbers). But Skolem never mentions the fact that
the existence of such models follows from the completeness and
compactness theorems.  Gödel in his review (1934c) of Skolem's
paper also does not mention this fact, rather observing that the
failure of categoricity for arithmetic follows from the
<em>incompleteness</em> theorem. </p>

<p>

As for set theory, the failure of categoricity was already taken note
of by Skolem in 1923, because it follows from the
Löwenheim-Skolem Theorem (which Skolem arrived at that year; see
Skolem 1923, based on Löwenheim 1915 and Skolem 1920): any first
order theory in a countable language that has a model has a countable
model. </p>

<p>

Skolem's observation that categoricity fails for set theory because it has 
countable models is now known as the Skolem
 paradox.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-8" id="ref-8">8</a>]</sup>The
 observation is strongly emphasized in Skolem's paper, which is accordingly
entitled ‘An Observation on the Axiomatic Foundations of Set
Theory'  As he wrote in the conclusion of it, he had not
pointed out the relativity in set theory already in 1915 because:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>… first, I have in the meantime been occupied with other
problems; second, I believed that it was so clear that axiomatization
in terms of sets was not a satisfactory ultimate foundation of
mathematics that mathematicians would, for the most part, not be very
much concerned with it. But in recent times I have seen to my surprise
that so many mathematicians think that these axioms of set theory
provide the ideal foundation for mathematics; therefore it seemed to
me that the time had come to publish a critique. (English translation
taken from van Heijenoort 1967, p. 300.)</p>

 </blockquote>

<p>

As an aside, in the proof of the Löwenheim-Skolem theorem,
specifically that part of the theorem in which one constructs a model
for a satisfiable sentence, Löwenheim and Skolem's tree
construction was more or less the same as appears in Gödel's
thesis. In a 1967 letter to Hao Wang, Gödel takes note of the
fact that his completeness proof had almost been obtained by Skolem in
1923. Though van Heijenoort and Dreben (Dreben and van Heijenoort
1986) remark that “Throughout much of the 1920s it was not semantic
completeness but the decision problem for quantificational validity, a
problem originating from the work of Schröder and Löwenheim,
that was the dominant concern in studying quantification theory”
(examples of such results would include the decision procedure for
the first order monadic predicate calculus due to Behmann, (Behmann
1922)), according to Gödel, the reasons that Skolem did not
obtain the complete proof are different and philosophically important,
having to do with the then dominant bias against semantics and against
infinitary methods:</p>

<blockquote>The Completeness Theorem, mathematically, is indeed an
almost trivial consequence of Skolem 1923. However, the fact is that,
at that time, nobody (including Skolem himself) drew this conclusion
neither from Skolem 1923 nor, as I did, from similar considerations of
his own …This blindness (or prejudice, or whatever you may call
it) of logicians is indeed surprising. But I think the explanation is
not hard to find. It lies in the widespread lack, at that time, of the
required epistemological attitude toward metamathematics and toward
non-finitary reasoning.  (Gödel 2003b).</blockquote>

<p>

The matter of Skolem's contribution to the Completeness Theorem has
been extensively discussed in van Atten and Kennedy 2009,
as well as in van Atten 2005.</p>

<h3><a name="IncThe">2.2 The Incompleteness Theorems</a></h3>

<p>

Gödel mentioned the possibility of the unsolvability of a
question about the reals already in his 1929 thesis, in arguing
against the formalist principle of Hilbert's, that consistency is a
criterion for existence. In fact, giving a finitary proof of the
consistency of analysis was a key desideratum of what was then known
as the Hilbert program, along with proving its
completeness. Accordingly it was Gödel's turn to these questions,
especially the first, which led him to the two incompleteness
theorems.  (For a discussion of the Hilbert Program the reader is
referred to the standard references: Sieg 1990, 1988, 1999; Mancosu
1998, Zach 2003, Tait 1981 and Tait 2002.)</p>

<p>

The First Incompleteness Theorem provides a counterexample to
completeness by exhibiting an arithmetic statement which is neither
provable nor refutable in Peano arithmetic, though true in the
standard model. The Second Incompleteness Theorem shows that the
consistency of arithmetic cannot be proved in arithmetic itself. Thus
Gödel's theorems demonstrated the infeasibility of the Hilbert
program, if it is to be characterized by those particular desiderata,
consistency and completeness.</p>

<p>

As an aside, von Neumann  understood the two theorems this way,
even before Gödel did. In fact von Neumann went much further in
taking the view that they showed the infeasibility of classical
mathematics altogether. As he wrote to Carnap in June of 1931:</p>

<blockquote>

 Thus today I am of the opinion that 1. Gödel has shown the
unrealizability of Hilbert's program. 2. There is no more reason to
reject intuitionism (if one disregards the aesthetic issue, which in
practice will also for me be the decisive factor). Therefore I consider
the state of the foundational discussion in Königsberg to be
outdated, for Gödel's fundamental discoveries have brought the
question to a completely different
 level.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-9" id="ref-9">9</a>]</sup>

</blockquote>

<p>

And the previous fall von Neumann had written to Gödel in even
stronger terms:</p>

<blockquote>

Thus, I think that your result has solved negatively the foundational
question: there is no rigorous justification for classical
mathematics. (Gödel 2003b, p. 339)

</blockquote>

<p>

It would take Gödel himself a few years to see that those aspects
of the Hilbert Program had been decisively refuted by his results
(Mancosu 2004).</p>

<h4><a name="FirIncThe">2.2.1 The First Incompleteness Theorem</a></h4>

<p>

In his <em>Logical Journey</em> (Wang 1996) Hao Wang published the full text
of material Gödel had written (at Wang's request) about his
discovery of the incompleteness theorems.  This material had formed
the basis of Wang's “Some Facts about Kurt Gödel,” and was read
and approved by Gödel:</p>

<blockquote>In the summer of 1930 I began to study the consistency
problem of classical analysis. It is mysterious why Hilbert wanted to
prove directly the consistency of analysis by finitary methods. I saw
two distinguishable problems: to prove the consistency of number
theory by finitary number theory and to prove the consistency of
analysis by number theory … Since the domain of finitary number
theory was not well-defined, I began by tackling the second
half… I represented real numbers by predicates in number
theory… and found that I had to use the concept of truth (for
number theory) to verify the axioms of analysis. By an enumeration of
symbols, sentences and proofs within the given system, I quickly
discovered that the concept of arithmetic truth cannot be defined in
arithmetic. If it were possible to define truth in the system itself,
we would have something like the liar paradox, showing the system to
be inconsistent… Note that this argument can be formalized to
show the existence of undecidable propositions without giving any
individual instances. (If there were no undecidable propositions, all
(and only) true propositions would be provable within the system. But
then we would have a contradiction.)… In contrast to truth,
provability in a given formal system is an explicit combinatorial
property of certain sentences of the system, which is formally
specifiable by suitable elementary means…</blockquote>

<p>

We see that Gödel first tried to reduce the consistency problem for
analysis to that of arithmetic. This seemed to require a truth
definition for arithmetic, which in turn led to paradoxes, such as the
Liar paradox (“This sentence is false”) and Berry's paradox (“The least
number not defined by an expression consisting of just fourteen English
words”). Gödel then noticed that such paradoxes would not
necessarily arise if truth were replaced by provability. But this means
that arithmetic truth and arithmetic provability are not co-extensive —
whence the First Incompleteness Theorem.</p>

<p>

This account of Gödel's discovery was told to Hao Wang very much
after the fact; but in Gödel's contemporary correspondence with
Bernays and Zermelo, essentially the same description of his path to
the theorems is given. (See Gödel 2003a and Gödel 2003b
respectively.)  From those accounts we see that the undefinability of
truth in arithmetic, a result credited to Tarski, was likely obtained
in some form by Gödel by 1931. But he neither publicized nor
published the result; the biases logicians had expressed at the time
concerning the notion of truth, biases which came vehemently to the
fore when Tarski announced his results on the undefinability of truth
in formal systems 1935, may have served as a deterrent to Gödel's
publication of that theorem.</p>

<h4><a name="ProFirIncThe">2.2.2 The proof of the First Incompleteness Theorem</a></h4>

<p>

We now describe the proof of the two theorems, formulating
Gödel's results in Peano arithmetic. Gödel himself used a
system related to that defined in Principia Mathematica, but
containing Peano arithmetic. In our presentation of the First and
Second Incompleteness Theorems we refer to Peano arithmetic as
<em>P</em>, following Gödel's notation.</p>

<p>

Before proceeding to the details of the formal proof, we define the
notion of ω-consistency used by Gödel in the First
Incompleteness Theorem: <em>P</em> is <em>ω-consistent</em> if

<em>P</em>
 ⊢ 
 ¬φ(<u><em>n</em></u>) for all <em>n</em> implies
<em>P</em>
 ⊬ 
 ∃<em>x</em>φ(<em>x</em>).  Naturally this implies
consistency and follows from the assumption that the natural numbers
satisfy the axioms of Peano arithmetic.</p>

<p>

One of the main technical tools used in the proof is <em>Gödel
numbering</em>, a mechanism which assigns natural numbers to terms and
formulas of our formal theory <em>P</em>.  There are different ways of
doing this. The most common is based on the unique representation of
natural numbers as products of powers of primes. Each symbol
<em>s</em> of number theory is assigned a positive natural number
#(<em>s</em>) in a fixed but arbitrary way, e.g.</p>

<blockquote>
<table cellpadding="3">
<tbody><tr>
<td align="left">#(0) = 1</td>
<td align="left">#(=) = 5</td>
<td align="left">#(¬) = 9</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align="left">#(1) = 2</td>
<td align="left">#( ( ) = 6</td>
<td align="left">#(∀) = 10</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align="left">#(+) = 3</td>
<td align="left">#( ) ) = 7</td>
<td align="left">#(<em>v</em><sub>i</sub>) = 11 + <em>i</em></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align="left">#(×) = 4</td>
<td align="left">#(∧) = 8</td>
<td align="left"> </td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</blockquote>

<p>

 The natural number corresponding to a sequence <em>w</em> = &lt;
<em>w</em><sub>0</sub>,…, <em>w</em><sub><em>k</em></sub> &gt;
of symbols is</p>

<blockquote>
 <sup>⌈</sup><em>w</em><sup>⌉</sup>
 = 2<sup>#(<em>w</em><sub>0</sub>)</sup> · 
   3<sup>#(<em>w</em><sub>1</sub>)</sup> · 
   … ·
   <em>p</em><sub><em>k</em></sub><sup>#(<em>w</em><sub><em>k</em></sub>)</sup>,
</blockquote>

<p>
 where <em>p</em><sub><em>k</em></sub> is the <em>k</em>+1st prime. It
is called its Gödel number and denoted by
 <sup>⌈</sup><em>w</em><sup>⌉</sup>.
 In this way we can assign Gödel numbers to formulas, sequences
of formulas (once a method for distinguishing when one formula ends
and another begins has been adopted), and most notably, proofs.</p>

<p>

An essential point here is that when a formula is construed as a
natural number, then the numeral corresponding to that natural number
can occur as the argument of a formula, thus enabling the syntax to
“refer” to itself, so to speak (i.e., when a numeral is substituted
into a formula the Gödel number of which the numeral
represents). This will eventually allow Gödel to formalize the
Liar paradox (with “provability” in place of “truth”) by substituting
into the formula which says, ‘the formula, whose code is
<em>x</em>, is unprovable,’ its own natural number code (or more
precisely the corresponding numeral).</p>

<p>

Another concept required to carry out the formalization is the concept
of numeralwise expressibility of number theoretic predicates. A
number-theoretic formula φ(<em>n</em><sub>1</sub>, …,
<em>n</em><sub>k</sub>) is <em>numeralwise expressible</em> in
<em>P</em> if for each tuple of natural numbers
(<em>n</em><sub>1</sub>, …, <em>n</em><sub><em>k</em></sub>):</p>

<blockquote>
<table>
<tbody><tr align="left">
<td align="left"><strong>N</strong>
 ⊨ 
 φ(<em>n</em><sub>1</sub>, …, <em>n</em><sub><em>k</em></sub>)</td>
<td align="left">⇒</td>
<td align="left"><em>P</em>
 ⊢ 
 φ(<u><em>n</em></u><sub>1</sub>,
 …,
 <u><em>n</em></u><sub><em>k</em></sub>)</td>
</tr>

<tr align="left">
<td align="left"><strong>N</strong>
 ⊨ 
 ¬φ(<em>n</em><sub>1</sub>,
 …, <em>n</em><sub><em>k</em></sub>)</td>
<td align="left">⇒</td>
<td align="left"><em>P</em>
 ⊢ 
 ¬φ(<u><em>n</em></u><sub>1</sub>,
 …, <u><em>n</em></u><sub><em>k</em></sub>)</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</blockquote>

<p>

where <u><em>n</em></u> is the formal term which denotes the natural
number <em>n</em>. (In <em>P</em>, this is
<em>S</em>(<em>S</em>(…<em>S</em>(0)…), where <em>n</em>
is the number of iterations of the successor function applied to the
constant symbol 0.) One of the principal goals is to numeralwise
express the predicate</p>

<blockquote> 

Prf(<em>x</em>, <em>y</em>): ‘the sequence with
Gödel number <em>x</em> is a proof of the sentence with
Gödel number <em>y</em>.’ </blockquote>

<p>

Reaching this goal involves defining forty-five relations, each
defined in terms of the preceding ones. These relations are all
primitive
 recursive.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-10" id="ref-10">10</a>]</sup>
 Relations needed are, among others, those which assert of a natural
number that it codes a sequence, or a formula, or an axiom, or that it
is the code, denoted by
Sb(<em>r</em><sup><em>u</em><sub>1</sub>…<em>u</em><sub><em>n</em></sub></sup><sub><em>Z</em>(<em>x</em><sub>1</sub>)…<em>Z</em>(<em>x</em><sub><em>n</em></sub>)</sub>),
of a formula obtained from a formula with code <em>r</em> by
substituting for its free variable <em>u</em><sub><em>i</em></sub> the
<em>x</em><sub><em>i</em></sub> th numeral for <em>i</em> = 1,
…, <em>n</em>. The forty-fifth primitive recursive relation
defined is Prf(<em>x</em>,
<em>y</em>), and the forty-sixth is</p>

<blockquote>

Prov(<em>y</em>): ‘the
sentence with Gödel number <em>y</em> is provable in
<em>P</em>’</blockquote>

<p>

which without being primitive recursive, is however obtained from
Prf(<em>x</em>, <em>y</em>) by existentially quantifying
<em>x</em>. (Prov(<em>y</em>) satisfies only the
‘positive’ part of numeralwise expressibility, and not the
negative part; but the negative part is not needed.)</p>

<p>

In Theorem V of his paper, Gödel proves that any number theoretic
predicate which is primitive recursive is numeralwise expressible in
<em>P</em>. Thus since Prf(<em>x</em>, <em>y</em>) and
substitution are primitive recursive, these are decided by <em>P</em>
when closed terms are substituted for the free variables <em>x</em>
and <em>y</em>. This is the heart of the matter as we will
see. Another key point about numeralwise expressibility is that
although we informally interpret, for example,
Prov(Sb(<em>r</em><sup><em>u</em><sub>1</sub>…<em>u</em><sub><em>n</em></sub></sup><sub><em>Z</em>(<em>x</em><sub>1</sub>)…<em>Z</em>(<em>x</em><sub><em>n</em></sub>)</sub>)),
by: ‘the formula with Gödel number <em>r</em> is provable
if the Gödel number for the <em>x</em><sub>i</sub> th numeral is
substituted in place of the <em>i</em> th variable,’ neither the
formal statement within the theory <em>P</em> nor anything we prove
about it appeals to such meanings. On the contrary
Prov(Sb(<em>r</em><sup><em>u</em><sub>1</sub>…<em>u</em><sub><em>n</em></sub></sup><sub><em>Z</em>(<em>x</em><sub>1</sub>)…<em>Z</em>(<em>x</em><sub><em>n</em></sub>)</sub>)),
is a meaningless string of logical and arithmetical symbols. As
Gödel puts it in his introduction to his theorem V, ‘The
fact that can be formulated vaguely by saying that every recursive
relation is definable in the system <em>P</em> (if the usual meaning
is given to the formulas of this system) is expressed in precise
language, <em>without</em> reference to any interpretation of the
formulas of <em>P</em>, by the following Theorem (V) (Gödel
1986, p. 171, italics Gödel's).</p>

<p>

Gödel in his incompleteness theorems uses a method given in
what is called nowadays Gödel's Fixed Point Theorem. Although
Gödel constructs a fixed point in the course of proving the
incompleteness theorem, he does not state the fixed point theorem
explicitly. The fixed point theorem is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
<strong>Theorem 2</strong> (Gödel's Fixed Point Theorem) <br />
 If φ(<em>v</em><sub>0</sub>) is a formula of number theory,
then there is a sentence ψ such that
<em>P</em> ⊢ ψ ↔
 φ(<sup>⌈</sup><u>ψ</u><sup>⌉</sup>),
 where <sup>⌈</sup><u>ψ</u><sup>⌉</sup> is the formal
 term corresponding to the natural number code
 of <sup>⌈</sup>ψ<sup>⌉</sup>.
</p>

<p>

<em>Proof:</em> Let σ(<em>x</em>,<em>y</em>,<em>z</em>) be a
formula that numeralwise expresses the number theoretic predicate
‘<em>y</em> is the Gödel number of the formula obtained by
replacing the variable <em>v</em><sub>0</sub> in the formula whose
Gödel number is <em>x</em> by the term <u><em>z</em></u>’.
Let θ(<em>v</em><sub>0</sub>) be the formula
∃<em>v</em><sub>1</sub>(φ(<em>v</em><sub>1</sub>)
 ∧ σ(<em>v</em><sub>0</sub>,
<em>v</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>v</em><sub>0</sub>)).  Let <em>k</em> =
 <sup>⌈</sup>θ(<em>v</em><sub>0</sub>)<sup>⌉</sup>
and ψ = θ(<em>k</em>).  Now directly by the construction
<em>P</em> ⊢ ψ ↔ 
φ(<sup>⌈</sup>ψ<sup>⌉</sup>).
</p>

</blockquote>

<p>

A sentence is refutable from a theory if its negation is provable.
The First Incompleteness Theorem as Gödel stated it is as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>

<strong>Theorem 3</strong> (Gödel's First Incompleteness Theorem)
<br />
If <em>P</em> is ω-consistent, then there is a sentence which is
neither provable nor refutable from <em>P</em>.</p>

<p>
<em>Proof:</em>
 By judicious coding of syntax referred to above, write a formula 
 Prf(<em>x</em>,<em>y</em>)<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-11" id="ref-11">11</a>]</sup>
 of number theory, representable in <em>P</em>, so that</p>

<ol start="1">

<li><em>n</em> codes a proof of φ ⇒ <em>P</em>
 ⊢ Prf(<u><em>n</em></u>,
 <sup>⌈</sup><u>φ</u><sup>⌉</sup>).
</li></ol>

<p>
and</p>

<ol start="2">

<li><em>n</em> does not code a proof of φ ⇒ <em>P</em>
 ⊢ ¬Prf(<u><em>n</em></u>,
 <sup>⌈</sup><u>φ</u><sup>⌉</sup>).
</li></ol>

<p>

Let Prov(<em>y</em>) denote the formula ∃<em>x</em>
 Prf(<em>x</em>,<em>y</em>)<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-12" id="ref-12">12</a>]</sup>.  
 By Theorem 2 there is a sentence φ with the property</p>

<ol start="3">

<li><em>P</em>
 ⊢
 (φ ↔ 
 ¬Prov(<sup>⌈</sup><u>φ</u><sup>⌉</sup>)).</li>

</ol>

<p>

Thus φ says ‘I am not provable.’ We now observe, if
<em>P</em>
 ⊢ 
 φ, then by (1) there is <em>n</em> such that <em>P</em>
 ⊢ Prf(<u><em>n</em></u>,
 <sup>⌈</sup><u>φ</u><sup>⌉</sup>),
 hence <em>P</em> ⊢
 Prov(<sup>⌈</sup><u>φ</u><sup>⌉</sup>), 
 hence, by (3) <em>P</em>
 ⊢ ¬φ,
 so <em>P</em> is inconsistent. Thus
</p>

<ol start="4">
<li><em>P</em> ⊬ φ</li>
</ol>

<p>
Furthermore, by (4) and (2), we have <em>P</em> 
 ⊢ ¬Prf(<u><em>n</em></u>,
 <sup>⌈</sup><u>φ</u><sup>⌉</sup>) 
 for all natural numbers <em>n</em>.  By ω-consistency
 <em>P</em> ⊬
 ∃<em>x</em> Prf(<em>x</em>,
 <sup>⌈</sup><u>φ</u><sup>⌉</sup>).
 Thus (3) gives <em>P</em>
 ⊬ ¬φ.  
 We have shown that if <em>P</em> is ω-consistent, then φ is
independent of <em>P</em>.
</p>

</blockquote>

<p>

On concluding the proof of the first theorem, Gödel remarks, “we
can readily see that the proof just given is constructive; that is
… proved in an intuitionistically unobjectionable
manner…” (Gödel 1986, p. 177). This is because, as he
points out, all the existential statements are based on his theorem V
(giving the numeralwise expressibility of primitive recursive
relations), which is intuitionistically unobjectionable.</p>

<h4><a name="SecIncThe">2.2.3 The Second Incompleteness Theorem</a></h4>

<p>

The Second Incompleteness Theorem establishes the unprovability, in
number theory, of the consistency of number theory. First we have to
write down a number-theoretic formula that expresses the consistency
of the axioms. This is surprisingly simple. We just let
Con(<em>P</em>) be the sentence
 ¬Prov(<sup>⌈</sup><u>0 = 
 1</u><sup>⌉</sup>).
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

<strong>Theorem 4</strong> (Gödel's Second Incompleteness
Theorem) If <em>P</em> is consistent, then Con(<em>P</em>) is not
provable from <em>P</em>.</p>

<p>

<em>Proof:</em> Let φ be as in (3).  The reasoning used to infer
‘if <em>P</em> ⊢ φ, then <em>P</em> ⊢ 0 ≠
1‘ does not go beyond elementary number theory, and can
therefore, albeit with a lot of effort (see below), be formalized in
<em>P</em>.  This yields: <em>P</em> ⊢
(Prov(<sup>⌈</sup><u>φ</u><sup>⌉</sup>) →
¬Con(<em>P</em>)), and thus by (3), <em>P</em> ⊢
(Con(<em>P</em>) → φ).  Since <em>P</em> ⊬ φ, we
must have <em>P</em> ⊬ Con(<em>P</em>).</p>

</blockquote>

<p>

The above proof (sketch) of the Second Incompleteness Theorem is
deceptively simple as it avoids the formalization. A rigorous proof
would have to establish the proof of ‘if <em>P</em> ⊢
φ, then <em>P</em> ⊢ 0 ≠ 1’ in <em>P</em>.</p>

<p>

It is noteworthy that ω-consistency is not needed in the proof
of Gödel's Second Incompleteness Theorem. Also note that neither
is ¬Con(<em>P</em>) provable, by the consistency of <em>P</em> and
the fact, now known as Löb's theorem, that <em>P</em> ⊢
Prov(<sup>⌈</sup><u>φ</u><sup>⌉</sup>) implies
<em>P</em> ⊢ φ.</p>

<p>

The assumption of ω-consistency in the First Incompleteness
Theorem was eliminated by Rosser in 1936, and replaced by the weaker
notion of consistency.  Rosser's generalization involves applying the
fixed point theorem to the formula <em>R</em>(<em>x</em>): ‘for
all <em>z</em>: either <em>z</em> is not the Gödel number of a
proof of the formula with Gödel number <em>x</em> or there is a
proof shorter than <em>z</em> of the negation of (the formula with
Gödel number) <em>x</em>’ (see Rosser 1936).</p>

<p>

With regard to the Second Incompleteness Theorem, the argument relies
in part on formalizing the proof of the First Incompleteness Theorem
as we saw. This step is omitted in Gödel 1931. He planned to
include the step in what would have been a second part II (see
footnote 48a of Gödel 1931). But instead of writing it he turned
to the continuum
 problem.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-13" id="ref-13">13</a>]</sup>
 (Part II was to elaborate on other points too: the ‘true reason
for incompleteness,’ and the applicability of the two theorems
to other systems.) He perhaps did not feel compelled to attend to what
looked like an exercise in formalization, relying instead on the
informal argument to convince (in which it succeeded). However this
step turned out to be somewhat non-trivial. As Kleene puts it in his
introduction to Gödel 1931, of the informal presentation,
“Certainly the idea of the argument for Theorem XI (consistency) was
very convincing; but it turned out that the execution of the details
required somewhat more work and care than had been anticipated.” (See
pp. 126–141 of Gödel 1986.)  Eventually a complete proof of the
Second Theorem was given by Hilbert and Bernays in some seventy pages
in their Hilbert and Bernays 1939.  A much more compact treatment of
the theorem was given by Löb in his Löb 1956, and
subsequently Feferman, in his 1960 “Arithmetization of Metamathematics
in a General Setting” (Feferman 1960/1961), gave a succinct and
completely general treatment of both the First and Second
Theorems.  But see the supplementary document:</p>

<h3><a name="SpeUpThe">2.3 Speed-up Theorems</a></h3>

<p>

Gödel's 1936 ‘Speed-up’ theorem, published in an
abstract “On the length of proofs”, Gödel 1936 says that while
some sentences of arithmetic are true but unprovable, there are other
sentences which are provable, but even the shortest proof is longer
than any bound given in advance as a recursive function of the
sentence. More exactly:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>

<strong>Theorem 5</strong>. <br />
 Given any recursive function <em>f</em>
there are provable sentences φ of arithmetic such that the
shortest proof is greater than 
 <em>f</em>(<sup>⌈</sup>φ<sup>⌉</sup>) 
 in length.
</p>

</blockquote>

<p>

The proof we will outline is sensitive to the particular concept we
use for the length of a proof. Another possibility, and the one that
Gödel has in mind, is the number of formulas in the proof. Buss
(see below) proves the theorem in either case, so both cases are
resolved.</p>

<blockquote>

<em>Proof:</em> Let <em>f</em> be total recursive function. By
Gödel's Fixed Point theorem there is a formula φ(<em>n</em>)
stating ‘φ(<em>n</em>) has no proof in PA shorter than
<em>f</em>(<em>n</em>)’. This is tenable if the length is
measured by number of symbols, because we only need to search through
finitely many proofs shorter than <em>f</em>(<em>n</em>). Note that
φ(<em>n</em>) is true for all <em>n</em>, for if φ(<em>n</em>)
were false, then there would be a short proof of φ(<em>n</em>),
and hence by soundness φ(<em>n</em>) would be true, a
contradiction: φ(<em>n</em>) would both true and false. This can
be formalized in PA and thus we get the result that for each
<em>n</em> the sentence φ(<em>n</em>) is provable in PA. Since
φ(<em>n</em>) is true for all <em>n</em>, it cannot have a proof
in PA which is shorter than <em>f</em>(<em>n</em>).

</blockquote>

<p>

The Speed-up Theorem is the result of contemplating and elaborating
the proof of the incompleteness theorem. It applies the fixed-point
technique to the concept of unprovability by a short proof, as opposed
to the original idea of applying the fixed-point theorem to mere
unprovability. The proof has very much the same flavor as the proof of
the incompleteness theorem. Interestingly, it dates from the same year
as the construction, due to Rosser, that eliminates the use of
ω-consistency in the first Incompleteness Theorem; like the
Speed-up Theorem of Gödel, Rosser's construction exploits the
issue of short and long proofs.  Gödel never submitted a proof
for the Speed-up Theorem. Over the years several related proofs were
published, but the first full proof of Gödel's original result
was given only in 1994 by Sam Buss in his ‘On Gödel's
theorems on lengths of proofs I: Number of lines and speedups for
arithmetic.’ (Buss 1994). Buss also gives a second proof of the
theorem which avoids self-reference, following a technique due to
Statman. Gödel measures the length of proofs by the number of
formulas; but there are also other possibilities, such as the number
of symbols in the proof. The case of the Speed-up Theorem where the
length of proof is measured by the number of symbols was proved by
Mostowski in 1952 (Mostowski 1982).  For proofs of similar results see
Ehrenfeucht and Mycieleski 1971, and Parikh 1971. Though both
measures may be equally natural candidates for measuring the length of
a proof, proving the theorem for length measured by the number of
symbols avoids a technical complication introduced by the other
measure: there are only finitely many proofs with a given number of
symbols, whereas there are infinitely many proofs with a given number
of formulas.</p>

<p>

Gödel states the Speed-up Theorem differently from the above.
Let <em>S</em><sub>n</sub> be the system of logic of the <em>n</em>-th
order, the variables of the first level being thought of as ranging
over natural numbers. In this setting, variables of the second level
range over sets of natural numbers and so on. Gödel's formulation
is:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>

<strong>Theorem 6</strong>. <br />
 Let <em>n</em> be a natural number &gt;
0. If <em>f</em> is a computable function, then there are infinitely
many formulas <em>A</em>, provable in <em>S</em><sub><em>n</em></sub>,
such that if <em>k</em> is the length of the shortest proof of
<em>A</em> in <em>S</em><sub><em>n</em></sub> and <em>l</em> is the
length of the shortest proof of <em>A</em> in
<em>S</em><sub><em>n</em>+1</sub>, then <em>k</em> &gt;
<em>f</em>(<em>l</em>).</p>

<p>

<em>Proof sketch:</em> The idea is the following: Let
φ(<em>x</em>) be a formula, like above, for which
φ(<em>m</em>) does not have a short proof in
<em>S</em><sub><em>n</em></sub> for any <em>m</em>.  Suppose we have a
higher type system <em>S</em><sub><em>n</em>+1</sub> in which we can
prove ∀<em>x</em>φ(<em>x</em>). This proof is of constant
length.  Thus each φ(<em>m</em>) is derivable from this universal
statement by one application of the logical rule
∀<em>x</em>φ(<em>x</em>) → φ(<em>t</em>). Thus
φ(<em>m</em>) has in that system for all <em>m</em> a short
proof. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>

What kind of stronger system can we have in which
∀<em>x</em>φ(<em>x</em>) is provable? We may consider
second order logic in which we can define a predicate
<em>N</em>(<em>x</em>) for the set of natural numbers and furthermore
can prove of a new predicate symbol <em>Tr</em>(<em>x</em>) that it
satisfies the inductive clauses of the truth definition of first order
formulas of arithmetic, relativized to <em>N</em>. Then the stronger
system can prove that provable first order sentences of arithmetic
satisfy the predicate <em>Tr</em> . By the above argument, we can
prove in the stronger system that ∀<em>x</em>φ(<em>x</em>)
satisfies <em>Tr</em>. Then by adding a few lines we can prove each
φ(<em>n</em>) satisfies <em>Tr</em>. Because of the nature of
φ(<em>n</em>), this implies the stronger system has a (short)
proof of φ(<em>n</em>). An alternative system is Peano's axioms PA
in an extended language where we have a new predicate symbol
<em>Tr</em> and axioms stating that the predicate <em>Tr</em> codes
the satisfaction relation for all sentences of the vocabulary not
containing <em>Tr</em>.</p>

<h3><a name="GodWorSetThe">2.4 Gödel's Work in Set theory</a></h3>

<h4><a name="ConConHypAxiCho">2.4.1 The consistency of the Continuum Hypothesis and the Axiom of Choice</a></h4>

<p>

Gödel's proof of the consistency of the continuum hypothesis with
the axioms of Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory is a tour de force and
arguably the greatest achievement of his mathematical life. This is
because aside from the arithmetization, virtually all of the technical
machinery used in the proof had to be invented ab initio.</p>

<p>

The Continuum Hypothesis (henceforth <em>CH</em>) was formulated by Georg
Cantor, and was the first problem on Hilbert's list of twenty-three
unsolved problems as given in his famous address to the International
Mathematical Congress in Paris in 1900. The problem as stated by
Hilbert is as follows: Let <em>A</em> be an infinite set of real
numbers. Then <em>A</em> is either countable, or has cardinality
 2<sup>ℵ<sub>0</sub></sup>, i.e., 
 <em>A</em> is in one-to-one correspondence either with the set of natural
numbers or with the set of all real numbers (otherwise known as the
continuum). Another way to state the continuum hypothesis is that (the
first uncountably infinite cardinal)

 ℵ<sub>1</sub> = 
 2<sup>ℵ<sub>0</sub></sup>.</p>

<p>

As early as 1922 Skolem speculated that the <em>CH</em> was
independent of the axioms for set theory given by Zermelo in
1908. Nevertheless Hilbert published a (false) proof of the
<em>CH</em> in Hilbert 1926.  In 1937 Gödel proved its
consistency with the axioms of <em>ZF</em> set theory. (Henceforth we
use the standard abbreviations for Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory,
<em>ZF</em>, and Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory with the Axiom of Choice,
<em>ZFC</em>.) The consistency of the negation of the <em>CH</em> was
shown by Paul Cohen in 1961 (see Cohen 1963) and hence together with
Gödel's result one infers that the <em>CH</em> is independent
of <em>ZF</em> (and <em>ZFC</em>).</p>

<p>

Cohen invented an important new technique called forcing in the course
of proving his result; this technique is at present the main method
used to construct models of set theory. Forcing led to a revival of
formalism among set theorists, the plurality of models being an
indication of the “essential variability in set theory,” (Dehornoy
2004) and away from the notion that there is an intended model of set
theory—a perspective Gödel advocated since at least 1947,
if not
 earlier.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-14" id="ref-14">14</a>]</sup>
 Recently there have been signs that the <em>CH</em> may again be
coming to be regarded as a problem to be solved mathematically (with
the help of course of some new evident axioms extending ZF). (See for
example Woodin 2001a, 2002, 2001b, and Foreman 1998.)  If any of the
proposed solutions gain acceptance, this would confirm Gödel's
view that the <em>CH</em> would eventually be decided by finding an
evident extension of the ZF axioms for set theory. The program
associated with this view is called “Gödel's Large Cardinal
Program.”</p>

<h4><a name="GodProConConHypAxiChoAxiZerFraSetThe">2.4.2 Gödel's Proof of the Consistency of the Continuum Hypothesis and the Axiom of Choice with the Axioms of Zermelo-Fraenkel Set Theory</a></h4>

<p>

The continuum problem is solved by finding an enumeration of the
reals which is indexed by the countable ordinals, a strategy which had
been recognized as a promising one already by
 Hilbert.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-15" id="ref-15">15</a>]</sup>The
 problem, and the intuition behind the proof, is to build a “small”
model, one in which the absolute minimum number of reals is allowed,
while at the same time the model is large enough to be closed under
all the operations the <em>ZF</em> axioms assert to
exist.</p>

<p>

Gödel's is a relative consistency proof, obtained by constructing
a so-called “inner model” for <em>ZF</em> together with the
<em>CH</em>. An inner model is a subcollection <em>M</em> of the
collection <em>V</em> of all sets (see below) which satisfies the
axioms of <em>ZF</em> when only sets in <em>M</em> are
considered. Gödel's inner model is called the <em>inner model of
constructible sets</em> (see below) and is denoted by
<em>L</em>. Whatever is true in an inner model is consistent with
<em>ZF</em> for the same reason that any theory with a model is
consistent. An artifact of the construction is that the Axiom of
Choice (henceforth <em>AC</em>) is satisfied in Gödel's inner
model and hence the consistency of the <em>AC</em> with <em>ZF</em>
was established by Gödel. Later on it was shown by Sierpinski
that the <em>AC</em> is actually a consequence of the Generalized
Continuum Hypothesis or the <em>GCH,</em>  which states that for
each κ, 2<sup>κ</sup> = κ<sup>+</sup> (see
Sierpinski 1947).</p>

<p>

Gödel published two versions of these theorems, in 1939 and in
1940, entitled “Consistency Proof for the Generalized Continuum
Hypothesis,” and “The Consistency of the Axiom of Choice and of
the Generalized Continuum Hypothesis with the Axioms of Set
Theory,” respectively. Though completely definitive, the 1939
version is lacking in a great many details, most notably the arguments
showing that if <em>L</em> is built inside <em>L</em> itself, the same
<em>L</em> results; that is to say, the so-called absoluteness
arguments are missing. Also missing are the details of the proofs that
the <em>ZF</em> axioms hold in <em>L</em>. Unlike the case of the
Second Incompleteness Theorem, however, Gödel subsequently gave a
completely detailed proof of the two theorems in the 1940 monograph.
(The 1940 proof differs substantially from the first version. For
details about the two proofs and the difference between them the
reader is referred to Solovay 1990 and Kanamori 2006.)</p>

<p>

We now sketch the proof of the consistency of <em>CH</em> and of
<em>AC</em> with <em>ZFC</em>, using modern terminology. Some
preliminary concepts before sketching the proof: We first define the
stratified set theoretic universe, denoted <em>V</em>. (<em>V</em> is
also known as the cumulative hierarchy.) It is obtained by iteration
of the power set operation (℘) beginning with the null set:</p>

<blockquote>

<table cellpadding="+3">

<tbody><tr>
<td align="left"><em>V</em><sub>0</sub></td>
<td align="left">=</td>
<td align="left">∅,</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align="left"><em>V</em><sub>α+1</sub></td>
<td align="left">=</td>
<td align="left">℘(<em>V</em><sub>α</sub>),</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align="left"><em>V</em><sub>γ</sub></td>
<td align="left">=</td>
<td align="left"><font size="+2">∪</font><sub>β&lt;γ</sub>
 <em>V</em><sub>β</sub>,</td>
</tr>

</tbody></table>

</blockquote>

<p>

where α, β are any ordinals, γ is a limit ordinal
and
 ℘(<em>x</em>)
denotes the power set of <em>x</em>. Finally</p>

<blockquote>
<table cellpadding="+3">
<tbody><tr>
<td align="left"><em>V</em></td>
<td align="left">=</td>
<td align="left"><font size="+2">∪</font><sub>α∈<em>Ord</em></sub>
 <em>V</em><sub>α</sub>,</td>
</tr>

</tbody></table>
</blockquote>

<p>
 where <em>Ord</em> denotes the class of all ordinals.  </p>

<p>
 The constructible hierarchy <em>L</em> is likewise defined by
recursion on ordinals. But whereas the full power set operation is
iterated to obtain the cumulative hierarchy, the levels of the
constructible hierarchy are defined strictly predicatively, that is by
including at the next level only those sets which are first order
definable using parameters from the previous level. More exactly, let
<em>Def</em>(<em>A</em>) denote the set of all subsets of <em>A</em>
definable in the structure &lt; <em>A</em>, ∈ &gt; by first order
formulas with parameters in <em>A</em>. (For more on definability see
the entry on <a href="../model-theory/">model theory</a> in this
encyclopedia.)

</p>

<p>
 With this notation the constructible hierarchy is defined by induction
over the ordinals as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<table cellpadding="3">
<tbody><tr>
<td align="left"><em>L</em><sub>0</sub></td>
<td align="left">=</td>
<td align="left">∅,</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align="left"><em>L</em><sub>α+1</sub></td>
<td align="left">=</td>
<td align="left"><em>Def</em>(<em>L</em><sub>α</sub>),</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align="left"><em>L</em><sub>γ</sub></td>
<td align="left">=</td>
<td align="left"><font size="+2">∪</font><sub>α&lt;γ</sub>
 <em>L</em><sub>α</sub>,</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align="left"><em>L</em></td>
<td align="left">=</td>
<td align="left"><font size="+2">∪</font><sub>α∈<em>Ord</em></sub> <em>L</em><sub>α</sub>,</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</blockquote>

<p>

A set <em>x</em> is said to be <em>constructible</em> if <em>x</em>
∈ <em>L</em>. The axiom which states that all sets are
constructible is denoted <em>V</em> = <em>L</em> and is called the
Axiom of Constructibility. Note that <em>L</em> is a proper class and
not a set; although as we will see, each <em>L</em><sub>α
</sub> is a set, and the predicate “<em>x</em> is constructible” is
actually a definable term of the language. </p>

<p>

Our next task is to show that <em>L</em> is a model of <em>ZF</em>. A
set or a class is <em>transitive</em> if elements of it are also
subsets. By a meticulous transfinite induction, <em>L</em><sub>α
</sub> can be shown to be transitive for each α; and therefore so
is <em>L</em> itself. This fact, together with the observation that
some elementary closure properties hold in <em>L</em>
 <sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-16" id="ref-16">16</a>]</sup>
 is enough to show that <em>L</em> is a model of <em>ZF</em>. (Indeed,
as it turns out,  <em>L</em>  is the minimal transitive model of
the <em>ZF</em> axioms containing all the ordinals, and is therefore
in this sense canonical.)</p>

<p>

In detail, proving that the <em>ZF</em> axioms, apart from the
comprehension axiom, are true in <em>L</em>, amounts to showing that,
roughly speaking, any set with a property <em>P</em> that a
<em>ZF</em> axiom asserts to exist, can be seen to exist in <em>L</em>
by considering the relativization <em>P</em><sup>L</sup> of the
property <em>P</em> to <em>L</em>. (A property <em>P</em> is
relativized to an inner model <em>M</em> by replacing every quantifier
∃<em>x</em>φ by ∃<em>x</em>(<em>x</em> ∈
<em>M</em>  ∧  φ) and every quantifier ∀<em>x</em>φ by
∀<em>x</em>(<em>x</em> ∈ <em>M</em>→ φ).)  As for
the comprehension axiom, verifying it requires showing that the set
asserted to exist is constructed at a particular successor level
<em>L</em><sub>α + 1</sub>. Proving this requires an important
principle of set theory which in modern terminology is called the Levy
(or <em>ZF</em>) Reflection Principle. This principle says that any
statement in the language of <em>ZF</em> which is true in <em>V</em>
is already true on some level of any continuously increasing hierarchy
such as <em>L</em>. (For the history of this principle, see Kanamori
2006.) The Levy Reflection Principle gives the level α at which
the elements of the set are all constructed. Gödel did not
actually have the Levy Reflection Principle but used the argument
behind the proof of the principle.</p>

<p>

Once it is established that <em>L</em> is a model of <em>ZF</em>, one
can now prove that both the <em>CH</em> and the <em>AC</em> hold in
<em>L</em>. To this end, one first shows that the definition of
<em>L</em> is <em>absolute</em> for <em>L</em>, where absoluteness is
defined as follows: given a class <em>M</em>, a predicate
<em>P</em>(<em>x</em>) is said to be absolute for <em>M</em> if and
only if for all <em>x</em> ∈ <em>M</em>, <em>P</em>(<em>x</em>)
↔ <em>P</em><sup>M</sup>(<em>x</em>).</p>

<p>

Proving that the predicate “<em>x</em> is constructible” is absolute
requires formalizing the notion of definability, which in turn
requires formalizing the notion of satisfaction. This is because the
predicate “<em>x</em> is constructible” says of a set, that for some
ordinal α, and for some formula φ with parameters in
<em>L</em><sub>α</sub>, <em>x</em> = {<em>y</em> ∈
<em>L</em><sub>α </sub> | <em>L</em><sub>α</sub>
 ⊨ 
 φ(<em>y</em>)}. This part of the proof is tedious but
unproblematic. </p>

<p>

Once the absoluteness of <em>L</em> is established, it follows that
<em>ZF</em> satisfies the axiom of constructibility if it is
relativized to <em>L</em>; that is, <em>ZF</em>
 ⊢
 (V=L)<sup>L</sup>. In particular, the axiom <em>V</em>
= <em>L</em> is consistent if <em>ZF</em> is.</p>

<p>

We now give the idea of the proof of <em>CH</em> and <em>AC</em> in
<em>ZF</em> + <em>V</em> = <em>L</em>. (For a detailed exposition of
the proof, the reader is referred to the standard sources. See for
example Devlin's chapter on constructibility in Barwise 1977; see
also Kunen 1983, and Jech 2003.)</p>

<p>

As concerns the <em>CH</em>, the idea behind the proof of it in
<em>L</em> is simply the following: Gödel showed that assuming
<em>V</em> = <em>L</em>, every real number occurs on some countable
level of the <em>L</em>-hierarchy. Since every countable level is
itself countable (after all, there are only countably many possible
defining formulas), and there are ω<sub>1</sub> countable
levels, there must be only ω<sub>1</sub> real numbers.</p>

<p>

The difficulty here, if not of the whole proof altogether, lies in
showing that every real is constructed already on a countable level of
the <em>L</em>-hierarchy. To show this Gödel argued as follows:
Suppose <em>A</em> is a real number thought of as a set of natural
numbers. By a combination of the Levy Reflection principle and the
Löwenheim-Skolem Theorem there is a countable submodel &lt;
<em>M</em>, ∈ &gt; of &lt; <em>L</em>, ∈ &gt; satisfying a
sufficiently large <em>finite</em> part of the <em>ZF</em> axioms +
<em>V</em> = <em>L</em>, such that <em>A</em> belongs to
<em>M</em>. By a simple procedure &lt; <em>M</em>, ∈ &gt; can be
converted into a transitive model &lt; <em>N</em>, ∈ &gt;. This
procedure, used by Gödel already in 1937, was explicitly isolated
by Mostowski (Mostowski 1949). The resulting model is referred to as the
Mostowski Collapse.</p>

<p>

Let us pause to discuss this important technique. Suppose &lt;
<em>M</em>, <em>E</em>&gt; is a well-founded model of the axiom of
extensionality. It is a consequence of the well-foundedness of the
binary predicate <em>E</em> on <em>M</em>, and of the principle of
transfinite recursion, that the equation π(<em>x</em>) =
{π(<em>y</em>) | <em>y</em> ∈ <em>M</em>
 ∧
 <em>yEx</em>} defines a unique function on <em>M</em>. The range
<em>N</em> of π is transitive, for if π(<em>a</em>) ∈
<em>N</em> and <em>y</em> ∈ π(<em>a</em>), then <em>y</em> =
π(<em>b</em>) for some <em>b</em> ∈ <em>M</em> with
<em>bEa</em>, whence π(<em>b</em>) ∈ <em>N</em>. The fact that
π is an isomorphism between &lt; <em>M</em>, <em>E</em>&gt; and
&lt; <em>N</em>, ∈ &gt; can be proved by transfinite induction on
elements on <em>M</em>, based again on the well-foundedness of
<em>E</em>.  The well-foundedness of &lt; <em>M</em>, <em>E</em>&gt;
is in practice often the consequence of &lt; <em>M</em>,
<em>E</em>&gt; being a submodel of some &lt;
<em>V</em><sub>α</sub>, ε &gt;.</p>

<p>

We now return to the proof of the <em>CH</em> in <em>L</em>. We used
the Mostowski Collapse to construct the transitive set <em>N</em>. As
it turns out, the real number <em>A</em> is still an element of &lt;
<em>N</em>, ∈ &gt; . By basic properties of <em>L</em>, &lt;
<em>N</em>, ∈ &gt; must be &lt; <em>L</em><sub>α </sub>,
∈ &gt; for some α . Since <em>N</em> is countable, α
is countable too. (It can be shown that |<em>L</em><sub>α</sub>|
= |α| + ℵ<sub>0</sub>.) 
Thus <em>A</em> is constructible on a countable level,
which was to have been shown.</p>

<p>

As for the <em>AC</em>, Gödel exhibits a definable well-ordering,
that is, a formula of set theory which defines, in <em>L</em>, a
well-ordering of all of <em>L</em>. The formula is tedious to write
down but the idea is a simple one: A set <em>x</em> precedes a set
<em>y</em> in the well-ordering if and only if either <em>x</em>
occurs in the <em>L</em>-hierarchy on an earlier level
<em>L</em><sub>α </sub> than <em>y</em>, or else they occur on
the same level but <em>x</em> is defined by a shorter formula than
<em>y</em>, or else they are defined by the same formula but the
parameters in the definition of <em>x</em> occur in <em>L</em> earlier
than the parameters of <em>y</em>. This well-ordering of <em>L</em>
shows that the <em>AC</em> holds in <em>L</em>.</p>

<p>

This concludes the proof of the consistency of <em>AC</em> and the
<em>CH</em> in <em>L</em>.</p>

<p>

We note that Gödel proved more in his 1939 and 1940 than what was
shown here, namely he proved the Generalized Continuum Hypothesis in
<em>L</em> and hence that it's consistency with <em>ZF</em>.</p>

 in his 1947 “What is Cantor's Continuum Hypothesis?” Gödel
conjectured that the <em>CH</em> would be shown to be independent. The
main consequence of Gödel's result, then, as far as the problem
of proving the independence of the <em>CH</em> is concerned, was that it pointed
mathematicians in the direction of adding non-constructible sets to a
model of set theory in order to establish the consistency of the
negation of the <em>CH</em>. In 1961 Dana Scott proved that the
failure of the Axiom of Constructibility follows from the existence of
a measurable cardinal, contrary to a conjecture Gödel had made in
1940. (See Scott 1961.  A cardinal κ is said to be measurable if
there is a non-principal κ-complete ultrafilter in the power-set
Boolean algebra of κ.) In 1963, as noted, Paul Cohen proved the
consistency of the negation of the <em>CH</em> by adding
non-constructible sets to an inner model.</p>

<p>

What other open questions of set theory could be solved by
Gödel's method? Gödel himself noted some consequences. They
are related to so called projective sets of real numbers and finite
sequences of real numbers. The simplest projective sets are the closed
sets, also called Π<sup>1</sup><sub>0</sub>-sets. A set is
Σ<sup>1</sup><sub><em>n</em>+1</sub> if it is the projection of
a Π<sup>1</sup><sub><em>n</em></sub>-subset of the real plane. A
set is Δ<sup>1</sup><sub><em>n</em>+1</sub> if it and its
complement are Σ<sup>1</sup><sub><em>n</em>+1</sub>.  Gödel
observed that there is both a non-Lebesgue measurable
Δ<sup>1</sup><sub>2</sub>-set and an uncountable
Π<sup>1</sup><sub>1</sub>-set without a perfect subset in
<em>L</em>. (A set of reals is perfect if it is closed, non-empty, and
has no isolated points. Such sets have the size of the continuum.)
Gödel gave a sketch of the proof in the 1951 second printing of
Gödel 1940. </p>

<p>

It has turned out subsequently that the axiom <em>V</em> = <em>L</em>
gives a virtually complete extension of <em>ZFC</em>. This means that,
apart from sentences arising from Gödel's incompleteness
theorems, essentially all set-theoretical questions can be decided by
means of the axioms <em>V</em> = <em>L</em>. This is not to imply that
such results are in any way trivial. Indeed, it has turned out that
<em>L</em> is quite a complicated structure, despite its relatively
simple description. As for settling open set-theoretical questions in
<em>L,</em>  the main step was the emergence of Jensen's fine
structure theory of <em>L</em> (Jensen 1972).  Recalling that
the successor step <em>L</em><sub>α +1</sub> in the definition
of the constructible hierarchy adds to <em>L</em> all subsets of
<em>L</em><sub>α </sub> definable by first order formulas φ
over (<em>L</em><sub>α</sub>, ∈), fine structure theory,
roughly speaking, ramifies the step from <em>L</em><sub>α </sub>
to <em>L</em><sub>α+1</sub> into smaller steps according to the
complexity of the defining formula φ. Jensen established by means
of his fine structure a strengthening, denoted by ◊, of
<em>CH</em>, that he used to construct a Souslin tree in <em>L</em>,
and a combinatorial principle □ that he used to show that the
Souslin Hypothesis is consistent with <em>CH</em>.</p>

<h4><a name="GodVieAxiCon">2.4.4 Gödel's view of the Axiom of Constructibility</a></h4>

<p>

If he did not think this way from the outset, Gödel soon came
to adopt the view that the Axiom of Constructibility was implausible.
As he remarked at the end of his 1947 “What is Cantor's Continuum
Hypothesis?”</p>

<blockquote>…it is very suspicious that, as against the
numerous plausible propositions which imply the negation of the
continuum hypothesis, not one plausible proposition is known which
would imply the continuum hypothesis. (Gödel 1990,
p. 186)</blockquote>

<p>

Gödel was compelled to this view of <em>L</em> by the
 Leibnizian<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-18" id="ref-18">18</a>]</sup>
 idea that, rather than the universe being “small,” that is, one with
the minimum number of sets, it is more natural to think of the set
theoretic universe as being as large as
 possible.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-19" id="ref-19">19</a>]</sup>This
 idea would be reflected in his interest in maximality principles,
i.e.,  principles which are meant to capture the intuitive idea that
the universe of set theory is maximal in the sense that nothing can be
added; and in his conviction that maximality principles would
eventually settle statements like the <em>CH</em>. As Gödel put
it in a letter to Ulam in the late 1950's, about a maximality
principle of von Neumann:</p>

<blockquote>

The great interest which this axiom has lies in the fact that it is a
maximality principle, somewhat similar to Hilbert's axiom of
completeness in geometry. For, roughly speaking, it says that any set
which does not, in a certain well defined way, imply an inconsistency
exists. Its being a maximum principle also explains the fact that this
axiom implies the axiom of choice. I believe that the basic problems
of set theory, such as Cantor's continuum problem, will be solved
satisfactorily only with the help of stronger axioms of this kind,
which in a sense are opposite or complimentary to the constructivistic
interpretation of mathematics.  (Ulam 1958, as quoted in Gödel
1990, p. 168; original emphasis. Note that this is different from the
very similar passage Gödel 2003b, p.295.) </blockquote>

<p>

Twenty years earlier, in 1938, Gödel had written seemingly
differently about the Axiom of Constructibility:</p>

<blockquote>The proposition <em>A</em> (i.e.,  <em>V</em> = <em>L</em>)
added as a new axiom seems to give a natural completion of the axioms
of set theory, in so far as it determines the vague notion of an
arbitrary infinite set in a definite way. (Gödel 1986,
p.27)</blockquote>

<p>

Gödel may have meant by “natural completion” here “the correct
completion,” or he may have meant to say no more than that the Axiom
of Constructibility determines the notion of set in a definite way. In
any case he used the term “natural” differently in a conversation with
Wang on constructibility in 1972 (Wang 1996, p. 144):</p>

<blockquote>Gödel talked more about the relation between axioms of
infinity and the constructible universe…(he observed that)
preliminary concepts such as that of constructible sets are necessary
to arrive at the natural concept, such as that of set.</blockquote>

<p>

This is reminiscent of a remark of Hugh Woodin, that studying forcing
leads to a better understanding of <em>V</em> — the general
principle being that studying the models of a theory is not only
useful to understand the theory itself, but useful to obtain a better
picture of <em>V</em> (Woodin 1988).</p>

<h3><a name="GodWorIntLogAri">2.5 Gödel's Work in Intuitionistic Logic and Arithmetic</a></h3>

<p>

Gödel's interest in intuitionism was deep and long-lasting.
Although he himself did not subscribe to that view, he made a number of
important contributions to intuitionistic logic. Perhaps the importance
he placed on the concept of evidence (see below) led to his close
consideration of it.</p>

<p>

We discuss Gödel's results on intuitionistic logic in their
chronological order.</p>

<h4><a name="IntProLogNotFinVal">2.5.1 Intuitionistic Propositional Logic is not Finitely-Valued</a></h4>

<p>

Both many-valued logic, introduced by Łukasiewicz in the twenties
(Łukasiewicz 1970) and intuitionistic logic, formalized by Heyting
in 1930, fail to satisfy the law of excluded middle. It was therefore
natural to ask whether intuitionistic logic can be presented as a
many-valued logic, and indeed a number of logicians in the 1920's had
suggested just that.  In his 1932 Gödel gave a simple argument
which shows that intuitionistic propositional logic cannot be thought
of as a finitely-valued logic. Precisely, Gödel proved two
theorems:</p>

<blockquote>

<strong>Theorem 7</strong>. <br />
 There is no realization with finitely many elements (truth values)
for which the formulas provable in <strong>H</strong>, and only
those, are satisfied (that is, yield designated values for an
arbitrary assignment).

</blockquote>

<p>

(<strong>H</strong> is intuitionistic propositional logic, after
Heyting.)</p>

<blockquote>

<strong>Theorem 8</strong>. <br />
 Infinitely many systems lie between <strong>H</strong> and the system
<strong>A</strong> of the ordinary propositional calculus, that is,
there is a monotonically decreasing sequence of systems all of which
include <strong>H</strong> as a subset and are included in
<strong>A</strong> as subsets.</blockquote>

<p>

In his proof he considered for each natural number <em>n</em> &gt; 0
the sentence</p>

<blockquote><em>F</em><sub><em>n</em></sub> =
 <font size="+3">∨</font><sub>1 ≤ <em>i</em> &lt;
<em>j</em> ≤ <em>n</em></sub> <em>p</em><sub><em>i</em></sub>
≡ <em>p</em><sub><em>j</em></sub>.</blockquote>

<p>

He observed that in an <em>n</em>-valued logic the sentences
<em>F</em><sub><em>m</em></sub>, for <em>m</em> &gt; <em>n</em>,
should be derivable. However, Gödel showed,
<em>F</em><sub><em>n</em></sub> is not derivable from Heyting's axioms
for any <em>n</em>.</p>

<p>

Subsequently Jaśkowski (Jaśkowski 1936) showed that
intuitionistic propositional logic can be given a many-valued
semantics in terms of infinitely many truth-values. For further
discussion of many-valued logics, see for example the entry on
 <a href="../logic-manyvalued/">many-valued logic</a>
 in this encyclopedia as well as van Stigt's article on intuitionistic
logic in Mancosu 1998.</p>

<h4><a name="ClaAriIntHeyAri">2.5.2 Classical Arithmetic is Interpretable in Heyting Arithmetic</a></h4>

<p>

We now consider Gödel 1933e, in which Gödel showed,
in effect, that intuitionistic or Heyting arithmetic is only
apparently weaker than classical first-order arithmetic. This is
because the latter can be interpreted within the former by means of a
simple translation, and thus to be convinced of the consistency of
classical arithmetic, it is enough to be convinced of the consistency
of Heyting arithmetic.  Heyting arithmetic is defined to be the same
as classical arithmetic, except that the underlying predicate logic is
given by intuitionistic axioms and rules of inference (see below).</p>

<p>

This result extends the same assertion for the propositional case.
Let <strong>H</strong> denote the intuitionistic propositional logic,
and <strong>A</strong> denote its classical counterpart (as
above). Inductively define:</p>

<blockquote>

<table cellpadding="+3">
<tbody><tr>
<td align="center"><em>A</em>′</td>
<td align="left">≡</td>
<td align="left">¬¬<em>A</em> (<em>A</em> atomic)</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align="center">(¬<em>A</em>)′ </td>
<td align="left">≡</td>
<td align="left">¬<em>A</em>′ </td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align="left">(<em>A</em> → <em>B</em>)′</td>
<td align="left">≡</td>

 ∧ 
<em>B</em>)′</td>
<td align="left">≡</td>
<td align="left"><em>A</em>′
 ∧ 
<em>B</em>′</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

</blockquote>

<p>

Then,</p>

<blockquote>

<strong>Theorem 9</strong>. <br />
Let <em>F</em> be a propositional formula. Then 
<strong>H</strong> 
 ⊢ 
 <em>F</em> if and only if <strong>A</strong>
 ⊢ 
 <em>F</em>′,</blockquote>

<p>

The theorem follows easily from the result of Glivenko (1929)
that ¬<em>F</em> follows from <strong>H</strong> if and only if
¬<em>F</em> follows from <strong>A</strong>, for any propositional
formula <em>F</em>.</p>

<p>

Gödel's so-called double negation interpretation extends Theorem
9 to a reduction of classical first order logic to intuitionistic
predicate logic. The translation in this case can be taken to map
<em>A</em>′ to <em>A</em> for atomic <em>A</em>. Moreover, we
let ∀<em>xA</em>(<em>x</em>)′ =
∀<em>xA</em>′(<em>x</em>) :</p>

<blockquote>

<strong>Theorem 10</strong>.<br />
Suppose <em>A</em> is a first order formula. If <em>A</em> is
provable in classical first order logic, then <em>A</em>′ is
provable in intuitionistic first order logic.</blockquote>

<p>

The above result had been obtained independently by Gentzen (with
Bernays), but upon hearing of Gödel's result Gentzen withdrew his
paper from publication. It had also been anticipated by Kolmogorov in
his 1925 “On the Principle of the Excluded Middle,” (English
translation van Heijenoort 1967) but that paper was largely
unknown to logicians who were outside of Kolmogorov's circle.</p>

<p>

Bernays has written (see Bernays' entry on David Hilbert in Edwards
1967) that this result of Gödel's drew the attention of the
Hilbert school to two observations: first, that intuitionistic logic
goes beyond finitism, and secondly, that finitist systems may not be
the only acceptable ones from the foundational point of view.</p>

<p>

The following theorem for the case of arithmetic follows
from Theorem 10:</p>

<blockquote>

<strong>Theorem 11</strong>. <br />
 Suppose <em>A</em> is a first order formula of arithmetic.  If
<em>A</em> is provable in classical Peano arithmetic, then
<em>A</em>′ is provable in intuitionistic first order
arithmetic.

</blockquote>

<p>

see Gödel 1958, reprinted with detailed introductory note by
A.S. Troelstra in Gödel 1990. See also Troelstra 1973, and
Troelstra's “Aspects of constructive mathematics” in Barwise 1977.
For a detailed proof of the above theorem the reader is referred also
to the latter.</p>

<h4><a name="IntProLogIntS4">2.5.3 Intuitionistic Propositional Logic is Interpretable in <strong>S4</strong></a></h4>

<p>

This result of Gödel's (Gödel 1933f), which marks
the beginning of provability logic, makes exact the difference between
the concept of “provability in a specified formal system” and that of
“provability by any correct means.”</p>

<p>

Gödel had already noted this difference in the introduction to
his 1929 thesis. The context was the following: Gödel entertains
there the possibility that his proof of the Completeness Theorem might
be circular, since the law of excluded middle was used to prove it.
This is because while the Completeness Theorem asserts ‘a kind
of decidability,’ namely every quantificational formula is
either provable or a counterexample to it can be given, ‘the
principle of the excluded middle seems to express nothing other than
the decidability of every problem’:</p>

<blockquote>

… what is affirmed (by the law of excluded middle) is the
solvability not at all through specified means but only through all
means that are <em>in any way imaginable</em> …
 <sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-20" id="ref-20">20</a>]</sup></blockquote>

<p>

Gödel considers intuitionistic propositional logic (henceforth
IPL); he also considers a second system, classical propositional logic
enriched by an operator “B”, where the intended meaning of “B” is
“provable.” The axiom system now known as <strong>S4</strong> (for a
list of these axioms see for example the entry on
 <a href="../logic-modal/">modal logic</a>
 in this encyclopedia) is added to the standard axioms for classical
propositional logic together with a new rule of proof: from
<em>A</em>, B<em>A</em> may be inferred. Let us call this second
system <strong>G</strong>. Gödel's theorem states that
<em>IPL</em> is interpretable in <strong>G</strong> via the following
translation:</p>

<blockquote>
<table cellpadding="+3">
<tbody><tr>
<td align="center">¬<em>p</em> </td>
<td align="left">≡</td>
<td align="left">~B<em>p</em> </td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align="left"><em>p</em> ⊃ <em>q</em> </td>
<td align="left">≡</td>
<td align="left">B<em>p</em> → B<em>q</em> </td>
</tr>

<tr>

 ∧ 
 <em>q</em> </td>
<td align="left">≡</td>
<td align="left">B<em>p</em>
 ∧ 
B<em>q</em> </td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</blockquote>

<p>

That is,</p>

<blockquote>

<strong>Theorem 12</strong>. <br /> 
 Let <em>A</em> be a formula of
<em>IPL</em>, and let <em>A</em>′ be its translation. Then
<em>IPL</em>
 ⊢ <em>A</em> implies
 <strong>G</strong>
 ⊢ 
 <em>A</em>′.</blockquote>

<p>

Gödel conjectures that the converse implication must be true,
and indeed this was shown in McKinsey and Tarski 1948.</p>

<p>

The difference between the two notions of provability: “provable in a
given formal system <em>S</em>” and provability by any correct means
— manifests itself as a consequence of Gödel's Second
Incompleteness Theorem, as follows. Let <em>S</em> contain Peano
arithmetic, and let the operator B be interpreted as “provable in
<em>S</em>”. If the axioms of <strong>S4</strong> were valid for this
interpretations of <em>B</em>, then from <em>B</em>(0 ≠ 1) →
(0 ≠ 1), the sentence ¬<em>B</em>(0 ≠ 1) would be provable,
contradicting the Second Incompleteness Theorem.</p>

<p>

its extensions, as well as its philosophical significance, the reader

<h4><a name="HeyAriIntComFunFinTyp">2.5.4 Heyting Arithmetic is Interpretable into Computable Functionals of Finite Type.</a></h4>

<p>

Gödel's so-called Dialectica intepretation (Gödel 1958)
delivers a relative consistency proof and justification for Heyting
arithmetic by means of a concrete interpretation involving a
system <em>T</em> of computable functionals of finite type. Taken
together with his 1933e, which reduces classical first order
arithmetic to Heyting arithmetic, a justification in these terms is
also obtained for classical first order arithmetic.</p>

<p>

Gödel's inductive definition of the notion “function
of finite type” is as follows: (Gödel 1990, p. 245).</p>

<ol>
 <li>The functionals of type 0 are the natural
numbers.</li>

 <li>If <em>t</em><sub>0</sub>,…,
<em>t</em><sub><em>k</em></sub> are types and we have already defined
what functionals of types
<em>t</em><sub>0</sub>,…,<em>t</em><sub><em>k</em></sub> are,
then (<em>t</em><sub>0</sub>,…,
<em>t</em><sub><em>k</em></sub>) is a type and a functional
of that type assigns to every <em>k</em>-tuple of
functionals of respective types <em>t</em><sub>1</sub>,…,
<em>t</em><sub><em>k</em></sub>, a functional of type
<em>t</em><sub>0</sub>.</li>

</ol>

<p>

Gödel considers the quantifier free theory of these
functionals of finite type, denoted by <em>T</em>. <em>T</em> has the
following features: the language of <em>T</em> contains variables of
each type, constants for distinguished types, and a ternary predicate
=<sub>σ</sub> for equality for type σ.  Equality between
terms of the same type is decidable. The non-logical axioms and rules
for <em>T</em> include the classical arithmetic axioms for 0 and
successor, and the induction rule:</p>

<blockquote>(<em>F</em>(0)
 ∧ 
 (<em>F</em>(<em>x</em><sup>0</sup>)
 → 
<em>F</em>(<em>S</em>(<em>x</em><sup>0</sup>))))
 → 
<em>F</em>(<em>x</em><sup>0</sup>)</blockquote>

<p>

for quantifier-free formulas <em>F</em>(<em>x</em><sup>0</sup>). As
Gödel remarks (Gödel 1990, p. 247), the axioms for
<em>T</em> are essentially those of primitive recursive arithmetic,
except that the variables can be of any finite type.</p>

<p>

Gödel's translation associates with every formula
<em>F</em>(<strong>x</strong>) of the language of Peano arithmetic a
formula <em>F</em>′(<strong>x</strong>) =
∃<strong>y</strong>∀<strong>z</strong><em>A</em>(<strong>y</strong>,
<strong>z</strong>, <strong>x</strong>) of the language of the theory
<em>T</em>, where <em>A</em> is quantifier free and the (boldface)
bound variables are finite sequences of variables thought to range
over functionals of a finite type determined by the type of the
variable. Intuitively, <strong>y</strong> is a concrete analogue of
the abstract notion of a construction constituting the meaning of
<em>F</em>.</p>

<p>

Gödel's theorem is as follows:</p>

<blockquote><strong>Theorem 13</strong>. <br />
 Suppose <em>F</em>′ =
∃<strong>y</strong>∀<strong>z</strong><em>A</em>(<strong>y</strong>,
<strong>z</strong>, <strong>x</strong>). If <em>F</em> is provable in intuitionistic first
order arithmetic, then there are computable functionals
<strong>Q</strong> of finite type such that
<em>A</em>(<strong>Q</strong>(<strong>x</strong>), <strong>z</strong>,
<strong>x</strong>) is provable in <em>T</em>.</blockquote>

<p>

The proof is by induction on the structure of the proof of <em>F</em>
in intuitionistic first order arithmetic. (For a treatment of the
proof in detail, the reader is referred to Troelstra 1986.)</p>

<p>

The importance of the theorem for foundations cannot be
overstated.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-21" id="ref-21">21</a>]</sup>
 A discussion of its generalizations, of
ensuing work on functional interpretations stimulated by the theorem
due to Kreisel, Tait, Howard, Feferman and others; its foundational
and philosophical significance; and finally its relation particularly
to the earlier, informal, proof interpretation, so-called, given by
Heyting-Kolmogorov, will not be attempted here. Accordingly the reader
is referred to the large literature on the subject, e.g., the
abovementioned Troelstra 1986, Tait 1967, Feferman 1993 and Avigad
&amp; Feferman 1998.  For interesting recent developments, e.g., in
the area of relating Gödel's Dialectica interpretation and
Kreisel's modified realizability, see Oliva 2006. See also van Oosten
2008. </p>

<p>

A remark concerning the philosophical context in which Gödel
presented his translation, namely finitism. The question addressed in
the introduction to the paper is what <em>abstract</em> notions must
be added to finitary mathematics in order to obtain a consistency
proof for arithmetic. Equivalently: what does the finitary view
presuppose, which must be given up in the light of the Second
Incompleteness Theorem, if the consistency proof is to be
obtained:</p>

<blockquote>In any case Bernays' remark teaches us to distinguish two
components of the finitary attitude; namely, first, the constructive
element, which consists in our being allowed to speak of mathematical
objects only insofar as we can exhibit them or actually produce them
by means of a construction; second, the specifically finitistic
element, which makes the further demand that the objects about which
we make statements, with which the constructions are carried out and
which we obtain by means of these constructions, are
‘intuitive’, that is, are in the last analysis
spatiotemporal arrangements of elements whose characteristics other
than their identity or nonidentity are irrelevant.… It is the
second requirement that must be dropped. This fact has hitherto been
taken into account by our adjoining to finitary mathematics parts of
intuitionistic logic and the theory of ordinals. In what follows we
shall show that, for the consistency proof of number theory, we can
use, instead, the notion of computable function of finite type on the
natural numbers and certain rather elementary principles of
construction for such functions.  (Gödel 1990,
p.245).</blockquote>

<p>

Aside from its technical contribution, then, Gödel's
1958/72 is one of Gödel's most important philosophical
works; notable for its analysis of the nature of finitary mathematics,
as well as its analysis of the notions of “intuitive,” as in
“intuitive knowledge,” and that of abstract versus concrete
evidence. </p>

<p>In the next section, we turn to Gödel's philosophical views.
But interested readers may wish to read a brief discussion about
Gödel's Nachlass, important source of philosophical material by
Gödel:</p>

  <blockquote>
  <a href="documents.html">Supplement Document: Gödel's Documents</a>
  </blockquote>

<h2><a name="GodPhiWor">3. Gödel's Philosophical Views</a></h2>

<p>
Gödel's philosophical views can be broadly characterized by two
points of focus, or, in modern parlance, commitments. These are:
realism, namely the belief that mathematics is a descriptive science
in the way that the empirical sciences are.  The second commitment is
to a form of Leibnizian rationalism in philosophy; and in fact
Gödel's principal philosophical influences, in this regard
particularly but also many others, were Leibniz, Kant and
Husserl. (For further discussion of how these philosophers influenced
Gödel, see van Atten and Kennedy 2003.)</p>

<p>

The terms “Gödel's realism” and “Gödel's
rationalism” must be prefaced with a disclaimer: there is no
single view one could associate with each of these terms. Gödel's
realism  underwent a complex development over time, in
both the nature of its ontological claims as well as in Gödel's
level of commitment to those claims. Similarly Gödel's
rationalism underwent a complex development over time, from a
tentative version of it at the beginning, to what was adjudged to be a
fairly strong version of it in the 1950's. Around 1959 and for some
time afterward Gödel fused his rationalistic program of
developing exact philosophy with the phenomenological method as
developed by Husserl. </p>

<p>

We examine these two strains of Gödel's thinking below:</p>

<h3><a name="GodRat">3.1 Gödel's Rationalism</a></h3>

<p>

Gödel's rationalism has its roots in the Leibnizian thought
that the world, not that which we immanently experience but that which
itself gives rise to immanent experience, is perfect and beautiful, and
therefore rational and ordered. Gödel's justification of this
belief rests partly on an inductive generalization from the perfection
and beauty of mathematics:</p>

<blockquote>

Rationalism is connected with Platonism because it is directed to the
conceptual aspect rather than toward the (real) world.  One uses
inductive evidence…Mathematics has a form of
perfection…We may expect that the conceptual world is perfect,
and, furthermore, that objective reality is beautiful, good, and
perfect. (Wang 1996, 9.4.18)

<p>Our total reality and total experience are beautiful and
meaningful—this is also a Leibnizian thought. We should judge
reality by the little which we truly know of it. Since that part which
conceptually we know fully turns out to be so beautiful, the real
world of which we know so little should also be beautiful.
(9.4.20)</p>

</blockquote>

<p>

Although the roots of Gödel's belief in rationalism are
metaphysical in nature, his long-standing aspirations in that domain
had always been practical ones. Namely, to develop exact methods in
philosophy; to transform it into an exact science, or <em>strenge
Wissenschaft</em>, to use Husserl's term.</p>

<p>

What this means in practice is taking the strictest view possible of
what constitutes the <em>dialectical</em> grounds for the acceptance
of an assertion; put another way, a level of rigor is aspired to in
philosophical arguments approaching that which is found in
mathematical proofs. A formulation of the view—one which is
somewhat phenomenologically colored (see below)—can be found in
a document in the Gödel Nachlass. This is a fourteen item list
Gödel drew up in about 1960, entitled “My Philosophical
Viewpoint.” Two items on the list are relevant here:</p>

<ol start="3">
<li>There are systematic methods for the solution of all
problems (also art, etc.).</li>
</ol>
<ol start="13">
<li>There is a scientific (exact) philosophy and theology,
which deals with concepts of the highest abstractness; and this is also
most highly fruitful for science.</li>
</ol>

<p>

(The list was transcribed by Cheryl Dawson and was published in
 <em>Wang 1996</em>, p. 316.)</p>

<p>

Gödel's earlier conception of rationalism refers to mathematical
rigor and includes the concept of having a genuine proof, and is
therefore in some sense a more radical one than that to which he would
later subscribe. One can see it at work at the end of
the Gibbs lecture, after a sequence of arguments in favor of realism
are given:</p>

<blockquote>Of course I do not claim that the foregoing considerations
amount to a real proof of this view about the nature of mathematics.
The most I could assert would be to have disproved the nominalistic
view, which considers mathematics to consist solely in syntactical
conventions and their consequences. Moreover, I have adduced some
strong arguments against the more general view that mathematics is our
own creation. There are, however, other alternatives to Platonism, in
particular psychologism and Aristotelian realism. In order to
establish Platonic realism, these theories would have to be disproved
one after the other, and then it would have to be shown that they
exhaust all possibilities. I am not in a position to do this now;
however I would like to give some indications along these lines.
(Gödel 1995, p. 321–2).</blockquote>

<p>

(For a penetrating analysis of this passage see Tait 2001.)  Such an
analysis must be based on conceptual analysis:</p>

<blockquote>I am under the impression that after sufficient
clarification of the concepts in question it will be possible to
conduct these discussions with mathematical rigour and that the result
will then be…that the Platonistic view is the only one tenable.
(Gödel 1995, p. 322).</blockquote>

<p>

Along with the methodological component, as can be seen from the items
on Gödel's list, there was also an “optimistic” component to
Gödel's rationalism: once the appropriate methods have been
developed, philosophical problems such as, for example, those in
ethics (e.g., item 9 on the list is: “Formal rights comprise a real
science.”)  can be decisively solved. As for mathematical assertions,
such as the Continuum Hypothesis in set theory, once conceptual
analysis has been carried out in the right way, that is, once the
basic concepts, such as that of “set,” have been completely clarified, 
the Continuum Hypothesis should be able to be decided. </p>

<p> Although at the time of the Gibbs lecture the analogy in
Gödel's mind between philosophical and mathematical reasoning may
have been a very close one, Gödel's view at other periods was
that the envisaged methods will not be mathematical in nature. What
was wanted was a general, informal science of conceptual analysis.</p>

<blockquote>

Philosophy is more general than science. Already the
theory of concepts is more general than mathematics…True
philosophy is precise but not specialized.

<p>Perhaps the reason why no progress is made in mathematics
(and there are so many unsolved problems), is that one confines oneself
to the ext[ensional]—thence also the feeling of disappointment in the
case of many theories, e.g., propositional logic and formalisation
altogether.  (Wang 1996, 9.3.20,
 9.3.21)<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-22" id="ref-22">22</a>]</sup> </p>

Library, Princeton, item 030090). Transcription Cheryl Dawson;

of Max IV indicates that it is from May 1941 to April 1942. See also
Gödel's letter to Bernays, Gödel 2003a,
p. 283.)</p>

<p>

An important source for understanding Gödel's advance toward a
general theory of concepts are Gödel's remarks on conceptual
analysis published by Hao Wang in <em>Logical Journey</em>. In remark
8.6.10 for example, Gödel expresses the belief that
extensionality fails for concepts, contrary to what he said in his
1944 “Russell's Mathematical Logic,” a remark which he now
wishes to retract:</p>

<blockquote>I do not (no longer) believe that generally sameness of
range is sufficient to exclude the distinctness of two
concepts.</blockquote>

<p> In some of Gödel's later discussions another component of
conceptual analysis emerges, namely the project of finding the
so-called primitive terms or concepts, and their relations. These are
roughly terms or concepts which comprise a theoretical “starting
point,” on the basis of their meaning being completely definite
and clear. For example, the concept of “the application of a
concept to another concept” is a primitive term, along with
“force”.  (Wang 1996, 9.1.29).</p>

<p>

He spoke to Wang about the general project in 1972:</p>

<blockquote>Phenomenology is not the only approach. Another approach
is to find a list of the main categories (e.g., causation, substance,
action) and their interrelations, which, however, are to be arrived at
phenomenologically. The task must be done in the right manner.  (Wang
1996, 5.3.7).</blockquote>

<p>

Gödel spoke with Sue Toledo between 1972 and 1975 about the
project of finding primitive terms, as well as other aspects of
phenomenology. See Toledo 2011.  We discuss Gödel's involvement
with phenomenology further in the supplementary document
  <a href="goedel-phenomenology.html">Gödel's Turn to Phenomenology</a>.</p>

<p>

The judgement levied upon Gödel's rationalism by contemporary
philosophers was a harsh one. (See for example Gödel 1995,
pp. 303–4). Nevertheless Gödel himself remained
optimistic. As he commented to Wang:</p>

<blockquote>It is not appropriate to say that philosophy as rigorous
science is not realizable in the foreseeable future. Time is not the
main factor; it can happen anytime when the right idea appears.  (Wang
1996, 4.3.14).</blockquote>

<p>

Gödel concluded his 1944 on a similarly optimistic
note.</p>

<h3><a name="GodRea">3.2 Gödel's Realism</a></h3>

<p>

Gödel's realist views were formulated mostly in the context of
the foundations of mathematics and set theory.</p>

<p>

We referred above the list “What I believe,”  thought to have
been written in 1960 or thereabouts. Out of 14 items, only two refer to
realism, remarks 10 and 12:</p>

<ol start="10">
<li>Materialism is false.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="12">
<li>Concepts have an objective existence.</li>
</ol>

<p>

Gödel published his views on realism for the first time in his
1944. The following is one of his most quoted passages on the
subject:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Classes and concepts may, however, also be conceived as real
objects, namely classes as “pluralities of things,”  or as
structures consisting of a plurality of things and concepts as the
properties and relations of things existing independently of our
definitions and constructions.</p>

<p>It seems to me that the assumption of such objects is quite as
legitimate as the assumption of physical bodies and there is quite as
much reason to believe in their existence. They are in the same sense
necessary to obtain a satisfactory system of mathematics as physical
bodies are necessary for a satisfactory theory of our sense
perceptions and in both cases it is impossible to interpret the
propositions one wants to assert about these entities as propositions
about the “data,” i.e., in the latter case the actually
occurring sense perceptions.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>

Gödel's reference to the impossibility of interpreting empirical
laws, or more precisely, instantiations of them—the statements
“one wants to assert,”—as statements about sense
perceptions, is  likely an endorsement of the (then) contemporary
critique of phenomenalism. The critique was based on the observation
that sense data are so inextricably bound up with the conditions under
which they are experienced, that no correspondence between statements
about those and the statements “we want to assert”  can be given (see
Chisholm 1948 for example). More generally Gödel was against
verificationism, namely the idea that the meaning of a statement is
its mode of verification.</p>

<p>

The analogical point in the first part of the passage was amplified
by Gödel in the draft manuscript “Is Mathematics a Syntax of
Language?”:</p>

<blockquote>It is arbitrary to consider “This is red”  an immediate
datum, but not so to consider the proposition expressing modus ponens
or complete induction (or perhaps some simpler propositions from which
the latter follows). (Gödel 1995, p. 359)</blockquote>

<p>

Some writers have interpreted Gödel in this and similar passages
pragmatically, attributing to him the view that because
empirical statements are paradigmatic of successful reference,  reference in the case
of abstract concepts should be modelled 
causally. (See  Maddy 1990.)
Interpreting reference to <em>abstract</em> objects this way, it is
argued, addresses the main difficulty
associated with realism, the problem how we
can come to have knowledge of abstract objects.  Others have argued
that Gödel had no paradigm case in mind; that for him both the
empirical and the abstract case are either equally problematic, or
equally unproblematic. (See Tait 1986.)  The latter view is referred to as
epistemological parity  in van Atten
and Kennedy 2003.  (See also Kennedy and van Atten 2004.)</p>

<p>

In his 1947 “What is Cantor's Continuum Problem?”,
Gödel expounds the view that in the case of meaningful
propositions of mathematics, there is always a fact of the matter to
be decided in a yes or no fashion. This is a direct consequence of
realism, for if there exists a domain of mathematical objects or
concepts, then any meaningful proposition concerning them must be
either true or
 false.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-23" id="ref-23">23</a>]</sup>
 The Continuum Hypothesis is Gödel's
example of a meaningful question. The concept “how many”
leads “unambiguously” to a definite meaning of the
hypothesis, and therefore it should be decidable—at least in
principle. Most strikingly Gödel does not leave the matter there
but goes on to offer a practical strategy for determining the value of
the continuum, as well as the truth value of other axioms extending
<em>ZFC</em>. Specifically, he offers two criteria for their
decidability: the first involves conceptual analysis and is associated
with Gödel's rationalistic program. (See the above section on
Gödel's rationalism.) Secondly one must keep an eye on the
so-called success of the axiom, as a check or indicator of which
direction to look to for the solution of its truth. For example,
Gödel notes in the paper that none of the consequences of the
Axiom of Constructibility are very plausible. It is, then, likely
false. See Maddy 2011 and Koellner 2014 for discussion of intrinsic vs
extrinsic justifications for new axioms of set theory. </p>
