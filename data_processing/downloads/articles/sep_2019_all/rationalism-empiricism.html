<h1>Rationalism vs. Empiricism</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Thu Aug 19, 2004; substantive revision Thu Jul 6, 2017</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
The dispute between rationalism and empiricism concerns the extent to
which we are dependent upon sense experience in our effort to gain
knowledge. Rationalists claim that there are significant ways in which
our concepts and knowledge are gained independently of sense
experience. Empiricists claim that sense experience is the ultimate
source of all our concepts and knowledge.</p>

<p>
Rationalists generally develop their view in two ways. First, they
argue that there are cases where the content of our concepts or
knowledge outstrips the information that sense experience can provide.
Second, they construct accounts of how reason in some form or other
provides that additional information about the world. Empiricists
present complementary lines of thought. First, they develop accounts
of how experience provides the information that rationalists cite,
insofar as we have it in the first place. (Empiricists will at times
opt for skepticism as an alternative to rationalism: if experience
cannot provide the concepts or knowledge the rationalists cite, then
we don’t have them.) Second, empiricists attack the
rationalists’ accounts of how reason is a source of concepts or
knowledge.</p>

<h2 id="Intr">1. Introduction</h2>

<p>
The dispute between rationalism and empiricism takes place within
epistemology, the branch of philosophy devoted to studying the nature,
sources and limits of knowledge. The defining questions of
epistemology include the following.</p>

<ol>

<li>

<p>
What is the nature of propositional knowledge, knowledge that a
particular proposition about the world is true?</p>

<p>
To know a proposition, we must believe it and it must be true, but
something more is required, something that distinguishes knowledge
from a lucky guess. Let’s call this additional element
‘warrant’. A good deal of philosophical work has been
invested in trying to determine the nature of warrant.</p></li>

<li>

<p>
How can we gain knowledge?</p>

<p>
We can form true beliefs just by making lucky guesses. How to gain
warranted beliefs is less clear. Moreover, to know the world, we must
think about it, and it is unclear how we gain the concepts we use in
thought or what assurance, if any, we have that the ways in which we
divide up the world using our concepts correspond to divisions that
actually exist.</p></li>

<li>

<p>
What are the limits of our knowledge?</p>

<p>
Some aspects of the world may be within the limits of our thought but
beyond the limits of our knowledge; faced with competing descriptions
of them, we cannot know which description is true. Some aspects of the
world may even be beyond the limits of our thought, so that we cannot
form intelligible descriptions of them, let alone know that a
particular description is true.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>
The disagreement between rationalists and empiricists primarily
concerns the second question, regarding the sources of our concepts
and knowledge. In some instances, their disagreement on this topic
leads them to give conflicting responses to the other questions as
well. They may disagree over the nature of warrant or about the limits
of our thought and knowledge. Our focus here will be on the competing
rationalist and empiricist responses to the second question.</p>

<h3 id="Rati">1.1 Rationalism</h3>

<p>
To be a rationalist is to adopt at least one of three claims. The
Intuition/Deduction thesis concerns how we become warranted in
believing propositions in a particular subject area.</p>

<blockquote>
<em>The Intuition/Deduction Thesis</em>: Some propositions in a
particular subject area, S, are knowable by us by intuition alone;
still others are knowable by being deduced from intuited propositions.
</blockquote>

<p>
Intuition is a form of rational insight. Intellectually grasping a
proposition, we just “see” it to be true in such a way as
to form a true, warranted belief in it. (As discussed in Section 2
below, the nature of this intellectual “seeing” needs
explanation.) Deduction is a process in which we derive conclusions
from intuited premises through valid arguments, ones in which the
conclusion must be true if the premises are true. We intuit, for
example, that the number three is prime and that it is greater than
two. We then deduce from this knowledge that there is a prime number
greater than two. Intuition and deduction thus provide us with
knowledge <em>a priori</em>, which is to say knowledge gained
independently of sense experience.</p>

<p>
We can generate different versions of the Intuition/Deduction thesis
by substituting different subject areas for the variable
‘S’. Some rationalists take mathematics to be knowable by
intuition and deduction. Some place ethical truths in this category.
Some include metaphysical claims, such as that God exists, we have
free will, and our mind and body are distinct substances. The more
propositions rationalists include within the range of intuition and
deduction, and the more controversial the truth of those propositions
or the claims to know them, the more radical their rationalism.</p>

<p>
Rationalists also vary the strength of their view by adjusting their
understanding of warrant. Some take warranted beliefs to be beyond
even the slightest doubt and claim that intuition and deduction
provide beliefs of this high epistemic status. Others interpret
warrant more conservatively, say as belief beyond a reasonable doubt,
and claim that intuition and deduction provide beliefs of that
caliber. Still another dimension of rationalism depends on how its
proponents understand the connection between intuition, on the one
hand, and truth, on the other. Some take intuition to be infallible,
claiming that whatever we intuit must be true. Others allow for the
possibility of false intuited propositions.</p>

<p>
The second thesis associated with rationalism is the Innate Knowledge
thesis.</p>

<blockquote>
<em>The Innate Knowledge Thesis</em>: We have knowledge of some truths
in a particular subject area, S, as part of our rational nature.
</blockquote>

<p>
Like the Intuition/Deduction thesis, the Innate Knowledge thesis
asserts the existence of knowledge gained <em>a priori</em>,
independently of experience. The difference between them rests in the
accompanying understanding of how this <em>a priori</em> knowledge is
gained. The Intuition/Deduction thesis cites intuition and subsequent
deductive reasoning. The Innate Knowledge thesis offers our rational
nature. Our innate knowledge is not learned through either sense
experience or intuition and deduction. It is just part of our nature.
Experiences may trigger a process by which we bring this knowledge to
consciousness, but the experiences do not provide us with the
knowledge itself. It has in some way been with us all along. According
to some rationalists, we gained the knowledge in an earlier existence.
According to others, God provided us with it at creation. Still others
say it is part of our nature through natural selection.</p>

<p>
We get different versions of the Innate Knowledge thesis by
substituting different subject areas for the variable ‘S’.
Once again, the more subjects included within the range of the thesis
or the more controversial the claim to have knowledge in them, the
more radical the form of rationalism. Stronger and weaker
understandings of warrant yield stronger and weaker versions of the
thesis as well.</p>

<p>
The third important thesis of rationalism is the Innate Concept
thesis.</p>

<blockquote>
<em>The Innate Concept Thesis</em>: We have some of the concepts we
employ in a particular subject area, S, as part of our rational
nature.
</blockquote>

<p>
According to the Innate Concept thesis, some of our concepts are not
gained from experience. They are part of our rational nature in such a
way that, while sense experiences may trigger a process by which they
are brought to consciousness, experience does not provide the concepts
or determine the information they contain. Some claim that the Innate
Concept thesis is entailed by the Innate Knowledge Thesis; a
particular instance of knowledge can only be innate if the concepts
that are contained in the known proposition are also innate. This is
Locke’s position (1690, Book I, Chapter IV, Section 1, p. 91).
Others, such as Carruthers, argue against this connection (1992, pp.
53–54). The content and strength of the Innate Concept thesis
varies with the concepts claimed to be innate. The more a concept
seems removed from experience and the mental operations we can perform
on experience the more plausibly it may be claimed to be innate. Since
we do not experience perfect triangles but do experience pains, our
concept of the former is a more promising candidate for being innate
than our concept of the latter.</p>

<p>
The Intuition/Deduction thesis, the Innate Knowledge thesis, and the
Innate Concept thesis are essential to rationalism: to be a
rationalist is to adopt at least one of them. Two other closely
related theses are generally adopted by rationalists, although one can
certainly be a rationalist without adopting either of them. The first
is that experience cannot provide what we gain from reason.</p>

<blockquote>
<em>The Indispensability of Reason Thesis</em>: The knowledge we gain
in subject area, S, by intuition and deduction, as well as the ideas
and instances of knowledge in S that are innate to us, could not have
been gained by us through sense experience.
</blockquote>

<p>
The second is that reason is superior to experience as a source of
knowledge.</p>

<blockquote>
<em>The Superiority of Reason Thesis</em>: The knowledge we gain in
subject area S by intuition and deduction or have innately is superior
to any knowledge gained by sense experience.
</blockquote>

<p>
How reason is superior needs explanation, and rationalists have
offered different accounts. One view, generally associated with
Descartes (1628, Rules II and III, pp. 1–4), is that what we
know <em>a priori</em> is certain, beyond even the slightest doubt,
while what we believe, or even know, on the basis of sense experience
is at least somewhat uncertain. Another view, generally associated
with Plato (<em>Republic</em> 479e-484c), locates the superiority of
<em>a priori</em> knowledge in the objects known. What we know by
reason alone, a Platonic form, say, is superior in an important
metaphysical way, e.g. unchanging, eternal, perfect, a higher degree
of being, to what we are aware of through sense experience.</p>

<p>
Most forms of rationalism involve notable commitments to other
philosophical positions. One is a commitment to the denial of
scepticism for at least some area of knowledge. If we claim to know
some truths by intuition or deduction or to have some innate
knowledge, we obviously reject scepticism with regard to those truths.
Rationalism in the form of the Intuition/Deduction thesis is also
committed to epistemic foundationalism, the view that we know some
truths without basing our belief in them on any others and that we
then use this foundational knowledge to know more truths.</p>

<h3 id="Empi">1.2 Empiricism</h3>

<p>
Empiricists endorse the following claim for some subject area.</p>

<blockquote>
<em>The Empiricism Thesis</em>: We have no source of knowledge in S or
for the concepts we use in S other than sense experience.
</blockquote>

<p>
Empiricism about a particular subject rejects the corresponding
version of the Intuition/Deduction thesis and Innate Knowledge thesis.
Insofar as we have knowledge in the subject, our knowledge is <em>a
posteriori</em>, dependent upon sense experience. Empiricists also
deny the implication of the corresponding Innate Concept thesis that
we have innate ideas in the subject area. Sense experience is our only
source of ideas. They reject the corresponding version of the
Superiority of Reason thesis. Since reason alone does not give us any
knowledge, it certainly does not give us superior knowledge.
Empiricists generally reject the Indispensability of Reason thesis,
though they need not. The Empiricism thesis does not entail that we
have empirical knowledge. It entails that knowledge can only be
gained, <em>if at all</em>, by experience. Empiricists may assert, as
some do for some subjects, that the rationalists are correct to claim
that experience cannot give us knowledge. The conclusion they draw
from this rationalist lesson is that we do not know at all.</p>

<p>
I have stated the basic claims of rationalism and empiricism so that
each is relative to a particular subject area. Rationalism and
empiricism, so relativized, need not conflict. We can be rationalists
in mathematics or a particular area of mathematics and empiricists in
all or some of the physical sciences. Rationalism and empiricism only
conflict when formulated to cover the same subject. Then the debate,
Rationalism vs. Empiricism, is joined. The fact that philosophers can
be both rationalists and empiricists has implications for the
classification schemes often employed in the history of philosophy,
especially the one traditionally used to describe the Early Modern
Period of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries leading up to Kant.
It is standard practice to group the major philosophers of this period
as either rationalists or empiricists and to suggest that those under
one heading share a common agenda in opposition to those under the
other. Thus, Descartes, Spinoza and Leibniz are the Continental
Rationalists in opposition to Locke, Berkeley and Hume, the British
Empiricists. We should adopt such general classification schemes with
caution. The views of the individual philosophers are more subtle and
complex than the simple-minded classification suggests. (See Loeb
(1981) and Kenny (1986) for important discussions of this point.)
Locke rejects rationalism in the form of any version of the Innate
Knowledge or Innate Concept theses, but he nonetheless adopts the
Intuition/Deduction thesis with regard to our knowledge of God’s
existence. Descartes and Locke have remarkably similar views on the
nature of our ideas, even though Descartes takes many to be innate,
while Locke ties them all to experience. The rationalist/empiricist
classification also encourages us to expect the philosophers on each
side of the divide to have common research programs in areas beyond
epistemology. Thus, Descartes, Spinoza and Leibniz are mistakenly seen
as applying a reason-centered epistemology to a common metaphysical
agenda, with each trying to improve on the efforts of the one before,
while Locke, Berkeley and Hume are mistakenly seen as gradually
rejecting those metaphysical claims, with each consciously trying to
improve on the efforts of his predecessors. It is also important to
note that the rationalist/empiricist distinction is not exhaustive of
the possible sources of knowledge. One might claim, for example, that
we can gain knowledge in a particular area by a form of Divine
revelation or insight that is a product of neither reason nor sense
experience. In short, when used carelessly, the labels
‘rationalist’ and ‘empiricist,’ as well as the
slogan that is the title of this essay, ‘Rationalism vs.
Empiricism,’ can retard rather than advance our
understanding.</p>

<p>
Nonetheless, an important debate properly described as
‘Rationalism vs. Empiricism’ is joined whenever the claims
for each view are formulated to cover the same subject. What is
perhaps the most interesting form of the debate occurs when we take
the relevant subject to be truths about the external world, the world
beyond our own minds. A full-fledged rationalist with regard to our
knowledge of the external world holds that some external world truths
can and must be known <em>a priori</em>, that some of the ideas
required for that knowledge are and must be innate, and that this
knowledge is superior to any that experience could ever provide. The
full-fledged empiricist about our knowledge of the external world
replies that, when it comes to the nature of the world beyond our own
minds, experience is our sole source of information. Reason might
inform us of the relations among our ideas, but those ideas themselves
can only be gained, and any truths about the external reality they
represent can only be known, on the basis of sense experience. This
debate concerning our knowledge of the external world will generally
be our main focus in what follows.</p>

<p>
Historically, the rationalist/empiricist dispute in epistemology has
extended into the area of metaphysics, where philosophers are
concerned with the basic nature of reality, including the existence of
God and such aspects of our nature as freewill and the relation
between the mind and body. Major rationalists (e.g., Descartes 1641)
have presented metaphysical theories, which they have claimed to know
by reason alone. Major empiricists (e.g., Hume 1739–40) have
rejected the theories as either speculation, beyond what we can learn
from experience, or nonsensical attempts to describe aspects of the
world beyond the concepts experience can provide. The debate raises
the issue of metaphysics as an area of knowledge. Kant puts the
driving assumption clearly:</p>

<blockquote>
The very concept of metaphysics ensures that the sources of
metaphysics can’t be empirical. If something could be known
through the senses, that would automatically show that it
doesn’t belong to metaphysics; that’s an upshot of the
meaning of the word ‘metaphysics.’ Its basic principles
can never be taken from experience, nor can its basic concepts; for it
is not to be physical but metaphysical knowledge, so it must be beyond
experience. (1783, Preamble, I, p. 7)
</blockquote>

<p>
The possibility then of metaphysics so understood, as an area of human
knowledge, hinges on how we resolve the rationalist/empiricist debate.
The debate also extends into ethics. Some moral objectivists (e.g.,
Ross 1930 and Huemer 2005) take us to know some fundamental objective
moral truths by intuition, while some moral skeptics, who reject such
knowledge, (e.g., Mackie 1977) find the appeal to a faculty of moral
intuition utterly implausible. More recently, the
rationalist/empiricist debate has extended to discussions (e.g.,
Bealer 1999 and Alexander &amp; Weinberg 2007) of the very nature of
philosophical inquiry: to what extent are philosophical questions to
be answered by appeals to reason or experience?</p>

<h2 id="IntuThes">2. The Intuition/Deduction Thesis</h2>

<p>
The Intuition/Deduction thesis claims that we can know some
propositions by intuition and still more by deduction. Many
empiricists (e.g., Hume 1748) have been willing to accept the thesis
so long as it is restricted to propositions solely about the relations
among our own concepts. We can, they agree, know by intuition that our
concept of God includes our concept of omniscience. Just by examining
the concepts, we can intellectually grasp that the one includes the
other. The debate between rationalists and empiricists is joined when
the former assert, and the latter deny, the Intuition/Deduction thesis
with regard to propositions that contain substantive information about
the external world. Rationalists, such as Descartes, have claimed that
we can know by intuition and deduction that God exists and created the
world, that our mind and body are distinct substances, and that the
angles of a triangle equal two right angles, where all of these claims
are truths about an external reality independent of our thought. Such
substantive versions of the Intuition/Deduction thesis are our concern
in this section.</p>

<p>
One defense of the Intuition/Deduction thesis assumes that we know
some substantive external world truths, adds an analysis of what
knowledge requires, and concludes that our knowledge must result from
intuition and deduction. Descartes claims that knowledge requires
certainty and that certainty about the external world is beyond what
empirical evidence can provide. We can never be sure our sensory
impressions are not part of a dream or a massive, demon orchestrated,
deception. Only intuition and deduction can provide the certainty
needed for knowledge, and, given that we have some substantive
knowledge of the external world, the Intuition/Deduction thesis is
true. As Descartes tells us, “all knowledge is certain and
evident cognition” (1628, Rule II, p. 1) and when we
“review all the actions of the intellect by means of which we
are able to arrive at a knowledge of things with no fear of being
mistaken,” we “recognize only two: intuition and
deduction” (1628, Rule III, p. 3).</p>

<p>
This line of argument is one of the least compelling in the
rationalist arsenal. First, the assumption that knowledge requires
certainty comes at a heavy cost, as it rules out so much of what we
commonly take ourselves to know. Second, as many contemporary
rationalists accept, intuition is not always a source of certain
knowledge. The possibility of a deceiver gives us a reason to doubt
our intuitions as well as our empirical beliefs. For all we know, a
deceiver might cause us to intuit false propositions, just as one
might cause us to have perceptions of nonexistent objects.
Descartes’s classic way of meeting this challenge in the
<em>Meditations</em> is to argue that we can know with certainty that
no such deceiver interferes with our intuitions and deductions. They
are infallible, as God guarantees their truth. The problem, known as
the Cartesian Circle, is that Descartes’s account of how we gain
this knowledge begs the question, by attempting to deduce the
conclusion that all our intuitions are true from intuited premises.
Moreover, his account does not touch a remaining problem that he
himself notes (1628, Rule VII, p. 7): Deductions of any appreciable
length rely on our fallible memory.</p>

<p>
A more plausible argument for the Intuition/Deduction thesis again
assumes that we know some particular, external world truths, and then
appeals to the nature of what we know, rather than to the nature of
knowledge itself, to argue that our knowledge must result from
intuition and deduction. Leibniz (1704) tells us the following.</p>

<blockquote>
The senses, although they are necessary for all our actual knowledge,
are not sufficient to give us the whole of it, since the senses never
give anything but instances, that is to say particular or individual
truths. Now all the instances which confirm a general truth, however
numerous they may be, are not sufficient to establish the universal
necessity of this same truth, for it does not follow that what
happened before will happen in the same way again. … From which
it appears that necessary truths, such as we find in pure mathematics,
and particularly in arithmetic and geometry, must have principles
whose proof does not depend on instances, nor consequently on the
testimony of the senses, although without the senses it would never
have occurred to us to think of them… (1704, Preface, pp.
150–151)
</blockquote>

<p>
Leibniz goes on to describe our mathematical knowledge as
“innate,” and his argument may be directed to support the
Innate Knowledge thesis rather than the Intuition/Deduction thesis.
For our purposes here, we can relate it to the latter, however: We
have substantive knowledge about the external world in mathematics,
and what we know in that area, we know to be necessarily true.
Experience cannot warrant beliefs about what is necessarily the case.
Hence, experience cannot be the source of our knowledge. The best
explanation of our knowledge is that we gain it by intuition and
deduction. Leibniz mentions logic, metaphysics and morals as other
areas in which our knowledge similarly outstrips what experience can
provide. Judgments in logic and metaphysics involve forms of necessity
beyond what experience can support. Judgments in morals involve a form
of obligation or value that lies beyond experience, which only informs
us about what is the case rather than about what ought to be.</p>

<p>
The strength of this argument varies with its examples of purported
knowledge. Insofar as we focus on controversial claims in metaphysics,
e.g., that God exists, that our mind is a distinct substance from our
body, the initial premise that we know the claims is less than
compelling. Taken with regard to other areas, however, the argument
clearly has legs. We know a great deal of mathematics, and what we
know, we know to be necessarily true. None of our experiences warrants
a belief in such necessity, and we do not seem to base our knowledge
on any experiences. The warrant that provides us with knowledge arises
from an intellectual grasp of the propositions which is clearly part
of our learning. Similarly, we seem to have such moral knowledge as
that, all other things being equal, it is wrong to break a promise and
that pleasure is intrinsically good. No empirical lesson about how
things are can warrant such knowledge of how they ought to be.</p>

<p>
This argument for the Intuition/Deduction thesis raises additional
questions which rationalists must answer. Insofar as they maintain
that our knowledge of necessary truths in mathematics or elsewhere by
intuition and deduction is substantive knowledge of the external
world, they owe us an account of this form of necessity. Many
empiricists stand ready to argue that “necessity resides in the
way we talk about things, not in the things we talk about”
(Quine 1966, p. 174). Similarly, if rationalists claim that our
knowledge in morals is knowledge of an objective form of obligation,
they owe us an account of how objective values are part of a world of
apparently valueless facts.</p>

<p>
Perhaps most of all, rationalist defenders of the Intuition/Deduction
thesis owe us an account of what intuition is and how it provides
warranted true beliefs about the external world. What is it to intuit
a proposition and how does that act of intuition support a warranted
belief? Their argument presents intuition and deduction as an
explanation of assumed knowledge that can’t—they
say—be explained by experience, but such an explanation by
intuition and deduction requires that we have a clear understanding of
intuition and how it supports warranted beliefs. Metaphorical
characterizations of intuition as intellectual “grasping”
or “seeing” are not enough, and if intuition is some form
of intellectual “grasping,” it appears that all that is
grasped is relations among our concepts, rather than facts about the
external world. One current approach to the issue involves an appeal
to Phenomenal Conservatism (Huemer 2001), the principle that if it
seems to one as if something is the case, then one is prima facie
justified in believing that it is so. Intuitions are then taken to be
a particular sort of seeming or appearance: “[A]n intuition that
p is a state of its seeming to one that p that is not dependent on
inference from other beliefs and that results from thinking about p,
as opposed to perceiving, remembering, or introspecting” (Hummer
2005, p. 102). Just as it can visually seem or appear to one as if
there’s a tree outside the window, it can intellectually seem or
appear to one as if nothing can be both entirely red and entirely
green. This approach aims to demystify intuitions; they are but one
more form of seeming-state along with ones we gain from sense
perception, memory and introspection. It does not, however, tell us
all we need to know. Any intellectual faculty, whether it be sense
perception, memory, introspection or intuition, provides us with
warranted beliefs only if it is generally reliable. The reliability of
sense perception stems from the causal connection between how external
objects are and how we experience them. What accounts for the
reliability of our intuitions regarding the external world? Is our
intuition of a particular true proposition the outcome of some causal
interaction between ourselves and some aspect of the world? What
aspect? What is the nature of this causal interaction? That the number
three is prime does not appear to cause anything, let alone our
intuition that it is prime. As Michael Huemer (2005, p. 123) points
out in mounting his own defense of moral intuitionism, “The
challenge for the moral realist, then, is to explain how it would be
anything more than chance if my moral beliefs were true, given that I
do not interact with moral properties.”</p>

<p>
These issues are made all the more pressing by the classic empiricist
response to the argument. The reply is generally credited to Hume and
begins with a division of all true propositions into two
categories.</p>

<blockquote>
All the objects of human reason or inquiry may naturally be divided
into two kinds, to wit, “Relations of Ideas,” and
“Matters of Fact.” Of the first are the sciences of
Geometry, Algebra, and Arithmetic, and, in short, every affirmation
which is either intuitively or demonstratively certain. That the
square of the hypotenuse is equal to the square of the two sides is a
proposition which expresses a relation between these figures. That
three times five is equal to half of thirty expresses a relation
between these numbers. Propositions of this kind are discoverable by
the mere operation of thought, without dependence on what is anywhere
existent in the universe. Though there never were a circle or triangle
in nature, the truths demonstrated by Euclid would forever retain
their certainty and evidence. Matters of fact, which are the second
objects of human reason, are not ascertained in the same manner, nor
is our evidence of their truth, however great, of a like nature with
the foregoing. The contrary of every matter of fact is still possible,
because it can never imply a contradiction and is conceived by the
mind with the same facility and distinctness as if ever so conformable
to reality. (Hume 1748, Section IV, Part 1, p. 40)
</blockquote>

<p>
Intuition and deduction can provide us with knowledge of necessary
truths such as those found in mathematics and logic, but such
knowledge is not substantive knowledge of the external world. It is
only knowledge of the relations of our own ideas. If the rationalist
shifts the argument so it appeals to knowledge in morals, Hume’s
reply is to offer an analysis of our moral concepts by which such
knowledge is empirically gained knowledge of matters of fact.</p>

<blockquote>
Morals and criticism are not so properly objects of the understanding
as of taste and sentiment. Beauty, whether moral or natural, is felt
more properly than perceived. Or if we reason concerning it and
endeavor to fix the standard, we regard a new fact, to wit, the
general taste of mankind, or some other fact which may be the object
of reasoning and inquiry. (Hume 1748, Section XII, Part 3, p. 173)
</blockquote>

<p>
If the rationalist appeals to our knowledge in metaphysics to support
the argument, Hume denies that we have such knowledge.</p>

<blockquote>
If we take in our hand any volume--of divinity or school metaphysics,
for instance--let us ask, Does it contain any abstract reasoning
concerning quantity or number? No. Does it contain any experimental
reasoning concerning matter of fact and existence? No. Commit it then
to the flames, for it can contain nothing but sophistry and illusion.
(Hume 1748, Section XII, Part 3, p. 173)
</blockquote>

<p>
An updated version of this general empiricist reply, with an increased
emphasis on language and the nature of meaning, is given in the
twentieth-century by A. J. Ayer’s version of logical positivism.
Adopting positivism’s verification theory of meaning, Ayer
assigns every cognitively meaningful sentence to one of two
categories: either it is a tautology, and so true solely by virtue of
the meaning of its terms and provides no substantive information about
the world, or it is open to empirical verification. There is, then, no
room for knowledge about the external world by intuition or
deduction.</p>

<blockquote>
There can be no <em>a priori</em> knowledge of reality. For …
the truths of pure reason, the propositions which we know to be valid
independently of all experience, are so only in virtue of their lack
of factual content … [By contrast] empirical propositions are
one and all hypotheses which may be confirmed or discredited in actual
sense experience. [Ayer 1952, pp. 86; 93–94]
</blockquote>

<p>
The rationalists’ argument for the Intuition/Deduction thesis
goes wrong at the start, according to empiricists, by assuming that we
can have substantive knowledge of the external world that outstrips
what experience can warrant. We cannot.</p>

<p>
This empiricist reply faces challenges of its own. Our knowledge of
mathematics seems to be about something more than our own concepts.
Our knowledge of moral judgments seems to concern not just how we feel
or act but how we ought to behave. The general principles that provide
a basis for the empiricist view, e.g. Hume’s overall account of
our ideas, the Verification Principle of Meaning, are problematic in
their own right. In various formulations, the Verification Principle
fails its own test for having cognitive meaning. A careful analysis of
Hume’s <em>Inquiry,</em> relative to its own principles, may
require us to consign large sections of it to the flames.</p>

<p>
In all, rationalists have a strong argument for the
Intuition/Deduction thesis relative to our substantive knowledge of
the external world, but its success rests on how well they can answer
questions about the nature and epistemic force of intuition made all
the more pressing by the classic empiricist reply.</p>

<h2 id="InnaKnowThes">3. The Innate Knowledge Thesis</h2>

<p>
The Innate Knowledge thesis joins the Intuition/Deduction thesis in
asserting that we have <em>a priori</em> knowledge, but it does not
offer intuition and deduction as the source of that knowledge. It
takes our <em>a priori</em> knowledge to be part of our rational
nature. Experience may trigger our awareness of this knowledge, but it
does not provide us with it. The knowledge is already there.</p>

<p>
Plato presents an early version of the Innate Knowledge thesis in the
<em>Meno</em> as the doctrine of knowledge by recollection. The
doctrine is motivated in part by a paradox that arises when we attempt
to explain the nature of inquiry. How do we gain knowledge of a
theorem in geometry? We inquire into the matter. Yet, knowledge by
inquiry seems impossible (<em>Meno</em>, 80d-e). We either already
know the theorem at the start of our investigation or we do not. If we
already have the knowledge, there is no place for inquiry. If we lack
the knowledge, we don’t know what we are seeking and cannot
recognize it when we find it. Either way we cannot gain knowledge of
the theorem by inquiry. Yet, we do know some theorems.</p>

<p>
The doctrine of knowledge by recollection offers a solution. When we
inquire into the truth of a theorem, we both do and do not already
know it. We have knowledge in the form of a memory gained from our
soul’s knowledge of the theorem prior to its union with our
body. We lack knowledge in that, in our soul’s unification with
the body, it has forgotten the knowledge and now needs to recollect
it. In learning the theorem, we are, in effect, recalling what we
already know.</p>

<p>
Plato famously illustrates the doctrine with an exchange between
Socrates and a young slave, in which Socrates guides the slave from
ignorance to mathematical knowledge. The slave’s experiences, in
the form of Socrates’ questions and illustrations, are the
occasion for his recollection of what he learned previously.
Plato’s metaphysics provides additional support for the Innate
Knowledge Thesis. Since our knowledge is of abstract, eternal Forms
which clearly lie beyond our sensory experience, it is <em>a
priori</em>.</p>

<p>
Contemporary supporters of Plato’s position are scarce. The
initial paradox, which Plato describes as a “trick
argument” (<em>Meno</em>, 80e), rings sophistical. The
metaphysical assumptions in the solution need justification. The
solution does not answer the basic question: Just how did the
slave’s soul learn the theorem? The Intuition/Deduction thesis
offers an equally, if not more, plausible account of how the slave
gains knowledge <em>a priori</em>. Nonetheless, Plato’s position
illustrates the kind of reasoning that has caused many philosophers to
adopt some form of the Innate Knowledge thesis. We are confident that
we know certain propositions about the external world, but there seems
to be no adequate explanation of how we gained this knowledge short of
saying that it is innate. Its content is beyond what we directly gain
in experience, as well as what we can gain by performing mental
operations on what experience provides. It does not seem to be based
on an intuition or deduction. That it is innate in us appears to be
the best explanation.</p>

<p>
Noam Chomsky argues along similar lines in presenting what he
describes as a “rationalist conception of the nature of
language” (1975, p. 129). Chomsky argues that the experiences
available to language learners are far too sparse to account for their
knowledge of their language. To explain language acquisition, we must
assume that learners have an innate knowledge of a universal grammar
capturing the common deep structure of natural languages. It is
important to note that Chomsky’s language learners do not know
particular propositions describing a universal grammar. They have a
set of innate capacities or dispositions which enable and determine
their language development. Chomsky gives us a theory of innate
learning capacities or structures rather than a theory of innate
knowledge. His view does not support the Innate Knowledge thesis as
rationalists have traditionally understood it. As one commentator puts
it, “Chomsky’s principles … are innate neither in
the sense that we are explicitly aware of them, nor in the sense that
we have a disposition to recognize their truth as obvious under
appropriate circumstances. And hence it is by no means clear that
Chomsky is correct in seeing his theory as following the traditional
rationalist account of the acquisition of knowledge” (Cottingham
1984, p. 124).</p>

<p>
Peter Carruthers (1992) argues that we have innate knowledge of the
principles of folk-psychology. Folk-psychology is a network of
common-sense generalizations that hold independently of context or
culture and concern the relationships of mental states to one another,
to the environment and states of the body and to behavior (1992, p.
115). It includes such beliefs as that pains tend to be caused by
injury, that pains tend to prevent us from concentrating on tasks, and
that perceptions are generally caused by the appropriate state of the
environment. Carruthers notes the complexity of folk-psychology, along
with its success in explaining our behavior and the fact that its
explanations appeal to such unobservables as beliefs, desires,
feelings and thoughts. He argues that the complexity, universality and
depth of folk-psychological principles outstrips what experience can
provide, especially to young children who by their fifth year already
know a great many of them. This knowledge is also not the result of
intuition or deduction; folk-psychological generalizations are not
seen to be true in an act of intellectual insight. Carruthers
concludes, “[The problem] concerning the child’s
acquisition of psychological generalizations cannot be solved, unless
we suppose that much of folk-psychology is already innate, triggered
locally by the child’s experience of itself and others, rather
than learned” (1992, p. 121).</p>

<p>
Empiricists, and some rationalists, attack the Innate Knowledge thesis
in two main ways. First, they offer accounts of how sense experience
or intuition and deduction provide the knowledge that is claimed to be
innate. Second, they directly criticize the Innate Knowledge thesis
itself. The classic statement of this second line of attack is
presented in Locke 1690. Locke raises the issue of just what innate
knowledge is. Particular instances of knowledge are supposed to be in
our minds as part of our rational make-up, but how are they “in
our minds”? If the implication is that we all consciously have
this knowledge, it is plainly false. Propositions often given as
examples of innate knowledge, even such plausible candidates as the
principle that the same thing cannot both be and not be, are not
consciously accepted by children and those with severe cognitive
limitations. If the point of calling such principles
“innate” is not to imply that they are or have been
consciously accepted by all rational beings, then it is hard to see
what the point is. “No proposition can be said to be in the
mind, which it never yet knew, which it never yet was conscious
of” (1690, Book I, Chapter II, Section 5, p. 61). Proponents of
innate knowledge might respond that some knowledge is innate in that
we have the capacity to have it. That claim, while true, is of little
interest, however. “If the capacity of knowing, be the natural
impression contended for, all the truths a man ever comes to know,
will, by this account, be every one of them, innate; and this great
point will amount to no more, but only an improper way of speaking;
which whilst it pretends to assert the contrary, says nothing
different from those, who deny innate principles. For nobody, I think,
ever denied, that the mind was capable of knowing several
truths” (1690, Book I, Chapter II, Section 5, p. 61). Locke thus
challenges defenders of the Innate Knowledge thesis to present an
account of innate knowledge that allows their position to be both true
and interesting. A narrow interpretation of innateness faces
counterexamples of rational individuals who do not meet its
conditions. A generous interpretation implies that all our knowledge,
even that clearly provided by experience, is innate.</p>

<p>
Defenders of innate knowledge take up Locke’s challenge. Leibniz
responds (1704) by appealing to an account of innateness in terms of
natural potential to avoid Locke’s dilemma. Consider Peter
Carruthers’ similar reply.</p>

<blockquote>
We have noted that while one form of nativism claims (somewhat
implausibly) that knowledge is innate in the sense of being present as
such (or at least in propositional form) from birth, it might also be
maintained that knowledge is innate in the sense of being innately
determined to make its appearance at some stage in childhood. This
latter thesis is surely the most plausible version of nativism. (1992,
p. 51)
</blockquote>

<p>
Carruthers claims that our innate knowledge is determined through
evolutionary selection (p. 111). Evolution has resulted in our being
determined to know certain things (e.g. principles of folk-psychology)
at particular stages of our life, as part of our natural development.
Experiences provide the occasion for our consciously believing the
known propositions but not the basis for our knowledge of them (p.
52). Carruthers thus has a ready reply to Locke’s
counterexamples of children and cognitively limited persons who do not
believe propositions claimed to be instances of innate knowledge. The
former have not yet reached the proper stage of development; the
latter are persons in whom natural development has broken down (pp.
49–50).</p>

<p>
A serious problem for the Innate Knowledge thesis remains, however. We
know a proposition only if it is true, we believe it and our belief is
warranted. Rationalists who assert the existence of innate knowledge
are not just claiming that, as a matter of human evolution,
God’s design or some other factor, at a particular point in our
development, certain sorts of experiences trigger our belief in
particular propositions in a way that does not involve our learning
them from the experiences. Their claim is even bolder: In at least
some of these cases, our empirically triggered, but not empirically
warranted, belief is nonetheless warranted and so known. How can these
beliefs be warranted if they do not gain their warrant from the
experiences that cause us to have them or from intuition and
deduction?</p>

<p>
Some rationalists think that a reliabilist account of warrant provides
the answer. According to Reliabilism, beliefs are warranted if they
are formed by a process that generally produces true beliefs rather
than false ones. The true beliefs that constitute our innate knowledge
are warranted, then, because they are formed as the result of a
reliable belief-forming process. Carruthers maintains that
“Innate beliefs will count as known provided that the process
through which they come to be innate is a reliable one (provided, that
is, that the process tends to generate beliefs that are true)”
(1992, p. 77). He argues that natural selection results in the
formation of some beliefs and is a truth-reliable process.</p>

<p>
An appeal to Reliabilism, or a similar causal theory of warrant, may
well be the best way for rationalists to develop the Innate Knowledge
thesis. They have a difficult row to hoe, however. First, such
accounts of warrant are themselves quite controversial. Second,
rationalists must give an account of innate knowledge that maintains
and explains the distinction between innate knowledge and <em>a
posteriori</em> knowledge, and it is not clear that they will be able
to do so within such an account of warrant. Suppose for the sake of
argument that we have innate knowledge of some proposition, <i>P</i>.
What makes our knowledge that <i>P</i> innate? To sharpen the
question, what difference between our knowledge that <i>P</i> and a
clear case of <em>a posteriori</em> knowledge, say our knowledge that
something is red based on our current visual experience of a red
table, makes the former innate and the latter not innate? In each
case, we have a true, warranted belief. In each case, presumably, our
belief gains its warrant from the fact that it meets a particular
causal condition, e.g., it is produced by a reliable process. In each
case, the causal process is one in which an experience causes us to
believe the proposition at hand (that <i>P</i>; that something is
red), for, as defenders of innate knowledge admit, our belief that
<i>P</i> is “triggered” by an experience, as is our belief
that something is red. The insight behind the Innate Knowledge thesis
seems to be that the difference between our innate and <em>a
posteriori</em> knowledge lies in the relation between our experience
and our belief in each case. The experience that causes our belief
that <i>P</i> does not “contain” the information that
<i>P</i>, while our visual experience of a red table does
“contain” the information that something is red. Yet,
exactly what is the nature of this containment relation between our
experiences, on the one hand, and what we believe, on the other, that
is missing in the one case but present in the other? The nature of the
experience-belief relation seems quite similar in each. The causal
relation between the experience that triggers our belief that <i>P</i>
and our belief that <i>P</i> is contingent, as is the fact that the
belief-forming process is reliable. The same is true of our experience
of a red table and our belief that something is red. The causal
relation between the experience and our belief is again contingent. We
might have been so constructed that the experience we describe as
“being appeared to redly” caused us to believe, not that
something is red, but that something is hot. The process that takes us
from the experince to our belief is also only contingently reliable.
Moreover, if our experience of a red table “contains” the
information that something is red, then that fact, not the existence
of a reliable belief-forming process between the two, should be the
reason why the experience warrants our belief. By appealing to
Reliablism, or some other causal theory of warrant, rationalists may
obtain a way to explain how innate knowledge can be warranted. They
still need to show how their explanation supports an account of the
difference between innate knowledge and <em>a posteriori</em>
knowledge.</p>

<h2 id="InnaConcThes">4. The Innate Concept Thesis</h2>

<p>
According to the Innate Concept thesis, some of our concepts have not
been gained from experience. They are instead part of our rational
make-up, and experience simply triggers a process by which we
consciously grasp them. The main concern motivating the rationalist
should be familiar by now: the content of some concepts seems to
outstrip anything we could have gained from experience. An example of
this reasoning is presented by Descartes in the <em>Meditations</em>.
Although he sometimes seems committed to the view that all our ideas
are innate (Adams 1975 and Gotham 2002), he there classifies our ideas
as adventitious, invented by us, and innate. Adventitious ideas, such
as a sensation of heat, are gained directly through sense experience.
Ideas invented by us, such as our idea of a hippogriff, are created by
us from other ideas we possess. Innate ideas, such as our ideas of
God, of extended matter, of substance and of a perfect triangle, are
placed in our minds by God at creation. Consider Descartes’s
argument that our concept of God, as an infinitely perfect being, is
innate. Our concept of God is not directly gained in experience, as
particular tastes, sensations and mental images might be. Its content
is beyond what we could ever construct by applying available mental
operations to what experience directly provides. From experience, we
can gain the concept of a being with finite amounts of various
perfections, one, for example, that is finitely knowledgeable,
powerful and good. We cannot however move from these empirical
concepts to the concept of a being of infinite perfection. (“I
must not think that, just as my conceptions of rest and darkness are
arrived at by negating movement and light, so my perception of the
infinite is arrived at not by means of a true idea but by merely
negating the finite,” Third Meditation, p. 94.) Descartes
supplements this argument by another. Not only is the content of our
concept of God beyond what experience can provide, the concept is a
prerequisite for our employment of the concept of finite perfection
gained from experience. (“My perception of the infinite, that is
God, is in some way prior to my perception of the finite, that is
myself. For how could I understand that I doubted or
desired—that is lacked something—and that I was not wholly
perfect, unless there were in me some idea of a more perfect being
which enabled me to recognize my own defects by comparison,”
Third Meditation, p. 94).</p>

<p>
An empiricist response to this general line of argument is given by
Locke (1690, Book I, Chapter IV, Sections 1–25, pp.
91–107). First, there is the problem of explaining what it is
for someone to have an innate concept. If having an innate concept
entails consciously entertaining it at present or in the past, then
Descartes’s position is open to obvious counterexamples. Young
children and people from other cultures do not consciously entertain
the concept of God and have not done so. Second, there is the
objection that we have no need to appeal to innate concepts in the
first place. Contrary to Descartes’ argument, we can explain how
experience provides all our ideas, including those the rationalists
take to be innate, and with just the content that the rationalists
attribute to them.</p>

<p>
Leibniz (1704) offers a rationalist reply to the first concern. Where
Locke puts forth the image of the mind as a blank tablet on which
experience writes, Leibniz offers us the image of a block of marble,
the veins of which determine what sculpted figures it will accept.</p>

<blockquote>
This is why I have taken as an illustration a block of veined marble,
rather than a wholly uniform block or blank tablets, that is to say
what is called tabula rasa in the language of the philosophers. For if
the soul were like those blank tablets, truths would be in us in the
same way as the figure of Hercules is in a block of marble, when the
marble is completely indifferent whether it receives this or some
other figure. But if there were veins in the stone which marked out
the figure of Hercules rather than other figures, this stone would be
more determined thereto, and Hercules would be as it were in some
manner innate in it, although labour would be needed to uncover the
veins, and to clear them by polishing, and by cutting away what
prevents them from appearing. It is in this way that ideas and truths
are innate in us, like natural inclinations and dispositions, natural
habits or potentialities, and not like activities, although these
potentialities are always accompanied by some activities which
correspond to them, though they are often imperceptible. (1704,
Preface, p. 153)
</blockquote>

<p>
Leibniz’s metaphor contains an insight that Locke misses. The
mind plays a role in determining the nature of its contents. This
point does not, however, require the adoption of the Innate Concept
thesis.</p>

<p>
Rationalists have responded to the second part of the empiricist
attack on the Innate Concept thesis—the empricists’ claim
that the thesis is without basis, as all our ideas can be explained as
derived from experience—by focusing on difficulties in the
empiricists’ attempts to give such an explanation. The
difficulties are illustrated by Locke’s account. According to
Locke, experience consists in external sensation and inner reflection.
All our ideas are either simple or complex, with the former being
received by us passively in sensation or reflection and the latter
being built by the mind from simple materials through various mental
operations. Right at the start, the account of how simple ideas are
gained is open to an obvious counterexample acknowledged, but then set
aside, by Hume in presenting his own empiricist theory. Consider the
mental image of a particular shade of blue. If Locke is right, the
idea is a simple one and should be passively received by the mind
through experience. Hume points out otherwise.</p>

<blockquote>
Suppose therefore a person to have enjoyed his sight for thirty years
and to have become perfectly acquainted with colors of all kinds,
except one particular shade of blue, for instance, which it never has
been his fortune to meet with; let all the different shades of that
color, except that single one, be placed before him, descending
gradually from the deepest to the lightest, it is plain that he will
perceive a blank where that shade is wanting and will be sensible that
there is a greater distance in that place between the contiguous
colors than in any other. Now I ask whether it be possible for him,
from his own imagination, to supply this deficiency and raise up to
himself the idea of that particular shade, though it had never been
conveyed to him by his senses? I believe there are but few will be of
the opinion that he can… (1748, Section II, pp. 29–30)
</blockquote>

<p>
Even when it comes to such simple ideas as the image of a particular
shade of blue, the mind is more than a blank slate on which experience
writes.</p>

<p>
Consider too our concept of a particular color, say red. Critics of
Locke’s account have pointed out the weaknesses in his
explanation of how we gain such a concept by the mental operation of
abstraction on individual cases. For one thing, it makes the incorrect
assumption that various instances of a particular concept share a
common feature. Carruthers puts the objection as follows.</p>

<blockquote>
In fact problems arise for empiricists even in connection with the
very simplest concepts, such as those of colour. For it is false that
all instances of a given colour share some common feature. In which
case we cannot acquire the concept of that colour by abstracting the
common feature of our experience. Thus consider the concept
<em>red</em>. Do all shades of red have something in common? If so,
what? It is surely false that individual shades of red consist, as it
were, of two distinguishable elements a general redness together with
a particular shade. Rather, redness consists in a continuous
<em>range</em> of shades, each of which is only just distinguishable
from its neighbors. Acquiring the concept <em>red</em> is a matter of
learning the extent of the range. (1992, p. 59)
</blockquote>

<p>
For another thing, Locke’s account of concept acquisition from
particular experiences seems circular.</p>

<blockquote>
As it stands, however, Locke’s account of concept acquisition
appears viciously circular. For noticing or attending to a common
feature of various things presupposes that you already possess the
concept of the feature in question. (Carruthers 1992, p. 55)
</blockquote>

<p>
Consider in this regard Locke’s account of how we gain our
concept of causation.</p>

<blockquote>
In the notice that our senses take of the constant vicissitude of
things, we cannot but observe, that several particulars, both
qualities and substances; begin to exist; and that they receive this
their existence from the due application and operation of some other
being. From this observation, we get our ideas of cause and effect.
(1690, Book II, Chapter 26, Section 1, pp. 292–293)
</blockquote>

<p>
We get our concept of causation from our observation that some things
receive their existence from the application and operation of some
other things. Yet, we cannot make this observation unless we already
have the concept of causation. Locke’s account of how we gain
our idea of power displays a similar circularity.</p>

<blockquote>
The mind being every day informed, by the senses, of the alteration of
those simple ideas, it observes in things without; and taking notice
how one comes to an end, and ceases to be, and another begins to exist
which was not before; reflecting also on what passes within itself,
and observing a constant change of its ideas, sometimes by the
impression of outward objects on the senses, and sometimes by the
determination of its own choice; and concluding from what it has so
constantly observed to have been, that the like changes will for the
future be made in the same things, by like agents, and by the like
ways, considers in one thing the possibility of having any of its
simple ideas changed, and in another the possibility of making that
change; and so comes by that idea which we call power. (1690, Chapter
XXI, Section 1, pp. 219–220)
</blockquote>

<p>
We come by the idea of power though considering the possibility of
changes in our ideas made by experiences and our own choices. Yet, to
consider this possibility—of some things <em>making</em> a
change in others—we must already have a concept of power.</p>

<p>
One way to meet at least some of these challenges to an empiricist
account of the origin of our concepts is to revise our understanding
of the content of our concepts so as to bring them more in line with
what experience will clearly provide. Hume famously takes this
approach. Beginning in a way reminiscent of Locke, he distinguishes
between two forms of mental contents or “perceptions,” as
he calls them: impressions and ideas. Impressions are the contents of
our current experiences: our sensations, feelings, emotions, desires,
and so on. Ideas are mental contents derived from impressions. Simple
ideas are copies of impressions; complex ideas are derived from
impressions by “compounding, transposing, augmenting or
diminishing” them. Given that all our ideas are thus gained from
experience, Hume offers us the following method for determining the
content of any idea and thereby the meaning of any term taken to
express it.</p>

<blockquote>
When we entertain, therefore, any suspicion that a philosophical term
is employed without any meaning or idea (as is but too frequent), we
need but inquire <em>from what impression is that supposed idea
derived</em>? And if it be impossible to assign any, this will confirm
our suspicion. (1748, Section II, p. 30)
</blockquote>

<p>
Using this test, Hume draws out one of the most important implications
of the empiricists’ denial of the Innate Concept thesis. If
experience is indeed the source of all ideas, then our experiences
also determine the content of our ideas. Our ideas of causation, of
substance, of right and wrong have their content determined by the
experiences that provide them. Those experiences, Hume argues, are
unable to support the content that many rationalists and some
empiricists, such as Locke, attribute to the corresponding ideas. Our
inability to explain how some concepts, with the contents the
rationalists attribute to them, are gained from experience should not
lead us to adopt the Innate Concept thesis. It should lead us to
accept a more limited view of the contents for those concepts, and
thereby a more limited view of our ability to describe and understand
the world.</p>

<p>
Consider, for example, our idea of causation. Descartes takes it to be
innate. Locke offers an apparently circular account of how it is
gained from experience. Hume’s empiricist account severely
limits its content. Our idea of causation is derived from a feeling of
expectation rooted in our experiences of the constant conjunction of
similar causes and effects.</p>

<blockquote>
It appears, then, that this idea of a necessary connection among
events arises from a number of similar instances which occur, of the
constant conjunction of these events; nor can that idea ever be
suggested by any one of these instances surveyed in all possible
lights and positions. But there is nothing in a number of instances,
different from every single instance, which is supposed to be exactly
similar, except only that after a repetition of similar instances the
mind is carried by habit, upon the appearance of one event, to expect
its usual attendant and to believe that it will exist. This
connection, therefore, which we <em>feel</em> in the mind, this
customary transition of the imagination from one object to its usual
attendant, is the sentiment or impression from which we form the idea
of power or necessary connection. (1748, Section VII, Part 2, p. 86)
</blockquote>

<p>
The source of our idea in experience determines its content.</p>

<blockquote>
Suitably to this experience, therefore, we may define a cause to be an
object followed by another, and where all the objects, similar to the
first are followed by objects similar to the second… We may,
therefore, suitably to this experience, form another definition of
cause and call it <em>an object followed by another, and whose
appearance always conveys the thought of the other</em>. (1748,
Section VII, Part 2, p. 87)
</blockquote>

<p>
Our claims, and any knowledge we may have, about causal connections in
the world turn out, given the limited content of our empirically based
concept of causation, to be claims and knowledge about the constant
conjunction of events and our own feelings of expectation. Thus, the
initial disagreement between rationalists and empiricists about the
source of our ideas leads to one about their content and thereby the
content of our descriptions and knowledge of the world.</p>

<p>
Like philosophical debates generally, the rationalist/empiricist
debate ultimately concerns our position in the world, in this case our
position as rational inquirers. To what extent do our faculties of
reason and experience support our attempts to know and understand our
situation?</p>
