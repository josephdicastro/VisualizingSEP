<h1>Pietro Pomponazzi</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Tue Nov 7, 2017</em></div>

<div id="preamble">


<p>
Pietro Pomponazzi (1462–1525) was a leading philosopher of
Renaissance Italy. Teaching primarily at the universities at Padua and
Bologna, he developed innovative approaches to Aristotelian natural
philosophy and psychology. He gained particular fame, and notoriety,
for his philosophical investigations into the mortality of the soul
and for his naturalistic explanations of seemingly miraculous
phenomena and of the development of religions. Pomponazzi was notable
for his philosophical challenges to religious doctrine as well as for
his use of Alexander of Aphrodisias’s writings and Stoic ideas
to forge what he considered to be a purer or more accurate
interpretation of Aristotle’s natural philosophy and
psychology.</p>

<h2 id="Life">1. Life</h2>

<p>
Born in Mantua, Pomponazzi studied at Padua, obtaining his degree in
arts in 1487. He then taught there, first as extraordinary and then
ordinary professor from 1488–1496 (Nardi 1965: 54–55). His
teacher and fellow professor at Padua Nicoletto Vernia as well as his
colleague Alessandro Achillini openly endorsed Averroes’ view of
the unicity of the material intellect, a view that Bishop Pietro
Barrozzi condemned with the threat of excommunication in 1489, leading
them to revise or hide their teachings (Hasse 2016: 184–214).
Pomponazzi questioned and ultimately rejected Averroes’ unicity
position. Perhaps influenced by his other teachers Pietro Trapolino
and Francesco Securo da Nardò, respected Thomas Aquinas’s
views even if he found them to use theological premises that he
believed were unwelcome to natural philosophy and contrary to
Aristotle’s philosophy. Despite rejecting Averroes’ view
on the material intellect, throughout his career, Pomponazzi’s
lectures relied on Averroes’ commentaries; for example among
Pomponazzi’s writings are <em>quaestiones</em> based on
Averroes’ <em>De substantia orbis</em> (<em>On the Substance of
the Orbs</em>). Around 1496, he
obtained a doctorate in medicine (Oliva 1926: 179), a common step for
those who wished to rise in the universities of northern Italy, where
philosophy was often taught as preparation to the study of medicine
(see Kristeller 1993: vol. 3, 436–38; Kraye 2010: 93). Although
Pomponazzi never taught medicine he was consulted for his medical
expertise (see Park 2006: 175–76) and frequently considered
medical teachings in his writings on wondrous phenomena,
Aristotle’s zoological writings, and <em>Meteorologica</em> IV
(see Perfetti 2004: xliii–xlv; Martin 2002). During this first
stint at Padua, he wrote <em>Quaestio de maximo et minimo</em>
(<em>Question on the Maximum and the Minimum</em>), attacking William
Heytesbury and the calculatory tradition (see Biard 2009). Beginning
in the 1330s, Heytesbury and others at Merton College at Oxford
applied mathematical and logical analysis on a range topics, including
natural philosophical questions regarding kinetics. Pomponazzi
remained hostile to the calculatory and terminist traditions
throughout his life because he considered their interpretations of
Aristotle’s texts as veering too far from a strict exegesis of
Aristotle. In 1496, Pomponazzi left Padua, after disputing with
Agostino Nifo, and tutored Prince Alberto Pio da Carpi, who was in
exile at Ferrara. He then taught at the university at Ferrara for a
year, before returning to Padua. Alberto Pio remained for years a
supporter of Aristotelian thought, commissioning translations of
Averroes and Aristotle; Pomponazzi dedicated his 1514 <em>De
intensione et remissione formarum</em> (<em>On the Intension and
Remission of Forms</em>) to him (see Schmitt 1984).</p>

<p>
After returning to Padua in 1499, he taught natural philosophy there
until 1509, when the university closed due to the War of the League of
Cambrai. He returned briefly to Ferrara and then to his native Mantua,
before moving to the university of Bologna in 1511, where he remained
for the rest of his life, teaching natural and moral philosophy (Oliva
1926: 265). His years at Bologna were both productive and filled with
controversy. All his works printed during the sixteenth century stem
from his tenure at Bologna (Lohr 1988: 347–62). In 1514 he
completed a disputation on the intension and remission of forms; and
in 1515 he published the question <em>De reactione</em> (<em>On
Reaction</em>). A year later he published <em>Tractatus de
immortalitate animae</em> (<em>Treatise on the Immortality of the
Soul</em>). The work defends a materialist reading of Aristotle in
which the human soul depends on and perishes with the body. The
treatise came out three years after the Fifth Lateran Council issued
the bull <em>Apostolici regiminis</em>. The bull demanded that
philosophers refrain from teaching that the soul is one in number, is
mortal, and that the universe eternal. It also demanded that
philosophers defend Christian doctrine to the best of their ability.
As Pomponazzi’s teaching appeared to many to run against the
bull, he was attacked, but also defended, by a number of scholars and
ecclesiastical authorities. Although he was charged with heresy, he
was not tried, being under the protection of the powerful Venetian
Cardinal Pietro Bembo (see Pine 1986: 124–28).</p>

<p>
Despite these controversies, Pomponazzi maintained his position at
Bologna and continued to teach and write, pursuing many of the themes
of his psychological writings. In 1520, he completed <em>De naturalium
effectuum admirandorum causis sive de incantationibus</em> (<em>On the
Causes of Marvelous Natural Effects or On Incantations</em>). The work
circulated in manuscript widely before being printed first in 1556 and
again in 1567 (Regnicoli 2010). In the same year he finished <em>De
fato, de libero arbitrio, de praedestinatione</em> (<em>On Fate, Free
Will, On Predestination</em>), which was not printed until 1567. In
1521, he published <em>De nutritione et augmentatione</em> (<em>On
Nutrition and Growth</em>). Given greater freedom to choose the
subject of his lectures as the result of contract negotiations,
Pomponazzi lectured on a number of Aristotle’s writings that
were not part of the typical duties of an ordinary professor. These
topics include Aristotle’s <em>De generatione et
corruptione</em> and his zoological and meteorological writings. His
<em>Dubitationes in quartum Meteorologicorum librum</em> (<em>Doubts on
Meteorologica</em> IV) were printed in 1563. Pomponazzi, after several
years of illness, died from kidney disease in 1525 (Nardi 1965:
205–6).</p>

<h2 id="WritMethInteChal">2. Writings, Methods, and Interpretative Challenges</h2>

<p>
There are numerous challenges to interpreting the writings of
Pomponazzi. In addition to his writings printed during the sixteenth
century, many <em>reportationes</em> (transcripts) made by listeners
of his lectures are extant. Due to the nature of their creation, they
potentially contain errors or are incomplete. At times, they appear to
present conflicting views. Filled with witticisms and ironic
statements, they reveal insights into Pomponazzi’s popularity as
a lecturer. Adding to the difficulty of interpretation, are
Pomponazzi’s repeated statements of not having a solution to
philosophical questions and promoting the idea that philosophy teaches
the practice of doubting (Perfetti 1999). Accordingly, he questioned
at times both ecclesiastical authority and the prevailing
philosophical environment of Padua and Bologna that was characterized
by Averroism.</p>

<p>
An additional impediment in interpreting Pomponazzi stems from his
arguments that is characterized as <em>in naturalibus</em> (based on
nature). Similarly, he at times described himself as following the
<em>via peripatetica</em> (the Peripatetic path), which meant
investigating according to Aristotelian principles without influence
from other fields, most prominently theology. Restricting arguments to
those that are <em>in naturalibus</em> or following the <em>via
peripatetica</em> entailed at times determining Aristotle’s
view, regardless of its truth. Pomponazzi justified this approach on
the grounds that natural philosophy possesses different principles
than theology and therefore those fields should not use the principles
of other fields. Consequently, at times he maintained that as a lay
person he was unable to pronounce on theological questions.
Furthermore, his duties as professor of philosophy, as in essence a
professional Aristotelian, required him to expound the views of
Aristotle, regardless of their conformity with theological truth.
Thus, he included provisos in <em>On the Immortality of the Soul</em>
and <em>On Incantations</em> that stated that his conclusions were
merely according to philosophy and that he accepted the determinations
of the Catholic Church as having a greater degree of authority than
philosophy. Some of his contemporaries and later scholars have seen
the inclusion of these provisos as being disingenuous, merely a means
to protect himself from prosecution (Renan 1852: 286]; Pine
1986: 123). But, other scholars have argued for the philosophical
coherence of his employment of probable arguments and deference to
faith (see Perrone Compagni 1999: lxxxv–xcvi). In the thirteenth
century, Albertus Magnus had distinguished between investigations of
nature and the divine, contending that the fields have distinct
methods and that revelation disagrees at times with arguments based on
reason and experience (Martin 2014: 16–18). Although at times
Albertus’s position was controversial, a number of medieval
philosophers endorsed his view. Thus even if Pomponazzi included these
provisos as a protective measure, he nevertheless simultaneously
endorsed a long medieval tradition that held that natural philosophy
was separate from theology and that theological truths prevailed over
philosophical ones.</p>

<p>
Pomponazzi used the methods and language typical of the medieval
scholastic tradition (Kraye 2010), primarily relying on reason and
experience as the key tools for investigation. The former refers to
the logical and philosophical principles of Aristotelianism, the
latter refers to both quotidian experience and the experiences found
in the writings of authorities, witnessed in testimonies of
contemporaries, and taken from his own personal history. He had a
critical attitude toward humanist writers, for example, judging
Giovanni Pico della Mirandola’s attack on astrology to be
ignorant of the workings of the field. And while his Latin prose did
not match they polished elegance of Renaissance humanists, in other
ways his writings, through its extensive consideration of ancient
sources, reflects developments of humanism. Despite never learning
Greek, as many of his fellow philosophers did, including his rival
Agostino Nifo, Pomponazzi relied on recent translations of Greek
commentators on Aristotle, most significantly Alexander of Aphrodisias
(Kessler 2011). Furthermore, his later writings, especially <em>On
Incantations</em>, take evidence from a broad range of Greek, Roman,
and Renaissance poets and historians, interspersed among citations of
the typical authorities of the scholastic traditions. In that work, he
also discussed the possible natural causes of the Delphic oracle (see
Ossa-Richardson 2010).</p>

<h2 id="Psyc">3. Psychology</h2>

<p>
Pomponazzi’s most complete discussion of the human soul was
published in his 1516 <em>On the Immortality of the Soul</em>. The
work builds on earlier discussions found in <em>quaestiones</em>
delivered in 1503 and 1504 (Poppi 1970: 27–92; Kristeller 1944)
and in lectures on the <em>De anima</em> given in 1514–15
(Bakker 2007). In <em>On the Immortality of the Soul</em>, he sought
to establish whether the human intellect is separable and immortal
using a methodology that did not exceed “natural limits”,
that is, without supposing “something from faith or
revelation” and to determine what is “in conformity with
the words of Aristotle” (ch. 8). He cautioned that he did not
affirm anything contrary to Thomas Aquinas’s views but his
critiques advance “in the way of doubt and not of
assertion” (ch. 8). Moreover, he tempered his considerations by
declaring his preference for scripture over “human reasoning and
experience” (ch. 8).</p>

<p>
In what manner the human intellect is separable was a frequently
debated question in Renaissance discussions of the soul. Many of
Pomponazzi’s contemporaries adopted Averroes’ solution
that the possible or material intellect must be one in number and thus
shared by all humans. Pomponazzi rejected Averroes’ view,
deeming it “most false, unintelligible, monstrous, and quite
foreign to Aristotle” (ch. 4). After rejecting Averroes’
unicity thesis, Pomponazzi maintained that the most probable arguments
according to natural philosophy and Aristotle’s view are
contrary to Thomas’s position that the individual human
intellect is immortal, separable, and unqualifiedly immaterial.</p>

<p>
A central premise for Pomponazzi’s psychology is that the entire
human soul falls under the study of natural philosophy. The human soul
has three powers—vegetative, sensitive, rational—but is
unified; these powers do not have distinct substantial forms (see
Casini 2007). Pomponazzi generally referred not to the intellect but
rather to the intellective soul, meaning the rational power of the
human soul (Sellars 2016). This intellective soul, or rational soul,
rests midway between the eternal and perishable (ch. 1; see Bakker
2007: 165–67). Accordingly, he emphasized the relation between
the intellectual soul and the sensitive soul, citing Aristotle’s
statement that “the soul does not know at all without some
phantasm (<em>phantasma</em>)” (<em>De anima</em> 3.7
431a16–17). The intellectual soul’s dependence on these
phantasms—images that the imagination creates based on what has
been sensed—is confirmed for Pomponazzi not just by
Aristotle’s authority but also by our own experience and by
experiences with those who have suffered injuries to the relevant
organs. Since the sensitive soul resides within a material organ and
sensation occurs in time, it is dependent on matter both with respect
to subject (i.e., the sense organ) and object (i.e., the sensible).
The human intellectual or rational soul, however, is dependent on
matter for its object (i.e., the phantasms) but only immaterial with
respect to its subject (i.e., cognition) (see Brenet 2009).</p>

<p>
Because the human intellectual soul depends on the operations of the
sensitive soul, which are part of a material perishable body, it
cannot function after the body has been destroyed. Accordingly, in
Pomponazzi’s view, the human intellectual soul is immortal only
in a relative or qualified sense. Because the act of understanding
does not require a material organ as subject, the human intellectual
soul is more immortal than the sensitive soul or the souls of animals.
The human soul partakes in the immortal through its limited knowledge
of the forms of species, without being immortal in itself. Yet because
it cannot function without the sensitive soul, it is lower than
God’s intelligence and than the intelligences that move the
spheres, which are separated substances. Moreover, the human soul
differs from these separated intelligences in that it is the
actualization of a body while the intelligences merely actuate, that
is, set in motion, the celestial spheres without receiving anything
from the matter of the orb. The human’s soul dependency on
matter means that human cognition is less abstracted than that of the
intelligences, which know through intuition not sensation. Accordingly
the human soul cannot know universals unqualifiedly but only in
relation to singulars. Thereby, the human rational soul, with its
functioning tied to material objects, sits midway between the material
and the immaterial and between the eternal and the perishable; and
human knowledge, while partaking in the knowledge of universals,
possesses it in limited manner (ch. 8).</p>

<p>
While most scholarship has emphasized Pomponazzi’s argument
related to the connection between the intellectual and sensitive soul,
he put forth several other arguments based on Aristotelian principles
against the immortality of individual human souls. He argued that if
the human soul survives the death of the body at that point it must be
an individual indivisible substance that is either in some place or
nowhere. If it is somewhere, it must have arrived there through
locomotion, yet Aristotle denies that indivisibles can move in space.
If it is nowhere, then Aristotle could have posited intelligences that
do not move the spheres and potentially there could exist an infinite
number of intelligences, which in turn is prohibited by
Aristotle’s arguments against the realization of an infinite
multitude. Similarly, he argued that if human souls are immortal and
individual, given that the world and its species are eternal according
to Aristotle, the number of human souls must be infinite or souls must
transmigrate, both propositions that Aristotle rejected. Additionally,
Pomponazzi dismissed Thomas’s view that God creates each human
soul placed within the body as being an explanation unacceptable to
natural philosophy because Aristotle held that according to natural
philosophy the soul is not created but rather generated “by the
sun and man” (<em>Physics</em> 2.2. 194b13) and everything that
is generated perishes (ch. 8).</p>

<p>
Given the importance of the immortality of the soul to Catholic
doctrine, Pomponazzi considered the ramifications of the soul’s
mortality to ethics and the possibility of human happiness and
blessedness (see Cuttini 2012). He countered the argument that
immortality of the soul is necessary for a happy end achieved by
perfecting the intellect by contending that achieving such
intellectual perfection is only possible for someone with superior
intellectual ability, of sound health, who has withdrawn from worldly
affairs. Yet, such individuals are extremely rare—“even in
long centuries, barely one is found”—and the human race
and its societies do not permit all humans to devote themselves to
philosophy (ch. 13). To the potential objection that belief in the
mortality of the soul encourages immoral acts because otherwise some
persons would choose to commit crimes because there would be no
punishment or rewards after death, Pomponazzi responded that their are
sufficient motivations for virtue without considerations of the
afterlife. In his view, the essential reward of virtue is virtue
itself, which is humankind’s greatest good and brings security
and peace of mind. Accordingly, the religious teachings of immortality
are not true according to the principles of natural philosophy but
were introduced in order to persuade those incapable of understanding
philosophy to behave in a moral fashion, thereby allowing society to
function (ch. 14).</p>

<p>
Pomponazzi, keeping with his earlier statements that his arguments
were probable and according to natural principles, concluded that the
question of the immortality of the soul is a neutral problem, meaning
that there are no arguments based only on nature that prove either
immortality or mortality. His application of the term “neutral
problem” was not novel. John Duns Scotus had come to the same
conclusion about the immortality of the soul; and Thomas Aquinas
regarded the question of the eternity of the world as a neutral
problem. Consequently, faith is the ultimate arbiter of the question,
and Pomponazzi maintained that Christians must follow the doctrine of
immortality that has been established by the Church fathers and Pope
Gregory I, who were the greatest experts in divine matters (ch.
15).</p>

<p>
<em>On the Immortality of the Soul</em> provoked numerous polemics, in
which Pomponazzi defended his views. In 1518, he published
<em>Apologia</em> (<em>Apology</em>) in response to the 1517 attack by
his former student Gaspare Contarini. In 1519, Pomponazzi published
the <em>Defensorium</em> (<em>Defense</em>) in reply to Agostino
Nifo’s attacks. The <em>Defense</em> was printed together with
Giovanni Crisostomo Javelli’s work that bolstered Pomponazzi.
The theologians Ambrogio Flandino and Bartolomeo Spina also published
attacks on Pomponazzi’s treatment of the soul (see Blum 2007:
223–28).</p>

<h2 id="WondNatuPretMira">4. Wondrous Nature, the Preternatural, and Miracles</h2>

<p>
In 1520, Pomponazzi finished <em>On Incantations</em>, a work that
expanded many of the themes of his psychological works. The book
undermines the use of demonic and supernatural explanations for
sublunary phenomena. The work is presented as a response to the
question: How would Aristotelians explain what “seems to be
beyond the order of nature”, (<em>praeter naturae ordinem</em>)
or, in other words, seems preternatural? The category of preternatual,
which included a large range of strange and seemingly irregular
phenomena, formed the subject matter of numerous early modern
philosophical inquiries (see Daston 2000). With respect to <em>On
Incantations</em>, Pomponazzi’s friend, Ludovico Paniza, asked
him to explain the extraordinary recoveries of three boys from a skin
disease, burns, and a sword that physicians cannot remove
(<em>Praefatio</em>.1). The actions of demons can explain these
recoveries. Pomponazzi stated that these demonic acts are justified in
accordance with ecclesiastical law (<em>ex decreto Ecclesiae</em>) and
are capable of “saving many experiences”. Yet, Pomponazzi
contended that Aristotelians would not use demons to explain these
wondrous events. In Pomponazzi’s view even if demons exist, a
premise that Aristotle did not admit according to Pomponazzi’s
interpretation of <em>Metaphysics</em> Lambda, they would not be able
to affect the sublunary world because they would not have adequate
knowledge of its particulars. Demons’ knowledge of sublunary
particulars must derive either through essences or from sensation and
<em>phantasmata</em> (i.e., mental images). Knowledge through
essences, however, does not provide knowledge of singulars but only
universals and species. Moreover, knowledge from sensation and
<em>phantasmata</em> entails generation, corruption, and corporeality,
properties which cannot belong to demons (1.1).</p>

<p>
Demons’ lack of knowledge of natural particulars is merely one
reason they cannot be the cause of wondrous sublunary events. Citing
Augustine, Pomponazzi contended that all theologians hold that while
demons can directly move bodies from one place to another they cannot
alter them directly but must do so through natural bodies. Yet,
Pomponazzi rejected the likelihood that demons affect change by
applying active powers to passives, just like humans imperfectly do
when they apply healing medicines. For Pomponazzi, this understanding
of demonic action is untenable because it requires demons to use
sensible material substances, which would be detectable. Presumably
demons must carry these substances in pillboxes and bags, all of which
is contrary to experience. Finally, he concluded that it is
superfluous to suppose demonic influence “because we can save
these kinds of experiences through natural causes” (1.2).
Accordingly, the first half of <em>On Incantations</em> posits
hypothetical natural causes of preternatural experiences in an attempt
to show the inadequacy and superfluity of demonic explanation
(1.3).</p>

<p>
Employing doctrines key to natural magic, Pomponazzi put forth three
potential ways that natural causes could explain wondrous effects:
directly through manifest causes, such as heat and cold; through
occult qualities or powers; or indirectly through vapors and spirits
that had been altered by such powers (3.1–3). In support of
these explanations, citing Albertus Magnus, Marsilio Ficino, Pliny,
and unnamed botanists, he maintained that herbs, stones, minerals, and
animal extracts possess nearly countless occult powers and that if we
knew them it would be possible to reduce those effects that the
unlearned attribute to demons and angels to the actions of these
occult powers. In support of the existence of these occult powers
Pomponazzi described experiences with herbal medicines, magnets,
electric rays (<em>torpedines</em>), and remoras—fish that
allegedly could halt ships with the power of their
mouths—experiences, all verified as most true by respected
authorities (3.2–3).</p>

<p>
Additionally, Pomponazzi contended that similar powers reside in
humans, either through the temperament, the sensitive soul, or the
intellectual soul. He based this contention on the fact that human
temperaments were widely recognized to affect and determine human
habits, inclinations, and physiognomy (3.4). Following
Aristotle’s <em>De motu animalium</em> and Ficino’s
<em>Platonic Theology</em>, he
argued that the actions of the soul are not only spiritual but also
real and cause alterations in the body, as is manifest in the physical
affects of emotions, such as tremors and blushing (3.6). Finally, he
maintained that it is possible that the human mind can produce what it
thinks through real bodily means, such as spirit and blood, in an
analogous way to the intelligences that produce the sublunary world
through corporal intermediaries, namely the celestial bodies
(3.6).</p>

<p>
Applying these causes, Pomponazzi explained that many of those accused
of necromancy, like the medieval physicians and astrologers Pietro
d’Abano and Cecco d’Ascoli, were merely very knowledgeable
and capable of applying actives to passives (4.1). Moreover, it is
possible that some humans have extraordinary occult powers that allow
them to affect cures through touch, like the kings of France, or to
perform other marvelous feats such as charming snakes and opening
doors without touching them (4.2). Additionally, Pomponazzi argued
that the powers of imagination can produce real effects. For example,
he cited the widespread belief that women’s thoughts at the time
of conception will produce a fetus that is similar to those thoughts.
Therefore, the power of fascination and imaginative powers transmitted
through vapors might explain unexpected cures and diseases just as
they are supposedly responsible for the spread of leprosy and plague
(4.3). While Pomponazzi admitted that some supposedly magical works
are acts of deception—such as contemporary examples of
fraudulent magicians conjuring through sieves—he allowed that it
might be possible that some men to possess individual natural occult
powers that allow them to move a sieve or transmit vapors through
prayers so that they form images on mirrors (4.4). Pomponazzi used
this analysis to respond to the possible objection that these three
kinds of natural causes eliminate the acceptance of miracles. He
conceded that many of the deeds reported in the bible can be
“superficially reduced to a natural causes”, but that many
cannot, such as the resurrection of Lazarus, the eclipse during the
crucifixion of Jesus, and the satisfaction of the hunger of thousand
people with five loaves of bread and two fish (7.7). Furthermore,
while he conceded that there is a remote possibility that the cross
found in Saint Catherine’s heart and Saint Francis’s
stigmata arose from natural causes, he nonetheless stated it is more
likely and more pious to understand them as miracles (7.8).</p>

<p>
Perhaps the most controversial portions of <em>On Incantations</em>
surround his explanation of why both pagan and monotheistic societies
give credence to the works of demons. His answer derives from his
largely Aristotelian and Averroistic conception of the ordering of the
universe (see Perrone Compagni 2011: xxxiii–lxxi). For
Pomponazzi, God is both the final and efficient cause of the universe,
a view he put forth in his earlier <em>quaestiones</em> on
Averroes’ <em>De substantia orbis</em> (Pomponazzi <em>Corsi inediti</em>:
1:299–304) God,
possessing knowledge of the essences of all species of beings,
arranges the universe through the celestial intelligences (10.1). In
turn, the celestial intelligences through the powers of the stars
cause the eternal cycles of change in the universe. Accordingly, the
entire arrangement of the world, including human society and religion,
reflects and derives from God’s power. Thus, the pronouncements
in favor of the existence of demonic works from serious and important
authorities, both religious lawmakers and philosophers including
Plato, are the result not of their truth but of their usefulness for
creating a virtuous populace. Since a large portion of humanity is
incapable of understanding philosophical truths, lawmakers have
created and employed myths or fables to inculcate virtue. The
legislator is like the physician who deceives a patient for the
patient’s own good, in composing such fables because they
contribute to his larger purpose; these fables should not be judged as
philosophical doctrines—they contain neither falsity or
truthfulness <em>per se</em> but have an allegorical or poetic
meaning. For Pomponazzi, these myths are not cynical and used merely
to gain political power but are harmonious with the universe’s
nature and order, as arranged by God and the celestial intelligences.
Political authority and obedience are necessary for ensuring the
persistence of political structures that are ordained for humanity,
for which nature has given leaders and organization just as it has for
flock animals, like bees and quail (10.2). Consequently the growth and
decline of religions are in accordance with the cyclical workings of
nature.</p>

<p>
Pomponazzi’s judgment that the bulk of humanity is incapable of
understanding philosophical truths corresponds to his statements in
<em>On the Immortality of the Soul</em> about the differences between
divine and human souls and the infrequency of humans who develop into
philosophers with comprehensive and accurate knowledge of nature and
the universe. The inability of nearly all of humanity to understand
true causes has led to further misunderstandings of prodigies, omens,
divination, and oracles. Pomponazzi held that, instead of being direct
messages from God, they are reflections of a purposeful and
well-ordered universe.</p>

<p>
Having dismissed Pico della Mirandola’s polemic against
astrology, Pomponazzi contended that fields such as astrology and
physiognomy read signs that are causally connected, through celestial
influences or physiological links. Celestial prodigies, omens, and
apparitions in the sky both signal and cause future events by
affecting vapors and spirits that in turn influence the outcomes of
human activity. Some apparitions, such as the recent image of Saint
Celestine that appeared in the sky above Aquila while its residents
prayed for protection from excessive rain, result from the collective
imagination affecting vapors, exhalations, and clouds (see Giglioni
2010). Moreover, Pomponazzi argued that the fact that the prodigies
are indicative explains their purpose and final cause that is linked
to nature, which is interdependent, well ordered, and under
God’s providence. The possibility of using prodigies to predict
the future is analogous to physicians’ ability to give prognoses
for diseases using symptoms that seemingly are not directly connected
to the maladies. Similarly ignorant people have mistakenly understood
the prognostications of sibyls and other seers as being caused by
demons when in fact they possess either extraordinary occult natural
powers or are caused by the powers of stars.</p>

<p>
Invoking celestial powers, occult virtues, the force of the
imagination, and the intermediary actions of vapors and spirits,
Pomponazzi contended that by using only Aristotelian natural
principles it was possible to save or explain seemingly miraculous and
preternatural phenomena. Pomponazzi accepted the veracity of nearly
all this phenomena, trusting in the accounts of contemporaries and
ancient histories (12.9). The work is a critique of demonic
explanations but not of the reports of these alleged events.</p>

<p>
In the closing of <em>On Incantations</em>, Pomponazzi stated that
while he believed that what the Peripatetics would have probably
(<em>verisimiliter</em>) believed is in agreement with Christianity,
he would nevertheless revoke the entire work and submit himself to the
Catholic Church in the event that this writing opposed Catholic
doctrine (<em>Peroratio</em>.1). A number of interpreters have found
this conclusion to be disingenuous; the Holy Office placed the work on
the Index of Prohibited books by the 1570s. A censor wrote that while
Pomponazzi put forth arguments that seem to undermine the existence of
miracles he did make strong ones in their favor (Baldini &amp; Spruit
2009: vol. 1, tome 3, 2279).</p>

<h2 id="FateProv">5. Fate and Providence</h2>

<p>
Several months after Pomponazzi completed <em>On Incantations</em> in
1520, he finished <em>De fato, de libero arbitrio, et de
praestinatione</em>, (<em>On Fate, Free Will, and Predestination</em>)
a work that addressed Alexander of Aphrodisias’s <em>De
fato</em>,
which had been printed in Girolamo Bagolino’s Latin translation
in 1516. In this work, Alexander criticized Stoic deterministic
understandings of causation because they deny the possibility of
chance, contingency, and human choice. In <em>On Fate</em>, Pomponazzi
largely sided not with Alexander but in favor of his Stoic
opposition.</p>

<p>
The premise of Pomponazzi’s arguments coincides with his
understanding of causation presented in <em>On Incantations</em>. The
work also reaffirms the limitations placed on the human intellect in
<em>On the Immortality of the Soul</em>. In <em>On Fate</em>,
Pomponazzi argued that God, as efficient cause of the world, acts on
the sublunary world using the celestial bodies. God is the principal
cause and the celestial bodies are the instrumental cause of
accidental effects in the sublunary world, which Alexander and Thomas
Aquinas viewed as contingent and without a cause (1.7.II/15). The
celestial bodies’ motion, contiguous to the lower world, drives
and determines alterations on earth. Therefore, accidental effects,
ultimately resulting from God acting as an efficient cause, occur by
necessity (1.7.II/16). Pomponazzi maintained that they are mistakenly
called contingent as a result of human ignorance of causes and future
events but not from any irregularity in matter, natural powers, or
celestial influences. Rather, all accidental effects and what appears
to result from luck or chance can be traced back to fixed causes
(1.7.II/23–26).</p>

<p>
Applying this deterministic framework, Pomponazzi rejected
Alexander’s understanding of free will as the ability to choose
between alternatives. Pomponazzi maintained that human will functions
just like the rest of nature. It depends on an external mover, namely
God’s will and the celestial motions, which are eternal
(1.9.2.10). Just as for other natural beings, if there is a
potentiality and no impediment, by necessity the potentiality will be
realized. Thus, the human will reacts to external factors according to
its powers and the absence of impediments (1.9.2.12). Consequently,
the human will depends on higher, universal causes. The apparent
ability of humans to deliberate between choices using reason, however,
is an illusion because every actor is in fact directed toward one of
the choices by external causes (1.9.3.2–4).</p>

<p>
The rejection of the existence of free will presented difficult
ramifications for Christian ethics and theology, which depend on the
freedom to choose a virtuous life. In resolving these difficulties,
Pomponazzi chose fate over freedom because he thought that it better
preserved God’s complete power and providence. If God had
granted freedom to humans, the lack, or extreme rarity, of truly
virtuous humans on earth demonstrates the absence of a truly
providential plan in which humans freedom to choose a completely moral
good life is realized. Similarly, if humans have the ability of free
choice, God must not know these future decisions and humans are
thereby limited with respect to his knowledge and power. As a
consequence, Pomponazzi opted for fate and determinism, rejecting what
he considered to be a denial of God’s providence, omnipotence,
and omniscience. The world’s order and the cosmic laws that
govern the eternal motions of the universe include the existence of
good and evil as part of the necessary cycles of change.</p>

<p>
At the beginning of the third book, Pomponazzi maintained that his
naturalistic arguments (<em>argumentationes naturales</em>) of the
first two books were by no means certain and were to be rejected if
they contradicted the teachings of the Catholic Church (3.1.1). He
then proposed to find solutions to the questions of fate and divine
providence that preserve free will. Accordingly, Pomponazzi, seemingly
in opposition to the arguments outlined in the first two books, opened
the door for the possibility of freedom of choice that potentially
could be in line with Christian theology by identifying the human will
with the intellect. He argued that God limited his omnipotence and
foreknowledge, thereby allowing for the possibility of future
contingents. This divine self-limitation allows for the possibility
that the human intellect, through the power of deliberation, is
capable of suspending predetermined acts of volition that go against
the moral interests of the actor, thereby being able to choose to sin
or not sin. Human liberty is defined in negative terms, a privation
and a suspension, since the will does not produce action in these
instances but only impedes it (3.8). While some commentators have seen
this line of argumentation as a potential “line of defense for
the <em>opinio christiana</em>”, (Poppi 1988: 659) it was
specifically condemned in 1576 by a censor who placed the work on the
index of prohibited books (Baldini &amp; Spruit 2009: 1,3:
2279–80).</p>

<p>
The fifth and final book of <em>On Fate</em> continues the theological
discussions of the previous two books, turning to an examination of
predestination., a concept that according to Pomponazzi is not
mentioned by philosophers but is key to Christian theology, being tied
to doctrines on fate and God’s providence. In this book, he put
forward two distinct, incompatible accounts of predestination. The
first account argues that God does not act in an indeterminate or
contingent manner and therefore, has determined everything for
eternity, eliminating the importance or even possibility of human
choice (5.2). The second account argues that God has created the
universe perfect with respect to all its parts, including humans who
have the capacity to choose, or refrain from, sin. God, however, has
not made all humans equal with respect to their ability to obtain
perfection, and only some have been granted grace or are
“elected”. This election, or grace is not certain, as
those that have been chosen still have the possibility to choose to
sin and thereby forfeit the grace that had been conceded to them. The
chosen, however, who follow God’s will can be certain to obtain
the glory that God has conditionally promised (5.7). The epilogue
reiterates his conviction that the Stoic conception of the universe is
preferable. He maintained that if the universe is like an animal, the
sublunary world represents excrements, while the heavenly spheres are
perfect, free of evil. Finally, he confessed that he has never
understood how Christian theologians preserve divine providence and
human free will, describing it as an illusion and a trick
(5.<em>epilogus</em>.7–10).</p>

<p>
That the first two books of <em>On Fate</em> at times seem to be in
disagreement with the latter three presents difficulties for
interpreting it, having led some scholars to assume Pomponazzi’s
true position, which corresponds to arguments in <em>On
Incantations</em>, are found in the first books (see Poppi 1988).
Others have seen the last three books as an attempt to undermine
Christianity by demonstrating the weakness or incompatibility of the
Christian doctrines of predestination and God’s omnipotence and
omniscience (see Di Napoli 1970). Alternatively, scholars have seen
the latter books to be a genuine attempt to critique and reform
Thomistic theology (see Perrone Compagni 2004: cix–clviii) that
offers innovative solutions to outstanding theological problems (see
Ramberti 2007: 109–50).</p>

<h2 id="LateWork">6. Later Works</h2>

<p>
Pomponazzi elaborated on many themes found in <em>On Fate</em>, <em>On
Incantations</em>, and <em>On the Immortality of the Soul</em> in the
final years of his life while he lectured on Aristotle’s
<em>Parva naturalia</em>, <em>De generatione et corruptione</em>,
<em>De partibus animalium</em>, and the <em>Meteorologica</em>. The
only new work printed these years was a <em>On Growth and
Nutrition</em> (1521), which discussed a central topic of <em>De
generatione et corruptione</em>. The work is explicitly naturalistic
in outlook and provides potential natural explanations for what some
considered miracles—that St. Paul’s tongue spoke after his
head was severed from his body—in addition to asserting that the
human intellect requires a bodily organ (1.11, 1.23; see Ramberti
2010).</p>

<p>
His lectures on <em>De partibus animalium</em> display his skepticism
toward complete human knowledge of the natural world (see Perfetti
1999). This skepticism displayed in the biological works also appears
in his lectures on Aristotle’s <em>Meteorologica</em>, in which
he puts forward doubts about knowledge of the final causes of
disasters and the certainty of a number of meteorological explanations
(see Martin 2011: 30–33, 44–50). Yet, in these lectures he
followed several teachings of <em>On Incantations</em>, affirming the
place of prodigies in the ordering of the universe and the role of the
stars in causing sublunary change (see Graiff 1976).</p>

<h2 id="InflLega">7. Influence and Legacy</h2>

<p>
Given the controversial nature of many of his writings and the
difficulty in interpreting his works, Pomponazzi’s influence was
varied. Opponents accused him of undermining organized religion,
abetting Lutheranism, and contributing to the development of atheism.
Alternatively, he has been praised for promoting intellectual freedom,
improving methods for interpreting Aristotle, and preparing the way
for the materialism and positivism of modern science.</p>

<p>
Although,his writings do not appear to follow the demand of
<em>Apostolici regiminis</em> that philosophers defend Catholic dogma
to the best of their ability, ecclesiastical authorities did little to
enforce the Fifth Lateran Council. While never convicted of heresy,
nevertheless the last years of his life as well as the immediate
aftermath were filled with accusations of heterodoxy, including the
burning of his books at Venice. Some adversaries, such as Ambrogio
Flandino, associated <em>On Fate</em> with Martin Luther’s and
Hus’s denials of free will, an association that continued
throughout the sixteenth century (Del Soldato 2010). That Guglielmo
Gratarolo, a Calvinist exiled from Bergamo living in Basel, printed
<em>On Incantations</em> and <em>On Fate</em>, potentially confirmed
perceived links to heterodoxy (Maclean 2005). As the Counter
Reformation more clearly defined Catholic orthodoxy in the second half
of the sixteenth century, many Catholic theologians and philosophers,
especially Jesuits, saw his teachings as noxious and a potential
source of heresy. During the seventeenth century, concerns over
Pomponazzi grew in part due to the convicted and executed heretic
Giulio Cesare Vanini (d. 1619), who appropriated a number of
Pomponazzi’s arguments. Subsequently, many scholars, including
François Garasse, Marin Mersenne, and Tommaso Campanella,
linked him to atheism and to Niccolò Machiavelli’s
promotion of religious imposture as a political tool. Yet he still had
his defenders. The erudite Frenchman Gabriel Naudé praised
Pomponazzi both for his wit and for his historically accurate
interpretation of Aristotle. As a result, Pomponazzi became linked to
seventeenth-century libertinism (Martin 2014: 94–95,
124–44).</p>

<p>
Despite numerous negative assessments, some sixteenth-century
philosophers pursued Pomponazzi’s approach. For example, Simone
Porzio, a professor of philosophy at Pisa, followed his mortalist and
Alexandrian take on the human intellect (Del Soldato 2010). Even
though, many condemned his view that the soul dies with the body
throughout the seventeenth century, Pierre Bayle absolved Pomponazzi
of impiety, found him to an example of freedom of thought, and praised
him for his ethical teachings that spurned the inducements of the
afterlife (Bayle 1740: vol. 3, 777–83). In the nineteenth
century, he was championed by positivists such as Ernest Renan and
Roberto Ardigò, who upheld Pomponazzi as a model for the
scientific spirit that opposed religious oppression (Ardigò
1869; Renan 1852: 284–88). During the twentieth century,
a number of scholars endorsed the views of seventeenth-century
libertines, interpreting Pomponazzi as insincere, a promoter of
religious imposture, or as a determined enemy of Christianity (see
Busson 1957: 44–69; Charbonnel 1919: 220–74,
389–438). Accordingly, he gained among some the epithet
“Radical Philosopher” (see Pine 1986). Other scholars,
following the leads of Bruno Nardi and Paul Oskar Kristeller, placed
him in the context of the secular tradition of medieval philosophy
that separated theology from philosophy. Under that interpretation,
Pomponazzi was not necessarily an instigator, or harbinger, of the
conflicts between church and science of the modern period but rather
better understood as participating in a continuation of scholastic
philosophy’s practices, which included open inquiry, that began
in the thirteenth century.</p>
