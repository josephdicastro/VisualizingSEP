<h1>Temporal Parts</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Sun Feb 1, 2004; substantive revision Mon Oct 5, 2015</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>

Material objects extend through space by having different spatial
parts in different places. But how do they persist through time?
According to some philosophers, things have temporal parts as well as
spatial parts: accepting this is supposed to help us solve a whole
bunch of metaphysical problems, and keep our philosophy in line with
modern physics. Other philosophers disagree, arguing that neither
metaphysics nor physics give us good reason to believe in temporal
parts.</p>

<h2><a name="1">1. Introduction</a></h2>

<p>

You're performing an amazing trick right now: you're in two places
at once. How do you manage to be down there, near the floor, and yet
also be a metre or two up in the air? Well, it's not so very amazing:
your feet are down there on the floor, and your head is up in the air.
Having spatial parts enables you to be in several different places, and
to have different properties in different places: you're cold down
there on the tiled floor, and also warm up there by the heater, because
your feet are cold and your head is warm. Moreover, having parts could
let you be in the same place as someone else: if you shared a hand with
a conjoined (‘Siamese’) twin, then you could both wear the
same glove without jostling for space.</p>

<p>

None of this is special to people: inanimate objects also extend
through space by having spatial parts. They have different properties
in different places, and sometimes they overlap by sharing their parts.
These simple facts about spatial parts explain basic features about the
way things and people occupy space.</p>

<p>

Things and people take up time as well as taking up space: you
existed yesterday, and, unless reading this article is a real strain,
you will exist tomorrow too. Just as you can have different properties
at different places (hot up here, cold down there), you can have
different properties at different times (yesterday you hadn't heard of
temporal parts, by tomorrow you'll know plenty about them). </p>

<p>

Some philosophers believe that you take up time by having different
temporal parts at different times. Your spatial parts are things like
your head, your feet and your nose; your temporal parts are things like
you-yesterday, you-today and you-tomorrow. If you have different
temporal parts, this would explain how you can exist at different
times, and it would also explain how you can have different properties
at different times (you-yesterday hasn't heard of temporal parts,
you-tomorrow is an expert). According to these philosophers, then,
persisting through time is pretty much like extending through space:
it's all a matter of parts.</p>

<p>

Other philosophers reject this picture. They argue that you persist
through time as a whole: it's not just a part of you sitting in front
of the computer right now, it's you, the whole you! It was the very
same whole person yesterday who knew nothing about temporal parts, and,
by tomorrow, the very same whole person will be an expert.
‘You-yesterday’ isn't a name for some mysterious part of
you which only existed for a day; instead, it's a stilted way of
talking about you, and what you were like yesterday.</p>

<p>

Discussions of time, space, identity and change have been part of
philosophy since its earliest days, and not every question about
persistence obviously concerns temporal parts. For example, can we give
criteria of identity through time for artefacts, animals or people?
What happens to a ship if you replace all of its planks one by one?
What if you keep the old planks, then build a new ship out of them? In
addressing these questions during the last couple of decades, however,
it has proven useful to discuss whether objects have temporal parts,
because the answers that philosophers give to these questions can often
depend upon whether they believe in temporal parts.</p>

<p>

This article is divided into a number of sections. Section 2 looks
more closely at what exactly temporal parts are supposed to be, and at
what sorts of things are supposed to have them. Sections
 <a href="#3">3</a>,
 <a href="#4">4</a>
 and
 <a href="#5">5</a>
 look
at a range of arguments in favour of believing in temporal parts, and
at the responses of those who reject temporal parts.
 <a href="#6">Section 6</a>
 discusses connections between debate about
temporal parts, and debate about the nature of time more generally.
 <a href="#7">Section 7</a>
 considers whether physics can teach us
anything about temporal parts.
 <a href="#8">Section 8</a>
 discusses a
question internal to temporal-parts theories: what relationship is
there between the different temporal parts of a single object? 
Finally,
 <a href="#9">section 9</a>
 touches on special concerns about
the persistence of people through time.</p>

<h2><a name="2">2. What are temporal parts, and which things are supposed to have them?</a></h2>

<p>

The two most popular accounts of persistence are perdurance theory
(perdurantism) and endurance theory (endurantism). Perdurantists
believe that ordinary things like animals, boats and planets have
temporal parts (things persist by ‘perduring’).
Endurantists believe that ordinary things do not have temporal parts;
instead, things are wholly present whenever they exist (things persist
by ‘enduring’). This looks like a straightforward
ontological disagreement, a dispute about what exists. Perdurantists
think that objects have both spatial and temporal parts, while
endurantists think that they only have spatial parts.</p>

<p>

From an endurantist point of view, however, it is difficult even to
say what temporal parts are supposed to be. Your temporal parts are
parts of you which lie in the past or in the future. But endurantists
agree that you have different spatial parts at different times: you
exchange molecules with the environment, you grow new hairs or lose a
tooth to decay. So, yes, some of your (former) parts lie in the past,
and some of your (future) parts lie in the future, but that doesn't
mean that you're somehow less than a whole person, right here and now.
Why do perdurantists make such a big deal of the obvious fact that you
have different parts at different times?</p>

<p>

Endurantists think about what parts you have at different times,
past, present or future. But perdurantists prefer to think atemporally
about what parts you have, full stop (what parts you have, period). And
they claim that you have you-yesterday, you-today and you-tomorrow
amongst your parts. Endurantists don't accept this atemporal way of
talking about parthood, and so they find it difficult even to say what
they don't like about temporal parts.</p>

<p>

What moral should we draw from this communication breakdown? Some
perdurantists think ‘so much the worse for endurantists: they
can't even say what they're against’. Some endurantists think
‘so much the worse for perdurantists: their theory doesn't even
make sense’. And some philosophers on both sides look for a
neutral way to spell out the notion of a temporal part (for more detail
on this, see the reading suggestions at the end of this section). For
now, let's take it that the basic idea of a temporal part is
well-enough understood, perhaps via the analogy with spatial parts;
later sections will show how the idea is put to work.</p>

<p>

So the two standard views of persistence are endurance and
perdurance theories. But there are also non-standard views. 
According to mixed views, some persisting objects have temporal parts,
and others do not. For example, perhaps changing objects have temporal
parts, whilst objects with unchanging intrinsic natures do not. Or
perhaps ontologically self-sufficient things like organisms don't have
temporal parts, but ontologically dependent things like ocean waves,
smiles or universities do. (Most endurantists, perdurantists and others
agree that processes or events have temporal parts: whether or not I
have earlier and later parts, my birthday party certainly does.)</p>

<p>

Other non-standard views take the basic perdurantist idea that
persistence is much like spatial extension, then they develop the idea
in different ways. For example, perhaps persisting things stretch out
four-dimensionally through time, but without being subdivided into
temporal parts. Or perhaps, as stage theorists claim, the world is full
of four-dimensional objects with temporal parts, but when we talk about
ordinary objects like boats and people, we talk about brief temporal
parts or ‘stages’ of four-dimensional objects.</p>

<p>

How is this supposed to work? Imagine that someone refers to you by
name. According to perdurantists, the name refers to a ninety-year-long
(let's hope) four-dimensional object. According to stage theorists, the
name refers to a brief part of that ninety-year-long object, a
different one at different times. This sounds peculiar: after all, your
name refers to you and you have a future (and quite a past), while
stages exist only momentarily. Stage theorists say that when we
speculate about what you're going to do next week, our speculations are
made true or false by the behaviour of your counterparts next week.
These future counterparts of yours are the very objects which,
according to perdurantists, are your future temporal parts.</p>

<p>

Just how brief are temporal parts or stages? Typically, objects
which have any temporal parts are thought to have instantaneous
temporal parts (‘time-slices’), which do not themselves
persist through time. (Most perdurantists think that things have
non-instantaneous temporal parts too, like you-during-1999.) But an
alternative is to claim that an object has only as many temporal parts
as it has genuinely differentiated periods in its existence; this is a
mixed view, because changing objects will have temporal parts, while
unchanging objects and temporal parts will persist without having
temporal parts of their own.</p>

<p>

Some philosophers and some non-philosophers suspect that debate about
whether things have temporal parts is empty, that there is no genuine
issue at stake here. One idea is that we can't know for sure whether
things have temporal parts: all the theories on offer have good and
bad aspects and we'll never find an undisputed champion. If this is
true, it doesn't undermine the debate unless consensus and certainty
are our only goals. A second idea is that metaphysical enquiry is
pointless, since irrelevant to daily life. This claim needs support
from accounts of relevance, and of the connection between irrelevance
and pointlessness. A third idea is that metaphysical enquiry is doomed
to fail because there are no absolute metaphysical truths. This claim
needs support from accounts of truth, language and reality. All of
these topics are too grand for this article. A fourth idea is the much
more focused claim that, while certain metaphysical disputes are
legitimate, the debate about temporal parts is empty: this doubt may
be reinforced by the difficulty of giving a neutral account of what
temporal parts are supposed to be, or by scepticism about the
so-called 'problem of change', as discussed in the next section.</p>

<p>
As noted above, the debate between endurantists and perdurantists is
an ontological dispute: do temporal parts of ordinary material objects
exist, or not?  Moreover the endurantist notion of 'being wholly
present' was understood in terms of parts and wholes.  In the past few
years, however, some have suggested that debates about persistence are
better understood as debates about location - how are material objects
located in (or extended through) time, and how does this compare with
the way(s) in which material objects are located in (or extended
through) space? Temporal parts were introduced at the beginning of
this entry via an analogy with spatial parts, but this recent work
challenges even the assumption that spatially-extended objects
inevitably have spatial parts. The present article focuses,
appropriately enough, on persistence questions understood via the
notion of temporal parthood, but you can read about alternative
approaches in the separate entry
on <a href="../location-mereology/">Location and Mereology</a>,
especially section 6.3.2.</p>

 

<p>

Before we plunge into arguments about whether temporal parts exist,
it's worth clarifying some terminology. First: perdurance theory is
sometimes called ‘worm theory’, especially when it is
contrasted with stage theory. This is because perduring objects stretch
out through time just as (we all agree) earthworms stretch out through
space. Worm theory has nothing to do with wormholes, and, sadly, people
don't usually describe themselves as ‘worm theorists’.
Second: ‘four-dimensionalism’ is sometimes used as an
umbrella term for perdurance theory and stage theory, and
‘three-dimensionalism’ as a name for endurance theory. This
is because perduring objects (and sums of stages) are four-dimensional,
whereas enduring objects are three-dimensional, wholly present at each
moment. But some non-standard views of persistence, including
‘mixed’ views, do not fall neatly into either category. And
beware: other authors use ‘four-dimensionalism’ and
‘three-dimensionalism’ as names for different theories of
time, rather than different theories of things in time. Third:
‘continuant’ is sometimes used as a neutral term for any
ordinary persisting thing. In this sense, we can ask whether
continuants endure or perdure. But the label ‘continuant’
is more commonly reserved for enduring, three-dimensional objects. This
marks a contrast with processes or events, and carries the implication
that perdurantists foolishly identify material objects with events. So
it tends only to be endurantists who use the term
‘continuant’.</p>

<p>

<strong>Suggested Reading</strong>: good introductions to the debate
about temporal parts include Loux (1998, chapter 6), Haslanger (2003),
McGrath (2007), Sider (2008), Effingham (2009), Balashov (2011), and
Effingham (2012). Of these recent three, Effingham (2009) is more
introductory, Effingham (2012) detailed and comprehensive, and
Balashov (2011) more advanced, guided by relativistic physics. Lewis
(1986a, p. 202) introduces the terms ‘endurance’ and
‘perdurance’, attributing them to Johnston. Sider (1997;
2001, section 3.3) discusses the difficulty of defining
‘temporal part’; see also Merricks (1999a), Hawley (2001,
section 1.6) and McKinnon (2002). Wasserman (forthcoming) argues that
we often conflate the ontological question whether things have
temporal parts with the explanatory question whether things persist in
virtue of having those parts.  Lewis (1976, postscript B) tries to
make the notion of a temporal part acceptable to endurantists; van
Inwagen (2000) and Noonan (2003a) object, whilst Braddon-Mitchell and
Miller (2004) respond.  Perdurantists include Quine (1950; 1960),
Taylor (1955), Lewis (1971; 1976; 1986a), Armstrong (1980), Noonan
(1980), Robinson (1982), Heller (1984; 1990), Le Poidevin (1991),
Jubien (1993), and Hudson (2001).  Endurantists include Thomson (1965;
1983), Geach (1966; 1967), Chisholm (1976), Mellor (1980; 1981; 1998),
Lowe (1983; 1998b), Simons (1987), Forbes (1987), Haslanger (1989a),
van Inwagen (1990a; 1990b), Oderberg (1993), Merricks (1994) and Fine
(2008/2006); Simons (2008) responds to Fine. Melia (2000) eliminates
processes in favour of enduring things. Johnston (1987) explores a
mixed view, and so, differently, do Hofweber and Velleman
(2011). Parsons (2000) develops four-dimensionalism without temporal
parts, and Miller (2009) develops this further. For stage theory see
Sider (1996; 2001) and Hawley (2001); Varzi (2003) is a sympathetic
discussion, whilst Balashov (2007) attempts a precise definition of
‘exdurance’ aka stage theory. Moyer (2008), Moss (2012)
and Viebahn (2013) compare stage theory with perdurantism.  For
arguments that there is no real dispute here, see McCall and Lowe
(2003), Lowe and McCall (2004), and Miller (2005); Reydon (2008)
responds by drawing analogies with debate about biological species.
Hirsch (2008) shows how more general scepticism about metaphysical
disputes might play out here; McGrath (2007) draws out a number of
connections with the burgeoning literature on metaontology, and
Hawthorne (2006, 2008) explores the distinction between three- and
four-dimensionalism (the second of these articles is the more
accessible).  For discussion of how to define ‘wholly
present’, see Wasserman (2004a), Crisp and Smith (2005), Olson
(2006).  Cotnoir's (2015) review of Kleinschmidt (2014) highlights
issues about persistence and location; Kleinschmidt's introduction is
very useful,and provides further references.  Donnelly (2011)
advocates the location approach, articulated in Parsons (2007); for
further references see the separate entry
on <a href="../location-mereology/">Location and Mereology</a>,
especially section 6.3.2.  Steward (2015) discusses continuants.</p>

<h2><a name="3">3. Change and Temporal Parts</a></h2>

<p>

Enough about what temporal parts are supposed to be. Why believe in
them at all? It's not clear whether ordinary thinking involves any
commitment for or against temporal parts: some believe that it is
neutral, while others believe that the default assumption is that
things don't have temporal parts. Regardless of what ordinary thinking
tells us, advocates of temporal parts argue that their view offers the
best solutions to a number of metaphysical problems. Endurance
theorists respond by offering solutions of their own, criticising the
temporal-parts solutions, or both.</p>

<p>

One metaphysical problem concerns how change is possible (this has
recently become known as the ‘problem of temporary
intrinsics’ or sometimes the ‘problem of
change’). The banana in the fruitbowl was unripe a few days ago,
and today it is overripe. Surely nothing can be both unripe and
overripe?  Of course, it's the fact that the banana is unripe and
overripe at different times which saves it from metaphysical peril: we
all know that. But it would be nice to understand why this fact is
crucial: what is it about the passage of time which makes it possible
for one and the same object to have apparently incompatible
properties?</p>

<p>

If the banana has temporal parts, this explains how it can change:
an earlier temporal part of the banana is unripe, while a later
temporal part of the banana is overripe. More grandly: an earlier
temporal part has the property <em>being-unripe</em>, while a later
temporal part has the property <em>being-ripe</em>. There's no mystery
here, any more than there is mystery in your being both hot and cold by
having a hot head and cold feet: we're all familiar with the fact that
different parts of the same object can have different properties.</p>

<p>

Is this a good explanation of change? One objection is that
perdurance-style temporal variation is not really change at all: 
the whole four-dimensional banana is neither unripe nor overripe, so
can't change between these states, and the temporal parts are either
permanently unripe or permanently overripe, so they don't change
either. In response, perdurantists distinguish two ways of talking
about persisting things—an atemporal way, which takes in all times at
once, and a temporal way of talking, relative to various times. On the
atemporal way of talking, the whole four-dimensional banana is neither
unripe nor overripe; nevertheless, it's true to say in temporal terms
that the whole banana is unripe on Monday, and the whole banana is
overripe on Friday, because of the properties of the relevant temporal
parts. Endurantists who claim that temporal variation is not genuine
change must challenge this combination of temporal and atemporal
talk.</p>

<p>

Stage theorists give the same basic account of change as
perdurantists do, but they have a slightly different response to the
no-change objection. According to perdurantists, talk about the same
banana at different times is straightforwardly made true by one and the
same four-dimensional object existing at different times. But some
fancy footwork is needed to explain what it is for that object to be
overripe right now: it's for it to have an overripe temporal part right
now. In contrast, according to stage theorists, talk about the banana
being overripe right now is straightforwardly made true by the banana
being overripe, since the banana just is a momentary stage which exists
right now. But some fancy footwork is needed to explain what it is for
the same banana to exist at different times: it is for the current
momentary banana to stand in certain intimate causal relations to
momentary bananas in the past and the future.</p>

<p>

Temporal-parts accounts of change seem OK, but can endurantists come
up with anything equally good or better? How can one and the same thing
have different properties at different times? One radical answer is
presentism, the view that only present objects, events and states
exist: past and future do not exist. Presentism seems to dissolve the
problem of change: since only the overripe banana is present, its
unripe state does not exist, so there's nothing to worry about. (For
further discussion of presentism, see
 <a href="#6">section 6</a>.) 
 But unless there are independent reasons for accepting
presentism (see the separate entry on
 <a href="../time/">time</a>),
 it
seems like a drastic response to the problem of change.</p>

<p>

Less radically, endurantists may claim that objects change by
standing in different relations to different times. There is no
absolute fact of the matter regarding the ripeness of the banana:
instead, the banana bears the <em>being-unripe-on</em> relation to
Monday, and the <em>being-overripe-on</em> relation to Friday. 
(Alternatively, perhaps the banana possesses two compatible properties,
<em>being-unripe-on-Monday</em>, and
<em>being-overripe-on-Friday</em>.) There's no mystery in an object
which bears apparently incompatible relations to different things: you
are bigger than the Mona Lisa, and smaller than the Louvre, but
metaphysicians don't puzzle over how you can be both bigger-than and
smaller-than. Those who oppose this relational view of changeable
properties claim that it's just too relational: the banana seems to
lose all its intrinsic nature. We may also worry that, as with the
temporal parts account, it's not clear whether anything really changes
on this picture: the banana always stands in the same relations to the
various times.</p>

<p>

(For further discussion see the separate entry on
 <a href="../intrinsic-extrinsic/">intrinsic vs. extrinsic properties</a>,
especially section 1.1.)</p>

<p>

A third endurantist account of change is adverbialism. Change is
puzzling because it seems that a single object (like the banana) both
has and doesn't have a single property (like <em>being-unripe</em>).
The adverbialist idea is that, instead of subdividing the object into
temporal parts (the banana-on-Monday and the banana-on-Friday), or
subdividing the property (into <em>being-unripe-on-Monday</em> and
<em>being-unripe-on-Friday</em>), we should subdivide the way in which
the object has the property. The banana has the property
<em>being-unripe</em> in a Monday way, and it fails to have that same
property in a Friday way. (Adverbialism is so-called because it focuses
on ways of having properties: an adverb tells you about the way
something is done.) Objections to adverbialism focus on whether this
relativisation of ways things have (or ‘instantiate’)
properties can explain change without simply raising further problems
about the nature of instantiation.</p>

<p>

In summary, then, those who believe in temporal parts seem to have a
nice explanation of change to hand. But those who reject temporal parts
also have a range of options, none of which seems decisively to have
been ruled out. (For further discussion, see the separate entry on
 <a href="../change/">change</a>.)</p>

<p> There have been a number of challenges to the idea there is any
genuinely metaphysical 'problem of change'; this is sometimes
diagnosed as a problem arising from confusions about tensed language.
However, there is no consensus about what the consequence would be if
there were no metaphysical problem of change: should we default to
endurance, or to perdurance, or should we conclude that the contrast
between these two positions is also somehow illusory?  </p>

<p>

<strong>Suggested Reading</strong>: It's a good idea to start with
Lewis (1986a, pp. 203–4), who coins the phrase ‘problem of
temporary intrinsics', argues that none of the endurance theories of
change are satisfactory, and sets out the perdurance account of
change. Wasserman (2006) surveys the debate; see also Wasserman
(2010). McTaggart (1927, sections 315–6), Simons (1987), Mellor
(1998, section 8.4), McCall and Lowe (2009), and Oderberg (2004) argue
that variation between temporal parts is not genuine change (Oderberg
2004 is also sceptical as to whether there is any genuine puzzle
here).  For a response see Heller (1992), then Lombard (1994) in
return. Botterell (2004) also criticises the temporal parts account of
change; Sattig (2002, 2003) objects to the perdurantist and stage
accounts of predication; see also Hansson Wahlberg (2010) and Lombard
(2006).  For the presentist account of change, see Merricks (1994),
Hinchliff (1996) and Zimmerman (1998a). van Inwagen (1990a) advocates
a relations-to-times view of temporary properties, as do Wasserman
(2003) and Mellor (1981), although Mellor (1998) has a different
account, in terms of fact-constituents; Effingham and Melia (2007)
defend the view against objections from Sider (2001). For discussion
of Lewis's objection to the relations-to-times view, see MacBride
(2001) and Rodriguez-Pereyra (2003); for a related objection see
Browning (1988). Lowe (1987), Johnston (1987) and Haslanger (1989b)
all propose versions of adverbialism. For discussion of these, see
Lewis (1988; 2002), Lowe (1988b) and Lombard (2003). Rea (1998b)
argues that consideration of change does not favour perdurantism. For
stage theory see Sider (2000; 2001, section 4.6). Hawley (2001,
chapter 1) also advocates stage theory, and discusses most of the
issues covered in this section.  Alternative accounts of change are
mooted by Ehring (1997; 2001), Simons (2000a), MacBride (2001) and
Parsons (2001). Klein (1999) argues that neither endurance nor
perdurance theories permit genuine change.  Rychter (2009), Hansson
(2007), and Hofweber (2009) argue that there is no genuine problem of
change; Raven (2011) argues that there is, whilst Einheuser (2012)
gives a nuanced assessment.</p>

<h2><a name="4">4. Coincidence</a></h2>

<p>

We usually assume that two different things can't be in the same
place at the same time: how could there be room? But certain puzzle
cases challenge this assumption. These puzzles are of interest in their
own right, but they feature in this article because, as with the
problem of change, perdurantists have argued that believing in temporal
parts is the best way to solve the puzzles. And, as with the problem of
change, endurantists may reply that temporal parts don't help, or that
there is a perfectly good endurantist alternative, or both.</p>

<h3><a name="4.1">4.1 Temporary Coincidence</a></h3>

<p>

In some puzzle cases it seems that two objects occupy the same place
at the same time, but not forever: one or both of them exist either
before or after the period of coincidence. For example, suppose you
take a lump of clay, and by moulding and shaping it create a statue,
which you place proudly on a plinth. What's on the plinth? Well, the
statue is. Is the original lump of clay also on the plinth? It seems
so: you didn't destroy or even damage the lump of clay just by changing
its shape. So are there are two statue-shaped things on the plinth, a
statue and a lump of clay? On the one hand it seems daft to count these
as two different objects. But on the other hand they do seem different:
the lump of clay is older than the statue, for example, and perhaps it
makes sense to describe the statue as ‘well-made’ or as
‘yet another derivative bit of art-as-therapy’, while the
lump of clay is neither well-made nor derivative: it was just dug out
of the garden. These differences suggest that the lump of clay
and the statue are two different things, occupying the same place at
the same time.</p>

<p>

This argument is sometimes expressed using Leibniz's Law, the
principle which says that if objects differ in their properties, they
cannot be one and the same thing. Leibniz's Law should be distinguished
from the more controversial Principle of the Identity of
Indiscernibles, which says that if objects share all their properties,
they must be one and the same thing. (See the separate entry on the
 <a href="../identity-indiscernible/">identity of indiscernibles</a>.)</p>

<p>

Similar examples of temporary coincidence can arise when objects
gain or lose parts. Tibbles the cat is made of the usual catty parts,
including a tail, and a tail-complement, i.e., all of Tibbles except
for her tail. A tail-complement is a slightly strange object, but it's
rather like a torso, i.e., all of an animal except for its limbs and
head. Tibbles has a whimsical owner, who names the tail-complement
‘Tib’. One eventful day, Tibbles loses her tail in an
accident: she shrinks to become exactly the same size and shape as Tib.
On the one hand it seems daft to count Tibbles and Tib as two different
objects after the accident. But on the other hand they do seem
different: Tibbles has been a cat for years, unlike Tib, and Tibbles is
her owner's favourite animal, while perhaps we cannot say this of Tib.
These differences suggest that, after the accident, Tibbles and Tib are
two different things occupying the same place at the same time.</p>

<p>

(Related problems about cats and their parts are dealt with in the
separate entry on the
 <a href="../problem-of-many/">problem of the many</a>.)</p>

<p>

What have these puzzles about temporary coincidence got to do with
temporal parts? If we accept that statues, lumps of clay, cats, tails
and tail-complements all have temporal parts, then we can tell a
coherent story about these cases. This should tempt us to believe in
temporal parts, unless endurantists can come up with a good story of
their own. Let's look at the perdurantist and endurantist stories in
turn.</p>

<p>

Central to the perdurantist account of temporary coincidence is the
claim that, while it is bizarre to think that two distinct objects
could entirely coincide, there is nothing bizarre about two objects
partially coinciding by sharing a part, and nothing bizarre about an
object partially coinciding with one of its own parts. Recall the
example of you and your conjoined twin. If you share a hand, there is
no puzzle about how you can both be in the same glove without jostling
for space: you and your twin partially coincide by sharing a part. And
think of your left foot: there is no mystery about how you and your
foot can both be in the same sock, nor about how you can be partially
in the same place as your own foot. According to perdurantists, cases
of temporary coincidence involve objects which partially overlap by
sharing temporal parts, or objects which partially overlap because one
is a temporal part of the other (we can think of this as a limiting
case of sharing parts).</p>

<p>

Think of the lump of clay and the statue. Suppose you formed the
lump out of smaller bits on Monday, made it into a statue on Wednesday,
then smashed the thing to pieces on Sunday. According to perdurantists,
the lump of clay is a week-long four-dimensional object, and the statue
is a five-day-long four-dimensional object. Indeed, the statue is a
temporal part of the lump of clay, composed of some of the
instantaneous temporal parts which compose the lump. Now, how many
statue-shaped things are on the plinth on Thursday? Well, the lump of
clay and the statue both have a temporal part sitting on the plinth on
Thursday, so they're both partially on the plinth on Thursday. But
neither the lump nor the statue is wholly there on the plinth on
Thursday. This explains both our intuition that there's only one object
there (there's just the one arty-looking temporal part) and our
intuition that the statue and the lump are different objects with
different properties (they occupy different four-dimensional
regions).</p>

<p>

Much the same can be said for Tib and Tibbles. Tib and Tibbles are
both long-lasting four-dimensional objects, according to perdurantists.
Before the accident, at any given moment a temporal part of Tib is a
spatial part of a temporal part of Tibbles. After the accident, Tib and
Tibbles share temporal parts. But there's no mystery as to how Tib and
Tibbles can coincide after the accident yet still be different things:
neither the whole Tib nor the whole Tibbles is there, just some of
their shared temporal parts.</p>

<p>

Objections to the perdurance account of temporary coincidence focus
on general difficulties for perdurantism; on whether the account can
generalise to cope with all coincidence problems (see
 <a href="#4.2">section 4.2</a>);
 and on whether it can explain why we
are happy to call the statue but not the lump ‘well-made’
or ‘derivative’. There are also specific objections to the
perdurance account of temporary coincidence involving people (see
 <a href="#9">section 9</a>
 for these). What can endurantists come
up with instead?</p>

<p>

One popular endurantist option is simply to accept that two
different objects can wholly occupy exactly the same location at the
same time. This view is sometimes called the ‘standard
account’ of coincidence. The relationship between
wholly-coinciding objects is often called ‘constitution’,
and so the slogan of the standard account is ‘constitution is not
identity’. The lump of clay constitutes the statue, so they do
not have to jostle for space, but they are distinct objects, so they
can differ in their age, in whether they are derivative, and so on.
(Beware: the similar-sounding ‘composition is not identity’
usually represents the quite different view that a whole is not
identical to its several parts.)</p>

<p>

The examples we have seen so far involve coincidence between objects
of different kinds: a cat and a tail-complement, a statue and a lump of
clay. According to some versions of the standard account, constitution
is always a one-way relationship: the lump constitutes the statue, but
not vice versa. Accounts without this restriction can be sympathetic to
coincidence between objects of the same kind. This may occur, for
example, if objects of the same kind can ‘merge’ without
losing their identity, or if what looks like a single object can
‘divide’ into two of the same kind (some versions of the
‘ship of Theseus’ problem have this form). The most
intriguing imagined cases of fusion and fission involve people, and
will be discussed briefly in
 <a href="#9">section 9</a>.
 (The claim
that same-kind coincidence is impossible is sometimes called
‘Locke's thesis’.)</p>

<p>

Opponents of the standard account make the following objections: it
requires just too many objects (a particular problem in vague cases,
see
 <a href="#5">section 5</a>);
 it entails that when a 1kg statue is
constituted by a distinct 1kg lump, the result ought to weigh 2kg; and,
most seriously, it fails to explain how two distinct objects, made of
the same parts and matter, arranged in the same way and at the same
place and time, can be distinct objects with different properties. How
could all these facts about the arrangement of parts fail to fix the
facts about the whole?</p>

<p>

Defenders of the standard account make various responses. 
Regarding the ‘too many objects’ accusation, some point out
that perdurantists require even more objects when you count up all the
temporal parts, some attempt to establish principled limits on how many
objects are required, and others simply accept the multitude. 
After all, it's not so bad having all those objects when you realise
they don't all need separate locations. The response to the objection
about mass turns on an analogy with ordinary parts and wholes: your
various internal organs and limbs weigh several kilos each, but we
wouldn't expect these to show up on the scales in addition to your
total body mass, since you are made of the same stuff as your organs
and limbs. Likewise, supposedly, although the lump and the statue are
distinct 1kg objects, we shouldn't expect these to show up separately
on the scales, since they are made of the same stuff.</p>

<p>

Explanations of how coinciding objects can have different properties
vary with different versions of the standard account. Some claim that
coinciding objects share all their parts (and are parts of one
another). Others claim that, for example, the arm of the statue is not
part of the lump of clay, although there may be an arm-shaped lump of
clay which constitutes the statue-arm and is part of the bigger lump of
clay. But a couple of themes recur in defences of the standard account:
first, there is an attempt to shift the burden of proof. Why
<em>expect</em> all the properties of a composite object to be
determined by the identity, properties and interrelations of its
present parts? Second, there is the point that, although the standard
account entails that objects made of the same parts may differ, there
is no arbitrariness here. Not every object made of suitably-arranged
particles of clay is a lump of clay, for some are statues, but whenever
there are suitably-arranged particles of clay, there is a lump of
clay.</p>

<p>

Those who find these explanations unsatisfactory and thereby reject
the standard account needn't become perdurantists, however, for there
are several less-popular endurantist accounts of temporary coincidence.
Perhaps identity can be temporary: the statue and the lump are
identical once the statue exists, although the lump was not always
identical to the statue; Tib and Tibbles begin as non-identical, and
become identical. This proposal requires us to change our views of
identity, and of the connection between identity and sharing of
properties. Or perhaps objects can be destroyed more easily than we had
realised: the lump of clay ceases to exist when the statue is created
(it is replaced by a new, statue-shaped lump of clay, made from the
same clay particles); the cat's tail-complement ceases to exist when it
is separated from the tail.</p>

<p>

Or perhaps we should be more restrictive about the kinds of object
we accept into our ontology. After all, a tail-complement seemed like a
dubious object from the beginning, and if there is no such thing as
Tib, we don't have to explain what relationship holds between Tib and
Tibbles (we may grandly deny that cats have ‘arbitrary undetached
parts’). Similarly, perhaps it is a mistake to think that there
literally are such things as statues and lumps of clay, as opposed to
mere quantities of stuff or pluralities of particles. Restrictive
ontologies come in different strengths: accepting only partless objects
and living organisms; accepting only partless objects and those
composite objects which are ‘greater than the sum of their
parts’; accepting only partless objects; accepting only
‘stuff’ or matter and not objects at all; accepting only
‘proper’ objects and not quantities of stuff. 
Difficulties here include reconciling such radical claims with our
everyday beliefs, and, for the more moderate versions, ensuring that
each and every possible case of coincidence really has been ruled
out.</p>

<p>

separate entry on
 <a href="../identity-relative/">relative identity</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="4.2">4.2 Permanent Coincidence</a></h3>

<p>

The cases discussed so far involve objects which seem to coincide
for a while, yet fail to coincide at other times at which at least one
of them exists. Perdurantists claim that temporarily-coincident objects
are not wholly coincident: their non-coincident parts lie in the past
or future. But other puzzle cases seem to involve
permanently-coincident objects: even perdurantists have to accept that
permanently-coinciding objects wholly coincide.</p>

<p>

Suppose that, instead of first forming or digging up the lump of
clay then later moulding it into a statue, you make the two halves of
the statue separately, then create both statue and large lump in one
fell swoop, by sticking the halves together. Later, you petulantly
smash the thing into pieces, destroying statue and lump simultaneously.
Here, it seems that the lump of clay and the statue coincide at every
moment at which either exists, yet they seem to be distinct objects
because they differ in how they could have been: for example, the
statue could have been made of a different lump of clay, but the lump
could not. Talk of temporal parts doesn't help here: lump and statue
share all their temporal parts, and differ only in their modal features
(in how they could have been different).</p>

<p>

Can perdurantists accept that the lump and statue are distinct,
coinciding objects? In principle, yes, but this would be strategically
unwise: accepting the possibility of complete coincidence without
identity leaves perdurantism with no advantage over the standard
endurantist account of coincidence. Perdurantists are better advised to
claim that the statue and the lump of clay are one and the same object,
then come up with some explanation of why they appear to have different
properties. We may say that the object in question could, <em>qua</em>
statue, have been made out of a different lump of clay, but could not,
<em>qua</em> lump, have been made out of a different lump of clay.
There are various ways of explaining what the
‘<em>qua</em>’ clauses are doing in this peculiar claim,
and perhaps the most popular explanation involves counterpart theory, a
controversial theory about our talk of possibilities. Objections
here turn either on problems for counterpart theory, or else on whether
a satisfactory theory of how we talk about actual things can ever be
compatible with this view.</p>

<p>

Endurantists are in a happier position regarding permanent
coincidence: whatever solution they have adopted in response to
temporary coincidence will also handle permanent coincidence (although
adjustments are necessary in some cases).</p>

<p>

<strong>Suggested reading</strong>: This is a large field, but Rea
(1995) provides a helpful overview, and the papers collected in Rea
(ed.) (1997) are a useful next step. Sider (2001, chapter 5) and
Hawley (2001, chapters 5 and 6) also survey this area, both from a
temporal-parts perspective. The standard account is advocated or
discussed sympathetically by Doepke (1982), Baker (1997), Fine (2000;
2003), Johnston (1992), Robinson (1985), Levey (1997), Lowe (1983;
1997; 2003), Moyer (2006), Oderberg (1996), Rea (1997), Simons (1985;
1986; 1987; 1997), Yablo (1987), Thomson (1983; 1998), Paul (2006) and

(1997a; 1997b), Lewis (1971) , Noonan (1993) and Burke (1992). Gilmore
(2007) argues that endurance theorists can handle coincidence by
paying attention to the appropriate notion of spatiotemporal location;
Eagle (2010a) criticises this argument, and Gilmore (2010) responds,
followed by Eagle (2010b). McGrath (2007a) argues that temporal parts
views suffer the same difficulties as the standard account; Hawley
(2008) discusses this further, whilst Hawley (2005) explores related
issues.  Moyer (2009) argues that coincidence is neutral between
endurance and perdurance; in response, Eddon (2010) defends
perdurance; Rychter (2011) also defends perdurance here.  Sattig
(2008) argues that perdurantists cannot combine coincidence with
informative identity criteria.  Temporary identity is advocated by
Baxter (1989) and Gallois (1990; 1998). The claim that objects can be
very easily destroyed is advocated by Burke (1994a; 1994b; 1997a;
1997b) and Rea (2000), and critically discussed by Carter (1997),
Denkel (1995), Lowe (1995b), Noonan (1999b), Olson (1997a), Zimmerman
(1997) and Zammiello (2001). Restrictive ontologies are discussed by
Chisholm (1973), Elder (1999), Merricks (2000; 2001), Olson (1996;
1997b), van Inwagen (1981; 1990b), and Zimmerman (1997; 1995); Sidelle
(1998) explores a number of interesting options. It's hard to avoid
Wiggins (1980; 2001). The classic discussion of permanent coincidence
is Gibbard (1976). Temporal-parts accounts of permanent coincidence
include Noonan (1988; 1993; 1999a). Counterpart theory is advocated by
Lewis (1986, chapter 4).  A more formal approach to problems

<h2><a name="5">5. Vagueness</a></h2>

<p>

(The so-called ‘argument from vagueness’, sometimes
invoked in support of temporal parts, is discussed
in <a href="#8">Section 8</a> below.)</p>

<p>

Vagueness, or indeterminacy, seems to be a feature of our everyday
experience of persisting things, and it creates problems which,
according to temporal parts theorists, can best be solved by accepting
that things have temporal parts. As with the problems of change and of
coincidence, endurantists may criticise the temporal parts solution to
this problem, provide solutions of their own, or both.</p>

<p>

Vagueness often occurs at the beginning and ending of existence. It
is notoriously controversial whether there is a precise moment at which
human people begin to exist, and if so when that moment is. But most of
us will have a grey area at the end of our existence, a few seconds or
even a few minutes during which we seem to be neither clearly alive nor
clearly dead. More mundanely, formation and decay are gradual processes
for many kinds of object, both natural and artificial: think of a lake
or haystack which gradually comes into existence, or a building or a
rock formation which slowly crumbles away. Let's call this phenomenon
‘fuzzy temporal boundaries’.</p>

<p>

Indeterminacy can also arise when objects intermingle in a way which
seems to leave it clear that they survive the process, but unclear
which object is which. Suppose you remove about half the parts from the
bicycle your uncle gave you, about half the parts from the bicycle your
aunt gave you, and switch them over. Afterwards, you have two bicycles,
each half-made of parts that used to be in the bicycle your uncle gave
you, and half-made of parts that used to be in the bicycle your aunt
gave you. Which post-repair bicycle is the one your uncle gave you, and
which the one your aunt gave you? There seems to be no clear fact of
the matter. Let's call this phenomenon ‘radical
disruption’.</p>

<p>

In their bare essentials, the two types of indeterminacy are the
same (and it is possible to construct cases of intermediate types). In
each case, we are not sure how to pin down the career of an object. In
fuzzy-boundary cases, we don't know which of many overlapping career
paths an object follows (one which begins earlier, or later?); in
radical disruption cases, we don't know which of (at least) two
intersecting career paths an object follows.</p>

<p>

Typical temporal parts theorists argue that such indeterminacy
results from a mismatch between human language and
temporarily-coincident objects (of the sort discussed in
 <a href="#4.1">section 4.1</a>).
 Take a building which slowly crumbles
away to nothing. According to most temporal parts theorists, there are
very many ‘nested’ four-dimensional objects involved in
this process, some of which end before others do. We are unclear about
when the building ceases to exist because our use of language just
doesn't determine which of these many four-dimensional objects is
‘the building’.</p>

<p>

Likewise, in radical disruption cases like that of the bicycles,
perdurantists typically recognise a number of different
temporarily-coincident four-dimensional objects. Suppose the bicycle
your uncle gave you starts off made of parts <i>A</i> and
parts <i>B</i>, and the bicycle your aunt gave you starts off made of
parts <i>C</i> and parts <i>D</i>.  After the switch-around, you have
a bicycle made of parts <i>A</i> and parts <i>C</i>, and a bicycle
made of parts <i>B</i> and parts <i>D</i>. Perdurantists recognise (at
least) the following four-dimensional objects:</p>

<ol>
<li>something that begins with <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>, then continues
with <i>A</i> and <i>C</i>;</li>

<li>something that begins with <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>, then continues
with <i>B</i> and <i>D</i>;</li>

<li>something that begins with <i>C</i> and <i>D</i>, then continues
with <i>A</i> and <i>C</i>;</li>

<li>something that begins with <i>C</i> and <i>D</i>, then continues
with <i>B</i> and <i>D</i>.</li>

</ol>

<p>

Before the switch-around, objects (1) and (2) temporarily coincide,
in the place where you keep the bicycle your uncle gave you, and
objects (3) and (4) temporarily coincide, in the place where you keep
the bicycle your aunt gave you. After the switch-around, objects (1)
and (3) coincide, and objects (2) and (4) coincide. When we initially
talked about ‘the bicycle your uncle gave you’, there was
no fact of the matter as to whether we were talking about (1) or (2).
And (1) and (2) end up in different places after the switch-around,
which is why we don't know what to say about the final location of the
bicycle your uncle gave you.</p>

<p>

From a typical perdurantist perspective, apparent indeterminacy in
persistence arises from our fumbling failures to deal with the
multitude of precise four-dimensional objects around us. This account
of indeterminacy is not a consequence of perdurance theory alone: as
well as the claim that ordinary things have temporal parts, it involves
the claim that there are many more persisting things than we recognise
in ordinary life. It is possible to believe in temporal parts without
accepting this second claim but, as we will see in
 <a href="#8">section 8</a>,
 most perdurantists do accept the second
claim. The typical perdurantist story also involves a theory of
vagueness which traces it to our use of language; it is not compulsory
for perdurantists to think about vagueness in this way, but many do
adopt this ‘linguistic’ or ‘semantic’ approach
to vagueness.</p>

<p>

Objections to the typical temporal parts account of indeterminacy in
persistence turn on the sheer number of temporarily coincident objects
required to make the story work; or on independent objections to the
language-based account of vagueness (see the separate entry on
 <a href="../vagueness/">vagueness</a>);
 or on particular objections to
telling such a story about indeterminacy involving people (see
 <a href="#9">section 9</a>).</p>

<p>

What can endurantists say about indeterminacy in persistence? 
One option is to mimic the perdurantist temporary-coincidence account,
but without the temporal parts. That's to say, endurantists could claim
that there are very many wholly-present coincident building-like
objects where the building stands, each of which ends at a slightly
different moment from all the others. This multiplicity, together
with our loose talk, accounts for the unclarity in when the building
ceases to exist. Likewise, endurantists could recognise objects
(1)–(4), just as perdurantists do, but claim that each is wholly
present whenever it exists. This strategy is unpopular, because
temporarily-coincident enduring objects can seem worse than
temporarily-coincident perduring objects: temporarily-coincident
endurers are wholly coincident, unlike temporarily-coincident
perdurers. Endurantists may want to recognise some temporarily
coinciding things (see
 <a href="#4.1">section 4.1</a>),
 yet stop
short of the multitudes which would be required to explain fuzzy
boundaries.</p>

<p>

A second endurantist option is to accept that sometimes there just
are no precise facts of the matter about the temporal boundaries and
careers of objects, because the world itself is sometimes
indeterminate. This is the claim that there can be worldly
(‘ontic’, or ‘metaphysical’) vagueness. (A
worldly-vagueness option is also available to perdurantists, and might
be attractive to those who want to avoid commitment to a multitude of
temporarily-coincident four-dimensional objects. But typical
perdurantists adopt the temporary-coincidence-plus-linguistic-vagueness
account outlined above.)</p>

<p>

Many people recoil at the thought that the world itself could be
vague or indeterminate, perhaps because they believe that indeterminacy
must be a result of mismatch between what is represented (the world),
and what does the representing (thought or language). Even those who
don't mind a bit of worldly vagueness may have reason to reject worldly
vagueness in persistence, because this amounts to worldly vagueness in
identity: it's vague whether the original bicycle your uncle gave you
is identical with the bicycle you now ride to work. Worldly vagueness
in identity is thought to be especially problematic, because all
identity is self-identity, and it's hard to see how there could be any
vagueness in self-identity.</p>

<p>

Third, endurantists could claim that we speak precisely, that there
always are determinate facts of the matter about the identity,
existence and careers of objects, but it's just that sometimes we can't
tell what these facts are. (This involves an ‘epistemicist’
account of vagueness.) This claim could be developed in one of two
ways. In the case of the crumbling building, for example, endurantists
could claim that there is a single building-shaped object with an
unknown final moment. Or they could claim that there are very many
temporarily-coincident building-like objects, each with a different
final moment, that we refer to just one of these when we say ‘the
building’ but we do not know which. (Again, perdurantists may
adopt one of these epistemicist strategies, but typically do not.)</p>

<p>

Objections here may turn on problems for the epistemicist view of
vagueness in general; on the oddity of insisting that, for example,
there is an exact number of molecules which a building can lose before
it stops existing (on the first version of the view); or on objections
to multitudinous temporary coincidents (on the second version of the
view).</p>

<p>

Finally, endurantists could adopt a restricted ontology, as some do
in response to temporary coincidence. If there aren't really any such
things as bicycles, buildings or lakes, just particles moving around
and interacting, then there are no issues to resolve about the careers
and identities of bicycles, buildings or lakes. As before, the main
difficulty here is in reconciling our everyday beliefs with a
sufficiently restricted ontology: after all, people and even
fundamental particles seem sometimes to be indeterminate. (Again, it is
open to perdurantists to adopt a restricted ontology, but typically
they do not.)</p>

<p>

In summary then, both perdurantists and endurantists can adopt
various responses to apparent vagueness in persistence; which they
choose depends in part upon their more general views about the nature
of vagueness. Typical perdurantists posit temporary coincidence between
objects, and a failure on our part to talk determinately about any one
of these. Endurantists could make the same claim, but typically do not.
A temporary-coincidence view could instead be paired with an epistemic
account of vagueness, and our failure to know which object we're
talking about. Alternatively, vagueness may be either attributed to
objects themselves, and their failure to have determinate careers, or
else to our failure to know what careers they have. A radical
option is to deny that any genuine object is involved (thus restricting
ontology). In different ways, all of these options are available to
perdurantists and endurantists alike, but the costs and benefits
differ.</p>

<strong>Suggested Reading</strong>: For a way into the general
debate about vagueness, try Keefe and Smith (eds.) (1997), and the
separate entry on
 <a href="../vagueness/">vagueness</a>.
 Stalnaker
(1988) is a particularly nice discussion of vague persistence. 
Issues discussed in this section are covered in more detail by Hawley
(2001, chapter 4). Temporal parts accounts of vague persistence are
defended by Sider (2001, section 4.9) (Sider presents a distinctive
argument which will be discussed in
 <a href="#8">section 8</a>)
and Heller (2000); these are criticised by Lowe (2005). Endurantist
worldly vagueness is defended by van Inwagen (1988; 1990b) and
discussed by Cowles (1994), Garrett (1991), and Hirsch (1999). The
classic argument against worldly vagueness in identity can be found in
Evans (1978) and Salmon (1981). Heller (1996) objects to worldly
vagueness of all kinds. Hudson (2000) defends an epistemicist temporal
parts theory. Williamson (1994, chapter 9) discusses an epistemicist
account of vague objects. Haslanger (1994) considers multitudes of
coinciding endurers, and Sosa (1987; 1999) looks kindly upon the idea,
as does Kurtsal Steen (2010).</p>

<h2><a name="6">6. Time and Temporal Parts</a></h2>

<p>

As well as disagreeing about whether persisting things have temporal
parts, philosophers disagree about the nature of time itself. Does time
flow? Are the past and the future as real as the present? Philosophers
also disagree about the connection between these disagreements: does
taking a certain view about the nature of time commit you to any
particular view about the existence of temporal parts? What about vice
versa?</p>

<p>

You can find a more detailed discussion of the nature of time
elsewhere in this encyclopedia (see the separate entry on
 <a href="../time/">time</a>).
 The most relevant debate for our purposes
turns on whether distant times are like distant places. For example,
people, objects and places in Antarctica exist, even though they are
far away (if you are reading this in Antarctica, please adjust the
example). It can be difficult to communicate with distant places, and
they may be less important to us than our immediate surroundings, but
they exist nevertheless. What about eighteenth-century people, objects
and times? Does David Hume exist, despite being far away in time? Or is
it more reasonable to say that Hume used to exist, but now does not
exist?  Eternalists believe that past and future things exist,
just like present things. Presentists, in contrast, believe that
distant times are not like distant places: things in distant places
exist, but things at distant times do not. According to the
intermediate ‘growing universe’ theory, past and present
things exist, but future things do not.</p>

<p>

What connection is there between the eternalism-presentism debate,
and the debate about temporal parts? It's natural to suppose that
presentists should be endurantists, claiming that things are wholly
present whenever they exist. If you don't believe in either the past or
the future, there's nowhere and nowhen for any ‘missing’
parts to be. This argument from presentism to endurantism needs some
work, however. Presentists think that only the present exists, but
they're happy for us to talk about the causes of the First World War,
about next week's seminar, or about David Hume. Although Hume does not
exist, it's right to say that David Hume wrote <em>An Enquiry
Concerning Human Understanding</em>, and wrong to say that David Hume
wrote <em>The Feminine Mystique</em>. Presentists worth their salt provide a
story about what makes certain statements about the past and the future
right, and others wrong. Can presentists claim that, although past and
future temporal parts of the banana do not exist, the banana did have
temporal parts in the past, and will have other temporal parts in the
future? This takes us back to the question of how to define
‘temporal part’ (see
 <a href="#2">section 2</a>),
 and it
raises a methodological issue: should ‘temporal part’ be
defined in such a way that presentists can believe in temporal parts,
or not?</p>

<p>

Well, perhaps presentists should reject temporal parts and so be
endurantists. Must eternalists, who believe in the past and the future,
accept temporal parts and so be perdurantists? Or are eternalists free
to choose between endurantism and perdurantism?  One reason to
think that eternalists should believe in temporal parts is that without
them they may have difficulty explaining how things change. How can you
both know about theories of persistence (tomorrow) and fail to know
about theories of persistence (yesterday)? Presentists don't seem to
have a problem here: your failure yesterday to know about theories of
persistence just doesn't exist. But eternalists are committed to the
existence of your two apparently-conflicting states. If eternalists
accept temporal parts, they have a neat explanation at hand: your
yesterday temporal part doesn't know about theories of persistence, but
your tomorrow part does know about theories of persistence. But if
eternalists reject temporal parts, then the two apparently-conflicting
states are states of one and the same thing (you), and it's not obvious
how to resolve the conflict. So perhaps eternalists should believe in
temporal parts, and, conversely, those who reject temporal parts should
be presentists. This argument succeeds only if eternalists really can't
explain change without believing in temporal parts (see
 <a href="#3">section 3</a>).</p>

<p>

If we could establish that things have temporal parts if and only if
the past and the future exist, this would raise a number of issues.
First, should we attempt to establish a theory of persistence, and then
let this dictate our theory of time? Or should we start with the theory
of time? (See
 <a href="#7">section 7</a>
 for an argument from
physics against presentism and thus, perhaps, against endurantism.)
Second, tying the dispute about persistence to the dispute about time
makes trouble for anyone who thinks that one of the disputes is genuine
but the other is merely a verbal disagreement. And, third, since
presentism and eternalism seem clearly to be incompatible, if each
compels a different account of persistence, then there can't be
‘mixed’ worlds in which some things perdure and others
endure (a peculiar consequence, since most endurantists think that
processes perdure).</p>

<p>

Attempts to connect debates about time with debates about
persistence have focused on the disagreement between eternalists and
presentists. But there is another dispute about time which may have
some bearing on whether things have temporal parts. Eternalists agree
that past, present and future times all exist, but they disagree
amongst themselves as to whether there are important ontological
differences between the three categories. Advocates of the
‘A-theory’ of time argue that the flow of time pushes
events from one ontological status to another (presentists are usually
taken to be A-theorists too). But advocates of the
‘B-theory’ of time think that there is no important
ontological difference between past, present and future, and that there
is no such thing as ‘the flow of time’. There is some
tendency to think that the A-theory is more hospitable to endurantism,
and the B-theory more hospitable to perdurantism, but there is no
consensus on this matter.</p>

<p> Finally, considerations about the possibility of time-travel have
been used to argue both for and against the existence of temporal
parts; these arguments connect with debate about whether we should
approach persistence as an issue about parthood and/or as an issue
about location.  For more on this debate, see section 4.2 of the
separate entry on
 <a href="../time-travel/index.html#TimTraCha">Time Travel</a>, and section
 6.3.5 of the separate entry on
 <a href="../location-mereology/">Location and Mereology</a>.</p>

<p>

<strong>Suggested Reading</strong>: Earlier discussions of temporal
parts paid close attention to analogies and disanalogies between space
and time: e.g. Taylor (1955), Meiland (1966); Butterfield (1985)
reflects on these.  Lombard (1999) and Brogaard (2000) argue that
presentism is compatible with perdurantism, while Merricks (1995) and
Hestevold and Carter (2002) argue that presentism compels
endurantism. Benovsky (2009) takes an even-handed approach.  Merricks
(1995) and Hinchliff (1996) argue that eternalism rules out
endurantism, because of the problem of change; see the suggested
reading at the end of
 <a href="#3">section 3</a>
 for
endurance-friendly eternalist accounts of change. Lowe (1998a) argues
for a connection between theories of time and theories of persistence.
Markosian (1994) attempts to formulate the endurance-perdurance debate
in a way which is independent of the eternalism/presentism debate.
Mellor (1981; 1998) and Johnston (1987) combine eternalism and
endurantism. For discussion of the relationship between the A/B-theory
debate and the debate about persistence, see Butterfield (1985),
Oaklander (1992), Wilson (1955), and Carter and Hestevold (1994).
Parsons (2005) highlights a semantic problem for B-theory
perdurantists. Barker and Dowe (2003) criticise endurantism by drawing
on rival theories of time; McDaniel (2003) and Beebee and Rush (2003)
respond, provoking Barker and Dowe (2005); see also Benovsky (2009a).
Following Sider (2001), Effingham and Robson (2007) argue that
endurantism cannot account for the possibility of time travel, as does
Simon (2005), whilst Miller (2006a) defends endurantism; Gilmore
(2007) and Effingham (2011a) argue that time travel is a problem for
perdurantism.  See also Effingham (2010) and Daniels (2014)</p>

<h2><a name="7">7. Special Relativity and Temporal Parts</a></h2>

<p>

Didn't Einstein show that space and time are basically the same
thing? It's true that Einstein's two theories of relativity radically
altered our scientific picture of space and time, although it is more
controversial what consequences the theories have for metaphysics. (See
section 3 of the separate entry on
 <a href="../spacetime-bebecome/">being and becoming in modern physics</a>
for more detail on this issue.) It is the Special Theory of Relativity
(STR) which has had most impact on the debate about temporal parts:
three quite different arguments have been proposed, each of which
purports to show that STR lends support to the perdurantist claim that
things have temporal parts.</p>

<p>

For our purposes, the key feature of STR is its claim that, for many
pairs of events, there is no absolute fact of the matter as to which
event, if either, happened first, or whether both occurred at the same
time. The question of precedence has different answers according to
different frames of reference, and there are no grounds for selecting
any single frame of reference as the one which gives the
‘real’ answer. This means that, for many events, there is
no absolute fact of the matter as to whether they are occurring in the
present, in the past or in the future. (If they were occurring now,
they'd be occurring simultaneously with your reading this sentence, but
there's no absolute fact of the matter about this simultaneity
issue.)</p>

<p>

A first argument from STR to perdurantism goes as follows: STR shows
space to be much like time, objects extend in space by having spatial
parts, so objects persist through time by having temporal parts. 
But this argument is weak: although STR does show space to be like time
in some respects, the theory does still differentiate between spatial
and temporal dimensions. Even if it did not, we would need some further
reason to believe that persistence must be just like spatial
extension.</p>

<p>

A second argument from STR to perdurantism proceeds via the debate
about time (see
 <a href="#6">section 6</a>).
 According to STR, for
many events there is no absolute fact of the matter as to whether those
events are simultaneous with now. That's to say, at any moment, there
is no absolute fact of the matter as to which events are present. This
makes life difficult for presentists, who claim that only present
events exist. If STR thereby rules out presentism, and if endurantism
requires presentism in order to explain change (see
 <a href="#3">section 3</a>),
 then STR rules out endurantism: things have
temporal parts. But not all endurantists agree that they must be
presentists, and not all presentists agree that their view is
undermined by STR.</p>

<p>

A third argument from STR to perdurantism does not rely on the claim
that STR is out-and-out incompatible with endurantism. Instead, the
claim is that STR highlights a phenomenon which can better be explained
by perdurantists than by endurantists. To understand the phenomenon,
imagine a three-dimensional cylindrical chocolate cake which you want
to cut up into two-dimensional pieces (you've got a lot of friends). If
you cut only at right angles to the length of the cake, then each piece
will be circular. But if you cut at a different angle, then each piece
will be oval. The cylindrical shape of the cake explains the shapes of
the various pieces produced by cutting at various angles.</p>

<p>

Now imagine a four-dimensional object, cut into three-dimensional
timeslices. In a non-relativistic world, there's only one way to do
this, because there's only one way to divide up events into groups of
simultaneous events: it's like cutting the cake at right-angles. But,
by relativising simultaneity to reference frames, STR gives us lots of
different ways to cut the four-dimensional object into
three-dimensional slices, just as there are lots of different angles at
which to cut the cake. The shape of the three-dimensional slices you
get by cutting in different ways, from the perspective of different
reference frames, can all be explained by the shape of the
four-dimensional object you're cutting up.</p>

<p>

Endurantists don't think there is any four-dimensional object to do
this explaining job. There are only the three-dimensional slices, which
are just the single, persisting three-dimensional object (each slice is
that object, at a different time). STR tells us that the persisting
thing has different three-dimensional shapes with respect to different
reference frames. The different shapes in different reference frames
are correlated, but according to the endurance theorist there is no
‘underlying’ four-dimensional object to explain these
correlations. Endurantists may respond by questioning the need for
explanation here.</p>

<p>

In short, while the general ambience of modern physics may seem more
friendly to perdurance than to endurance theory, it is remarkably
difficult to devise any conclusive argument from physics to temporal
parts.</p>

<p>

More recent concerns have focused on how the various theories of
persistence can be formulated within a relativistic framework: can we
sustain a distinction between temporal and spatial parts, or should we
think in terms of spatiotemporal parts?  </p>

<p>

<strong>Suggested Reading</strong>: Balashov (2011) is an advanced
overview of these issues, Hawley (2009) is much more introductory, and
Gilmore (2008) is a very useful middle ground; Balashov (2008) is a
more technical paper which attempts precise definitions of the rival
theories of persistence against a relativistic backdrop.  Broad (1927,
chapter 2) is an early discussion of the links between perdurantism
and STR; see also Quine (1960, p. 172); Rea (1998b, section 1.1)
responds. Mellor (1981) argues that STR is compatible with
endurantism, while Mellor (1980) argues that the General Theory of
Relativity is also compatible with endurantism, contrary to Nerlich
(1979). Balashov (1999; 2000a) argues that perdurantism can better
explain relativistic phenomena. Balashov (2002) argues that STR
favours perdurantism over stage theory; Balashov (2000b) raises
further problems for endurantism, while Gilmore (2002) responds,
followed by Balashov (2005a); Gilmore (2006) develops a relativistic
version of endurance theory. Hales and Johnson (2003) weigh in against
endurance theory; see also Hales and Johnson (2007). Further
installments include Balashov (2009), Sattig (2006), Miller (2004),
Harrington (2005), Gibson and Pooley (2006). See also Hudson (2005)
and Balashov (2010) for book-length treatments of this and related
topics. McCall and Lowe (2003) argue for an STR-friendly notion of the
flow of time.  Davidson (2013). Balashov (2014), and Calosi (2015)
exchange arguments about four-dimensional shapes in relativistic
contexts.  Pashby (2013) argues that quantum objects lack temporal
parts.</p>

<h2><a name="8">8. Relations Between Temporal Parts</a></h2>

<p>

Suppose we accept that ordinary persisting things have temporal
parts. What can we say about the relations which hold between those
temporal parts? For example: must the different temporal parts of a
single object lie along a smooth trajectory through space and time, or
can objects jump about instantaneously, or pop out of and back into
existence? Similar questions also arise for endurantists, and not all
perdurantists answer these questions in the same way, but for the most
part perdurantists do agree on a particular type of answer to these
questions. This is because perdurantism is very often held in
conjunction with two other doctrines: the doctrine of universalism, and
that of Humean Supervenience.</p>

<p>

Universalism is the view that any collection of objects whatsoever
has a sum, an object they compose. Thinking just of the present moment,
this entails that there is an object composed right now of your left
ear, the front fork of your bicycle, and the Louvre. If you think about
all times, and imagine that ordinary things are made of instantaneous
temporal parts, then you can see that universalist perdurantists
believe in quite an extraordinary number of objects. Any combination of
temporal parts of any objects from any times, no matter how scattered
and disparate, composes an object. So there is an object made of your
maternal grandmother's wedding ring on the day she was married, your
right ear yesterday and a brief temporal part of an electron in the
year 2020. (Universalism is sometimes called ‘unrestricted
mereology’, ‘unrestricted composition’ or
‘unrestricted fusion’; ‘fusion’ means
‘sum’. For more on universalism, see the separate entry
 on
 <a href="../mereology/">mereology</a>,
 especially section 4.2.)</p>

<p>

There are a number of reasons why perdurantists typically adopt
universalism  First, the claim that there is a large number of
nested four-dimensional objects is central to the most common
perdurantist account of vagueness in persistence (see
 <a href="#5">section 5</a>).
 The building doesn't seem to have a clear
last moment of existence because there are very many coinciding
building-shaped four-dimensional objects, each of which ends at a
slightly different moment, and it is vague which of these is ‘the
building’. Whether its role in this story is a reason to accept
universalism depends upon the strength or weakness of alternative
accounts of vagueness in persistence.</p>

<p>

Second, it often seems that whether or not an object survives a
certain kind of change is in some sense conventional, or up to us. Many
believe that we set the standards for how many repairs you can make to
your bicycle without destroying it, and that whether or not a person
can survive massive memory loss is partly a matter of what we mean by
‘person’. How things persist seems sometimes to be a matter
of what kind of classifications we choose to use. A radical version of
this suggests that physical objects come into and out of existence when
we decide they do. This sounds mysterious: how could we have such
powers? But the combination of universalism and perdurantism permits a
less radical version of the view: there are lots of four-dimensional
objects which share temporal parts with the wheeled thing in your bike
shed, and it's up to us which one of those counts as a
‘bicycle’. Similarly, perhaps it's up to us which of the
multitude of four-dimensional objects count as
‘people’. </p>

<p>

Third, perdurantists who reject universalism seem committed to
giving an account of the difference between collections of temporal
parts which have a sum, and collections which do not. But such accounts
seem to permit borderline cases, in which it's not clear whether a
certain collection has a sum. And borderline cases look like cases in
which it is not clear whether a certain object (the sum of those parts)
exists or not. And many find such vagueness in existence unacceptable.
Objections to this argument turn on whether non-universalists really
have to give such an account, and on whether vague existence really is
unacceptable.</p>

<p>

This third type of argument for universalism has also been used to
argue directly for the existence of temporal parts. Roughly speaking,
instead of asking which temporal parts have a sum, we ask which
matter-filled regions exactly contain objects. Unless we agree that
they <em>all</em> do, we will get into trouble with borderline cases,
as in the previous paragraph. But if every matter-filled region
exactly contains an object, then even three-dimensional matter-filled
regions exactly contain objects. So the world is full of instantaneous
objects: these look very like temporal parts. This argument is now
often known as the 'argument from vagueness'.  Objections here include
those mentioned in the previous paragraph; we might also question
whether the instantaneous objects are really temporal parts.</p>

<p>

However they argue for their position, perdurantists who are also
universalists have an easy answer to some questions about what paths
objects may take through space-time: <em>any</em> series of
object-stages composes an object. It is certainly interesting to ask
which of those objects are bicycles, or ships, or people, but these now
look like questions about the classification of objects, rather than
questions about persistence.</p>

<p>

The other doctrine which usually goes along with perdurantism is
Humean Supervenience. This is the claim that, roughly speaking, facts
about which intrinsic properties are instantiated at which points
determine all the facts there are. There are no irreducibly holistic
facts. In conjunction with perdurantism, this entails that all the
facts about a given persisting object supervene upon intrinsic facts
about its briefest temporal parts. That's to say, if you fix what's
happening at each moment, you've fixed everything. This sounds pretty
plausible, but it turns out that it's rather difficult to reduce facts
about motion, for example, to suitable moment-by-moment facts.</p>

<p>

There are various responses to this difficulty. Endurantists are not
usually tempted by Humean Supervenience, since they are committed to
facts about identity between objects wholly existing at different
times, and these identity facts are not easily reducible to
moment-by-moment facts. So some take the difficulty for Humean
Supervenience to be a reason for adopting endurantism. Some
perdurantists stick with perdurantism, but reject Humean Supervenience.
Instead, they accept that some facts about persisting objects cannot be
reduced to facts about their briefest temporal parts; they may accept,
for example, that causal relations between earlier and later parts are
irreducible in this way. Finally, some perdurantists insist that the
supposed facts which seem to cause problems for Humean Supervenience
are not real facts after all.</p>

<strong>Suggested Reading</strong>: Lewis (1986a, pp. 212–3),
Heller (1990, section 2.9), Jubien (1993, section 2.2), Quine (1981,
chapter 1), Rea (1998a) and Hudson (2000) argue for universalism; van
Inwagen (1990b, section 8), Markosian (1998), Merricks (2001) and
Varzi (2003) object in various ways. Balashov (2007a) discusses
universalism and stage theory.  Sosa (1999) investigates the options
for endurantist universalism, whilst Miller (2006) develops an
endurantist 'universalism' based on constitution rather than
parthood. Sider (1997; 2001, section 4.9) develops the 'argument from
vagueness' via universalism to temporal parts; Koslicki (2003) is
critical, while Sider (2003a) responds. Further discussions of Sider's
argument include Balashov (2005), Nolan (2006), Markosian (2004),
Sider (2004), Miller (2005a), Varzi (2005), Noonan (2010) and Magidor
(forthcoming a). Korman (2010) provides an overview of this debate,
with further references.  Hirsch (1982) is an extensive, rewarding
discussion of criteria of persistence. Humean Supervenience is
articulated by Lewis (1986b, pp. ix-x), and discussed by Loewer
(1996).  The problem about motion is raised by Armstrong (1980), and
addressed by Robinson (1989) Hawley (1999; 2001, chapter 3), Zimmerman
(1998b; 1999), Callender (2001), Sider (2001, section 6.5), Lewis
(1999), Teller (2002) and Butterfield (2006); Butterfield (2005)
raises many interesting connections between the physics of motion and
the metaphysics of persistence. Balashov (2003a, 2003b, 2010), Hudson
(2002, 2003), Effingham (2011) and Torre (2015) discuss issues about
restricted composition and laws of nature.  Haslanger (1994) discusses
the connection between endurance and Humean Supervenience; Hawley
(2015) discusses links between persistence, temporary intrinsics and
Humean Supervenience in Lewis's work.  Oakes (2004) raises causal
difficulties for perdurantism without relying on HS.  Magidor
(forthcoming b) argues that much of the debate around perdurance and
endurance looks very different when we notice implicit assumptions
about universalism; see also Miller (2008) and Varzi (2007).  Della
Rocca (2011) argues that endurantists must adopt an implausible kind
of anti-reductionism about persistence; Baker (2013) responds.</p>

<h2><a name="9">9. Do People have Temporal Parts? And Other Special Cases.</a></h2>  

<p>

Issues about the persistence of people are the subject of an entire
encyclopedia article in their own right (see the separate entry on
 <a href="../identity-personal/">personal identity</a>),
 but it is worth
highlighting points where the arguments discussed in earlier sections
have special consequences for personal survival. People have various
distinctive features: we have moral status, we have mental properties
like reasoning and being conscious, and we are associated in an
intimate but somewhat puzzling way with living organisms. 
Moreover, most of us seem to have a special concern for our own future,
and are willing to limit current pleasures like smoking, shopping, and
not writing encyclopedia articles, because we believe that sacrifices
made now will benefit us in the future. We also feel a distinctive kind
of pride or shame about our own past actions, and are bound by our own
past promises but not by those of other people.</p>

<p>

Is there room for these distinctive features within the different
theories of persistence? It has been suggested that only endurantists
can justify our willingness to make sacrifices for our future selves,
to act upon the plans formulated by our past selves, and to rely upon
the evidence gathered by our past selves . The idea is that these
activities make sense only if a present person is identical to her past
and future selves. Perdurantists may respond in one of two ways. First,
they may argue that it is the whole, identical, four-dimensional person
who makes sacrifices, acts upon plans and reasons from evidence, via
the activities of her temporal parts. Alternatively, they may accept
that it is short-lived temporal parts which act, sacrifice and reason,
but that past- and future-regarding actions can be justified by the
intimate relations between distinct temporal parts of the same person.
Stage theorists must take this second route, for they claim that the
person just is a brief stage, who takes responsibility for the actions
of her past counterparts, and acts to benefit her future
counterparts.</p>

<p>

There are a number of issues about coincidence involving
people. For example, it seems that we human people at least
coincide with human organisms. You occupy the same location as a human
organism right now, but it seems that you differ in various ways: the
organism may have existed since conception, and will go on until
biological death, but some believe that the person does not come into
existence until the organism is relatively well-developed, and that the
person may cease to exist before biological death, by entering a
persistent vegetative state. You also seem to differ from the organism
regarding what's possible: perhaps you could have been a robot, or a
disembodied intelligence, whereas the organism could not.</p>

<p>

Certain puzzle cases also seem to suggest that a person might divide
into two: suppose that, as a result of philosophical confusion on the
hospital ethics committee, a doctor is permitted to remove the two
halves of your brain and implant them into two different (brainless)
bodies. On one understanding of this process, each of the resulting
people has a good claim to be you. Is this a reason to think that two
coincident people were walking around together before the operation,
and that they have only now been separated?</p>

<p>

Moreover, it seems that people are prone to indeterminacy, just like
crumbling buildings and bicycles: some people have gradual endings, and
sometimes, in stories at least, a person can undergo such a traumatic
change that it's not clear whether the same person exists after the
change.</p>

<p>

We saw a number of ways of dealing with coincidence and
indeterminacy more generally, in
 <a href="#4">section 4</a>
 and
 <a href="#5">section 5</a>.
 But any talk of either partial or total
coincidence involving people can seem problematic, because of concerns
about the use of first-person pronouns (who does your ‘I’
refer to before your brain-splitting operation, if there are two of
you?), and about multiplying conscious entities (could two people have
literally the same headache? if you merely coincide with a human
organism, are you sure it's you who has the headache, and not the
organism?). It's not clear, however, whether we should revise our
theories of persistence as a consequence of these problems, or whether
we should revise our ideas about people.</p>

<p>

People are especially interesting, but metaphysical questions about
persistence have been raised for objects of various other kinds,
including musical works, social entities, and biological species.  It
is often controversial what sort of entities these are - material
objects, abstract types, processes, sets? - and so it is also
controversial how far the arguments discussed above, which focus on
material objects, are relevant to these special cases.  The ontology
of musical works is discussed within a separate entry
on <a href="../music/#2">Philosophy of Music</a>.</p>

<p>Finally, this article has focused on debates about temporal parts
within philosophy, with a dash of physics.  However temporal parts are
also significant within applied ontology, where they may feature
within the conceptual schemes adopted by computer scientists,
biologists and others to represent information systematically.</p>

<p>

<strong>Suggested Reading</strong>: There is a huge literature on
personal identity, but everyone should read Williams (1973) and Parfit
(1971; then 1984 part 3 (at least)). Work on people which is informed
by the broader debate about persistence includes Lowe (1996), Olson
(1997; 2007), Merricks (2001), Baker (2000), Hudson (2001) and Noonan
(2003b). Lewis (1976) and Hudson (1999) provide perdurantist accounts
of people, while Merricks (1999b) advocates endurantism, and Brueckner
(2009) responds to Merricks. Haslanger (1992) argues that rational
enquirers must endure; Rosenkrantz (2005) argues from self-knowledge
to endurance; Prosser (2006) uses the nature of experience to explain
away the appeal of endurantism in general; Brink (1997) discusses
self-concern in a perdurantist framework; Broome (1991 chapter 11)
discusses connections between theories of persistence and
utilitarianism; Braddon-Mitchell and West (2001) argue that stages are
primary; Duncan (forthcoming) argues from the temporal extendedness of
thought to the falsity of certain views about personal
persistence. Special concerns about coincidence involving people are
discussed by Noonan (1999a), Merricks (2003), Olson (1997a), Shoemaker
(1999), Sider (2003b), and Sutton (2014). Burke (1997b), Ehring
(1995), Heller (2000), Wasserman (2005) and Demarest (forthcoming) are
also relevant.  Dodd (2004) and Caplan and Matheson (2006) discuss the
persistence of musical works, Hansson Wahlberg (2014) and Epstein
(2015 ch.12) discuss the persistence of social entities, Merkouris
(2014) discusses the persistence of legal treaties, and Reydon (2008)
discusses biological species.  There are many resources on applied
ontology at the Buffalo Ontology Site (see Other Internet Resources),
whilst Bittner, Donnelly and Smith (2004) explicitly discusses
endurance and perdurance in an applied ontology context. </p>
