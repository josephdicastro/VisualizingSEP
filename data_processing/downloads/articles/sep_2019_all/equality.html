<div id="preamble">

<p>

This article is concerned with social and political equality. In its
prescriptive usage, ‘equality’ is a loaded and
‘highly contested’ concept. On account of its normally
positive connotation, it has a rhetorical power rendering it suitable
as a political slogan (Westen 1990). At least since the French
Revolution, equality has served as one of the leading ideals of the
body politic; in this respect, it is at present probably the most
controversial of the great social ideals. There is controversy
concerning the precise notion of equality, the relation of justice and
equality (the principles of equality), the material requirements and
measure of the ideal of equality (equality of what?), the extension of
equality (equality among whom?), and its status within a comprehensive
(liberal) theory of justice (the value of equality). Each of these five
issues will be discussed by turn in the present article.

<h2><a name="DefCon">1. Defining the Concept</a></h2>

<p>

‘Equality’ is a contested concept: “People who praise it or
disparage it disagree about what they are praising or disparaging”
(Dworkin 2000, p. 2). Our first task is therefore to provide a clear
definition of equality in the face of widespread misconceptions about
its meaning as a political idea. </p>

<p>

The terms “equality” (Gr. isotes, Lat. aequitas, aequalitas, Fr.
égalité, Ger. Gleichheit), “equal,” and “equally”
signify a qualitative relationship. ‘Equality’ (or
‘equal’) signifies correspondence between a group of
different objects, persons, processes or circumstances that have the
same qualities in at least one respect, but not all respects, i.e.,
regarding one specific feature, with differences in other features.
‘Equality’ needs to thus be distinguished from
‘identity’ — this concept signifying that one and
the same object corresponds to itself in all its features: an object
that can be referred to through various individual terms, proper
names, or descriptions. For the same reason, it needs to be
distinguished from ‘similarity’ — the concept of
merely approximate correspondence (Dann 1975, p. 997; Menne 1962,
p. 44 ff.; Westen 1990, pp. 39, 120). Thus, to say e.g. that men are
equal is not to say that they are identical. Equality implies
similarity rather than ‘sameness.’</p>

<p>

In distinction to numerical identity, a judgment of equality presumes
a difference between the things being compared. According to this
definition, the notion of ‘complete’ or
‘absolute’ equality is self-contradictory. Two
non-identical objects are never completely equal; they are different
at least in their spatiotemporal location. If things do not differ
they should not be called ‘equal,’ but rather, more
precisely, ‘identical,’ as e.g., the morning and evening
star. Here usage might vary. Some authors do consider absolute
qualitative equality admissible as a borderline concept (Tugendhat
&amp; Wolf 1983, p. 170).</p>

<p>

‘Equality’ can be used in the very same sense both to
describe and prescribe, as with “thin”: “you are thin” and “you are
too thin.” The approach taken to defining the standard of comparison
for both descriptive and prescriptive assertions of the concept of
equality is very important (Oppenheim 1970). In the case of
<em>descriptive</em> use of equality, the common standard is itself
descriptive, e.g. two people weigh the same. A <em>prescriptive</em>
use of equality is present when a prescriptive standard is applied,
i.e., a norm or rule, e.g. people ought to be equal before the
law. The standards grounding prescriptive assertions of equality
contain at least two components. On the one hand, there is a
descriptive component, since the assertions need to contain
descriptive criteria, in order to identify those people to which the
rule or norm applies. The question of this identification — who
belongs to which category? — may itself be normative, e.g. to
whom do the U.S. laws apply? On the other hand, the comparative
standards contain something normative — a moral or legal rule,
in the example, the U.S. laws — specifying how those falling
under the norm are to be treated. Such a rule constitutes the
prescriptive component (Westen 1990, chap. 3). Sociological and
economic analyses of (in-)equality mainly pose the questions of how
inequalities can be determined and measured and what their causes and
effects are. In contrast, social and political philosophy is in
general concerned mainly with the following questions: <em>what
kind</em> of equality, if any, should be offered, and to <em>whom</em>
and <em>when</em>? Such is the case in this article as well.</p>

<p>

‘Equality’ and ‘equal’ are incomplete
predicates that necessarily generate one question: equal in what
respect? (Rae 1981, p. 132 f.) Equality essentially consists of a
tripartite relation between two (or several) objects or persons and
one (or several) qualities. Two objects a and b are equal in a certain
respect if, in that respect, they fall under the same general
terminus.  ‘Equality’ denotes the relation between the
objects that are compared. Every comparison presumes a <em>tertium
comparationis</em>, a concrete attribute defining the respect in which
the equality applies — equality thus referring to a common
sharing of this comparison-determining attribute. This relevant
comparative standard represents a ‘variable’ (or
‘index’) of the concept of equality that needs to be
specified in each particular case (Westen 1990, p. 10); differing
conceptions of equality here emerge from one or another descriptive or
normative moral standard. There is another source of diversity as
well: As Temkin (1986, 1993) argues, various different standards might
be used to measure inequality, with the respect in which people are
compared remaining constant. The difference between a general concept
and different specific conceptions (Rawls 1971, p. 21 f.) of equality
may explain why according to various authors producing
‘equality’ has no unified meaning — or even is
devoid of meaning. (Rae 1981, p. 127 f., 132 f.)</p>

<p>

For this reason, it helps to think of the idea of equality or for
that matter inequality, understood as an issue of social justice, not
as a single principle, but as a complex group of principles forming the
basic core of today's egalitarianism. Depending on which procedural
principle one adopts, contrary answers are forthcoming. Both equality
and inequality are complex and multifaceted concepts (Temkin 1993,
chap. 2). In any real historical context, it is clear that no single
notion of equality can sweep the field. (Rae 1981, p. 132) Many
egalitarians concede that much of our discussion of the concept is
vague and theoretical. But they believe that there is also a common
underlying strain of important moral concerns implicit in it (Williams
1973). Above all it serves to remind us of our common humanity, despite
various differences (cf. 2.3. below). In this sense, egalitarians tend
to think of egalitarianism as a single coherent normative doctrine —
but one in any case embracing a variety of principles. Following the
introduction of different principles and theories of equality, I will
return in the last section of this article to the question how best to
define egalitarianism and the value of equality.</p>

<h2><a name="PriEquJus">2. Principles of Equality and Justice</a></h2>

<p>

Equality in its prescriptive usage has, of course, a close connection
with morality and justice in general and distributive justice in
particular. From antiquity onward, equality has been considered a
constitutive feature of justice. (On the history of the concept, cf.
Albernethy 1959, Benn 1967, Brown 1988, Dann 1975, Thomson 1949.)
Throughout history, people and emancipatory movements use the language
of justice to pillory certain inequalities. But what exactly is the
connection between equality and justice, i.e., what kind of role does
equality play in a theory of justice? The role and correct account of
equality, understood as an issue of social justice, is itself a
difficult philosophical issue. To clarify this, philosophers have
defended a variety of principles and conceptions of equality, many of
which are mentioned in the following discussion. This section
introduces four well known principles of equality, ranging from highly
general and uncontroversial to more specific and controversial. The
next section reviews various conceptions of the ‘currency’
of equality. Different interpretations of the role of equality in a
theory of justice emerge according to which of the four following
principles and which measure has been adopted. </p>

<p>

Through its connection with justice, equality, like justice itself,
has different <em>justitianda</em>, i.e., objects the term
‘just’ or ‘equal’ or their opposites can be
applied to. These are mainly actions, persons, social institutions, and
circumstances (e.g. distributions). These objects of justice stand in
an internal connection and order that can here only be hinted at. The
predicates “just” or “unjust” are only applicable when
<em>voluntary</em> actions implying responsibility are in question.
Justice is hence primarily related to individual actions. Individual
persons are the primary bearer of responsibilities (ethical
individualism). Persons have to take responsibility for their
individual actions and for circumstances they could change through such
actions or omissions. Although people have responsibility for both
their actions and circumstances, there is a moral difference between
the two <em>justitianda</em>, i.e., an injustice due to unjust
treatment through an individual or collective action and an injustice
due to a failure to correct unjust circumstances (cf. 3.1.v. below).
The responsibility people have to treat individuals and groups they
affect in a morally appropriate and, in particular, even-handed way has
hence a certain priority over their moral duty to turn circumstances
into just ones through some kind of equalization. Establishing justice
of circumstances (ubiquitously and simultaneously) is beyond any given
individual's capacities. Hence one has to rely on collective actions.
In order to meet this moral duty, a basic order guaranteeing just
circumstances must be justly created. This is an essential argument of
justice in favor of establishing social institutions and fundamental
state structures for political communities; with the help of such
institutions and structures, individuals can collectively fulfill their
responsibility in the best possible manner. If circumstances can be
rightly judged to be unjust, all persons have the responsibility and
moral duty, both individually and collectively, to change the pertinent
circumstances or distributive schemes into just ones. In the following
sections, the objects of equality may vary from topic to topic.
However, as indicated, there is a close relationship between the
objects. The next three principles of equality hold generally and
primarily for all actions and treatment of others and for resulting
circumstances. From the fourth principle onward, i.e., starting with
the presumption of equality, this article is mainly concerned with
distributive justice and the evaluation of distribution.</p>

<h3><a name="ForEqu">2.1 Formal Equality</a></h3>

<p>

When two persons have equal status in at least one normatively relevant
respect, they must be treated equally with regard to this respect.This
is the generally accepted <em>formal</em> equality principle that
Aristotle formulated in reference to Plato: “treat like cases as like”
(Aristotle, <em>Nicomachean Ethics</em>, V.3. 1131a10-b15;
<em>Politics</em>, III.9.1280 a8-15, III. 12. 1282b18-23). Of course
the crucial question is which respects are normatively relevant and
which are not. Some authors see this formal principle of equality as a
specific application of a rule of rationality: it is irrational,
because inconsistent, to treat equal cases unequally without sufficient
reasons (Berlin 1955-56). But most authors instead stress that what is
here at stake is a moral principle of justice, basically corresponding
with acknowledgment of the impartial and universalizable nature of
moral judgments. Namely, the postulate of formal equality demands more
than consistency with one's subjective preferences. What is more
important is possible justification vis-à-vis others of the
equal or unequal treatment in question — and this on the sole basis of
a situation's objective features. </p>

<h3><a name="ProEqu">2.2 Proportional Equality</a></h3>

<p>

According to Aristotle, there are two kinds of equality, numerical and
proportional (Aristotle, <em>Nicomachean Ethics</em>, 1130b-1132b; cf.
Plato, <em>Laws</em>, VI.757b-c). A form of treatment of others or as a
result of it a distribution is equal <em>numerically</em> when it
treats all persons as indistinguishable, thus treating them identically
or granting them the same quantity of a good per capita. That is not
always just. In contrast, a form of treatment of others or distribution
is <em>proportional</em> or relatively equal when it treats all
relevant persons in relation to their due. Just <em>numerical</em>
equality is a special case of proportional equality. Numerical equality
is only just under special circumstances, viz. when persons are equal
in the relevant respects so that the relevant proportions are equal.
Proportional equality further specifies formal equality; it is the more
precise and detailed, hence actually the more comprehensive formulation
of formal equality. It indicates what produces an adequate equality. </p>

<p>

Proportional equality in the treatment and distribution of goods to
persons involves at least the following concepts or variables: Two or
more persons (<em>P</em><sub><font size="-1">1</font></sub>,
<em>P</em><sub><font size="-1">2</font></sub>) and two or more
allocations of goods to persons (<em>G</em>) and <em>X</em> and
<em>Y</em> as the quantity in which individuals have the relevant
normative quality <em>E</em>. This can be represented as an equation
with fractions or as a ratio. If
 <em>P</em><sub><font size="-1">1</font></sub>
 has <em>E</em> in the amount of <em>X</em> and if
 <em>P</em><sub><font size="-1">2</font></sub>
 has <em>E</em> in the amount <em>Y</em>, then
 <em>P</em><font size="-1">1</font>
 is due <em>G</em> in the amount of <em>X</em>′ and
 <em>P</em><sub><font size="-1">2</font></sub>
 is due <em>G</em> in the amount of <em>Y</em>′, so that the
ratio <em>X</em>/<em>Y</em> = <em>X</em>′/<em>Y</em>′ is
valid. (N.B. For the formula to be usable, the potentially great
variety of factors involved have to be both quantifiable in principle
and commensurable, i.e., capable of synthesis into an aggregate
value.)</p>

<p>

When factors speak for unequal treatment or distribution, because
the persons are unequal in relevant respects, the treatment or
distribution proportional to these factors is just. Unequal claims to
treatment or distribution must be considered proportionally: that is
the prerequisite for persons being considered equally.</p>

<p>

This principle can also be incorporated into hierarchical,
inegalitarian theories. It indicates that equal output is demanded
with equal input. Aristocrats, perfectionists, and meritocrats all
believe that persons should be assessed according to their differing
deserts, understood by them in the broad sense of fulfillment of some
relevant criterion. And they believe that reward and punishment,
benefits and burdens, should be proportional to such deserts. Since
this definition leaves open who is due what, there can be great
inequality when it comes to presumed fundamental (natural) rights,
deserts, and worth — and such inequality is apparent in both
Plato and Aristotle.</p>

<p>

Aristotle's idea of justice as proportional equality contains a
fundamental insight. The idea offers a framework for a rational
argument between egalitarian and non-egalitarian ideas of justice, its
focal point being the question of the basis for an adequate equality
(Hinsch 2003). Both sides accept justice as proportional
equality. Aristotle's analysis makes clear that the argument involves
the features deciding whether two persons are to be considered equal or
unequal in a distributive context.</p>

<p>

On the formal level of pure conceptual explication, justice and
equality are linked through these principles of formal and proportional
justice. Justice cannot be explained without these equality principles;
the equality principles only receive their normative significance in
their role as principles of justice.</p>

<p>

Formal and proportional equality is simply a conceptual schema. It
needs to be made precise — i.e., its open variables need to be
filled out. The formal postulate remains quite empty as long as it
remains unclear when or through what features two or more persons or
cases should be considered equal. All debates over the proper
conception of justice, i.e., over who is due what, can be understood
as controversies over the question of which cases are equal and which
unequal (Aristotle, <em>Politics</em>, 1282b 22). For this reason
equality theorists are correct in stressing that the claim that
persons are owed equality becomes informative only when one is told
— what <em>kind</em> of equality they are owed (Nagel 1979; Rae
1981; Sen 1992, p. 13). Actually, every normative theory implies a
certain notion of equality. In order to outline their position,
egalitarians must thus take account of a specific (egalitarian)
conception of equality. To do so, they need to identify substantive
principles of equality, discussed below.</p>

<h3><a name="MorEqu">2.3 Moral Equality</a></h3>

Until the eighteenth century, it was assumed that human beings are
unequal by nature — i.e., that there was a natural human
hierarchy.  This postulate collapsed with the advent of the idea of
natural right and its assumption of an equality of natural order among
all human beings. Against Plato and Aristotle, the classical formula
for justice according to which an action is just when it offers each
individual his or her due took on a substantively egalitarian meaning
in the course of time, viz. everyone deserved the same dignity and the
same respect.  This is now the widely held conception of substantive,
universal, moral equality. It developed among the Stoics, who
emphasized the natural equality of all rational beings, and in early
New Testament Christianity, which elevated the equality of human
beings before God to a principle: one to be sure not always adhered to
later by the Christian church. This important idea was also taken up
both in the Talmud and in Islam, where it was grounded in both Greek
and Hebraic elements in both systems. In the modern period, starting
in the seventeenth century, the dominant idea was of natural equality
in the tradition of natural law and social contract theory. Hobbes
(1651) postulated that in their natural condition, individuals possess
equal rights, because over time they have the same capacity to do each
other harm. Locke (1690) argued that all human beings have the same
natural right to both (self-)ownership and freedom. Rousseau (1755)
declared social inequality to be a virtually primeval decline of the
human race from natural equality in a harmonious state of nature: a
decline catalyzed by the human urge for perfection, property and
possessions (Dahrendorf 1962). For Rousseau (1755, 1762), the
resulting inequality and rule of violence can only be overcome by
tying unfettered subjectivity to a common civil existence and popular
sovereignty. In Kant's moral philosophy (1785), the categorical
imperative formulates the equality postulate of universal human
worth. His transcendental and philosophical reflections on autonomy
and self-legislation lead to a recognition of the same freedom for all
rational beings as the sole principle of human rights (Kant 1797,
p. 230). Such Enlightenment ideas stimulated the great modern social
movements and revolutions, and were taken up in modern constitutions
and declarations of human rights.  During the French Revolution,
equality — along with freedom and fraternity — became a
basis of the <em>Déclaration des droits de l´homme et du
citoyen</em> of 1789.</p>

<p>

The principle of equal dignity and respect is now accepted as a
minimum standard throughout mainstream Western culture. Some
misunderstandings regarding moral equality need to be clarified. To say
that men are equal is not to say they are identical. The postulate of
equality implies that underneath apparent differences, certain
recognizable entities or units exist that, by dint of being units, can
be said to be ‘equal.’ (Thomson 1949, p. 4). Fundamental
equality means that persons are alike in important relevant and
specified respects alone, and not that they are all generally the same
or can be treated in the same way (Nagel 1991). In a now commonly posed
distinction, stemming from Dworkin (1977, p. 370), moral equality can
be understood as prescribing treatment of persons as equals, i.e., with
equal concern and respect, and not the often implausible principle of
treating persons equally. This fundamental idea of equal respect for
all persons and of the equal worth or equal dignity of all human beings
(Vlastos 1962) is accepted as a minimal standard by all leading schools
of modern Western political and moral culture. Any political theory
abandoning this notion of equality will not be found plausible today.
In a period in which metaphysical, religious and traditional views have
lost their general plausibility (Habermas 1983, p. 53, 1992, pp.
39-44), it appears impossible to peacefully reach a general agreement
on common political aims without accepting that persons must be treated
as equals. As a result, moral equality constitutes the
‘egalitarian plateau’ for all contemporary political
theories (Kymlicka 1990, p.5). To recognize that human beings are all
equally individual does not mean having to treat them uniformly in any
respects other than those in which they clearly have a moral claim to
be treated alike. Disputes arise, of course, concerning what these
claims amount to and how they should be resolved. That is the crux of
the problem to which I now turn.</p>

<p>

Since “treatment as an equal” is a shared moral standard in
contemporary theory, present-day philosophical debates are concerned
with the kind of equal treatment normatively required when we mutually
consider ourselves persons with equal dignity. The principle of moral
equality is too abstract and needs to be made concrete if we are to
arrive at a clear moral standard. Nevertheless, no conception of just
equality can be deduced from the notion of moral equality. Rather, we
find competing philosophical conceptions of equal treatment serving as
interpretations of moral equality. These need to be assessed according
to their degree of fidelity to the deeper ideal of moral equality
(Kymlicka 1990, p. 44). With this we finally switch the object of
equality from treatment to the fair distribution of goods and ills or
bads.</p>

<h3><a name="PreEqu">2.4 Presumption of Equality</a></h3>

<p>

Many conceptions of equality operate along procedural lines involving a
<em>presumption of equality</em>. While more materially concrete,
ethical approaches, as described in the next section below, are
concerned with distributive criteria; the presumption of equality, in
contrast, is a formal, procedural principle of construction located on
a higher formal and argumentative level. What is here at stake is the
question of the principle with which a material conception of justice
should be constructed — particularly once the above-described
approaches turn out inadequate. The presumption of equality is a prima
facie principle of equal distribution for all goods politically suited
for the process of public distribution. In the domain of political
justice, all members of a given community, taken together as a
collective body, have to decide centrally on the fair distribution of
social goods, as well as on the distribution's fair realization. Any
claim to a particular distribution, including any existing distributive
scheme, has to be impartially justified, i.e., no ownership will be
recognized without justification. Applied to this political domain, the
presumption of equality requires that everyone, regardless of
differences, should get an equal share in the distribution unless
certain types of differences are relevant and justify, through
universally acceptable reasons, unequal distribution. (With different
terms and arguments, this principle is conceived as a presumption by
Benn &amp; Peters (1959, 111) and by Bedau (1967, 19); as a relevant
reasons approach by Williams (1973); as a conception of symmetry by.
Tugendhat (1993, 374; 1997, chap. 3); as default option by Hinsch
(2003); for criticism of the presumption of equality, cf.
Westen (1990, chap. 10).) This presumption results in a principle of
prima facie equal distribution for all distributable goods. A strict
principle of equal distribution is not required, but it is morally
necessary to justify impartially any unequal distribution. The burden
of proof lies on the side of those who favor any form of unequal
distribution. </p>

<p>

The presumption in favor of equality can be justified by the
principle of equal respect together with the requirement of universal
and reciprocal justification; that requirement is linked to the
morality of equal respect granting each individual equal consideration
in every justification and distribution. Every sort of public,
political distribution is, in this view, to be justified to all
relevantly concerned persons, such that they could in principle agree.
Since it is immoral to force someone to do something of which he or she
does not approve, only reasons acceptable to the other person can give
one the moral right to treat the person in accordance with these
reasons. The impartial justification of norms rests on the reciprocity
and universality of the reasons. Universal norms and rights enforced
through inner or external sanctions are morally justified only if, on
the one hand, they can be reciprocally justified, i.e., if one person
asks no more of the other than what he or she is willing to give
(reciprocity), and if, on the other hand, they are justified with
respect to the interests of all concerned parties, i.e., if everyone
has good reasons for accepting them and no one has a good reason for
rejecting them (universality) (Forst 1994, p. 68, Scanlon 1998). In the
end, only the concerned parties can themselves formulate and advocate
their (true) interests. Equal respect, which we reciprocally owe to one
another, thus requires respect for the autonomous decisions of each
non-interchangeable individual (Wingert 1993, p. 90-96). This
procedural approach to moral legitimation sees the autonomy of the
individual as the standard of justification for universal rules, norms,
rights etc. Only those rules can be considered legitimate to which all
concerned parties can freely agree on the basis of universal,
discursively applicable, commonly shared reasons. Equal consideration
is thus accorded to all persons and their interests. In a public
distribution anyone who claims more owes all others an adequate
universal and reciprocal justification. If this cannot be provided,
i.e., if there is no reason for unequal distribution that can be
universally and reciprocally recognized by all (since, lets assume, all
are by and large equally productive and needy), then equal distribution
is the only legitimate distribution. How could it be otherwise? Any
unequal distribution would mean that someone receives less, and another
more. Whoever receives less can justifiably demand a reason for he or
she being disadvantaged. Yet there is <em>ex hyphothesi</em> no such
justification. Hence, any unequal distribution is illegitimate in this
case. If no convincing reasons for unequal distribution can be brought
forward, there remains only the option of equal distribution. Equal
distribution is therefore not merely one among many alternatives, but
rather the inevitable starting point that must be assumed insofar as
one takes the justificatory claims of all to be of equal weight.</p>

<p>

The presumption of equality provides an elegant procedure for
constructing a theory of distributive justice. The following questions
would have to be answered in order to arrive at a substantial and full
principle of justice.</p>

<ul>
<li>What goods and burdens are to be justly distributed (or should be
distributed)? Which social goods comprise the object of distributive
justice?</li>

<li>What are the spheres (of justice) into which these resources have
to be grouped?</li>

<li>Who are the recipients of distribution? Who has a prima facie claim
to a fair share?</li>

<li>What are the commonly cited yet in reality unjustified exceptions
to equal distribution?</li>

<li>Which inequalities are justified?</li>

<li>Which approach, conception or theory of egalitarian distributive
justice is therefore the best?</li>
</ul>

<p>

What goods and burdens are to be justly distributed (or should be
distributed)? There are various opinions as to which social goods
comprise the object of distributive justice. Does distributive justice
apply only to those goods commonly produced, i.e., through social and
economic fair cooperation, or to other goods as well, e.g. natural
resources, that are not the result of common cooperation? (At present,
the former approach is most apparent in Rawls (1971) and many of his
adherents and critics follow Rawls in this respect.) </p>

<p>

In the domain of public political distribution, the goods and
burdens to be distributed may be divided into various categories. Such
a division is essential because reasons that speak for unequal
treatment in one area do not justify unequal treatment in another. What
are the spheres (of justice) into which these resources have to be
grouped? In order to reconstruct our understanding of contemporary
liberal, democratic welfare states, four categories seem essential: 1.
civil liberties, 2. opportunities for political participation, 3.
social positions and opportunities, 4. economic rewards. Despite views
to the contrary, liberties and opportunities are seen in this view as
objects of distribution. For all four categories, the presumption of
equality is the guiding principle. The results of applying the
presumption to each category can then be codified as rights.</p>

<p>

After dividing social goods into categories, we must next ask what
can justify unequal treatment or unequal distribution in each category.
Today the following postulates of equality are generally considered
morally required.</p>

<p>

Strict equality is called for in the legal sphere of civil freedoms,
since — putting aside limitation on freedom as punishment
— there is no justification for any exceptions. As follows from
the principle of formal equality, all citizens of a society must have
equal general rights and duties. These rights and duties have to be
grounded in general laws applying to everyone. This is the postulate
of legal equality. In addition, the postulate of equal freedom is
equally valid: every person should have the same freedom to structure
his or her life, and this in the most far-reaching manner possible in
a peaceful and appropriate social order.</p>

<p>

In the political sphere, the possibilities for political participation
should be equally distributed. All citizens have the same claim to
participation in forming public opinion, and in the distribution,
control, and exercise of political power. This is the postulate
— requiring equal opportunity — of equal political power
sharing. To ensure equal opportunity, social institutions have to be
designed in such a way that persons who are disadvantaged, e.g. have a
stutter or a low income, have an equal chance to make their views
known and to participate fully in the democratic process.</p>

<p>

In the social sphere, social positions, equally gifted and motivated
citizens must have approximately the same chances at offices and
positions, independent of their economic or social class and native
endowments. This is the postulate of fair equality of social
opportunity. An unequal outcome has to result from equality of chances
at a position, i.e., qualifications alone counting, not social
background or influences of milieu.</p>

<p>

Since the nineteenth century, the political debate has increasingly
centered on the question of economic and social inequality (this
running alongside the question of — gradually achieved —
equal rights to freedom and political participation) (Marshall
1950). The main controversy here is whether, and if so to what extent,
the state should establish far-reaching equality of social conditions
for all through political measures such as redistribution of income
and property, tax reform, a more equal educational system, social
insurance, and positive discrimination.</p>

<p>

The equality required in the economic sphere is complex, taking
account of several positions that — each according to the
presumption of equality — justify a turn away from equality. A
salient problem here is what constitutes justified exceptions to equal
distribution of goods — the main subfield in the debate over
adequate conceptions of distributive equality and its currency. The
following sorts of factors are usually considered eligible for
justified unequal treatment: (a) need or differing natural
disadvantages (e.g. disabilities); (b) existing rights or claims
(e.g. private property); (c) differences in the performance of special
services (e.g. desert, efforts, or sacrifices); (d) efficiency; and
(e) compensation for direct and indirect or structural discrimination
(e.g. affirmative action).</p>

<p>

These factors play an essential, albeit varied, role in the
following alternative egalitarian theories of distributive justice. The
following theories offer different accounts of what should be equalized
in the economic sphere. Most can be understood as applications of the
presumption of equality (whether they explicitly acknowledge it or
not); only a few (like strict equality, libertarianism, and
sufficiency) are alternatives to the presumption.</p>

<h2><a name="ConDisEquEquWha">3. Conceptions of Distributive Equality: Equality of What?</a></h2>

<p>

Every effort to interpret the concept of equality and to apply the
principles of equality mentioned above demands a precise measure of the
parameters of equality. We need to know the dimensions within which the
striving for equality is morally relevant. What follows is a brief
review of the seven most prominent conceptions of distributive
equality, each offering a different answer to one question: in the
field of distributive justice, what should be equalized, or what should
be the parameter or “currency” of equality? </p>

<h3><a name="SimEquObjEquGen">3.1 Simple Equality and Objections to Equality in General</a></h3>

<em>Simple</em> equality, meaning everyone being furnished with the
same material level of goods and services, represents a strict position
as far as distributive justice is concerned. It is generally rejected
as untenable. 

<p>

Hence with the possible exception of Barbeuf (1796), no prominent
author or movement has demanded strict equality. Since egalitarianism
has come to be widely associated with the demand for economic
equality, and this in turn with communistic or socialistic ideas, it
is important to stress that neither communism nor socialism —
despite their protest against poverty and exploitation and their
demand for social security for all citizens — calls for absolute
economic equality. The orthodox Marxist view of economic equality was
expounded in the <em>Critique of the Gotha Program</em> (1875). Marx
here rejects the idea of legal equality, on three grounds. In the
first place, he indicates, equality draws on a merely limited number
of morally relevant vantages and neglects others, thus having unequal
effects; right can never be higher than the economic structure and
cultural development of the society it conditions. In the second
place, theories of justice have concentrated excessively on
distribution instead of the basic questions of production. In the
third place, a future communist society needs no law and no justice,
since social conflicts will have vanished.</p>

<p>

As an idea, <em>simple</em> equality fails because of problems that
are raised in regards to equality in general. It is useful to review
these problems, as they require resolution in any plausible approach to
equality.</p>

<blockquote>(i) We need adequate indices for the measurement of the
equality of the goods to be distributed. Through what concepts should
equality and inequality be understood? It is thus clear that equality
of material goods can lead to unequal satisfaction. Money constitutes a
usual-index — although an inadequate one; at the very least, equal
opportunity has to be conceived in other terms. 

<p>

(ii) The time span needs to be indicated for realizing the desired
model of equal distribution (McKerlie 1989, Sikora 1989). Should we
seek to equalize the goods in question over complete individual
lifetimes, or should we seek to ensure that various life segments are
as equally well off as possible?</p>

<p>

(iii) Equality distorts incentives promoting achievement in the
economic field, producing an inefficiency grounded in a waste of
assets arising from the administrative costs of redistribution (Okun
1975).  Equality and efficiency need to be placed in a balanced
relation.  Often, pareto-optimality is demanded in this respect
— for the most part by economists. A social condition is
pareto-optimal or pareto-efficient when it is not possible to shift to
another condition judged better by at least one person and worse by
none (Sen 1970, chap.  2, 2*). A widely discussed alternative to the
Pareto principle is the Kaldor-Hicks welfare criterion. This
stipulates that a rise in social welfare is always present when the
benefits accruing through the distribution of value in a society
exceed the corresponding costs. A change thus becomes desirable when
the winners in such a change could compensate the losers for their
losses and still retain a substantial profit. In contrast to the
Pareto-criterion, the Kaldor-Hicks criterion contains a compensation
rule (Kaldor 1939). For purposes of economic analysis, such
theoretical models of optimal efficiency make a great deal of
sense. However, the analysis is always made relative to starting
situation that can be unjust and unequal. A society can thus be (close
to) pareto-optimality — i.e., no one can increase his or her
material goods or freedoms without diminishing those of someone else
— while also displaying enormous inequalities in the
distribution of the same goods and freedoms. For this reason,
egalitarians claim that it may be necessary to reduce
pareto-optimality for the sake of justice if there is no more
egalitarian distribution that is also pareto-optimal.  In the eyes of
their critics, equality of whatever kind should not lead to some
people having to do with less even though this equalizing down does
not benefit any of those who are in a worse position.</p>

<p>

(iv) <em>Moral objections</em>: A strict and mechanical equal
distribution between all individuals does not sufficiently take into
account the differences among individuals and their situations. In
essence, since individuals desire different things, why should everyone
receive the same? Intuitively, for example, we can recognize that a
sick person has other claims than a healthy person, and furnishing each
with the same things would be mistaken. With simple equality, personal
freedoms are unacceptably limited and distinctive individual qualities
insufficiently regarded; in this manner they are in fact unequally
regarded. Furthermore, persons not only have a moral right to their own
needs being considered, but a right and a duty to take responsibility
for their own decisions and their consequences.</p>

<p>

Working against the identification of distributive justice with
simple equality, a basic postulate of virtually all present-day
egalitarians is as follows: human beings are themselves responsible for
certain inequalities resulting from their free decisions; aside from
minimum aid in emergencies, they deserve no recompense for such
inequalities. On the other hand, they are due compensation for
inequalities that are not the result of self-chosen options. For
egalitarians, the world is morally better when <em>equality of life
conditions</em> prevail. This is an amorphous ideal demanding further
clarification. Why is such equality an ideal, and equality of what,
precisely?</p>

<p>

By the same token, most egalitarians presently do not advocate an
equality of outcome, but different kinds of equality of opportunity,
due to their emphasis on a pair of morally central points: firstly,
that individuals have responsibility for their decisions; and secondly,
that the only things to be considered objects of equality are things
serving the real interests of individuals. The opportunities to be
equalized between people can be opportunities for well-being (i.e.
objective welfare), or for preference satisfaction (i.e., subjective
welfare), or for resources. It is not equality of objective or
subjective well-being or resources themselves that should be equalized,
but an equal opportunity to gain the well-being or resources one
aspires to. Such equality of opportunity (to well-being or resources)
depends on the presence of a realm of options for each individual equal
to the options enjoyed by all other persons, in the sense of the same
prospects for fulfillment of preferences or the possession of
resources. The opportunity must consist of possibilities one can really
take advantage of. Equal opportunity prevails when human beings
effectively enjoy equal realms of possibility.</p>

<p>

(v) Simple equality is very often associated with equality of
results (although these are two distinct concepts). However, to strive
only for equality of results is problematic. To illustrate the point,
let us briefly limit the discussion to a single action and the event or
state of affairs resulting from it. Arguably, actions should not be
judged solely by the moral quality of their results as important as
this may be. One also has to take into consideration the way in which
the events or circumstances to be evaluated have come about. Generally
speaking, a moral judgement requires not only the assessment of the
results of the action in question (the consequentialist aspect) but,
first and foremost, the assessment of the intention of the actor (the
deontological aspect). The source and its moral quality influence the
moral judgement of the results (Pogge 1999, sect. V). For example, if
you strike me, your blow will hurt me; the pain I feel may be
considered bad in itself, but the moral status of your blow will also
depend on whether you were (morally) allowed such a gesture (perhaps
through parental status, although that is controversial) or even
obliged to execute it (e.g. as a police officer preventing me from
doing harm to others), or whether it was in fact prohibited but not
prevented. What is true of individual actions (or their omission) has
to be true <em>mutatis mutandis</em> of social institutions and
circumstances like distributions resulting from collective social
actions (or their omission). Hence social institutions are to be
assessed not solely on the basis of information about how they affect
individual quality of life. A society in which people starve on the
streets is certainly marked by inequality; nevertheless, its moral
quality, i.e., whether the society is just or unjust with regard to
this problem, also depends on the suffering's causes. Does the society
allow starvation as an unintended but tolerable side effect of what its
members see as a just distributive scheme? Indeed, does it even defend
the suffering as a necessary means, e.g. as a sort of Social Darwinism?
Or has the society taken measures against starvation which have turned
out insufficient? In the latter case, whether the society has taken
such steps for reasons of political morality or efficiency again makes
a moral difference. Hence even for egalitarians, equality of results is
too narrow and one-sided a focus.</p>

<p>

(vi) Finally, there is a danger of (strict) equality leading to
uniformity, rather than to a respect for pluralism and democracy (Cohen
1989; Arneson 1993). In the contemporary debate, this complaint has
been mainly articulated in feminist and multiculturalist theory. A
central tenet of feminist theory is that gender has been and remains a
historical variable and internally differentiated relation of
domination. The same holds for so called racial and ethnic differences.
These differences are often still conceived of as marking different
values. The different groups involved here rightly object to their
discrimination, marginalization, and domination, and an appeal to
equality of status thus seems a solution. However as feminists and
multiculturalists have pointed out, equality, as usually understood and
practiced, is constituted in part by a denial and ranking of
differences; as a result it seems less useful as an antidote to
relations of domination. “Equality” can often mean the assimilation to
a pre-existing and problematic ‘male’ or
‘white’ or ‘middle class’ norm. In short,
domination and a fortiori inequality often arises out of an inability
to appreciate and nurture differences — not out of a failure to see
everyone as the same. To recognize these differences should however not
lead to an essentialism grounded in sexual or cultural characteristics.
In contemporary multiculturalism and feminism, there is a crucial
debate between those who insist that sexual, racial, and ethnic
differences should become irrelevant, on the one hand, and those
believing that such differences, even though culturally relevant,
should not furnish a basis for inequality: that rather one should find
mechanisms for securing equality, despite valued differences. Neither
of these strategies involves rejecting equality. Rather, the dispute is
about how equality is to be attained (McKinnon 1989, Taylor 1992).</p>

<p>

Proposing a connection between equality and pluralism, Michael
Walzer's theory (1983) aims at what he calls “complex equality”.
According to Walzer, relevant reasons can only speak in favor of
distribution of specific types of goods in specific spheres —
not in several or all spheres. Against a theory of simple equality
promoting equal distribution of dominant goods, hence underestimating
the complexity of the criteria at work in each given sphere the
dominance of particular goods needs to be ended. For instance,
purchasing power in the political sphere through means derived from
the economic sphere (i.e., money) needs to be prevented. Actually,
Walzer's theory of complex equality is not aimed at equality but at
the separation of spheres of justice, the theory's designation thus
being misleading. Any theory of equality should however follow
Walzer's advice not to be monistic but recognize the complexity of
life and the plurality of criteria for justice.</p> </blockquote>

<p>

We thus arrive at the following desideratum: instead of <em>simple</em>
equality, we need a concept of more <em>complex</em> equality: a
concept managing to resolve the above problems through a distinction of
various classes of goods, a separation of spheres, and a
differentiation of relevant criteria. </p>

<h3><a name="Lib">3.2 Libertarianism</a></h3>

<em>Libertarianism</em> and <em>economic liberalism</em> represent
minimalist positions in relation to distributive justice. Citing Locke,
they both postulate an original right to freedom and property, thus
arguing against redistribution and social rights and for the free
market (Nozick 1974; Hayek 1960). They assert an opposition between
equality and freedom: the individual (natural) right to freedom can be
limited only for the sake of foreign and domestic peace. For this
reason, libertarians consider maintaining public order the state's only
legitimate duty. They assert a natural right to self-ownership (the
philosophical term for “ownership of oneself” — i.e., one's will,
body, work, etc.) that entitles everybody to thus far unowned bits of
the external world by means of mixing their labor with it. All
individuals can thus claim property if “enough and as good” is left
over for others (Locke's proviso). Correspondingly, they defend market
freedoms and oppose the use of redistributive taxation schemes for the
sake of social justice as equality. A principal objection to
libertarian theory is that its interpretation of the Lockean proviso —
nobody's situation should be worsened through an initial acquisition of
property — leads to an excessively weak requirement and is thus
unacceptable (Kymlicka 1990, pp.108-117). With a broader and more
adequate interpretation of what it means for one a situation to be
worse than another, however, justifying private appropriation and,
<em>a fortiori</em>, all further ownership rights, becomes much more
difficult. If the proviso recognizes the full range of interests and
alternatives that self-owners have, then it will not generate
unrestricted rights over unequal amounts of resources. Another
objection is that precisely if one's own free accomplishment is what is
meant to count, as the libertarians argue, success should not depend
strictly on luck, extraordinary natural gifts, inherited property, and
status. In other words, <em>equal opportunity</em> also needs to at
least be present as a counterbalance, ensuring that the fate of human
beings is determined by their decisions and not by unavoidable social
circumstances. Equal opportunity thus seems to be the frequently vague
minimal formula at work in every egalitarian conception of distributive
justice. Many egalitarians, however, wish for more — namely, an
<em>equality of (at least basic) life conditions</em>. 

<p>

In any event, with a shift away from a strictly negative idea of
freedom, economic liberalism can indeed itself point the way to more
social and economic equality. For with such a shift, what is at stake
is not only assuring an equal right to self-defense, but also
furnishing everyone more or less the same chance to actually make use
of the right to freedom (e.g. Van Parijs 1995, Steiner 1994). In other
words, certain basic goods need to be furnished to assure the equitable
or ‘fair value of the basic liberties’ (Rawls 1993, pp.
356-63).
<br />
  </p>

<h3><a name="Uti">3.3 Utilitarianism</a></h3>

<p>

It is possible to interpret utilitarianism as concretizing moral
equality — and this in a way meant to offer the same
consideration to the interests of all human beings (Kymlicka 1990,
pp. 31f., Hare 1981, p. 26, Sen 1992, pp. 13f.). From the utilitarian
perspective, since everyone counts as one and no one as more than one
(Bentham), the interests of all should be treated equally without
consideration of contents of interest or an individual's material
situation. For utilitarianism this means that all enlightened personal
interests have to be fairly aggregated. The morally proper action is
the one that maximizes utility (Hare 1984). But this utilitarian
conception of equal treatment has been criticized as inadequate by
many opponents of utilitarianism. At least in utilitarianism's
classical form — so the critique reads — the hoped for
moral equality is flawed: this because all desires are taken up by the
utilitarian calculation — including “selfish” and “external”
preferences (Dworkin 1977, p. 234), all having equal weight, even when
they diminish the ‘rights’ and intentions of others. And
this, of course, conflicts with our everyday understanding of equal
treatment. What is here at play is an argument involving “offensive”
and “expensive” taste: a person cannot expect others to sustain his or
her desires at the expense of their own (Kymlicka 1990,
p. 40 f.). Rather, according to generally shared conviction, equal
treatment consistently requires a basis of equal rights and resources
that cannot be taken away from one person, whatever the desire of
others. In line with Rawls (1971, pp. 31, 564, cf. 450), many hold
that justice entails according no value to interests insofar as they
conflict with justice. According to this view, unjustified preferences
will not distort mutual claims people have on each other. Equal
treatment has to consist of everyone being able to claim a fair
portion, and not in all interests having the same weight in disposal
over my portion. Utilitarians cannot admit any restrictions on
interests based on morals or justice. As long as utilitarian theory
lacks a concept of justice and fair allotment, it must fail in its
goal of treating all as equals. As Rawls (1971, pp.  27) also famously
argues, utilitarianism that involves neglecting the separateness of
persons does not contain a proper interpretation of moral equality as
equal respect for each individual.</p>

<h3><a name="EquWel">3.4 Equality of Welfare</a></h3>

<p>

The concept of welfare equality is motivated by an intuition that when
it comes to political ethics, what is at stake is the individual's
well-being. The central criterion for justice must consequently be
equalizing the level of welfare. But taking welfare as what is to be
equalized leads into major difficulties, which resemble those of
utilitarianism. If one contentiously identifies subjective welfare
with preference satisfaction, it seems implausible to count all
individual preferences as equal, some — such as the desire to do
others wrong — being inadmissible on grounds of justice (the
offensive taste argument). Any welfare-centered concept of equality
grants people with refined and expensive taste more resources —
something distinctly at odds with our moral intuitions (the expensive
taste argument) (Dworkin 1981a). However, satisfaction in the
fulfillment of desires cannot serve as a standard, since we wish for
more than a simple feeling of happiness. A more viable standard for
welfare comparisons would seem to be success in the fulfillment of
preferences. A fair evaluation of such success cannot be purely
subjective, rather requiring a standard of what should or could have
been achieved. And this itself involves an assumption regarding just
distribution; it is thus no independent criterion for justice. An
additional serious problem with any welfare-centered concept of
equality is that it cannot take account of either desert (Feinberg
1970) or personal responsibility for one's own well-being, to the
extent this is possible and reasonable.</p>

<h3><a name="EquofRes">3.5 Equality of Resources</a></h3>

<p>

Represented above all by both Rawls and Dworkin, resource equality
avoids such problems (Rawls 1971; Dworkin 1981b). It holds individuals
responsible for their decisions and actions, not, however, for
circumstances beyond their control — race, sex, and skin-color, but
also intelligence and social position — which thus are excluded as
distributive criteria. Equal opportunity is insufficient because it
does not compensate for unequal innate gifts. What applies for social
circumstances should also apply for such gifts, both these factors
being purely arbitrary from a moral point of view and requiring
adjustment. </p>

<p>

According to Rawls, human beings should have the same initial
expectations of “basic goods,” i.e., all-purpose goods; this in no way
precludes ending up with different quantities of such goods or
resources, as a result of personal economic decisions and actions. When
prime importance is accorded an assurance of equal basic freedoms and
rights, inequalities are just when they fulfill two provisos: on the
one hand, they have to be linked to offices and positions open to
everyone under conditions of fair equality of opportunity; on the other
hand, they have to reflect the famous ‘difference
principle’ in offering the greatest possible advantage to the
least advantaged members of society (Rawls 1993, p. 5 f.; 1971, §
13). Otherwise, the economic order requires revision. Due to the
argument of the moral arbitrariness of talents, the commonly accepted
criteria for merit (like productivity, working hours, effort) are
clearly relativized. The difference principle only allows the talented
to earn more to the extent this raises the lowest incomes. According to
Rawls, with regard to the basic structure of society, the difference
principle should be opted for under a self-chosen “veil of ignorance”
regarding personal and historical circumstances and similar factors:
the principle offers a general assurance of not totally succumbing to
the hazards of a free market situation; and everyone does better than
with inevitably inefficient total equal distribution, whose level of
well-being is below that of those worst off under the difference
principle.</p>

<p>

Since Rawls' <em>Theory of Justice</em> is the classical focal point
of present-day political philosophy, it is worth noting the different
ways his theory claims to be egalitarian: First, Rawls upholds a
natural basis for equal human worth: a minimal capacity for having a
conception of the good and a sense of justice. Second, through the
device of the “veil of ignorance,” people are conceived as equals in
the “original position.” Third, the idea of sharing this “original
position” presupposes the parties having political equality, as equal
participants in the process of choosing the principles by which they
would be governed. Fourth, Rawls proposes fair equality of opportunity.
Fifth, Rawls maintains that all desert must be institutionally defined,
depending on the goals of the society. No one deserves his or her
talents or circumstances — all products of the natural lottery.
Finally, the difference principle tends toward equalizing holdings.</p>

<p>

Dworkin's equality of resources (1981b) stakes a claim to being even
more ‘ambition-sensitive’ and endowment-insensitive’
than Rawls' theory. Unequal distribution of resources is considered
fair only when it results from the decisions and intentional actions of
those concerned. Dworkin proposes a hypothetical auction in which
everyone can accumulate bundles of resources through equal means of
payment, so that in the end no one is jealous of another's bundle (the
envy test). The auction-procedure also offers a way to precisely
measure equality of resources: the measure of resources devoted to a
person's life is defined by the importance of the resources to others
(Dworkin 1981b, p. 290). In the free market, how the distribution then
develops depends on an individual's ambitions. The inequalities that
thus emerge are justified, since one has to take responsibility for
one's “option luck” in the realm of personal responsibility. In
contrast, unjustified inequalities based on different innate provisions
and gifts as well as brute luck should be compensated for through a
fictive differentiated insurance system: its premiums are established
behind Dworkin's own ‘veil of ignorance,’ in order to then
be distributed in real life to everyone and collected in taxes. For
Dworkin, this is the key to the natural lottery being balanced fairly,
preventing an “slavery of the talented” through excessive
redistribution.</p>

<h3><a name="EquandResp">3.6 Equality and Responsibility</a></h3>

<p>

Only some egalitarians hold inequality to be bad per se. Most of
today's egalitarians are pluralistic, i.e. recognize other values
besides equality. Many egalitarians regard the moral significance of
choice and responsibility as one of the most important other values
besides equality. They hold that it is bad - unjust or unfair - for
some to be worse off than others through no fault or choice of their
own (Temkin 1993, 13) and therefore they strive to eliminate
involuntary disadvantages for which the sufferer cannot be held
responsible (Cohen 1989, 916).</p>

<p>
 The principle of responsibility provides a central normative vantage
point for deciding on what grounds one might justify which
inequality. The positive formulation of the responsibility principle
requires an assumption of personal responsibilty (Cf. especially
Dworkin 1981b, contra: Anderson 1999). Unequal shares of social goods
are thus fair if they result from the decisions and intentional
actions of those concerned. Persons are themselves responsible for
certain inequalities that result from their voluntary decisions; and
they deserve no compensation for such inequalities, aside from minimal
provisions in case of dire need (see below). As autonomous
individuals, we all, individually and subsidiarily, bear
responsibility both for the consequences of our actions and for
ameliorating unequal conditions. This corresponds to the conditions of
our shared life. Inversely, in its negative formulation the
responsibility principle signifies the following: inequalities that
are not the result of self-chosen options are to be rejected as
unjust; if a person has this kind of disadvantage, then there must be
compensation. What one can do nothing about or is not responsible for
cannot constitute a relevant criterion. Still, the initial assumption
remains an ascription of responsibility and each individual case
requires close scrutiny: one is responsible and accountable unless
there is an adequate reason for being considered otherwise. A process
of elimination reveals which individual differences should not justly
matter because they do not result from personal
responsibility. Advantages or disadvantages that are due to arbitrary
and unearned differences in social circumstances or natural endowments
are unfair. Socio-economic advantages and disadvantages that persons
can be expected to adopt because they are born into them must be
excluded. Widely shared intuitions of this sort lead to the demand for
fair equality of opportunity: people with the same abilities and the
same readiness to use them should have the same chances of success,
regardless of their initial social position. But choosing natural
features such as parentage, sex, skin color, height, and indeed innate
intelligence as a fundamental basis for distribution is itself unjust:
all these features have a discriminatory effect but have not been
deliberatly acquired and cannot be altered by the individual. The
reasons speaking for the exclusion of features like skin color,
height, sex and parentage as discriminatory apply equally to other
natural human qualities like intellegence, appearance, physical
strength, and so forth that are often chosen as criteria for
distribution. The kind and the extent of one's natural abilities are
due to a lottery of nature; considered from a moral standpoint their
distribution is purely arbitrary (Rawls 1971, 48). For this reason we
have good and readily perceptible reasons for rejecting the use of
such features as basic criteria for social distribution. Consequently
anything for which we are not responsible cannot be considered a
relevant ground for unequal distribution; and both natural endowment
and social position are excluded, constituting irrelevant grounds for
exeption. Just distribution must be simultaneously insensitive to
endowment and sensitive to responsibility. Natural and social
endowment must not count, personal intentions and voluntary decisions
should count. Thus, a given social order is just when it equalizes as
much as possible, and in a normatively plausible way, all personal
disadvantages for which the person is not responsible; and when it at
the same time accords individuals the capacity to bear the
consequences of their decisions and actions, in accordance with their
capacity for autonomy. Every advantage that cannot be justified needs
to be equalized, as well as every disadvantage not due to personal
choice and responsibility.</p>

<p>
 Objections to all versions of “brute-luck egalitarianism” come from
two sides. Some authors criticize its in their view unjustified or
excessively radical rejection of merit: The egalitarian thesis of
desert only being justifiably acknowledged if it involves desert “all
the way down” (Nozick 1974, p. 225) not only destroys the classical,
everyday principle of desert, since everything has a basis that we
ourselves have not created. In the eyes of such critics, along with
the merit-principle this argument also destroys our personal identity,
since we can no longer accredit ourselves with our own capacities and
accomplishments. (Cf. the texts in Pojman &amp; McLeod 1998, Olsaretti
2003.) Other authors consider the criterion for responsibility to be
too strong, indeed inhuman in its consequences, since human beings
responsible for their own misery would (supposedly) be left alone with
their misery (Anderson 1999, also McLeod 1998, Scheffler 2003, Wolff
1998). However, pluralistic egalitarians should be able to argue that
there are special cases, in which people are so badly off that they
should be helped, even if they got into the miserable situation
through their own fault. But even when people are in terrible
situations that did not arise through their own fault ('bad brute
luck') — for instance when they are disabled from birth - and
egalitarians therefore have reasons to help them, these reasons are
supposedly stigmatizing, since in these cases the principles of
distribution would be based on pity. In these cases, political
institutions must take certain decisions — for example, in which
category a particular case of distress should be placed — and
must gather relevant information on their citizens. Against such a
procedure one could object that it subjects citizens to the tutelage
of the state and harms their private sphere (Anderson 1999, also Hayek
1960: 85-102).</p>

<h3><a name="EquOppForWelAdv">3.7 Equality of Opportunity for Welfare or Advantage</a></h3>

<p>

Approaches based on equality of opportunity can be read as revisions
of both welfarism and resourcism. Ranged against welfarism and
designed to avoid its pitfalls, they incorporate the powerful ideas of
choice and responsibility into various, improved forms of
egalitarianism. Such approaches are meant to equalize outcomes,
insofar as they are the consequences of causes beyond a person's
control (i.e., beyond circumstances or endowment), but to allow
differential outcomes in so far as they result from autonomous choice
or ambition. But the approaches are also aimed at maintaining the
insight that individual preferences have to count, as the sole basis
for a necessary linkage back to the individual perspective: otherwise,
there is an overlooking of the person's value. In Arneson's (1989,
1990) concept of <em>equal opportunity for welfare</em>, the
preferences determining the measure of individual well-being are meant
to be conceived hypothetically — i.e., a person would decide on
them after a process of ideal reflection. In order to correspond to
the morally central vantage of personal responsibility, what should be
equalized are not enlightened preferences themselves, but rather real
opportunities to achieve or receive a good, to the extent that it is
aspired to. G.A. Cohen's (1989, p. 916 f.) broader conception of
<em>equality of access to advantage</em> attempts to link and
integrate the perspectives of welfare equality and resource equality
through the overriding concept of advantage. For Cohen, there are two
grounds for egalitarian compensation. Egalitarians will be moved to
furnish a paralyzed person with a compensatory wheelchair
independently of the person's welfare level. This egalitarian response
to disability overrides equality of (opportunity to)
welfare. Egalitarians also favor compensation for phenomena such as
pain, independent of any loss of capacity — for instance by
paying for expensive medicine. But, Cohen claims, any justification
for such compensation has to invoke the idea of equality of
opportunity to welfare. He thus views both aspects, resources and
welfare, as necessary and irreducible. Much of Roemer's (1998) more
technical argument is devoted to constructing the scale to calibrate
the extent to which something is the result of circumstances. An
incurred adverse consequence is the result of circumstances, not
choice, precisely to the extent that it is a consequence that persons
of one or another specific type can be expected to incur.</p>

<h3><a name="CapApp">3.8 Capabilities Approaches</a></h3>

<p>

Theories that limit themselves to the equal distribution of basic
means — this in the hope of doing justice to the different goals
of all human beings — are often criticized as fetishistic, in
that they focus on means, rather than on what individuals gain with
these means (Sen 1980). For the value goods have for someone depends
on objective possibilities, the natural environment, and individual
capacities.  Hence in contrast to the resourcist approach, Amartya Sen
proposes orientating distribution around “capabilities to achieve
functionings,” i.e., the various things that a person manages to do or
be in leading a life (Sen 1992). In other words, evaluating individual
well-being has to be tied to a capability for achieving and
maintaining various precious conditions and “functionings”
constitutive of a person's being, such as adequate nourishment, good
health, the ability to move about freely or to appear in public
without shame, and so forth. Also important here is the real freedom
to acquire well-being — a freedom represented in the capability
to oneself choose forms of achievement and the combination of
“functionings.” For Sen, capabilities are thus the measure of an
<em>equality of capabilities</em> human beings enjoy to lead their
lives. A problem consistently raised with capability approaches is the
ability to weigh capabilities in order to arrive at a metric for
equality. The problem is intensified by the fact that various moral
perspectives are comprised in the concept of capability (Cohen 1993,
p. 17-26, Williams 1987). Martha Nussbaum (1992, 2000) has linked the
capability approach to an Aristotelian, essentialistic, “thick” theory
of the good — a theory meant to be, as she puts it, “vague,”
incomplete, and open-ended enough to leave place for individuality and
cultural variations. On the basis of such a “thick” conception of
necessary and universal elements of a good life, certain capabilities
and functionings can be designated as foundational. In this manner,
Nussbaum can endow the capability approach with a precision that
furnishes an index of interpersonal comparison, but at some risk: that
of not being neutral enough regarding the plurality of personal
conceptions of the good ? a neutrality normally required by most
liberals (most importantly Rawls 1993).</p>

<h2><a name="EquAmoWho">4. Equality Among Whom?</a></h2>

<p>

Justice is primarily related to individual actions. Individual persons
are the primary bearers of responsibility (the key principle of ethical
individualism). This raises two controversial issues in the
contemporary debate. </p>

<p>

One could regard the norms of distributive equality as applying to
groups rather than individuals. It is often groups that rightfully
raise the issue of an inequality between themselves and the rest of
society — e.g. women; so-called racial and ethnic groups. The
question arises of whether inequality among such groups should be
considered morally objectionable in itself, or whether even in the
case of groups, the underlying concern should be how individuals (as
members of such groups) fare in comparative terms. If we are worried
about inequalities among groups of individuals why does this worry not
translate into a worry about inequalities among members of the
group?</p>

<p>

A further question is whether the norms of distributive equality
(whatever they are) apply to all individuals, regardless of where (and
when) they live? Or rather, do they only hold for members of
communities within states and nations?  Most theories of equality deal
exclusively with distributive equality among people in a single
society. But there does not seem to be any rationale for that
limitation. Can the group of the entitled be restricted prior to the
examination of concrete claims? Many theories seem to imply this when
they connect distributive justice or the goods to be distributed with
social cooperation or production. For those who contribute nothing to
cooperation, such as the disabled, children, or future generations,
would have to be denied a claim to a fair share.  The circle of
persons who are to be the recipients of distribution would thus be
restricted from the outset. Other theories are less restrictive,
insofar as they do not link distribution to actual social
collaboration, yet nonetheless do restrict it, insofar as they bind it
to the status of citizenship. In this view, distributive justice is
limited to the individuals within a society. Those outside the
community have no entitlement to social justice. Unequal distribution
among states and the social situations of people outside the
particular society could not, in this view, be a problem of social
distributive justice (Nagel 2005). Yet here too, the universal
morality of equal respect and the principle of equal distribution
demand that we consider each person as prima facie equally entitled to
the goods, unless reasons for an unequal distribution can be put
forth. It may be that in the process of justification, reasons will
emerge for privileging those who were particularly involved in the
production of a good. But prima facie, there is no reason to exclude
from the outset other persons, e.g. those from other countries, from
the process of distribution and justification (Pogge 2002). That may
seem most intuitively plausible in the case of natural resources
(e.g. oil) that someone discovers by chance on or beneath the surface
of his or her property. Why should such resources belong to the person
who discovers them, or on whose property they are located?
Nevertheless, in the eyes of many if not most people, global justice,
i.e., extending distributive justice globally, demands too much from
individuals and their states (Miller 1998). The charge, open, of
course, to challenge, is one of excessive demands being
made. Alternatively, one might argue that there are other
‘special relationships’ among compatriots that do not
exist across national borders. This (controversial) thesis is
exemplified by nationalism, which may support a kind of local equality
(Miller 1995).</p>

<p>

Another issue concerns the relations among generations. Does the
present generation have an egalitarian obligation towards future
generations regarding equal living conditions? One argument in favor
of this view might be that people should not end up unequally well off
as a result of morally arbitrary factors. However, the issue of
justice among generations is notoriously complex (Temkin 1992).</p>

<h2><a name="ValEquWhyEqu">5. The Value of Equality: Why Equality?</a></h2>

<p>

Does equality play a major role in a theory of justice, and if so, what
is this role? </p>

<p>

A conception of justice is <em>egalitarian</em> when it views
equality as a fundamental goal of justice. L. Temkin has put it as
follows: “an egalitarian is any person who attaches <em>some</em> value
to equality <em>itself</em> (that is, any person that cares <em>at
all</em> about equality, over and above the extent it promotes other
ideals). So, equality needn't be the only value, or even the ideal she
values most....Egalitarians have the deep and (for them) compelling
view that it is a bad thing — unjust and unfair — for some to be
worse off than others through no fault of their own.” (Temkin 1986, p.
100, cf. 1993, p. 7). In general, the focus of the modern egalitarian
effort to realize equality is on the possibility of a good life, i.e.,
on an equality of life prospects and life circumstances — interpreted
in various ways according to various positions in the “equality of
what” debate (see above).</p>

<h3><a name="KinEga">5.1 Kinds of egalitarianism</a></h3>

<p>
 Three forms of egalitarianism can be found in the literature:
intrinsic, instrumental and constitutive. (For a two fold distinction,
cf. Parfit 1997, Temkin 1993, p. 11, McKerlie, 1996, p. 275.) </p>

<p>
 <em>Intrinsic</em> egalitarians view equality as an intrinsic good in
itself. As pure egalitarians, they are concerned solely with equality,
most of them with equality of social circumstances, according to which
it is intrinsically bad if some people are worse off than others
through no fault of their own. But it is in fact the case that we do
not always consider inequality a moral evil. Intrinsic egalitarians
regard equality as desirable even when the equalization would be of no
use to any of the affected parties — e.g. when equality can only
be produced through depressing the level of everyone's life. But
something can only have an intrinsic value when it is good for at
least one person, i.e., makes one life better in some way or
another. The following “<em>leveling-down</em>” <em>objection</em>
indicates that doing away with inequality in fact ought to produce
better circumstances — it otherwise being unclear why equality
should be desired. (For such an objection, cf.  Nozick 1974, p. 229,
Raz 1986, chap. 9, p. 227, 235, Temkin 1993, pp.  247-8.) Sometimes
inequality can only be ended by depriving those who are better off of
their resources, rendering them as poorly off as everyone else. (For
anyone looking for a drastic literary example, Kurt Vonnegut's
science-fiction story <em>Harrison Bergeron</em> (1950) is
recommended.) This would have to be an acceptable approach according
to the intrinsic concept. But would it be morally good if, in a group
consisting of both blind and seeing persons, those with sight were
rendered blind because the blind could not be offered sight? That
would in fact be morally perverse. Doing away with inequality by
bringing everyone down contains — so the objection —
nothing good. Such leveling-down objections would of course only be
valid if there were indeed no better and equally egalitarian
alternatives available; and nearly always there are such: e.g. those
who can see should have to help the blind, financially or
otherwise. In case there are no alternatives, in order to avoid such
objections, intrinsic egalitarianism cannot be strict, but needs to be
<em>pluralistic</em>.  Then intrinsic egalitarians could say there is
something good about the change, namely greater equality —
although they would concede that much is bad about it. Pluralistic
egalitarians do not have equality as their only goal; they also admit
other values and principles — above all the principle of
welfare, according to which it is better when people are doing
better. In addition, pluralistic egalitarianism should be
<em>moderate</em> enough to not always grant equality victory in the
case of conflict between equality and welfare. Instead, it needs to be
able to accept reductions in equality for the sake of a higher quality
of life for all (as e.g. with Rawls' difference principle).</p>

<p>

At present, many egalitarians are ready to concede that equality in
the sense of equality of life circumstances has no compelling value in
itself; but that, in a framework of liberal concepts of justice, its
meaning emerges in pursuit of other ideals: universal freedom, full
development of human capacities and the human personality, the
mitigation of suffering and defeat of domination and stigmatization,
the stable coherence of modern, freely constituted societies, and so
forth (Scanlon 1996). For those who are worse off, unequal
circumstances often mean considerable (relative) disadvantages and
many (absolute) evils; and as a rule these (relative) disadvantages
and (absolute) evils are the source for our moral condemnation of
unequal circumstances. But this does not mean that inequality as such
is an evil. Hence, the argument goes, fundamental moral ideals other
than equality stand behind our aspiring for equality. When we are
against inequality on such grounds, we are for equality either as a
byproduct or as a means and not as a goal or intrinsic value. In its
treatment of equality as a derived virtue, the sort of egalitarianism
— if the term is actually suitable — here at play is
<em>instrumental</em>.</p>

<p>

As indicated, there is also a third, more suitable approach to the
equality ideal: a <em>constitutive</em> egalitarianism. According to
this approach, we aspire to equality on other moral grounds —
namely, because certain inequalities are unjust. Equality has value,
but this is an extrinsic value, since it derives from another, higher
moral principle of equal dignity and respect. But it is not
instrumental for this reason, i.e., it is not only valued on account
of moral equality, but also on its own account. (For the distinction
between the origin of a value and the kind of value it is,
cf. Korsgaard 1996.) Equality stands in relation to justice as does a
part to a whole. The requirement of justification is based on moral
equality; and in certain contexts, successful justification leads to
the above-named principles of equality, i.e., formal, proportional
equality and the presumption of equality. Thus according to
constitutive egalitarianism, these principles and the resulting
equality are justified and required by justice, and by the same token
constitute social justice.</p>

<p>

We should further distinguish two levels of egalitarianism and
non-egalitarianism, respectively. On a first level, a constitutive
egalitarian presumes that every explication of the moral standpoint is
incomplete without terms such as ‘equal,’
‘similarly,’ etc. In contrast, a non-egalitarianism
operating on the same level considers such terms misplaced or
redundant. On a second level, when it comes to concretizing and
specifying conceptions of justice, a constitutive egalitarian gives
equality substantive weight. On this level, we can find more and less
egalitarian positions according to the chosen currency of equality (the
criteria by which just equality is measured) and according to the
reasons for unequal distributions (exemptions of the presumption of
equality) the respective theories regard as well grounded.
Egalitarianism on the second level thus relates to the kind, quality
and quantity of things to be equalized. Because of such variables, a
clear-cut definition of second level egalitarianism cannot be
formulated. In contrast, non-egalitarians on this second level advocate
a non-relational entitlement theory of justice.</p>

<h3><a name="EquVsPriSuf">5.2 Equality vs. Priority or Sufficiency</a></h3>

<p>
 Alongside the often-raised objections against equality mentioned in
the section on “simple equality” there is a different and more
fundamental critique formulated by first level non-egalitarians: that
equality does not have a foundational role in the grounding of claims
to justice. While the older version of a critique of egalitarianism
comes mainly from a the right side of the political spectrum, thus
arguing in general against “patterned principles of justice” (Nozick
1974, esp. pp. 156-157), the critique's newer version also often can
be heard in liberal circles (Walzer 1983, Raz 1986, chap. 9, Frankfurt
1987. 1997, Parfit 1997, Anderson 1999). This first-level critique of
equality poses the basic question of why justice should in fact be
conceived relationally and (what is here the same) comparatively.
Referring back to Joel Feinberg's (1974) distinction between
comparative and non-comparative justice, non-egalitarians object to
the moral requirement to treat people as equals and many demands for
justice emerging from it. They argue that neither the postulate nor
these demands involve comparative principles — let alone any
equality principles. They reproach first-level egalitarians for a
confusion between “equality” and “universals.” As the non-egalitarians
see things, within many principles of justice — at least the
especially important ones — the equality-terminology is
redundant. Equality is thus merely a byproduct of the general
fulfillment of actually non-comparative standards of justice:
something obscured through the unnecessary inserting of an expression
of equality (Raz 1986, p.  227f.). At least the central standards of
dignified human life are not relational but “absolute.” As Harry
Frankfurt puts it: “It is whether people have good lives, and not how
their lives compare with the lives of others” (Frankfurt 1997,
p. 6). And again: “The fundamental error of egalitarianism lies in
supposing that it is morally important whether one person has less
than another regardless of how much either of them has” (Frankfurt
1987, p. 34).</p>

<p>

From the non-egalitarian vantage point, what is really at stake in
helping those worse off and improving their lot is <em>humanitarian
concern</em>, a desire to alleviate suffering. Such concern is
understood as non-egalitarian. It is not centered on the difference
between those better off and those worse off as such (whatever the
applied standard), but on improving the situation of persons in bad
circumstances. Their distress constitutes the actual moral reason to
act.  The wealth of those better off only furnishes a means that has
to be transferred for the sake of mitigating the distress, as long as
other, morally negative consequences do not emerge in the process. The
strength of the impetus for more equality lies in the urgency of the
claims of those worse off, not in the extent of the inequality. For
this reason, instead of equality the non-egalitarian critics favor one
or another <em>entitlement theory of justice</em>, such as Nozick's
(1974) libertarianism (cf. 3.2. above) and Frankfurt's (1987)
<em>doctrine of sufficiency</em>, according to which “What is
important from the moral point of view is not that everyone should
have <em>the same</em> but that each should have <em>enough</em>. If
everyone had enough, it would be of no moral consequence whether some
had more than others” (Frankfurt 1987, p. 21).</p>

<p>

Parfit's (1997) <em>priority view</em> calls for focusing on improving
the situation of society's weaker and poorer members and indeed all
the more urgently the worse off they are, even if they can be less
helped than others in the process. Parfit (1995) distinguishes between
egalitarianism and prioritarianism. According to prioritarians,
benefiting people is more important the worse off the people are. Such
prioritizing will often increase equality but they are two distinct
values since in an important respect equality is a relational value
while priority is not. However, egalitarians and prioritarians share
an important commitment in that both hold that the best possible
distribution of a fixed sum of goods is an equal one. It is just a
matter of debate whether prioritarianism is a sort of egalitarianism
or a (decent) inegalitarianism. In any case, entitlement-based
non-egalitarian arguments can result, in practice, in an outcome
equality that is as far-reaching as that sought by egalitarian
theories. Hence fulfilling an absolute or non-comparative standard for
everyone (e.g. to the effect that nobody should starve) frequently
results in a certain equality of outcomes that consist in lives that
are not merely decent, but good. Consequently, the debate here centers
on the proper justification for this outcome — is it equality or
something else? — and not so much on the outcome — are
persons or groups more or less equal, according to a chosen metric?
Possibly, the difference is even deeper, lying in the conception of
morality in general, rather than in equality at all.</p>

<p>

Egalitarians can respond to the anti-egalitarian critique by
conceding that it is the nature of some (if certainly far from all)
essential norms of morality and justice to be concerned primarily with
the adequate fulfillment of the separate claims of individuals. However
whether a claim can itself be considered suitable can be ascertained
only by asking whether it can be agreed on by all those affected in
hypothetical conditions of freedom and equality. This justificatory
procedure is all the more needed the less evident — indeed the more
unclear or controversial — it is if what is at stake is actually
suffering, distress, an objective need. In the view of the constitutive
egalitarians, all the judgments of distributive justice should be
approached relationally by asking which distributive scheme all
concerned parties can universally and reciprocally agree to. As
described at some length in the pertinent section above, many
egalitarians argue that a presumption in favor of equality follows from
this justification requirement. In the eyes of such egalitarians, this
is all one needs for the justification and determination of the
constitutive value of equality.</p>

<p>

Secondly, even if — for the sake of argument — the question is
left open of whether demands for distribution according to objective
needs (e.g. alleviating hunger) involve non-comparative
entitlement-claims, it is nonetheless always necessary to resolve the
question of what we do owe needy individuals. And this is tied in a
basic way to the question of what we owe persons in comparable or worse
situations, and how we need to invest our scarce resources (money,
goods, time, energy) in light of the sum total of our obligations.
While the claim on our help may well appear non-relational, determining
the kind and extent of the help must always be relational — at least
in circumstances of scarcity (and resources are always scarce). Claims
are either “satiable” (Raz 1986, p. 235), i.e., an upper limit or
sufficiency level can be indicated after which each person's claim to X
has been fulfilled, or they are not so. For insatiable claims, to
stipulate any level at which one is or ought to be sufficiently
satisfied is arbitrary. If the standards of sufficiency are defined as
a bare minimum, why should persons be content with that minimum? Why
should the manner in which welfare and resources are distributed above
the poverty level not also be a question of justice? If, by contrast,
we are concerned solely with claims that are in principle “satiable,”
such claims having a reasonable definitions of sufficiency, then these
standards of sufficiency will most likely be very high. In Frankfurt's
definition, for example, sufficiency is reached only when persons are
satisfied and no longer actively strive for more. Since we find
ourselves operating, in practice, in circumstances far beneath such a
high sufficiency level, we (of course) live in (moderate) scarcity.
Then the above mentioned argument holds as well — namely, that in
order to determine to what extent it is to be fulfilled, each claim has
to be judged in relation to the claims of all others and all available
resources. In addition, the moral urgency of lifting people above dire
poverty cannot be invoked to demonstrate the moral urgency of everyone
having enough. In both forms of scarcity, i.e., with satiable and
insatiable claims, the social right or claim to goods cannot be
conceived as something absolute or non-comparative. Egalitarians may
thus conclude that distributive justice is always comparative. This
would suggest that distributive equality, especially equality of
life-conditions, is due a fundamental role in an adequate theory of
justice in particular and of morality in general.</p>
