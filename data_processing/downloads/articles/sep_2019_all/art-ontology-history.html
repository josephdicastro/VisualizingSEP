<h1>History of the Ontology of Art</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Mon Aug 29, 2011; substantive revision Tue Jun 7, 2016</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>

Questions central to the ontology of art include the following: what
sort(s) of things are works of art? Do all works of art belong to any
one basic ontological category?  Do all or only some works have
multiple instances? Do works have (material) parts or constituents,
and if so, what is their relation to the work as a whole? How are
particular works of art individuated? Are they created or discovered?
Can they be destroyed?</p>

<p>

Explicit and <em>extensive</em> treatments of these topics written
prior to the 19<sup>th</sup> century have yet to be found. This does
not mean, however, that there is nothing relevant to these ontological
questions in early writings on beauty, the arts, and related
matters. For example, Aristotle’s claims about the functions and
elements of tragedy (see Gerald Else 1957) can be mined for ideas
about the nature of literary works more generally. And what can be
made of the hint, in
<em>Metaphysics</em> Eta, 6, that the unity of <em>The Iliad</em> is
a matter of a set of words made “one” by being connected together?</p>

<p>

Rather than attempting to make conjectures about such difficult
exegetical topics, this entry focuses primarily on contributions made
by authors who explicitly address themselves at length to some of the
aforementioned questions pertaining to the ontology of works of art,
either in general or with reference to such major art forms as music,
literature, painting, architecture, and sculpture.</p>

<p>

One further note about the scope of this entry is in
order. Instructive surveys of the subfield of aesthetics known as the
ontology of art are fairly plentiful; see Nicholas Wolterstorff
(1992), Gregory Currie (1998, 2010), Joseph Margolis (1998), Stephen
Davies (2003a), Amie Thomasson (2004, 2006b), Guy Rohrbaugh (2005),
Theodore Gracyk (2009), Robert Stecker (2010), and Carl Matheson and
Ben Caplan (2011). Surveys of the <em>history</em> of the field have
not, however, been forthcoming, and the comments on this topic that
crop up in the literature are sketchy and sometimes quite
misleading. One shortcoming has been a marked tendency to focus on
contributions from the last two decades of the 20<sup>th</sup>
century, the one salient exception being due attention paid to works
by Roman Ingarden (e.g, 1931, 1962, and see the entry on Ingarden).
The present entry has been designed with this shortcoming in mind.  A
schematic mapping of questions and positions is provided and reference
is made to neglected, earlier contributions to the ontology of
art.</p>

<h2 id="DoWorkArtExis">1. Do works of art exist?</h2>

<p>

Although artists, critics, and art lovers are likely to think it
absurd to deny that a work of art is as real as anything else one
might encounter, many philosophers and art theorists have raised
questions about the very existence or “mode of being” of
works of art.</p>

<h3 id="Real">1.1 Realism</h3>

<p>

One prevalent response to the question of art’s existence is a
straightforward realism to the effect that works of art figure amongst
those entities which, once they have been brought into existence, do
not depend on anyone’s (actual or possible) beliefs or responses. A
strikingly realist statement is Samuel Alexander’s (1925, 22) claim
that the sculptor <em>discovers</em> a sculptural figure in the block
of marble, at least if we assume that something can only be discovered
if it already exists. A more prominent example of a philosopher who
defends realism about works of art is Monroe C. Beardsley (1958), who
seems to have espoused the disjunctive thesis that a work of art is
either a particular physical object or a kind of physical object (see
the entry on Beardsley’s aesthetics).</p>

<h3 id="ModeBeinExis">1.2 Modes of being and existence</h3>

<p>

Some philosophers postulate a plurality of modes of being, and some of
these philosophers have attributed modes of being other than existence
to works of art. An example is C. E. M. Joad, who included a fairly
lengthy discussion of issues related to the ontology of art in his
popular <em>Guide to Philosophy</em> of 1936.</p>

<p>

Joad denied that a work such as Shakespeare’s <em>Hamlet</em> could be
correctly identified with any existing concrete particular, such as a
script, or with a collection of events, such as those involved in a
staging of the play. Nor should the title ‘Hamlet’ be
taken as referring to ideas in the author’s mind, to some spectator’s
experience of the work, or to some collection of experiences
occasioned by performances of the play. Joad’s alternative was to say
that the work of art is a <em>subsistent</em> object, neither mental
nor material, which, like other universals, is a constituent of the
universe possessing a special kind of being in its own
right. According to Joad, then, at least some works are subsistent
universals, and this is the sort of entity to which the titles of such
works of art refer.</p>

<p>

In his Mellon lectures presented at the National Gallery in Washington
in 1955 (published in 1957), Étienne Gilson classified works of
art as Aristotelian substances (for background, see the entries on
substance and Aristotle’s metaphysics).  Gilson also claimed that a
work has aesthetic and artistic modes of existence in addition to a
substantial one. A work exists artistically <em>qua</em> product of
the artist’s activity, whereas it exists aesthetically when it is the
object of someone’s aesthetic (or contemplative) experience. A similar
plurality of modes of existence of works of art had been postulated by
Étienne Souriau (1943, 1947), who posited thing-like
[<em>chosale</em>], aesthetic, and transcendent modes of
existence.</p>

<h3 id="ImagFict">1.3 The Imagination and fictionalism</h3>

<p>

In attributing artistic and aesthetic modes of existence to works,
Gilson adverted to a physical object’s relation to the experiences and
actions of cognizing subjects. Similarly, a long series of
philosophers have taken subjective relations and experiences to be
crucial to answering the question of the existence of works of art. It
has often been proposed, for example, that works are at least in part
a product of the imagination, and this not merely in the sense that
some artist must imagine what sort of thing he or she wants to make or
do if a work of art is to be brought into existence.  Instead, the
thought is that even the existence or reality of a completed work of
art continues to depend on the make-believe or imaginative activity of
the artist or some other subject, such as the observer or reader who
appreciates the work as a work of art.</p>

<p>

That the imagination plays a crucial role in aesthetic responses to
both art and nature was an important theme in 18<sup>th</sup>-century
aesthetics (see the entries on French, British, and German aesthetics
in the 18<sup>th</sup> century).  Joseph Addison’s (1712) description
of the “pleasures of the imagination” was influential, yet
not as influential perhaps as Immanuel Kant’s idea that the activation
of the power or faculty of the imagination was essential to aesthetic
judgments (for more detail, see the entry on Kant’s aesthetics).</p>

<p>

In the 19<sup>th</sup> and 20<sup>th</sup> centuries, various thinkers
contended that the imagination plays a crucial role in both the
creation and the reception of works of art. Prominent examples of
philosophers who emphasized the importance
of <em>Einbildungskraft</em> or <em>Phantasie</em> in this regard
include Friedrich Theodor Vischer (1857, 1898), Robert Zimmermann
(1865), Hermann Lotze (1884), Eduard von Hartmann (1888), Karl
Köstlin (1869, 1889), Konrad von Lange (1895, 1901, 1912, 1935),
Christian von Ehrenfels (1896–1899, 318), and Johannes Volkelt
(1905–1915).</p>

<p>

Von Hartmann (1888, vol. 2, 11) rejects what he called
“naïve realistic” assumptions about the objects of
aesthetic or artistic judgements. Arguing for a “transcendental
realism,” he contends that beauty is not a material object, but
a subjective appearance, like the sweetness of sugar.  Von Hartmann
observes that people confidently say such things as “this book
is Homer’s <em>Iliad</em>,” “this score is Beethoven’s
Ninth Symphony,” and “this painting is
Raphael’s <em>Sistine Madonna</em>.” Although it is often
acknowledged that the first two examples are philosophically
untenable, it ought to be admitted, von Hartmann contends, that the
third sort of statement is also inaccurate. The painted surface in
itself is not beautiful even though in some circumstances it has the
capacity to contribute to a subjective appearance of beauty, which von
Hartmann characterizes as <em>Schein</em> or <em>Phantasie</em>. If
the work of art is the bearer or <em>locus</em> of beauty and other
aesthetic properties, it cannot be the material object in itself. Yet
Hartmann also contests what he called “subjective
idealism,” and in his discussion of artistic creation emphasizes
the artist’s engagement with the material constraints of artistic
media. The “phantasy work” that an artist elaborates prior
to the creation of an “external work of art” is never
neutral with regard to media or instrumentation (1888, vol. 2,
180).</p>

<p>

Konrad von Lange held that imaginative play and an attitude he called
‘conscious self-deception’ [<em>die bewusste
Selbsttäuschung</em>] are necessary to both the creation and
appreciation of art. He did not explicitly draw the conclusion that
works of art are therefore fictions, but he did describe our commerce
with them as a kind of lucid illusion in which we playfully entertain
thoughts of states of affairs that we know not to exist. The artistic
artifact, he proposed, is like the toy or other object that is
recruited to the ends of a child’s imaginative play. A sophisticated
and highly influential contemporary exponent of this kind of approach
to art and, more specifically, to the philosophical analysis of
depiction and fictional content, is Kendall L. Walton (1990).</p>

<p>

Jean-Paul Sartre (1938, 1940) has often been credited with the idea
that works of art are illusory (in the sense of systematically being
the object of some sort of error about their mode of existence), but
it is not obvious that this is the best interpretation of his remarks
on the topic. Sartre declares that Beethoven’s Seventh Symphony
“is outside of the <em>real</em>, outside of existence”
(1940, 371, my trans.). He also says that we do not really hear the
symphony at all, but only hear the composition in our imaginations.
Such statements can be read as being meant to debunk a widespread
illusory belief in the existence of musical works; they also hold open
the possibility of imagining works without believing in their
existence, in which case the putative illusion is not necessary.  One
of the possible targets of Sartre’s remarks is a kind of idealist
doctrine discussed below. For an informative discussion of Sartre’s
views on the subject, see Peter V. Lamarque (2010, chapter 10); and
for additional background, see the entry on existentialist
aesthetics.</p>

<p>

On this topic Sartre was preceded and possibly influenced by Ingarden
and Nicolai Hartmann, who was professor of theoretical philosophy in
Berlin at the time of Sartre’s stint at the <em>Institut français</em>
in Berlin from 1933–1934. In a paper presented at the
International Congress of Philosophy held at Harvard in 1926 and
published in 1927, Hartmann contrasted psychological and ontological
approaches in aesthetics and argued for the priority of the latter. In
this paper he outlined positions that he was to develop at length in a
series of works, including his (1933) and an unfinished treatise on
aesthetics, written in 1945 and published posthumously in 1953.</p>

<p>

Hartmann’s central thesis on the ontology of art is that works are
fictions that depend upon the perceptual and imaginative activities of
artists and their audiences. In Hartmann’s view, the work of art has
at least two parts or strata: the first layer, which he sometimes
refers to as the “foreground,” is
perceptible—Hartmann’s examples include a piece of stone, colors
on a surface, and audible sounds. The perception of such items is the
basis of the aesthetic experience of the higher
“background” stratum, which also requires imaginings
occasioned by this perceptual experience. The artistic and aesthetic
qualities of the work arise from the relation between these
‘heterogeneous’ levels. As a result of this dependence
upon the imagination, the work lacks independent or autonomous being,
or what Hartmann calls ‘<em>Ansichsein</em>’. A work is an
observer-relative appearance or <em>Erscheinung</em>, experienced as
such. An appearance experienced <em>as appearance</em> is not to be
confused, however, with illusion or <em>Schein</em> because it
involves self-reflexive awareness that something is being imagined as
opposed to believed. In this regard Hartmann evokes the familiar
analogy to children’s imaginative play, while commenting that for the
adult such play “remains fiction” (1953, 53).</p>

<p>

Hartmann’s concept of artistic appearance does not embrace
only the depictive or symbolic contents of representational works of
art, as Hartmann also applies his levels analysis to the aesthetic
properties of non-figurative works, including architectural ones.
A building <em>qua</em> material object obviously figures amongst the
real entities of the world, but to experience the material building as
a work of art is to engage in the imaginative apprehension of fictional
qualities. Hartmann appears to be claiming in this regard that
such terms as ‘grandiose’, ‘pompous’ or
‘majestic’, are, when used as labels to name the aesthetic
qualities of a building, in some sense imaginative and hence
fictional.</p>

<p>

Kindred approaches to the question of the work’s existence
have been developed by a number of different figures, an early instance
being the American philosopher Stephen C. Pepper, who describes how the
imagination contributes to a process in which “an aesthetic work
of art is created out of a physical work of art” (1937a, 231;
1955). Pepper, who was a professor of philosophy at the
University of California at Berkeley, was on the same panel as Hartmann
at the 1926 Congress mentioned above. It is not clear, however,
whether Pepper embraced Hartmann’s conclusion that works of art
are in some sense fictions. Pepper argued for a relativist
conception whereby ontological issues depend ultimately on such
overarching rival frameworks as organicism, mechanism, and pragmatism
or “contextualism.” Pepper explicitly denied that any
one of these frameworks was the one true theory.</p>

<p>

Another philosopher whose early contributions merit attention in
this vein is Joseph Margolis (1958, 1959, 1961). Margolis
describes a work of art as being comprised of a physical system (for
example, a lump of clay) and an aesthetic design. To behold
something as a work of art, it is necessary to combine a sensory
perception of the physical item with an imaginative experience of the
aesthetic design. The design “supervenes” upon the
physical system. Margolis suggests that whereas contradictory
assertions about a physical object cannot both be true, the principle
of noncontradiction does not apply to the description of works of
art.</p>

<h3 id="Inte">1.4 Intermittence</h3>

<p>

Margolis (1958) explicitly endorses one implication of his
hypothesis regarding the way of being or <em>Seinsweise</em> of the
work of art. In the absence of the right sort of attention, the
work ceases to exist, even though the physical system remains
intact. Yet the same work can return to existence when the same
sort of imaginative attention is directed upon the physical system that
constitutes the supervenience base of the artwork, thereby
“reviving” the correlative aesthetic design.</p>

<p>

Several philosophers (e.g., Eleanor Rowland 1913, 117, Hilde Hein
1959, Andrew Harrison 1967–68, Currie 1989, 57) have raised
questions about the wisdom of allowing that the existence of a work is
intermittent. An early example is Johannes Volkelt (1905, 11), who
asserts that the statue of Zeus in Otricoli was a work of art
throughout the many centuries during which it lay buried and
unobserved. As Wolterstorff later put it, “Have not Beethoven’s
quartets, Rembrandt’s prints, and Yeats’s poems existed at least ever
since their composition?” (1980, 43). As will become apparent
below, a desire to find some alternative to the hypothesis of
intermittent existence has influenced some of the proposals about the
category of enduring or perduring entities to which artworks should be
said to belong. For example, Andrew Paul Ushenko characterized works
as powers so as to avoid the intermittence problem (1953, 47), and
similar intuitions motivated Pepper’s (1965)
“double-dispositional” account, according to which a
work’s continuous existence depends on the “passive
disposition” of a physical object as well as the “dynamic
disposition” of the observer.</p>

<h3 id="Idea">1.5 Idealism</h3>

<p>

It would be quite misleading to give the impression that all of
those philosophers who thought minds and their activities have
something to do with the existence of works of art also thought that
this means that works were somehow less real than, say, natural
physical entities and events. Idealists invert this
hierarchy.</p>

<p>

This is explicit in Benedetto Croce (1913, 1965, 9–10) when he
asserts that works of art cannot be physical entities because works of
art are “supremely real” whereas the physical world is
“unreal.”</p>

<p>

Another early example of an idealist ontology of art is provided by
Waldemar Conrad (1908–09). Conrad stressed Edmund Husserl’s
contrast between “natural” and
“phenomenological” attitudes and their objects (for
background, see the entries on Husserl and phenomenology). Conrad
asserts that only the latter attitude can reveal the “ideal
Object” that is the genuine or intended [<em>gemeinte</em>] work
of art. In his example, which could well have served as the
counterpoint for Sartre’s discussion of Beethoven’s Seventh
Symphony, the genuine work is the symphony itself as opposed to the
various spatiotemporal events, such as more or less competent
orchestral performances, or someone’s whistling the melody or
reading the score, that might help to direct attention to some of the
work’s essential features (1908–09, 77–78). Conrad
does not present a detailed defense of his assumptions about the
ontology of ideal objects, but clearly shared Husserl’s aversion
to “psychologism” (for background, see the entry on
psychologism).</p>

<p>

Croce’s (1902, 1913, 1948) claims about works (and ideas) as
“expressions” of experience generated a lot of controversy
and did much to put ontological issues on the agenda of aesthetics and
the philosophy of art (for background, see the entry on Croce’s
aesthetics). British proponents of Croce-inspired aesthetics
included Lascelles Abercrombie (1922), who promoted the idea that the
work is an experience, and P. Leon (1931), who rhapsodized about the
aesthetic object as an experienced <em>quale</em>. Drawing upon a
broad Platonic and Romantic background, George W. Beiswanger (1939)
developed the view that the “material” work is merely a
means to the aesthetic object, which he characterized as
“experienced experiencing,” an idea inspired, apparently,
by John Dewey’s remark that “the actual work of art is what
the product does with and in experience” (1934, 3).</p>

<p>

By far the most influential Croce-inspired aesthetician was Robin
George Collingwood (1925, 1938), whose several translations of
Croce’s work helped make the Italian philosopher’s views
more accessible to readers bereft of Italian (for background and
references, see Alan Donagan 1972). As Collingwood’s
philosophy of art is the subject of a separate entry as well as various
commentaries (e.g., Ian Winchester 2004, David Davies 2008), we can be
brief here. For some purposes talk of a
“Croce-Collingwood” theory of art is good enough, but of
course differences come to the fore when one reads these authors with
an eye to detail. It seems fair to say that for Collingwood, the
work of art is not a physical object or finished artifact, but the
conscious imaginative activity through which creative expression takes
place. That works are the activity of the imagination does not
make them any less real in Collingwood’s opinion.</p>

<p>

A forceful objection to all theories that invite us to think of
works of art as experiences—those of the artist and/or those of
the audience—is that this is a conflation of an experience and
the object of the experience. It is one thing to acknowledge that
a work is the product or even the expression of a human experience and
that it is designed to occasion certain kinds of experiences; it is
something else entirely to assert that the work is itself an experience
and nothing more. Such an account neglects the physical
dimensions of art, beginning with the artist’s encounter with
materials and media. It is also objected that the attempted
reduction of artworks to experiences would convert a public, culturally
situated entity into something private. Early worries of this
sort were articulated in relation to Croce’s aesthetics by
Alexander (1925) and Louis Arnauld Reid (1926). More recently,
these objections have been raised against Roger Scruton’s (1997)
ontology of musical works by Jerrold Levinson (2000), who explicitly
links Scruton’s account to the legacy of Collingwood and
idealism.</p>

<h3 id="Elim">1.6 Elimination</h3>

<p>

Given a sufficiently austere ontology, titles such as <em>Das Lied
von der Erde</em> and <em>Hamlet</em> have no real referents. Those who
defend such an ontology are rarely eager to trumpet the implications
for the arts, perhaps because doing so would be a poor recommendation
for the austerity. A few thinkers writing about aesthetics have,
however, conjectured that we would be better off without committing
ourselves to the existence of works. For example, Richard Rudner
(1950) distinguished between questions about the object of our
aesthetic responses and questions about the referents of the names of
works. The answer to the latter question is that such names are
non-designative or syncategorematic. The former question, Rudner
concludes, is not scientific and should be set aside.</p>

<p>

Roland Barthes (1971) notoriously asserted that the concept of the
work of art is part of a repressive ideology that should be replaced by
a liberating conception of textuality. ‘Textuality’
referred in his mind to a highly indeterminate and exciting sphere of
semantic and erotic possibilities; ‘work’ [une œuvre]
was, on the contrary, an ideological drag involving wrong-headed
thinking about fixed meanings, ownership, and repression.</p>

<p>

In a somewhat similar spirit but without Barthes’s
poststructuralist idiom, Stephen David Ross (1977) contends that there
is no work of art <em>simpliciter</em>, but any number of discriminable
achievements or loci of artistic value.</p>

<p>

Anders Pettersson (1981, 1984, 1990, 2009, 2012) contends that talk of
a text or literary work can be eliminated. He acknowledges that the
concept of a literary work forms part of ordinary language and is
useful in theoretically undemanding contexts, but he also argues that
it is a self-contradictory construct that creates many pseudo-problems
for literary theory. We can say what we need to say about literature
in a theoretically adequate way without making any ontological
commitments to texts or works and without introducing any new entities
by referring to such phenomena as physical copies of texts, texts in
the sense of sequences of signs, or meaning in its different
varieties.</p>

<p>

A more recent proponent of an eliminativist strategy is Ross P. Cameron
(2008), who contends that we need not make works of art part of our
fundamental metaphysics. Even so, we can still hold our common
sense statements about them to be true. For criticisms of the
idea that this eliminativist position is compatible with common sense
or well-entrenched practices, see Robert Stecker (2009) and Stefano
Predelli (2009).</p>

<h2 id="MoniRiva">2. Monism and its rivals</h2>

<p>

In this context ‘monism’ is simply a label for the idea
that all works of art fall within one ontological category, such as
universals. A prevalent argument against this sort of thesis rests on
the distinction between performance and non-performance works: a
musical work can be performed by various persons and on various
occasions; a painting cannot. Having described such distinctions
amongst works of art, Wolterstorff concludes tersely that “Works
of art are not all alike in their ontological status” (1975,
230). According to Stephen Davies (1993), we need not look beyond the
art of music to find grounds for rejecting ontological monism. More
recently, Robert Howell (2002a, 2002b) has argued that if the term
‘work of art’ covers artistic improvisations, the various
utterances referred to as ‘oral literature’, and such
items as paintings and scored musical compositions, then no single
adequate ontological category is to be found. With reference to
artists’ stipulative authority over the “features and
boundaries” of their works, Sherri Irvin declares that
“Any claim to the effect that all works belong to the same
ontological category will thus come out false or uninformative”
(2008, 1). Yet as will become clear below, monism still has its
proponents.</p>

<h3 id="MultVsSingArtiItem">2.1 Multiple vs. singular artistic items</h3>

<p>

Many debates over monism and rivals to that position have hinged on
the question of reproduction and multiple instances, the thought being
that in the case of at least some works, adequate technologies of
reproduction yield more than one instance of an artistic artifact, and
therefore of the work. For example, it would be highly
implausible to contend that Henri Cartier-Bresson’s famous
photographic work, “Behind the Gare Saint-Lazare, Paris”
(1932), consists in the negative used to make prints, or in the first
or any other single print of this picture. Multiply instantiated
works form one major category, then, while singular or non-reproducible
ones form another.</p>

<p>

It has been complained, however, that this distinction ought not to
be taken as decisive for an ontology of art since it rests upon a
contingent thesis about what is technologically possible.</p>

<p>

The question of how technological change can influence our basic
conception of works of art was raised by Walter Benjamin in a famous
essay, a first version of which appeared in French in 1936 (translated
literally, the title is ‘The Work of Art in the Age of its
Mechanical Reproducibility’). Benjamin is generally interpreted
as claiming that the advent of techniques of mechanical reproduction
has undermined the quasi-religious “aura” that previously
surrounded the individual work of art. Benjamin appears to have viewed
such technological change as part of a liberating or progressive
historical process. Whether Benjamin held that no work of art really
was or could be an “authentic” concrete particular is hard
to determine, however, as the history of art’s political functions is
the primary focus of his somewhat obscure essay. Benjamin does declare
early on (in both the first and revised versions of his essay) that
“In principle, the work of art has always been
reproducible. Objects made by humans could always be copied by
humans” (2008, 20).</p>

<p>

Other philosophers have argued that technological possibility should
not be thought decisive with regard to the soundness of a monist
ontology of art: the important philosophical question is what is
nomologically or metaphysically possible. A relatively early
example is C. I. Lewis’s oft-overlooked (1946) discussion of the
ontology of the work of art.</p>

<p>

Drawing upon work by Pepper, D. W. Prall (1929, 1936), and George
Santayana (1923), Lewis held that an aesthetic appreciation of art is
based on the contemplation of an “aesthetic object”
presented by the work. Lewis recruited Santayana’s (1923)
concept of essences (or some approximation thereof) in order to
characterize these aesthetic objects. An aesthetic essence is
described as “a certain composition of sense or qualia”
(1946, 188) and as a “qualitatively identical content”
(1946, 18). When we appreciate a painting, Lewis contends, what
we contemplate is what this canvas could have in common with some
reproduction of it, namely, “that qualitative and abstract
essence which is here incorporated, and is theoretically repeatable in
some other physical object” (1946, 477). Lewis claims that
an aesthetic object always depends upon some physical object, but he
maintains that these dependency relations differ in degree, since a
poem depends on a particular inscription less than a work of visual art
depends on a particular visible object. Yet the work is not just
a type of visual appearance abstracted from a physical object, or in
Lewis’s terms, an artistic vehicle. Instead, for Lewis, the
aesthetic essence constitutive of the identity of the work of art, as
opposed to the physical object, “lies in <em>the context
associated with</em> this physical entity which presents it”
(1946, 474, Lewis’s italics). If someone fails to bring this
associated context, or brings some other context, into the
interpretation of the vehicle, “the esthetic object presented
fails to be apprehended in its actual esthetic character—is
either misapprehended or not apprehended at all” (1946, 474).</p>

<p>

Note that Lewis considers every aesthetic essence to be
“theoretically repeatable.” Similar claims to the
effect that all works of art are multiple, at least in principle and
<em>qua</em> objects of appreciation, were subsequently made by Ushenko
(1953, 21–25), Peter Strawson (1959, 231, n. 1; 1974, 183), Jeanne
Wacker (1960), Anthony Savile (1971), Eddie Zemach (1966, 1986), and
Currie (1989). </p>

<p>

Many other writers have, on the contrary, stressed the singularity
of at least some works of art and/or some of their constituents.
Croce’s influential (1903) diatribe against the
“science” of genres stands at the top of a list that
includes George Boas (1937), Henri Focillon (1934, 56), Souriau (1947,
70), Stuart Hampshire (1952), Ingarden (1962), Nelson Goodman (1968),
Richard Wollheim (1968), Wolterstorff (1975, 1980), Catherine Lord
(1977), Mark Sagoff (1978), Levinson (1987, 1996), Anthony O’Hear
(1995), Irvin (2008), and Michael Weh (2010).</p>

<p>

The diversity of arguments and positions on this broad particularist
theme should be noted. For example, Ingarden reacts negatively to
the prospect of a multiplicity of perfect replicas of the cathedral of
Notre Dame de Paris: seeing such things side by side, he comments,
would cause “the strongest displeasure, precisely because it
belongs to the nature of the work of art to be an individual, in the
sense of something qualitatively unique” (1989, 274; 1962,
278). O’Hear defends a “singularity thesis” to
the effect that “works of distinction” are necessarily
individual and unique, whereas Weh argues that artistic intentions
constrained by the historical circumstances determine whether and when
a work is reproducible or multiple. Wolterstorff’s line on
this topic is that in the case of many paintings, the artist does not
settle on a set of properties that establish criteria for correctness
of instances or “occurrences” of the work (1980, 72).</p>

<p>

In a paper published posthumously in 2001, Frank Sibley evokes the
longstanding controversy surrounding the reproducibility of works of
art and contends that in this regard a “two-way pull” is a
pervasive feature of the practices and discourses of art. Sibley
concludes that only a stipulation could rectify the tension between
reproducibility and singularity in our conception of the work of
art. We return to this topic below.</p>

<h3 id="ArtiVehiVsWorkArt">2.2 Artistic vehicles vs. works of art</h3>

<p>

One source of confusion in this area is divergent assumptions about
both the extension and intension of the expression ‘work of
art’ and its cognates: what is it, exactly, that can or cannot be
classified in a single, basic ontological category? Whereas
Virgil Aldrich (1963) proclaims the term ‘work of art’
useful because of its ambivalence, others (e.g., Boas 1937) have found
the pervasive ambiguity in the discourse about artworks (starting with
a process/product conflation) troublesome and in need of clarification.
</p>

<p>

I. A. Richards famously wrote that people “naturally talk about
poems (and pictures, etc.) in a way which makes it impossible for
anybody to discover what it is we are talking about” (1924,
176).  Evoking the “vague” and “diverse” usage
of the term, Francis Sparshott (1963) worried that the question about
what sort of thing a work of art is might have no precise answer.
Richard Shusterman concurs, and passes the question of the identity of
the work of art along to the “piecemeal efforts of practicing
art critics” (1980, 543). Thomasson (2005) argues that given
that the relevant sortals yield only vague and incomplete identity and
persistence conditions, some questions in the ontology of art admit of
no precise answers. A good example would be the question of just how
faulty a performance of a difficult composition can be and still count
as a performance of the work. Thomasson’s skepticism, however, is a
limited one: some art-ontological questions do have determinate
answers about which sufficiently well-informed practitioners in the
world of art could not be wrong.</p>

<p>

Pepper, who struggled with art-ontological issues for several
decades, ended up proclaiming in his (1952) that ‘work of
art’ is best understood as a “portmanteau” expression
on which are hung significantly different conceptual garments. In
his early writings on the ontology of art (e.g., 1937b, 231; 1946),
Pepper had distinguished between the work of art and “the
aesthetic work.” In response to published objections and
queries (Nathan Berall 1951, James L. Jarrett 1952, Robert Hoffman
1962), he later drew a distinction between what he proposed to call
‘the control object’ (that he had previously referred to as
the ‘physical work of art’ or ‘the vehicle’)
and the object of critical evaluation (previously, ‘the aesthetic
work of art’).</p>

<p>

Various terms for a distinction in this vicinity had already been
employed. Hermann Siebek (1875, 7) and von Hartmann (1888, vol. 2, 35,
208) both used the term ‘<em>Vehikel</em>’ to refer to the
material or perceptible bases of aesthetic objects and works of
art. Volkelt (1905, 11) used the term
‘<em>Ausserdinge</em>’ to refer to the non-psychological
items that make up what he called the “pre-aesthetic basis of
the work of art.” H. S. Goodhart-Rendel (1934) distinguished
between the material of art, the artistic vehicle, and the work of
art. His idea is that the vehicle is whatever is used to
“externalize” the work or to “disclose it to the
world” (1934, 4). In the case of music, the sound is the
vehicle; sound is not the artist’s material, however, because some
musicians can compose in their heads, and on Goodhart-Rendel’s usage,
only those media that are necessary to working in an art form are to
be taken as materials. All that is strictly necessary to musical
composition is an idea or thought of a sequence of sounds.</p>

<p>

The term ‘vehicle’ was taken up again by Harold Osborne,
who defined it as what “enables the same organization of material
to enter the experience of different persons at different times”
(1953, 96). A particular arrangement of pigments upon a canvas or
some other surface could be the vehicle of a work, but the work itself
is distinct from its material component. The work is not the
vehicle alone, but “an enduring possibility, often enshrined or
recorded in a material medium, of a specific set of sensory
impressions” (1953, 100).</p>

<p>

For those who dislike the medical and other connotations of the term
‘vehicle’, there are other options. Ruby Meager uses
the term ‘manifestation’, commenting that “a poem is
like a universal in being capable of multiple manifestations of which
no single one can count as the poem itself” (1958–59, 52).
Many writers have preferred the term ‘instances’.
Currie, for example, defines ‘instance’ as “all those
concrete things that we come into contact with when we experience a
work of art” (1989, 5).</p>

<p>

Why distinguish between the work of art and its vehicle,
manifestation, or control object? Various reasons have motivated such
distinctions. One line of thought is that a work is
“constituted” by a material object or vehicle, where the
constitution relation is not a matter of identity (for background, see
the entry on material constitution). Roger Pouivet (2000, 2010) has
brought such arguments to bear on a number of issues in the ontology
of art.</p>

<p>

John Dilworth (2005a) distinguishes between the concrete artifact or
event and the artwork. In his view the relation between them is
representational. The artifact or event represents the work, which in
turn represents other content, namely, the subject matter of the
work.</p>

<p>

In an analogy that some philosophers (e.g., Arthur C. Danto 1993,
199–200) have taken quite seriously, the vehicle is to the work
as the body is to the person; for Johan Georg Sulzer (1792, vol. 4,
727), the work of art has both body (the artistic material
or <em>Stoff</em>), and soul or <em>Geist</em> (the representation
or <em>Darstellung</em>). A less heavily freighted way of motivating
the distinction in aesthetics is to say, along with Pepper and others,
that reference to the vehicle or artistic structure alone does not
suffice to identify the object of critical evaluation, or what
artistic and aesthetic appreciation is really about.</p>

<p>

The next section evokes a commonly told story about the basis
of a work-object distinction, indicating some ways in which this story
is misleading.</p>

<h4>2.2.1 Indiscernibility and the story of Pierre Menard</h4>

<p>

In his widely cited 1964 paper, “The Artworld,” Danto
cleverly evoked ways in which perceptually indistinguishable painted
canvases could be the vehicles of strikingly different works of art
bearing different titles and contrasting artistic and aesthetic
qualities. It follows, Danto reasons, that the painted canvas
alone is not the work of art.</p>

<p>

In a reply to questions raised by Sparshott (1976), Danto claimed to
have been “loosely following a famous model in the philosophy of
perception” when he began to explore the implications of
indiscernibles for issues in aesthetics (1976, 80). Yet at the
outset of the second chapter of his 1981 book, <em>The Transfiguration
of the Commonplace</em>, Danto commented: “the possibility was
first recognized, I believe, in connection with literary works, by
Borges, who has the glory of having discovered it in his masterpiece,
<em>Pierre Menard, Symbolist Poet</em>” [sic]. </p>

<p>

It is certainly the case that many philosophers have found
inspiration in Jorge Luis Borges’s 1939 story, “Pierre
Menard, autor del Quijote,” an English translation of which first
appeared in 1962. This short story is not easy to summarize, but
one relevant part of it concerns a French symbolist who sets out to
create a novel by rewriting—without simply copying—the text
of Cervantes’s masterpiece. The narrator of the story makes
observations about ways in which Menard’s work would be different
from Cervantes’s even if Menard somehow managed to produce
something “verbally identical” to what Cervantes had
written.</p>

<p>

In English-language philosophical publications, the earliest
reference to the tale and to its implications for the ontology of art
appears in Savile’s (1971) essay on Goodman’s <em>Languages
of Art</em> (for background, see the entry on Goodman’s
aesthetics). Subsequent references to the story’s
philosophical implications include Walton (1973), Wollheim (1978), Goodman (1978),
David K. Lewis (1978), Levinson (1980a), Ben Tilghman (1982), Susan
Wilsmore (1987), Currie (1989), Jean-Marie Schaefer (1989), Michael
Wreen (1990), David Davies (1991, 2010), Christopher Janaway (1992),
Lamarque (1998, 2010), Jacques Morizot (1999), and the papers in Petr
Kot’átko and Karel Cisar (2004).</p>

<p>

Savile presented what he referred to as the
“Borges-paradox” in order to contest some of
Goodman’s claims about the individuation of works of art.
More specifically, Goodman had distinguished between
“autographic” and “allographic” works, where
the former, unlike the latter, are susceptible to forgery. Moving
quickly, the thought is that while it is possible to make a more or
less successful forgery of a particular painting, it is impossible to
make a deceptive copy of a work of literature because any verbally
identical instance of the text is a good copy of the work, or in
Goodman’s terms, an instance produced in conformity with a system
of notation (for discussion of Goodman’s distinction, see
Levinson 1980b, Pillow 2003, and the entry on
 <a href="../goodman-aesthetics/">Goodman’s aesthetics</a>).</p>

<p>

Savile presents the Pierre Menard case as a counterexample to
Goodman’s thesis that the identity conditions of allographic
works are determined by a notational scheme.</p>

<p>

Two numerically distinct tokens of the same “verbally
identical” text-type could be generated by different literary
authors—Menard and Cervantes—working in significantly different
artistic contexts. These could, then, be the texts of two
artistically different works. Ergo, the work is not the
text. Turning from literature to music, Savile asks us to imagine
a case where Stockhausen independently composes “an ode
notationally and semantically identical” with a composition by
Stamitz. Savile proposes that “We should certainly not say
that they had composed the same work, for the way in which it would be
appropriate to hear them would be quite different” (1971,
23; cf. Levinson 1980a).</p>

<p>

The Borgesian narrator also floats the idea that one work could have
two artistically different texts, which could be taken as reinforcing a
Borges-inspired assault on a text-to-work biconditional (Paisley
Livingston 2005a). Generalizing, we end up with a broad
distinction between works of art and their “objects” or
vehicles.</p>

<p>

There has unsurprisingly been some skepticism about both
the distinction between vehicle and work, and the idea that cogent
reasoning in favor of such a distinction is really to be found in the
Borges story. Tilghman (1982), Currie (1989, 134 n. 19) and
Lamarque (2010), for example, raise questions about the intelligibility
and coherence of that part of the Borges story that concerns Pierre
Menard’s unusual intentions and putative achievement with regard
to the writing of “his” Quixote. What are we supposed
to imagine about Menard’s ambition in setting out to
“rewrite” but not copy the text of the novel by
Cervantes? Is this a psychologically coherent project? What
is more, is there any good reason to think of his text as a new
work? For denials, see Goodman (1978) and Goodman and Catherine
Z. Elgin (1988), who contend that Menard’s text, if brought to
completion, would only be a “replica” of
Cervantes’s.</p>

<p>

With regard to the text-work distinction and the more general
arguments given in support of it, various doubts have been
raised. Wollheim (1993) challenges the evidentiary value of
thought experiments in a context where the concept in question—in
this case, the one evoked by the expression ‘work of
art’—has no determinate conditions for its application, but
only some broad assumptions that can easily be
“transgressed” by the apparent results of a thought
experiment. Tilghman had complained a decade earlier that Danto
did not specify any criteria of work constitution. Tilghman
(1982) added that the ontological question of constitution is in any
case not crucial to questions about criticism and appreciation.</p>

<p>

It can also be reasonably doubted whether the Borges story truly
merits the “glory” of discovery to which Danto
alludes. Lamarque (1998, 2010) finds evidence of the key
contextualist insight, or at least closely related points, in passages
from both Shakespeare and Kant.</p>

<p>

Another earlier and little-known source was the Danish physician and
neurologist, Carl Georg Lange (1834–1900), who is best known for his
independent discovery of the so-called James-Lange
‘peripheric’ theory of emotion in 1885. Lange’s
book of 1899, <em>Bidrag til Nydelsernes fysiologi som grundlag for en
rationel æstetik</em>, the title of which can be translated quite
literally as ‘Contribution to the Physiology of the Pleasures as
Foundation for a Rational Aesthetics’, begins with a lengthy
survey of the author’s ideas about the nature of the various
sources of enjoyment or pleasure, and then moves on to apply these
ideas to the arts and beauty.</p>

<p>

Lange argues that the various sorts of enjoyments or pleasures [the
Danish ‘<em>nydelser</em>’ is ambiguous between the two]
given to us by works of art have a few basic sources, including
variety [<em>Afvekslingen</em>] and the arousal of sympathy. He also
stresses the art appreciator’s admiration of the artist’s manifest
overcoming of artistic difficulties in the creation of the work. The
awareness that very few people, or perhaps even only a unique
individual [<em>den Enkelte</em>], could have brought about an
innovative artistic achievement is a distinct source of artistic
enjoyment. Lange wants to argue that this type of artistic enjoyment
depends upon the appreciator’s awareness of aspects of the art
object’s origins. One can only admire a work, in the special sense of
artistic admiration or ‘<em>Beundring</em>’ conceived of
by Lange, to the extent that one can understand and evaluate the
artistic difficulties the artist has overcome. Although Lange here
repeats a claim made in earlier aesthetic treatises (e.g. Véron
1878, 63), he takes the argument one step further. He turns to an
imaginary indiscernibility example in an effort to make a point about
the relevant aspects “in a work” [<em>i et
Værk</em>] that can give rise to the special kind of enjoyment
he has in mind:</p>

<blockquote>

There are examples where people, and this includes even the experts,
disagree over which of two paintings is the original and which is a
copy. In such a situation one should think that the artistic
pleasures these two paintings occasion must be more or less the same,
and indeed they are, up to the moment when the doubt is removed.
Once this happens the difference is very large, as history shows.
Nothing prevents us in any case from imagining a copy that so
perfectly reproduces the original that there is no way to distinguish
them from each other. Yet there is all the difference in the
world between the enjoyments they occasion. The enjoyment value
of the copy, and with it, its economic value, is negligible compared to
that of the original, and this notwithstanding the fact that they
resemble each other like two drops of water (1899, 125–126, my
trans.).</blockquote>

<p>

Lange holds, in other words, that one object of aesthetic admiration
and enjoyment is the relational event of artist <i>A</i> in
context <i>C</i> creating something sufficiently novel to provide an
audience with a certain type of pleasure. Lange explicitly insists
that the kind of value he has in mind is “in” the work,
but not an intrinsic feature of the (tokens of) the visually identical
image type.</p>

<p>

As will become apparent below, the debate between monisms and their
rivals in the ontology of art continues. A mapping of salient theses
is proposed in section 4.</p>

<h2 id="WhatSortEntiWorkArt">3. What sorts of entities are works of art?</h2>

<p>

Philosophers who have asked themselves what sorts of things works of
art are have had recourse to a bewildering array of received and newly
postulated ontological categories. The following survey is not
exhaustive, but identifies some of the most prominent proposals.</p>

<h3 id="PlatParaCrea">3.1 Platonism and the paradox of creation</h3>

<p>

Platonism about at least some works of art—understood broadly
as the thesis that a work is some kind of abstract entity having no
spatiotemporal location—has its advocates, such as Peter Kivy (1983,
1987) and Julian Dodd (2000, 2007, 2010). Noteworthy recent critiques of
Platonist assumptions in the ontology of art include Stephen Davies
(1993, 2003b, 2008), Predelli (1995), Saam Trivedi (2002), Andrew Kania
(2008a, 2008b), and David Davies (2009).</p>

<p>

Rudner raised an objection that would find multiple echoes in the
literature: if a work such as Beethoven’s <em>Fifth Symphony</em>
is an abstract entity, this would have “as a counter-intuitive
consequence a denial that Beethoven created the <em>Fifth
Symphony</em>” (1950, 385).</p>

<p>

Here we encounter a paradox, or incompatible conjunction of thoughts
each of which has some intuitive appeal when examined separately.
As Kania (2008a, 22) and Cameron (2008, 295) put it in the context of
discussions of the ontology of musical works, the inconsistent triad of
propositions may be specified as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
(A) Works of art are created.
<br />
(B) Works of art are abstract objects.
<br />
(C) Abstract objects cannot be created.

</blockquote>

<p>

Many philosophers (e.g., Wolterstorff 1980, Kivy 1987, Currie 1989)
have denied (A). For others, such as Haig Khatchadourian (1960) and
Renée Cox (1985), works of art should be recognized as items
that come into existence and can be destroyed. Given this premise,
which is defended at length by Charles Nussbaum (2003), the trio may
be interpreted as a <em>reductio</em> of (B).  Another strategy is to
restore coherence by attenuating (C). Margaret MacDonald (1952–1953) proposes that works are abstract types that are genuinely created by the artist or author. Similarly, Thomasson argues
that at least some works of art (i.e., musical and literary works) are
a kind of “abstract artifact” meriting recognition as
genuine creations (1999, 2005, 2006a, 2006b, 2010). Barry Smith (2008)
also argues for what he calls ‘quasi-abstract
patterns’, which like numbers are nonphysical and
nonpsychological, but which are tied, through the actions of agents,
to a time and historical context. Anthony Ralls (1972) characterizes
works as created universals concretely embodied through the
intentional activities of artists. Peter Alward (2004) contends that
the paradox is generated by inappropriate assumptions about types, and
that genuine artistic creation is compatible with a continuant/stage
model of works and performances.</p>

<p>

Many philosophers in search of conceptual resources that might be
useful in responding to the questions about what sorts of entities
works of art are have had recourse to some version of Charles Sanders
Peirce’s type-token distinction (1931–1955, IV, para. 537).
One idea has been that as a special sort of abstraction, types have
features that can help solve the paradox of creation and other vexed
issues in the ontology of art. As becomes apparent below,
however, the conclusions on this score have been quite diverse.</p>

<h3 id="TypeTokeDist">3.2 Type-token distinctions</h3>

<p>

Although Wollheim has at times wrongly been credited with this move
(e.g., Hick 2011, 188, n. 15), the earliest explicit reference to the
type-token distinction in the literature on the ontology of art is to
be found in Rudner (1950). Subsequent philosophers who discussed
applications of type-token distinctions in the philosophy of art
include Charles Stevenson (1957, 1958), Meager (1958–59) Margolis
(1958, 1959, 1961), W. D. L. Scobie (1960), Wacker (1960),
Khatchadourian (1960), Ruth Saw (1961), Donald F. Henze (1957, 1961),
Jay E. Bacharach (1971), Nigel Harrison (1975), and R. A. Sharpe (1979,
1995, 2001).</p>

<p>

Rudner brought up the type-token distinction in the context of a
critique of Lewis’s (1946) idea that a work of art is a
contextualized abstract entity. Rudner conjectured that what
Lewis had in mind in talking about the relationship between an abstract
entity and its renditions or instances was the type-token
relation. This conjecture might not have been far off, especially
given that Lewis was one of the first American philosophers to read his
way through the Peircean <em>Nachlass</em>, which he found stored in
cartons in the first office he was assigned at Harvard.</p>

<p>

Stevenson (1957) reached for a type/token distinction in an attempt
to disambiguate the intuitively appealing idea that a poem is a written
or spoken sequence of words. ‘Word’, Stevenson notes,
is ambiguous between the particular instance or token and the type of
word. While he finds it tempting to rule that the poem is the
type (of word sequence), Stevenson considers this to be incompatible
with ordinary discourse about literature, as when we use the title of a
work to refer to a particular token, saying “Please hand me
<em>Paradise Lost</em>.” Stevenson considers it best to
allow that the work is either a type or a token, leaving the task of
disambiguation to context-sensitive usage. He explicitly rejects
René Wellek and Austin Warren’s (1942) Ingarden-inspired
thesis that a work is an abstract item, namely a stratified system of
norms. In order to accommodate the idea that meaning is also
essential to the kind of thing a poem is, Stevenson uses the term
‘megatype’ to pick out classes of word sequences having the
same meaning, so that a poem is identifiable as a megatype.
Megatypes, he would appear to believe, are ultimately reducible to
“a special kind of physical object or event” (1958, 41 n.
2), but it is not clear how this analysis will proceed: is the
conjunction of a meaningful text type and the text types of all of its
past, present, and future faithful translations a physical object or
event?</p>

<p>

In an extended criticism of particularist accounts of the
individuation and evaluation of works, Meager characterizes a work as
either a spatiotemporal object or performance that manifests a pattern
of elements that is the product of a person’s (or group of persons’)
activity, where the activity was not a matter of copying or servile
imitation, and where the object or performance is evaluated
non-instrumentally. The concept of a work of art, she comments,
“operates in a rather special way as a universal defined by a
spatio-temporal particular, which may itself therefore be regarded as
a type-universal” (1958–59, 59). According to Meager, the
identity of the individual artist is not a factor of work
individuation: should two different persons independently author poems
that happen to consist in the same sequence of words, they have
independently authored the same work, even if their motives,
intentions, and contexts are strikingly different.</p>

<p>

Turning now to Wollheim’s influential application of a type-token
distinction (1968, 1980), what is most noteworthy about his
articulation of the idea that at least some works of art are best
categorized as types is the reason he gives for saying that types are
different from other “generic entities,” and in
particular, universals. The relation between a type and its tokens is,
according to Wollheim, “more intimate” than the relation
between a universal (e.g., a property) and its instances. Whereas the
property <em>being white</em> is not itself white, all and only those
properties that a token has by virtue of its being a token of a given
type are “transmitted” to that type as well: as no bit of
cloth that is not rectangular can be a correctly formed token of the
type <em>The Union Jack</em>, it follows that the property of being
rectangular also belongs to the type <em>The Union Jack</em>. This
idea is endorsed by Oswald Hanfling (1992, 80–82), Linda Wetzel
(2009), and others.</p>

<p>

This contention about the “intimate” relation between
types, tokens, and their instantiations of properties leaves one to
wonder how Wollheim conceived of both universals and types.  Unlike
Peirce, he does not hold that the existence of a type depends on that
of at least one token; Wollheim seems inclined to accept types as a
species of autonomously existing abstract object. Yet if any item that
instantiates the property <em>rectangular</em> must be spatial, and if
every token of <em>The Union Jack</em> instantiates that property,
then it follows from Wollheim’s claim that <em>The Union Jack</em>
is, <em>qua</em> type, rectangular. It would appear to follow from
this that the type must be a concrete, spatially located entity, since
anything that can be a particular instantiation of a spatial property
must be located in space. Yet one of the main reasons for going in for
the theory of types in the first place was Peirce’s basic observation
that while token word inscriptions of ‘the’ have their
times and places, the word <em>the</em>, <em>qua</em> type, has no
location. Is it sound to postulate the existence of an autonomous
abstraction having spatial or temporal features?</p>

<p>

Reicher (1998) acknowledges that if works are types, they cannot literally have spatiotemporal properties. With the aim of providing a more accurate restatement of ordinary talk about the perceptible qualities of works, she distinguishes between two different modes of predication. In an example of a first mode of predication, someone says ‘the table is rectangular’. This is contrasted to a different mode whereby we say, for example, ‘this work of art is determined as [<em>ist bestimmt als</em>] rectangular’. If a work of art has been determined as rectangular, then every realization of the work is rectangular. We can perceive a work’s realizations, as these are concrete objects or actions, but strictly speaking, we apprehend [<em>erfassen</em>] but do not perceive the type itself. (For background on this approach, see the entry on nonexistent objects.)</p>

<h3 id="NormKind">3.3 Norm-kinds</h3>

<p>

Wolsterstorff complains that Wollheim’s thesis about the
sharing of properties among types and their tokens gives us “no
illumination” with respect to the pattern of such sharing (1975,
239). Shifting to the terminology of ‘kinds’ and
‘examples’, Wolterstorff focuses on properties that are
necessary to “properly formed” examples of a kind, where
the kind in question is a “norm-kind” that can (but need
not) have both improperly and properly formed instances. For
example, some seriously flawed attempts to play a difficult piece by
Chopin are nonetheless performances of that work, even though they lack
qualities that a proper or a good instance of the work would
have. This proposal seems made to order for the many cases where
significantly different artistic and aesthetic properties figure within
the occurrences or performances of one and the same work (on this
theme, see also Walton 1977).</p>

<p>

Wolterstorff accepts the thesis that works of art neither come into
nor go out of existence (1980, 88–89). A kind, <i>K</i>, exists
if and only if the correlated property, <i>k</i>, exists. With regard
to the existence of properties, Wolterstorff’s initial view (1970) was
that for any property, <em>being-f</em>, this property exists just in
case either something is-<em>f</em> or something is
not-<em>f</em>. Criticisms (John Perry 1974) involving Russell’s
paradox of unexemplified properties led him to qualify this
“general predicate entailment principle.”</p>

<p>

Wolterstorff holds that the sequences of sounds and words of which
musical and literary works are made up exist everlastingly. What
the artist does in creating a work, then, is to make it the case that a
“preexistent kind becomes <em>a work</em>—specifically, a
work <em>of his</em>” (1980, 89). Wolterstorff’s
idea, then, is that a composer can select but not create a sound
pattern or type of sound-occurrence. Although the latter is an
entity that already exists, it is not a musical work unless some
composer has determined and perhaps recorded its correctness conditions
<em>qua</em> work. Wolterstorff remarks that the composing of a
musical work is similar to the inventing of a game (1980, 63).</p>

<h3 id="ArtiActi">3.4 Artifacts and actions</h3>

<p>

That the arts are a matter of the rational production and judgement of
artifacts was widely accepted by medieval thinkers (for background,
see Eco 1988, 164–165). For example, in the discussion of
iconoclasm in the <em>Opus Caroli regis contra synodum</em> (ca. 794),
Theodulf of Orléans characterized pictures
as <em>manufacta</em> (Noble 2009, 227, 347). As Aquinas puts it
in <em>Summa Theologica</em> (I-II, 57, 4c), “ars est recta
ratio factibilium” [art is the right reason of things to be
made, or more bluntly, art is knowing how to make things]. In keeping
with this tradition, Kant (1790) identified a work or <em>opus</em> as
the product of a doing [<em>Tun</em>] (<em>facere</em>), to which he
contrasted the effects of nature, such as a beehive. Only what is the
product of the exercise of a capacity to choose [<em>eine
Willkür</em>] is art (<em>Kritik der Urteilskraft</em>, paragraph
43). (For commentary on Kant’s definitions of art and fine art, see
Paul Guyer 1997.)</p>

<p>

Bernard Bolzano’s neglected (1849) essay on the nature and
classification of works of art similarly begins with an emphasis on
the necessity of the artist’s intentional activity to the creation of
a work, yet Bolzano goes on to allow that some works of art are
created solely by means of the artist’s thoughts. Such works consist
entirely of the artist’s voluntary subjective presentations or
intentional entertaining of propositions (for background, see Blaukopf
1996, Reicher 2006). Bolzano adds that the free and intentional
production of such inner representations often plays a crucial role in
the creation of those works of art, such as statues and songs, that
are perceptible to an audience.</p>

<p>

Philosophers who have more recently classified works of art as
artifacts include Marcia Eaton (1969), Gary Iseminger (1973), Denis
Dutton (1979), Risto Hilpinen (1992, 1993), Thomasson (1999), and
Levinson (2007) (for background, see the entry on artifacts).</p>

<h4>3.4.1 Indicated structures and objects</h4>

<p>

Levinson advocates a “contextualism” in aesthetics (2005),
which is not to be confounded, however, with the approach defended by
Pepper (1937a, 1968, 1970) under the same label.</p>

<p>

In his (1980a, 1990) Levinson sets forth and defends an
account of “paradigm musical works,” i.e., fully notated
“classical” compositions within Western culture. His
proposal is motivated by the attempt to meet what he takes to be three
salient requirements on an adequate ontology of works of this sort:
creatability, fine individuation, and the inclusion of performance
means.</p>

<p>

The first requirement specifies that “Musical works must be such
that they do not exist prior to the composer’s compositional activity,
but are brought into existence by that activity” (1980,
68). Like Wolterstorff, Levinson allows that all possible sounds, and
patterns and sequences thereof, preexist anyone’s compositional
activities. The creatability requirement must be compatible with this
assumption. The claim is not, then, that composers can bring musical
structures into existence; what they can do, however is
“indicate” a structural type along with a
“performance means” or manner of generating instances or
tokens of sound sequences of that type. A musical work is, then, a
relational entity of the sort “sound structure and
performance-means as indicated by artist <i>X</i> at
time <i>t</i>.” This sort of abstract item, Levinson writes,
“does not preexist the activity of composition and is thus
capable of being created” (1980a, 79; cf. John Andrew Fisher
1991). Entities of this sort, it seems, only come into existence
through an actual event of indication performed by a person (or
persons) in some context.  Terms figuring alongside
‘indicate’ in Levinson’s descriptions of what the artist
does with the abstract object include ‘discover’,
‘choose’, and ‘demonstrate’ (1990).</p>

<p>

Levinson’s fine individuation requirement springs from the
intuition that if two composers were to indicate the same
sound-structure, they would not thereby generate the same musical
work. The contrary intuition had been forwarded by Wolterstorff
(1975, 248) and criticized in Walton (1977) and Savile (1971).
Levinson entertains the possibility that the identity of the composer
is not necessarily essential to the individuation of works; perhaps it
is at least logically possible for a work to be composed by a person
other than the one who actually did so. Levinson explores the
thesis that something like sameness of musical-historical context is a
constraint sufficient to satisfy the requirement of “fine-grained
individuation.”</p>

<p>

Levinson proposes, then, that some musical works may be classified
as “initiated types,” that is, types that are brought into
being by an intentional action of indication performed upon a pure
structure. With regard to works of visual art, Levinson (1996)
defends the idea that at least some such works are physical objects as
intended by the artist for a certain regard or treatment. The
work is the relational entity comprised of the object or structure and
the artist’s action in a context.</p>

<p>

Currie objects that Levinson’s ontological category,
‘structure-as-indicated-by-artist at time <i>t</i>’ is
“metaphysically obscure” (1989, 58). Fleming discovered
penicillin, but do we want to add that in so doing he also created the
entity penicillin-as-discovered-by-Fleming? Levinson is explicitly
committed to the idea that when the artist indicates or discovers the
abstract structure, “something further comes into
existence,” namely, an “initiated type” (1990,
262). Currie’s point is that if this is allowed, various unwanted
ontological commitments follow. A related criticism raised by Dodd
(2000), Predelli (2001), and Alward (2004) is that indicating is not
really a matter of creating, and if this is correct, it follows that
Levinson’s proposal does not satisfy the first of his three
requirements on an adequate ontology.</p>

<p>

Currie also raises the objection that Levinson’s account does
not individuate works adequately; this objection has been further
pursued by David Davies (2004). And Lamarque (2010) contends that
there is an indeterminacy as to which tokens are of a given indicated
type.</p>

<p>

In response to James Anderson’s (1985) suggestion that Levinson’s
proposal could be amplified with reference to Wolterstorff’s ideas
about norm-kinds, Levinson (1990) expresses reservations about the
latter, but adds that the notion that the artist makes certain
features normative for a work helps explain in what
‘indicating’ a structure consists.</p>

<h4>3.4.2 Action types and performances</h4>

<p>

Various philosophers have explored the basic idea that works should be
classified as actions or performances as opposed to the products or
objects that may result from such activities. Croce, Collingwood, and
Dewey are early and highly influential examples. In a review of
Dewey’s aesthetics, Croce makes a list of familiar ideas to be found
in Dewey’s work. One of these ideas, which he says was formulated much
earlier in Italy, is that “there are not artistic
‘things’, but only an artistic doing, an artistic
producing” (1948, 205). Jeffrey Maitland (1975) similarly
suggests that the work of art is a “doing”, but also
declares that a work is a “performative presence.” Denis
Dutton writes that “As performances, works of art represent the
ways in which artists solve problems, overcome obstacles, make do with
available materials.” (1979, 305). He adds in the same context
that “the work of art has a human origin, and must be understood
as such”.</p>

<p>

Sparshott (1980, 1982) conceives of a work as a performance, and
more specifically, as an action when it is conceived in a certain way,
namely, as the establishment of a design. Work identity is
determined by both the nature of this design and the type of action
that yielded it: same design and origin, same work.
Sparshott’s evocation of a unity of outcome and agency is
complicated, however, by the fact that he thinks in terms of
reconstructed or idealized, nonfactual artistic intentions, as opposed
to the actual intentions and actions of the artist or artists
responsible for the production of a “system of
qualities.”</p>

<p>

Currie (1989) proposes that all artworks belong to the category of
action types. Works are types of events, then, and events are said by
Currie to be a “natural ontological category.” Although
Currie says he wants to stay neutral on issues pertaining to the
nature and individuation of events, he at least provisionally works
with Jaegwon Kim’s (1976) conception of events as property
exemplifications by an object or substance (or ordered <i>n</i>-tuple
of objects/substances) at a time. As types, works could not themselves
literally be events, and Currie’s event-types are individuated in ways
that abstract from the “constitutive substance” figuring
within Kim’s basically Aristotelian perspective on events.</p>

<p>

More specifically, Currie’s proposal is that a work is an
action type of the form:</p>

<blockquote>

An agent, <i>A</i>, discovers a structure, <i>s</i>, via a heuristic
path, <i>H</i>, at a time, <i>t</i>.</blockquote>

<p>

Currie allows that the artist does not create the work of art.
Nor does the artist discover it. The artist can discover a
preexisting abstract artistic structure, but the work is an action type
that the artist “performs” in so doing.</p>

<p>

Currie explains that the heuristic path is the “way in which
the artist arrived at the final product.” Neither a
particular agent nor a specific time is essential to the action type
that is the work of art: someone else could discover the same structure
at a different time yet instantiate the same work. Currie
conjectures, for example, that if “Picasso’s twin on
‘Twin Earth’ produces a canvas indistinguishable from
Picasso’s <em>Guernica</em>, and if he does so in the same way,
then <em>Guernica</em> and <em>Twin Guernica</em> are instances of the
same work” (1989, 9). Currie also introduces a similar
conjecture involving Beethoven, twin Beethoven, and twin tokens of the
Hammerklavier sonata.</p>

<p>

Wolterstorff (1992) and Levinson (1992) complain that a
counterintuitive implication of Currie’s proposal is that one
cannot read a literary work. Levinson (1992) takes up the
question of work individuation and asks whether Beethoven and twin
Beethoven really make the same works, even though they act within
qualitatively identical cultures and come up with tokens of the same artistic
structure via qualitatively identical paths. Do such examples
carry any weight in an ontology of art?</p>

<p>

Questions have been raised (e.g., by Levinson 1992 and David Davies
2004) about Currie’s Lakatos-inspired notion of the artist’s heuristic
path, beginning with the obvious query as to what is and is not
included in the “way” the artist discovers the
structure. Currie allows that the path can include facts unknown to
the artist if they are deemed relevant to the appreciation of his or
her achievement. For example, even if Virginia Woolf did not know of
Marcel Proust’s work when she wrote <em>Jacob’s Room</em>, she could
“in principle” have known about it, and so Proust’s prior
inventions are relevant to our understanding of Woolf’s achievement.
Currie acknowledges that his notion of a heuristic path is vague, and
he entertains the possibility that describing the heuristic of a work
“starts to look like writing the history of the universe”
(1989, 72). Yet he optimistically predicts that there “will be
wide agreement about how the idea is to be applied in particular
cases” (1989, 73). More specifically, he indicates that
“case studies” in the analysis of such heuristics can be
found in Michael Baxandall’s (1985).</p>

<p>

In his proposal for an alternative to contextualist ontologies of
art, David Davies (2004, 2005) proposes that works of art are best
classified, not as indicated structures or as action types, but as
action tokens. A work of art, then, is a ‘doing’ or
generative performance. Davies further analyzes the latter as a
sequence of “motivated manipulations of a vehicular medium
through which a particular focus of appreciation is
specified” (2005a, 75). With regard to the bedeviled
question of which factors in the historical context of a work’s
creation do and do not determine the identity of the work (a question
that is taken to be distinct from the question as to which factors are
in some broad sense relevant to the work’s understanding and
appreciation), Davies identifies what he calls the artist’s
“primary motivation,” which governs activities that specify
an artistic vehicle that articulates a given artistic content. It
is these art-content-articulating manipulations of artistic vehicles
that qualify as elements in the performance that is identified with the
work. For example, whether an artist’s intentional
ingestion of a drug during the making of the “focus of
appreciation” or product of the generative performance is to be
counted as part of the work depends, then, on whether this action is
part of a manipulation of an artistic vehicle effectively designed to
articulate some aspect of the work’s content.</p>

<p>

Dilworth (2005b) objects that Davies’s basic contention to the
effect that works are action tokens is incompatible with his claim that
works, conceived of as a particular generative performance, have a kind
of “modal flexibility,” which means that the same work
could have had different properties (e.g., it could have been created a
few minutes earlier or later). Other critics (Kania 2005, Stecker
2005) believe Davies provides insufficient grounds for the adoption of
a highly revisionary ontological doctrine that gives the lie to
countless ordinary statements about works of art, such as “the
<em>Mona Lisa</em> can be seen at Le Louvre.” This
criticism echoes Mary McCarthy’s remark in response to Harold
Rosenberg’s proposal that action paintings are not pictures but
“events”: “You cannot hang an event on a wall, only a
picture” (Rosenberg 1962, 5).</p>

<p>

Davies (or the proponent of any other ontological account that
diverges from ordinary language) may respond that the goal is not to
mirror all everyday utterances, but to articulate an accurate
ontological doctrine. Davies in fact contends that his proposal
is meant to obey a “pragmatic constraint” to the effect
that “Artworks must be conceived ontologically in such as way as
to accord with those features of our critical and appreciative practice
upheld on rational reflection” (2004, 23). Yet if it is
acknowledged that art-world practices are contradictory, changing, and
theory-infested, the question (Livingston 2005b) is on what grounds a
philosopher’s “rational reflection” can single out
those practices that can provide a non-circular basis for an
ontological thesis. Stecker (2009) argues that Davies’s
pragmatic constraint is too broad to single out the performance theory
or any of the other rival ontological proposals. The pragmatic,
referential core of our talk about musical works requires them to be
audible, repeatable, and performable, and this is compatible with
contextualism and other rivals to Davies’s proposal, but not with
Davies’s proposal itself.</p>

<h3 id="HistIndi">3.5 Historical individuals</h3>

<p>

Guy Rohrbaugh (2003) argues that even in the case of
‘repeatable’ works such as photographs, the category of
types does not adequately capture at least three fundamental features
of works of art: temporality (they come into existence and can cease to
exist), temporal flexibility (some of their qualities can change over
time), and modal flexibility (a work could have had properties other
than those it actually has). Rohrbaugh denies that a work or its
vehicle has all of its intrinsic features essentially. It is
widely accepted that some (but not too many) of the artistic features
of a painting or a photograph could have been slightly different.
According to Rohrbaugh, type theories, including those that include
features of the structure’s historical provenance amongst the
conditions on being a token of a given artwork type, cannot accommodate
this sort of modal flexibility. Rohrbaugh proposes instead that
works of art should be conceived of as “historical
individuals” that persist through time in an ontologically
dependent fashion.</p>

<h2 id="MappOntoThes">4. Mapping ontological theses</h2>

<p>

In light of the array of positions surveyed above, we may revisit
Sibley’s claim about a ‘two-way pull’ at the heart of
our practices and conceptions related to works of art. Doing so
will shed some light on at least one central aspect of the debate
between monists and their rivals in the ontology of art.</p>

<p>

We start with a broad distinction between the work and its vehicle,
where the term ‘vehicle’ names different sorts of items
that might be considered constituents or parts of
a work of art, such as the particular poplar board on which Da Vinci
worked for some ten years in making the <em>Mona Lisa</em>, the
specific gestures made by a performance artist, or a readily
reproducible inscription produced by a poet.</p>

<p>

If such a work/vehicle distinction is accepted (and as was noted
above, this is the case for some but not all philosophers), the
question of whether all or only some works admit of multiple instances
can be distinguished from the question of whether all artistic vehicles
can be reproduced in a manner that satisfies some standard of
qualitative artistic or aesthetic identity. Such a standard would
be met just in case the artistic item in question can be reproduced in
such a way that the relevant artistic or aesthetic properties are
manifested. Our two questions, then, are:</p>

<blockquote>

(Q1) Are all artistic vehicles multiple?
<br />
(Q2) Are all works of art multiple?</blockquote>

<p>

Salient answers to these questions are:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>(A1) Some vehicles are singular, some are multiple (e.g., they are
abstracta that can have multiple occurrences), and the works of which
they are parts or constituents are respectively singular and multiple;</p>

<p>(A2) All vehicles are multiple, and so are the works of which
they are parts or constituents.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>

Versions of (A2) are defended by prominent advocates of ontological
monism. One might think that the critics of ontological monism
all espouse (A1), but this is not correct, since some of these
philosophers do not accept a vehicle/work distinction to begin with,
and there are other grounds for rejecting monism. Also (A1) is
compatible with several different theses.</p>

<p>

What are some of these options? At least some of the disputes
between proponents of monism and its rivals in the ontology of art have
pivoted on equivocation regarding the kind of possibility envisaged in
discussions of multiplicity and singularity. It is one thing to
argue that it is impossible to make a perfect replica of an ancient
building either because our current technology will not allow it, or,
more boldly, because it is physically impossible given the laws of
nature (and so “nomologically” impossible). When
Ushenko, Strawson, Currie and other writers have evoked the
‘possibility’ of a machine that gives us perfect replicas
of things like the vehicle of the <em>Guernica</em>, they are quite
obviously abstracting away from the limitations of our current
technology. Currie says explicitly that his twin
<em>Guernica</em> conjecture ranges over “physically
impossible” worlds (1989, 111). C. I. Lewis’s
evocation of iterable “aesthetic essences” is similarly a
matter of a metaphysical or logical possibility, not a technological
one. In sharp contrast, when Focillon (1934, 56) asserted that
certain kinds of reproductions were “impossible,” he
clearly had in mind what could and could not be done given the
technical and other constraints of an actual historical period. A
similar assumption becomes explicit in Gérard Genette’s
discussion of this topic when he claims that the iterability of
artistic items depends upon institutional contingencies (1994,
101–102; Livingston 2012).</p>

<p>

Indicating what is meant by ‘possible’ and
‘impossible’ in this context is crucial to a more precise
identification of the available theses. Here is a sample:</p>

<blockquote>

(T1) It is technologically possible to make multiple
instances of some but not all artistic vehicles, yet it is logically
or metaphysically impossible for there to be multiple instances of any
<em>work</em>, because a work is a particular object, action, or
event;

<p>
(T2) It is technologically possible to make multiple instances of
some but not all artistic vehicles, and it is logically or
metaphysically possible for there to be multiple instances of some but
not all works, as some works are abstractions or types;</p>

<p>
(T3) It is nomologically possible to make multiple instances of any
artistic vehicle, but it is logically or metaphysically impossible for
there to be multiple instances of any work, because a work is a
particular object, action, or event;</p>

<p>
(T4) It is metaphysically possible to make multiple instances of any
artistic vehicle, and it is (in some sense) possible for there to be
multiple instances of some but not all works, because some works are
abstract types;</p>
<p>
(T5) It is metaphysically possible to make multiple instances of any
artistic vehicle, and it is metaphysically possible for there to be
multiple instances of all works, because all works are abstract
types.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>

It turns out, then, that at least some of the apparent disagreements
in the literature hinge on disparate assumptions about what sorts of
possibilities are relevant or decisive in discussions of the nature of
works of art. If we go on to ask what grounds philosophers have had
for deeming a given kind of possibility relevant or even decisive, a
prevalent answer is that such decisions should be constrained by our
interest in aesthetic or artistic appreciation. Currie, for example,
in his defense of a version of (A2)/(T5), contrasts an
“historical” interest in seeing something like Napoleon’s
boots or the actual canvas of <em>Guernica</em> to the
“aesthetic interest” that could, in the case of the work
of art, be equally well served by the scrutiny of a perfect replica of
the picture (1989, 102, 105). Yet as was noted above, Ingarden
explicitly evokes an aesthetic response in his articulation of the
idea that the work is an individual, even if it is possible to create
multiple reproductions of the building constitutive of the cathedral
of Notre Dame de Paris. A plausible diagnostic (Livingston 2013) is
that at least some of the diversity of opinion in ontology reappears
when we turn to conceptions of aesthetic and artistic value and
appreciation.
</p>

<p>

In light of this variety of theses and sources of divergent
assumptions and conclusions, it would appear that Sibley’s talk
of a “two-way pull” was something of an
oversimplification.</p>
