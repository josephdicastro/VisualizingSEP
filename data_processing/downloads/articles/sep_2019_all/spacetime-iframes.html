<h1>Space and Time: Inertial Frames</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Sat Mar 30, 2002; substantive revision Wed Nov 4, 2009</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>

A “frame of reference” is a standard relative to which
motion and rest may be measured; any set of points or objects that are
at rest relative to one another enables us, in principle, to describe
the relative motions of bodies. A frame of reference is therefore a
purely kinematical device, for the geometrical description of motion
without regard to the masses or forces involved. A dynamical account of
motion leads to the idea of an “inertial frame,” or a
reference frame relative to which motions have distinguished dynamical
properties. For that reason an inertial frame has to be understood as a
spatial reference frame together with some means of measuring time, so
that uniform motions can be distinguished from accelerated motions. The
laws of Newtonian dynamics provide a simple definition: an inertial
frame is a reference-frame with a time-scale, relative to which the
motion of a body not subject to forces is always rectilinear and
uniform, accelerations are always proportional to and in the direction
of applied forces, and applied forces are always met with equal and
opposite reactions. It follows that, in an inertial frame, the center
of mass of a system of bodies is always at rest or in uniform motion.
It also follows that any other frame of reference moving uniformly
relative to an inertial frame is also an inertial frame. For example,
in Newtonian celestial mechanics, taking the “fixed stars”
as a frame of reference, we can determine an (approximately) inertial
frame whose center is the center of mass of the solar system; relative
to this frame, every acceleration of every planet can be accounted for
(approximately) as a gravitational interaction with some other planet
in accord with Newton's laws of motion.</p>

<p>

This appears to be a simple and straightforward concept. By
inquiring more narrowly into its origins and meaning, however, we begin
to understand why it has been an ongoing subject of philosophical
concern. It originated in a profound philosophical consideration of the
principles of relativity and invariance in the context of Newtonian
mechanics. Further reflections on it, in different theoretical
contexts, had extraordinary consequences for 20<sup>th</sup>-century
theories of space and time.</p>

<h2><a name="RelRefFraClaMec">1. Relativity and Reference Frames in Classical Mechanics</a></h2>

<h3><a name="OriGalRel">1.1 The Origins of Galilean Relativity</a></h3>

<p>

The term “reference frame” was coined in the
19<sup>th</sup> century, but it has a long prehistory, beginning,
perhaps, with the emergence of the Copernican theory. The significant
point was not the replacement of the earth by the sun as the center of
all motion in the universe, but the recognition of both the earth and
the sun as merely possible points of view from which the motions of the
celestial bodies may be described. This implied that the basic task of
Ptolemaic astronomy—to represent the planetary motions by
combinations of circular motions—could take any point to be
fixed, and that, as Copernicus suggested in the opening arguments of
“On the revolutions of the heavenly spheres,” the choice of
any particular point required some justification on other than
astronomical grounds. As the basic programme of Ptolemy and Copernicus
gave way to that of early classical mechanics, this equivalence of
points of view was made more precise and explicit. Galileo demonstrated
that the Copernican view does not contradict our experience of a
seemingly stable earth, through a principle that, in the precise form
that it takes in Newtonian mechanics, has become known as the
“principle of Galilean relativity”: mechanical experiments
will have the same results in a system in uniform motion that they have
in a system at rest. Therefore the experiments claimed as evidence
against Copernicus—e.g., that a stone dropped from a tower
falls to the base of the tower, instead of being left behind—would happen just as they do whether the earth were moving or not,
provided that the motion is sufficiently uniform. See Figure 1.</p>

<blockquote><img src="figure1.gif" alt="figure 1" />
<br />
 <strong>Figure 1: Galileo's Argument</strong>
<br />
 If the earth is rotating sufficiently uniformly, a stone dropped from
the tower will fall straight to the base, just as a stone dropped from
the mast of a uniformly moving ship will fall to the foot of the mast.
In both cases the stone's vertical motion will be smoothly composed
with its horizontal motion. Hence a sufficiently uniform motion will be
indistinguishable from rest.</blockquote>

<h3><a name="PhiConOveAbsRelMot">1.2 Philosophical Controversy Over Absolute and Relative Motion</a></h3>

<p>

Leibniz, later, articulated a more general “equipollence of
hypotheses”: in any system of interacting bodies, any hypothesis
that any particular body is at rest is equivalent to any other.
Therefore neither Copernicus' nor Ptolemy's view can be true—though one may be judged simpler than the other—because both
are merely possible hypothetical interpretations of the same relative
motions. This principle clearly defines (what we would call) a set of
reference frames, differing in their arbitrary choices of a resting
point or origin, but agreeing on the relative positions of bodies at
any moment and their changing relative distances through time.</p>

<p>

For Leibniz and many others, this general equivalence was a matter
of philosophical principle, founded in the metaphysical conviction that
space itself is nothing more than an abstraction from the geometrical
relations among bodies. In some form or other it was a widely shared
tenet of the 17<sup>th</sup>-century “mechanical
philosophy”. Yet it was flatly incompatible with physics as
Leibniz himself, and the other “mechanists,” actually
conceived it. For the basic program of mechanical explanation depended
essentially on the concept of a privileged state of motion, as
expressed in the assumption that bodies maintain a state of rectilinear
motion until acted upon by an external cause. Thus their fundamental
conception of force, as the power of a body to change the state of
another, likewise depended on this notion of a privileged state. This
dependence was clearly exhibited in the vortex theory of planetary
motion, in which every orbit was explained by the balance between the
planet's inherent centrifugal tendency (its tendency to follow the
tangent to the orbit) and the pressure of the surrounding medium.</p>

<p>

For this reason, the notion of a dispute between
“relativists” or “relationists” and
“absolutists” or “substantivalists”, in the
17<sup>th</sup> century, is a drastic oversimplification. Newton, in
his controversial Scholium on space, time, and motion, was not merely
asserting that motion is absolute in the face of the mechanists'
relativist view; he was arguing that a conception of absolute motion
was already implicit in the views of his opponents—that it was
implicit in their conception, which he largely shared, of physical
cause and effect. The general equivalence of reference-frames was
implicitly denied by a physics that understood forces as powers to
change the states of motion of bodies.</p>

<p>

Newton therefore held that physics required the conception of
absolute space, a distinguished frame of reference relative to which
bodies could be said to be truly moving or truly at rest. Assuming, as
both Newton and Leibniz did, that states of motion could be
distinguished by their causes and effects, the distinguished status of
this frame of reference is physically well founded—and
metaphysically well-founded for a metaphysics that, like Newton's or
Leibniz's, takes force to be a well-founded notion. On Leibniz's
conception of force, in particular, a given force is required to
generate <em>or to maintain</em> a given velocity—for objects
“passively” resist motion, but maintain their states of
motion only by “active” force—so that, on dynamical
grounds, “every body truly does have a certain amount of motion,
or, if you will, force.” This implies that there is in principle
a distinguished frame of reference in which the velocities of bodies
correspond to their true velocities, i.e. to the amounts of moving
force that they truly possess, and it implies that in any frame that is
in motion relative to this one, bodies will not have their true
velocities. In short, such a conception of force, if it could be
applied physically, would give a precise physical application of
Newton's conception of absolute space.</p>

<h3><a name="GalRelNewPhy">1.3 Galilean Relativity in Newtonian Physics</a></h3>

<p>

The difficulty with Newton's view of absolute space comes from the
Newtonian conception of force. If force is defined and measured solely
by the power to accelerate a body, then obviously the effects of forces—in short, the causal interactions within a system of bodies—will be independent of the velocity of the system in which they
are measured. So the existence of a set of equivalent “inertial
frames” is imposed from the start by Newton's laws. Suppose that
we determine for the bodies in a given frame of reference—say,
the rest frame of the fixed stars—that all observable
accelerations are proportional to forces impressed by bodies within the
system, by equal and opposite actions and reactions among those bodies.
Then we know that these physical interactions will be the same in any
frame of reference that is in uniform rectilinear motion relative to
the first one. Therefore no Newtonian experiment will be able to
determine the velocity of a body, or system of bodies, relative to
absolute space. In other words, there is no way to distinguish absolute
space itself from any frame of reference that is in uniform motion
relative to it. Newton thought that a coherent account of force and
motion requires a background space consisting of “places”
that “all keep given positions in relation to one another from
infinity to infinity” (1726, p. 412). But the laws of motion
enable us to determine an infinity of such spaces, all in uniform
rectilinear motion relative to each other, and furnish no way of
singling out any one as “immovable space.”</p>

<p>

Oddly enough, no one in the 17<sup>th</sup> century, or even before
the late 19<sup>th</sup> century, expressed this equivalence of
reference-frames more clearly than Newton himself. Newton explicitly
derived it from the laws of motion as Corollary V:</p>

<blockquote><strong>Corollary V</strong>:
<br />
 When bodies are enclosed in a given space, their motions in relation
to one another are the same whether the space is at rest or whether it
is moving uniformly straight forward without circular motion. (1726, p.
423.)</blockquote>

<p>

This is the first clear statement of the Galilean relativity principle.
It implied that the dispute between the heliocentric and geocentric
views of the universe was mistakenly framed: the proper question about
“the system of the world” was not “which body is at
rest in the center?” but “where is the center of gravity of
the system, and which body is closest to it?” For in a system of
orbiting bodies, only their common center of gravity will be
unaccelerated, and by Corollary V, the motions of the bodies in the
system will be the same, whether its center of gravity is at rest or in
uniform rectilinear motion. The system is indeed approximately
Keplerian, since the sun has by far the greatest mass and is therefore
little disturbed from the center of gravity, which is therefore very
close to the common focus of the approximately Keplerian ellipses in
which the planets orbit the sun. But by Corollary V, the
nearly-Keplerian structure of the system is completely independent of
the system's state of motion in absolute space. </p>

<p>

The Galilean relativity principle thus expressed the insight that
different states of uniform motion, or different uniformly-moving
frames of reference, determine only different points of view on the
same physically objective quantities, namely force, mass, and
acceleration. We can see this insight expressed more explicitly in
Newton's understanding of inertia. For Leibniz (among others) , as we
saw, moving force, the power of a body to change the motion of another,
was determined by velocity. It was therefore seen as an active power,
fundamentally different from the passive power of a resting body to
resist any change of position. Newton, in contrast, understood the
“force of inertia” as a Galilei-invariant quantity:</p>

<blockquote>[A] body exerts this force only during a change of its
state, caused by another force impressed upon it, and the exercise of
this force is, depending on viewpoint, both resistance and impetus:
resistance in so far as the body, in order to maintain its state,
strives against the impressed force, and impetus in so far as the same
body, yielding only with difficulty to the force of a resisting
obstacle, endeavors to change the state of that obstacle. Resistance is
commonly attributed to resting bodies and impetus to moving bodies; but
motion and rest, in the popular sense of the term, are distinguished
from each other only by point of view, and bodies commonly regarded as
being at rest are not always truly at rest. (1726, p.
404–05.)</blockquote>

<p>

Newton thus recognized the powers distinguished by Leibniz as the same
thing seen from different points of view. </p>

<h3><a name="LinProAbsSpa">1.4 The Lingering Problem of Absolute Space</a></h3>

<p>

Newton understood the Galilean principle of relativity with a degree
of depth and clarity that eluded most of his “relativist”
contemporaries. It may seem bizarre, therefore, that the notion of
inertial frame did not emerge until more than a century and a half
after his death. He had identified a distinguished class of dynamically
equivalent “relative spaces,” in any of which true forces
and masses, accelerations and rotations, would have the same
objectively measured values. Yet these spaces, though empirically
indistinguishable, were not equivalent in principle; evidently Newton
conceived them as moving with various velocities in absolute space,
though those velocities could not be known. Why should not he, or
someone, have recognized the equivalence of these spaces
immediately?</p>

<p>

This is not the place for an adequate answer to this question, if
indeed one is possible. For much of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, the
accepted answer was that of Ernst Mach: Newton lived in an age
“deficient in epistemological critique,” and so was unable
to draw the conclusion that these <em>empirically</em>
indistinguishable spaces must be equivalent in <em>every</em>
meaningful sense, so that no one of them deserves even in principle to
be designated as “absolute space.” Yet even those whom the
20<sup>th</sup> century credited with more sophisticated
epistemological views, such as Leibniz, evidently had difficulties
understanding force and inertia in a Galilei-invariant way, despite a
philosophical commitment to relativity. Perhaps it suffices to say that
to abandon the intuitive association of force or motion with velocity
in space, and to accept an equivalence-class structure as the
fundamental spatiotemporal framework, requires a level of abstraction
that became possible only with the extraordinary development of
mathematics, especially of a more abstract view of geometry, that took
place in the 19<sup>th</sup> century. (See
 <a href="../geometry-19th/">geometry: in the 19th century</a>.)
 In the
17<sup>th</sup> century only Christiaan Huygens came close to
expressing such a view; he held that not velocity, but
velocity-difference, was the fundamental dynamical quantity. He
therefore understood, for example, that the “absoluteness”
of rotation had nothing to do with velocity relative to absolute space,
but arose from the difference of velocity among different parts of a
rotating body—a difference which would, evidently, be the same
irrespective of the velocity of the body as a whole in absolute space.
But of this Huygens gave only the merest suggestion, in manuscripts
that remained unpublished for two centuries. (See Stein 1977.) The
concept of inertial frame therefore emerged only in the late
19<sup>th</sup> century, when, as we shall see, it did not seem to be
of any great immediate importance.</p>

<p>

Meanwhile, the relativity principle was understood as the equivalence
of uniform states of motion, but any systems in such a state was
implicitly understood to have a definite, though unknown and
unknowable, velocity in absolute space. Euler (1748), for example,
defended Newton's conceptions of space and time against the thesis
that space and time are ideal, and motion merely relative; his broad
argument was that metaphysics had no standing to criticize conceptions
that are required by the established laws of physics. Yet he noted
that the laws of motion permit us to determine, not the velocity of
any motion in space, but only the absolute sameness of direction of an
inertial trajectory over time, and the equality of time-intervals in
which an inertially-moving particle moves equal distances. To Euler,
these irreducibly spatial and temporal aspects of the laws of motion
implied that space and time could not possibly be ideal. Like Newton,
therefore, he upheld both the relativity of velocity and the reality
of absolute space. The inconsistency of such a theory can be seen in
two ways. On the one hand, we can see it as a fundamental incoherence,
even if, again, we excuse those who held it on the grounds of the
limited mathematical tools available to them. On the other hand, it
does represent a deep appreciation of the indistinguishability of
velocities in absolute space, and a consequent effort to make sure
that the actual treatment of actual physical systems is not undermined
by this uncertainty. Newton hoped to analyze the dynamical
interactions that hold the solar system together; he wanted to show
that his dynamical account, and the view of “the frame of the
system of the world” that emerges from it, is a matter of
“reasoning from phenomena” rather than of plausible
conjecture. It was therefore a very circumspect, even prescient, move
on his part to demonstrate, through his use of Corollaries IV and V,
that the analysis is completely independent of any conceivable
translation of the system in absolute space.</p>

<h3><a name="19tCenAnaLawIne">1.5 19th-Century Analyses of the Law of Inertia</a></h3>

<p>

The development of this concept began with a renewed critical
analysis of the notion of absolute space, for reasons not anticipated
by Newton's contemporary critics. Its starting point was a critical
questions about the law of inertia: relative to what is the motion of a
free particle uniform and rectilinear? If the answer is “absolute
space,” then the law would appear to be something other than an
empirical claim, for no one can observe the trajectory of a particle
relative to absolute space. Two quite different answers to the question
were offered in 1870, in the form of revised statements of the law of
inertia. Carl Neumann proposed that when we state the law, we must
suppose that there is a body somewhere in the universe—the
“body Alpha”—with respect to which the motion of a
free particle is rectilinear, and that there is a time-scale somewhere
relative to which it is uniform (Neumann 1870). Ernst Mach (1883)
claimed that the law of inertia, and Newton's laws generally,
implicitly appeal to the fixed stars as a spatial reference-frame, and
to the rotation of the earth as a time-scale; at least, he held, such
is the basis for any genuine empirical content that the laws have. The
notion of absolute space, it followed, was only an unwarranted
abstraction from the practice of measuring motions relative to the
fixed stars.</p>

<p>

Mach's proposal had the advantage of a clear empirical motivation;
Neumann's “body Alpha” seemed no less mysterious than
absolute space, and almost sounds comical to the modern reader. But
Neumann's discussion of a time-scale was somewhat more fruitful. He
noted that the law of inertia defines a time-scale: equal intervals of
time are those in which a free particle travels equal distances. Such a definition is another aspect of the Newtonian theory first made explicit by Euler (1748). Neumann
also noted, however, that this definition is quite arbitrary. For, in
the absence of a prior definition of equal times, any motion whatever
can be stipulated to be uniform. It is no help to appeal to the
requirement of freedom from external forces, since the free particles
presumably are known to us only by their uniform motion. We have a
genuine empirical claim only when we state of <em>at least two</em>
free particles that their motions are <em>mutually</em> proportional;
equal intervals of time can then be defined as those in which two free
particles travel mutually proportional distances.</p>

<h3><a name="EmeConIneFra">1.6. The Emergence of the Concept of Inertial Frame</a></h3>

<p>

Neumann's definition of a time-scale directly inspired Ludwig
Lange's conception of “inertial system,” introduced in 1885
. An inertial coordinate system ought to be one in which free particles
move in straight lines. But any trajectory may be stipulated to be
rectilinear, and a coordinate system can always be constructed in which
it is rectilinear. And so, as in the case of the time-scale, we cannot
adequately define an inertial system by the motion of one particle.
Indeed, for any two particles moving anyhow, a coordinate system may be
found in which both their trajectories are rectilinear. So far the
claim that either particle, or some third particle, is moving in a
straight line may be said to be a matter of convention. We must define
an inertial system as one in which at least three non-collinear free
particles move in noncoplanar straight lines; then we can state the law
of inertia as the claim that, relative to an inertial system so
defined, the motion of any fourth particle, or arbitrarily many
particles, will be rectilinear. The notions of inertial system and
Neumann's time-scale, which Lange called an “inertial
time-scale,” may be combined as follows: relative to a coordinate
system in which three free particles move in straight lines
<em>and</em> travel mutually-proportional distances, the motion of any
fourth free particle will be rectilinear and uniform. The questionable
Newtonian concepts of absolute rotation and acceleration, Lange
proposed, could now be replaced by the concepts of “inertial
rotation” and “inertial acceleration,” i.e. rotation
and acceleration relative to an inertial system and inertial
time-scale. See Figures 2 and 3.</p>

<blockquote><strong>Figure 2: Neumann's Time-Scale</strong>:

 By Newton's first law, a particle not subject to forces travels equal
distances in equal times. But which particles are free of forces? This
might appear to be a matter of convention.

uniformly.

</blockquote>

<p>

At about the same time, apparently unaware of the work of Mach,
Neumann, and Lange, James Thomson expressed the content of the law of
inertia, and the appropriate frame of reference and time-scale
(“dial-traveller”), somewhat differently:</p>

<blockquote>For any set of bodies acted on each by any force, a
REFERENCE FRAME and a REFERENCE DIAL-TRAVELLER are kinematically
possible, such that relatively to them conjointly, the motion of the
mass-centre of each body, undergoes change simultaneously with any
infinitely short element of the dial-traveller progress, or with any
element during which the force on the body does not alter in direction
nor in magnitude, which change is proportional to the intensity of the
force acting on that body, and to the simultaneous progress of the
dial-traveller, and is made in the direction of the force. (Thomson
1884, p. 387)</blockquote>

<p>

More simply, an inertial reference-frame is one in which Newton's
second law is satisfied, so that every acceleration corresponds to an
impressed force. Thomson did not reject the term “absolute
rotation,” holding instead that it has to be understood as
rotation relative to a reference frame that satisfies his definition.
The definition does not express, as Lange's does, the degree of
arbitrariness involved in the construction of an inertial system by
means of free particles. Moreover, like Lange's, it leaves out a
crucial condition for an inertial system as we understand it: all
forces must belong to action-reaction pairs. Otherwise we could have,
as on a rotating sphere, merely apparent (centrifugal) forces that are,
by definition, proportional to mass and acceleration, and so the
rotating sphere would satisfy Thomson's definition. Therefore the
definition needs to be completed by the stipulation that to every
action there is an equal and opposite reaction. (This completion was
actually proposed by R.F. Muirhead in 1887.) </p>

<p>

But, so completed, Thomson's definition has two advantages over
Lange's. First, by appealing to Newton's second law instead of his
first, it shows that we can apply the notion of inertial frame without
having to consider the question whether there really are any free
particles in nature. Second, it exhibits more clearly an essential
point about the relation between the laws of motion and the inertial
frames: that the laws assert the existence of at least one inertial
frame. The original question, “relative to what frame of
reference do the laws of motion hold?” is revealed to be wrongly
posed. For the laws of motion essentially <em>determine</em> a class of
reference frames, and (in principle) a procedure for constructing them.
For the same reason, a skeptical question that is still commonly asked
about the laws of motion—why is it that the laws are true only
relative to a certain choice of reference frame?—is also
wrongly posed. If Newton's laws are true, then we can construct an
inertial frame; their truth doesn't depend on our ability to construct
such a frame in advance.</p>

<h3><a name="IneFraNewSpa">2.1 Inertial Frames in Newtonian Spacetime</a></h3>

<p>

By the early years of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, this notion of
inertial system seems to have been widely accepted, even if the
specific works of Lange and Thomson were largely forgotten; in writing
“On the electrodynamics of moving bodies” in 1905, Einstein
took it to be obvious to his readers that classical mechanics does not
require a single privileged frame of reference, but an
equivalence-class of frames, all in uniform motion relative to each
other, and any of which “the equations of mechanics hold
good.” Two inertial frames with coordinates (<em>x</em>,
<em>y</em>, <em>z</em>, <em>t</em>) and (<em>x</em>′,
<em>y</em>′ <em>z</em>′ <em>t</em>′) are related by
the <em>Galilean transformations</em>,</p>

<blockquote><em>x</em>′ = <em>x</em> − <em>vt</em>
<br />
 <em>y</em>′ = <em>y</em>
<br />
 <em>z</em>′ = <em>z</em>
<br />
 <em>t</em>′ = <em>t</em>
<br />
</blockquote>

<p>

(assuming that the x axis is defined to be the direction of their
relative motion). These transformations clearly preserve the invariant
quantities of Newtonian mechanics, i.e. acceleration, force, and mass
(and therefore time, length, and simultaneity). As far as Newtonian
mechanics was concerned, then, the problem of absolute motion was
completely solved; all that remained was to express the equivalence of
inertial frames in a simpler geometrical structure. </p>

<p>

The lack of a privileged spatial frame, combined with the obvious
existence of privileged states of motion—paths defined as
rectilinear in space and uniform with respect to time—suggests
that the geometrical situation ought to be regarded from a
four-dimensional <em>spatiotemporal</em> point of view. The
structure defined by the class of inertial frames can be captured in
the statement that <em>spacetime is a four-dimensional affine space,
whose straight lines</em> (geodesics) <em>are the trajectories of
particles in uniform rectilinear motion</em>. See Figure 4.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>

That is, spacetime is a structure whose automorphisms—the
Galilean transformations that relate one inertial frame to another—are equivalent to affine transformations: they take straight
lines into straight lines (i.e. an inertial motion in one inertial
frame will be an inertial motion in any other inertial frame, and
likewise for an accelerating or rotational motion), and parallel lines
into parallel lines (i.e. uniformly-moving particles or observers who
are relatively at rest in one frame will also be relatively at rest in
another). (See Stein 1967, Ehlers 1973, and Friedman 1983 for further
explanation.) An inertial frame can be characterized as a family of
parallel straight lines “filling” spacetime, representing
the possible trajectories of a family of free particles that are
relatively at rest. See Figure 5:</p>

<blockquote><strong>Figure 5:</strong>
<br />
 Each of these families of straight lines, F<sub>1</sub> and
F<sub>2</sub>, represents the trajectories of a family of free
particles that are relatively at rest, and therefore each defines an
inertial frame. Relative to each other, the frames defined by
F<sub>1</sub> and F<sub>2</sub> are in uniform motion.
<br />
 <img src="figure5.gif" alt="Figure 5" />
<br />
 Each of the surfaces S is a “hypersurface of absolute
simultaneity” representing all of space at a given moment;
evidently (given the Galilean transformations) two inertial frames will
agree on which events in spacetime are simultaneous.</blockquote>

<p>

From this we can see that the assertion that an inertial frame
exists imposes a global structure on spacetime; it is equivalent to the
assertion that spacetime is flat. As we can see from the Galilean
transformations, distinct inertial frames will agree on time and
simultaneity. Therefore, in the four-dimensional picture, the
decomposition of spacetime into hypersurfaces of absolute simultaneity
is independent of the choice of inertial frame. Another way of putting
this is that Newtonian spacetime is endowed with a <em>projection</em>
of spacetime onto time, i.e. a function that identifies spacetime
points that have the same time-coordinate. Similarly, absolute space
arises from a projection of spacetime onto space, i.e. a function that
identifies spacetime points that have the same spatial coordinates. See
Figure 6.</p>

But this latter projection is arbitrary: while it assumes that we
can identify the same time at different spatial locations, Newtonian
mechanics provides no physical way of identifying the same spatial

be thought of as the arbitrariness of the projection of spacetime onto
space, any such projection being, essentially, the arbitrary choice of
some particular inertial frame as a rest-frame.</p>

<h3><a name="ConBetGalRelModEle">2.2 The Conflict Between Galilean Relativity and Modern Electrodynamics</a></h3>

<p>

By the time that this representation of the Newtonian spacetime
structure was developed, however, the Newtonian conception of inertial
frame had been essentially overthrown. First, 19<sup>th</sup>-century
electrodynamics raised again the question of a privileged frame of
reference: the conception of light as an electromagnetic wave in the
ether implied that the rest-frame of the ether itself should play a
distinguished role in electrodynamical phenomena. On the one hand,
physicists such as Maxwell and Lorentz were careful to point out that
velocity relative to the ether was not equivalent to absolute velocity,
and that the state of motion of the ether itself was necessarily
unknown—in other words, that this conception of light did not
violate the classical principle of relativity. On the other hand, the
existence of such a preferred frame made the equivalence of inertial
frames correspondingly less interesting, even if it was true in
principle. This is why the appearance of the idea of inertial frame in
the 1880's, as I suggested earlier, was not of pressing physical
interest to the majority of physicists, and seemed to be a mere
philosophical sidelight. The attempts to measure the effects of motion
relative to the ether commanded considerably more attention.</p>

<p>

Second, the abandonment of the ether—following the failure
of attempts to measure velocity relative to the ether and, more
generally, the apparent independence of all electrodynamical phenomena
of motion relative to the ether—did not vindicate the Newtonian
inertial frame, but required a dramatically revised conception. Special
relativity might be said to have applied the relativity principle of
Newtonian mechanics to Maxwell's electrodynamics, by eliminating the
privileged status of the rest-frame of the ether and admitting that the
velocity of light is independent of the motion of the source. As
Einstein expressed it, “the same laws of electrodynamics and
optics will be valid for all frames of reference for which the
equations of mechanics hold good.” (1905, p. 38.) But as Einstein
also pointed out, the invariance of the velocity of light and the
principle of relativity, at least in its Galilean form, are
incompatible. It simply makes no sense, according to Galilean
relativity, that any velocity should appear to be the same in inertial
frames that are in relative motion.</p>

<h3><a name="SpeRelLorInv">2.3 Special Relativity and Lorentz Invariance</a></h3>

<p>

Einstein solved this difficulty through his analysis of
simultaneity: frames in relative motion can agree on the velocity of
light only if they disagree on simultaneity; only the relativity of
simultaneity makes possible the invariance of the velocity of
light. This means that the transformations between inertial
frames that preserve the velocity of light will not preserve
simultaneity. These are the <em>Lorentz transformations</em>:</p>

<blockquote><img src="lorentz3.jpg" alt="Lorentz transformation equation" /></blockquote>

<p>

Evidently these transformations do not preserve length and time, and
so the invariant quantities of Newtonian mechanics, which presuppose
invariant measures of length and time, must now depend on the choice of
inertial frame. By the same token, the notions of force, mass, and
acceleration can no longer be appealed to in the definition of an
inertial frame. The definition must instead appeal to the invariant
quantities of electrodynamics: an inertial frame is one in which light
travels equal distances in equal times in arbitrary directions. What
seems impossible, from the point of view of Galilean relativity, is
that a frame that moves uniformly relative to such a frame should also
satisfy the definition. But that, again, rests on the assumption that
two inertial frames will have a common measure of simultaneity. If, as
Einstein asserts, the only reasonable definition of simultaneity is one
provided by light signals, then there is no determination of
simultaneity that will give the same results in different inertial
frames. The spacetime structure that is implied by special relativity
is thus an affine space, like Newtonian spacetime, but it is not
objectively divided into hypersurfaces of absolute simultaneity; the
sets of simultaneous events for any inertial frame are the hyperplanes
orthogonal to the trajectories that determine that frame. In other
words, the choice between two inertial frames determines a choice
between two distinct divisions of spacetime into space and time. See
Figure 8:</p>

<blockquote><strong>Figure 8:</strong>
<br />
 The inertial frames F and F′ are in relative motion, and
therefore, as the Lorentz transformations indicate, they disagree on
simultaneity. F and F′ thus determine distinct decompositions of
spacetime into instantaneous spaces, S and S′, respectively
<br />
 <img src="figure8.gif" alt="Figure 8" /></blockquote>

<h3><a name="SimRefFra">2.4 Simultaneity and Reference-Frames</a></h3>

<p>

The details of Einstein's argument and the structure of Minkowski
spacetime can be found elsewhere (see, e.g., Einstein 1951 and Geroch
1978). Here only one more point is worth making. It could be argued
that Einstein's and Lorentz's view are completely equivalent. That is,
we could assume that there is indeed a privileged frame of reference,
and that the apparent invariance of the velocity of light is explained
by the effects on bodies of their motion through the ether (the Lorentz
contraction and time dilation). This purported distinction between
empirically indistinguishable frames has often been criticized on
straightforward methodological grounds, but it could be (and surely has
been) argued that it is more intuitively plausible than the relativity
of simultaneity. After all, knowing that (as Einstein showed) the
Lorentz contraction can be derived from the invariance of the velocity
of light does not, by itself, entitle us to say which of the two is the
more convincing starting-point.</p>

<p>

This is why it is so important that Einstein's 1905 paper begins
with a critical analysis of the entire notion of a frame of reference.
It is tacitly assumed by Lorentz's theory, and classical
electrodynamics generally, that we have a reference-frame in which we
can measure the velocity of light. But how is such a reference-frame
determined? The distances between points in space can only be
determined if it is possible to determine which events are
simultaneous. In practice this is always done by light-signalling, if
only in the informal sense that we identify simultaneous events when we
see them at the same time. But if the spatial frame of reference is
determined by light-signals, and is then to be used to measure the
speed of light, we would appear to be going in a circle; the underlying
assumption must be that, while light-signalling is useful and
practical, it is not essential to the definition of simultaneity, and
that there is a fact of the matter about which events are simultaneous
that is independent of this method of signalling. This assumption was
actually made explicit by James Thomson. He recognized—alone,
apparently, before Einstein—that the measurement of distance
involves</p>

<blockquote>the difficulty as to imperfection of our means of
ascertaining or specifying, or clearly idealizing, simultaneity at
distant places. For this we do commonly use signals by sound, by light,
by electricity, by connecting wires or bars, and by various other
means. The time required in the transmission of the signal involves an
imperfection in human powers of ascertaining simultaneity of
occurrences at distant places. It seems, however, probably not to
involve any difficulty of idealizing or imagining the existence of
simultaneity. Probably it may not be felt to involve any difficulty
comparable to that of attempting to form a distinct notion of identity
of place at successive times in unmarked space. (1884, p.
380).</blockquote>

<p>

In other words, Thomson assumed that it was not a difficulty in
principle, like the difficulty of determining rest in absolute space.
But Einstein showed that it was precisely the same kind of difficulty,
and that determinations of simultaneity involve reference to an
arbitrary choice of reference-frame, just as much as determinations of
velocity. Einstein's conclusion is, of course, entirely contingent on
the empirical facts of electrodynamics; it could have been avoided if
there were in nature a useful signal of some kind whose transmission
would provide a criterion of absolute simultaneity, so that the same
events would be determined to be simultaneous in all inertial frames.
Or, experiments might have been able to reveal the dependence of the
velocity of light on the state of motion of the source. Then
synchronization by light-signals could still have been regarded as a
mere practical substitute for a notion of absolute simultaneity that
stood on independent grounds, empirically as well as conceptually. But
as Einstein saw, because of the apparent independence of the velocity
of light of the motion of the source, even “idealizing or
imagining the existence of simultaneity” involves light-signaling
more essentially than anyone could have realized. Unless some other
criterion of simultaneity is provided, therefore, the establishment of
a spatial frame of reference involves light-signaling in an essential
way. In the absence of such a criterion the speed of light cannot be,
as Lorentz supposed, empirically measured against the background of an
inertial frame; in that case the only empirically sound definition of
an inertial frame is the one that appeals to the speed of light. </p>

<h3><a name="SpeRelLorInvGenRelGenCov">2.5 From Special Relativity and Lorentz Invariance to General Relativity and General Covariance</a></h3>

<p>

It may seem surprising that, after this insightful analysis of the
concept of inertial frame and its role in electrodynamics, Einstein
should have turned almost immediately to call that concept into
question. But he had a compelling combination of physical and
philosophical motives to do so. On the physical side, he realized
(along with many others) that special relativity would require some
fundamental revision of the Newtonian theory of gravity. On the
philosophical side, he became convinced, largely by his reading of Mach
(1883), that the central role of inertial frames was an
“epistemological defect” that special relativity shared
with Newtonian mechanics. (Einstein 1916, pp. 112–113.) Only relative
motions are observable, yet both of these theories purport to identify
a privileged state of motion and use it to explain observable effects
(such as centrifugal forces). Coordinate systems are not observable,
yet both of these theories assign a fundamental physical role to
certain kinds of coordinate system, namely, the inertial systems. In
either theory, inertial coordinates are distinguished from all others,
and the laws of physics are said to hold only relative to inertial
coordinate systems. In an epistemologically sophisticated theory, both
of these problems would be solved at once: the new theory would only
refer to what is observable, which is relative motion; it would admit
arbitrary coordinate systems, instead of confining itself to a special
class of system. Why, after all, should any genuine physical phenomenon
depend on the choice of coordinate system?</p>

<p>

Another way of putting the same point is to say that, in Newtonian
mechanics and special relativity, rotation is “absolute”
because the transformations between inertial frames (Galilean or
Lorentzian) preserve rotational states. Thus the
“absoluteness” of rotation arises precisely from singling
out one type of frame, by one type of transformation, instead of
allowing arbitrary transformations and arbitrary frames. Einstein held
that this epistemological insight had a natural mathematical
representation in the principle of <em>general covariance</em>, or the
principle that the laws of nature are to be invariant under
<em>arbitrary</em> coordinate transformations. More precisely, what
this means is that coordinate transformations are no longer required
(as in the affine spaces of Newtonian mechanics and special relativity)
to take straight lines to straight lines, but only to preserve the
smoothness of curves (i.e. their differentiability). The general theory
of relativity was intended to be a generally covariant account of
spacetime, and its general covariance was intended to express the
general relativity of motion. And the theory came into being because
Einstein perceived a deep connection between this project and that of
finding a relativistic theory of gravitation.</p>

<h3><a name="EquIneGra">2.6 The Equivalence of Inertia and Gravity</a></h3>

<p>

The philosophical motivations and implications of Einstein's view
are dealt with elsewhere. (See, for example, the entries on 
 <a href="../einstein-philscience/">Einstein's philosophy of science</a>;
 <a href="../spacetime-holearg/">the hole argument</a>;
 and
 <a href="../genrel-early/">early philosophical interpretations of general relativity</a>.)
 We will consider here only the bearing of
general relativity on the notion of an inertial frame. It is
questionable whether Einstein succeeded in establishing the general
relativity of motion, but it is clear that general relativity
undermines the concept of inertial frame in important respects. This
arises from the <em>equivalence principle</em>: that inertial 
mass—the quantity that enters into Newton's second law, and that is
a measure of a body's resistance to acceleration—is equivalent
to gravitational mass, the quantity that enters into Newton's law of
universal gravitation. A more empirical way of expressing it is that
all bodies fall with the same acceleration in the same gravitational
field, or, the trajectory of a body in a given gravitational field will
be independent of its mass and composition. This is the principle that
Newton tested by constructing pendulums with wooden boxes as their
bobs, which he would fill with different materials in order to see
whether those differences made a difference to the speed of falling;
they didn't. Eötvös made more precise tests in the late
19<sup>th</sup> century, and established the principle to much greater
accuracy; these are the results on which Einstein would have relied.
Newton also tested the principle for bodies whose masses differ
greatly, by observing that Jupiter and its four moons all received
precisely the same acceleration from the sun's gravitational field.</p>

<p>

The equivalence principle suggests, however, that a freely-falling
frame of reference is physically indistinguishable from an inertial
frame. Newton had already noticed this, and indeed he stated it, more
or less, in Corollary VI to the laws of motion:</p>

<blockquote>If bodies are moving in any way whatsoever with respect to
one another and are urged by equal accelerative forces along parallel
lines, they will all continue to move with respect to one another in
the same way as they would if they were not acted on by those forces.
(1726, p. 423.)</blockquote>

<p>

For example, he was able to treat the system of Jupiter and its moons
as if it were (nearly) at rest or moving uniformly in a straight line,
because the attractive force of the sun acts (almost) equally on every
part of the system. See Figure 9: </p>

<blockquote><strong>Figure 9: Newton's Corollary VI</strong>
<br />
 What seem, within a given system, like equal and parallel
accelerations may be, on a larger scale, unequal and converging on some
distant massive object; e.g., the system of Jupiter and its moons is
falling toward the sun, but “locally” the accelerations are
very nearly equal and parallel, and may therefore be neglected.

<p>

He even applied this reasoning to the entire solar system, in order
to justify treating it as an isolated system: if there were any outside
force acting on it, it must have been acting more or less equally and
in parallel directions on all parts of the system.</p>

<blockquote>It may be alleged that the sun and planets are impelled by
some other force equally and in the direction of parallel lines; but by
such a force (by Cor. VI of the Laws of Motion) no change would happen
in the situation of the planets to one another, nor any sensible effect
follow; but our business is with the causes of sensible effects. Let
us, therefore, neglect every such force as imaginary and precarious,
and of no use in the phenomena of the heavens….(1729, volume 2
p. 558)</blockquote>

<p>

Now, it is a familiar fact that in an orbiting spacecraft, bodies
behave as if no forces were acting on any of them (as if they were
“weightless”), because the attraction of the earth acts
equally on all of them. But these phenomena are not, by themselves,
evidence that <em>no</em> phenomena are capable of distinguishing an
inertial frame from a falling frame. Einstein was willing to generalize
the equivalence principle, and to conclude that the classical idea of a
distinguished class of frames of reference has no physical basis. Any
frame that we might regard as inertial might be, for all we can tell by
experiment, in free fall. By the same token, any frame that is
uniformly accelerating is indistinguishable from one that is at rest in
a uniform gravitational field. Suppose that you are in a box at rest on
the earth; you and everything in the box, by the equivalence principle,
will be accelerated downward with the acceleration <em>g</em> (= 9.8
meters/second/second). Now suppose that the box itself is in empty,
gravity-free space, but accelerating upward (i.e. in the direction of
its roof) with the acceleration -<em>g</em>. Obviously, because of
their inertia, bodies in the box, including your own, will exert the
same force—have the same “weight”—on the
floor as if the box were at rest and sitting on the earth.</p>

<h3><a name="EquPriGenCov">2.7 The Equivalence Principle and General Covariance</a></h3>

<p>

To get a clearer idea of the physical significance of the
equivalence principle, and its connection with general covariance,
consider the Newtonian procedure for analyzing motion in the solar
system, here sketched very roughly:</p>

<ol>
<li>Determine the accelerations of all the planets relative to the
fixed stars.</li>

<li>Using the laws of motion, their corollaries, and all the
propositions proved from these in Book I of Principia, derive from the
accelerations the forces needed to produce them; in particular, derive
from the orbits the centers of those orbits, and the masses of the
bodies needed to produce those forces. This crucially involves the law
of action and reaction, for otherwise it would be impossible to break
down the total acceleration of any planet into the components
contributed by particular other planets; the earth's acceleration, for
example, is the sum of its accelerations toward all the other planets,
and each individual acceleration is part of an action-reaction pair
involving some other planet.</li>

<li>When we understand the mutual interactions among the planets, we
are in a position to estimate their relative masses. In Newton's case,
this was necessarily restricted to the planets with satellites, because
only in those cases could he compare the accelerations they determine
at given distances and so deduce the differences in mass. By this
reasoning he estimated the ratios of the Sun's mass to those of Jupiter
(1067 to 1), Saturn (3021 to 1), and the earth, and was able to
calculate that the center of mass of the entire solar system would
never be more than one solar diameter from the center of the Sun.</li>

<li>Having found the center of mass, we have in principle determined an
inertial frame: by Corollary IV to the laws of motion, the center of
mass will be at rest or moving uniformly in a straight line. That is,
the mutual actions of the bodies in the system will not change the
state of motion of the center of mass. And having determined an
inertial frame, we are in a position to say that the accelerations
relative to the center of mass frame are the true accelerations.</li>
</ol>

<p>

One might think that the problem of relativity arises right from the
start: the reliance on the fixed stars already seems to introduce an
arbitrary assumption that threatens to vitiate Newton's procedure as an
account of the true motions. But the framework of the fixed stars,
initially just taken for granted, turns out to be justified in the
course of the analysis. If it turns out that all the accelerations
relative to the fixed stars can be analyzed into action-reaction pairs
involving bodies within the system, leaving no “leftover”
accelerations that need to be traced to some yet-unknown influence,
then we can conclude that the stars are a suitable (sufficiently
inertial) frame of reference after all. (By the later 19<sup>th</sup>
century, observations became sufficiently precise to reveal that there
is in fact a leftover acceleration, namely the famous extra precession
of Mercury. But that could not affect Newton's analysis in 1687.) In
contrast, had we chosen the earth as a frame of reference, we would
find that there are accelerations relative to this frame—e.g.
Coriolis and centrifugal accelerations—that don't satisfy the
law of action and reaction. </p>

<h3><a name="ExtRelPri">2.8 The Extension of the Relativity Principle</a></h3>

<p>

The relativistic aspect of this situation arises from the
equivalence principle. Newton's Corollary VI said that the inertial
frame we construct by this procedure is effectively indistinguishable
from one in which all the bodies are undergoing equal and parallel
accelerations caused by some force that acts equally on all of them;
the equivalence principle asserts that gravity is such a force. In
following the Newtonian procedure for constructing an inertial frame,
we have constructed a frame which might be, for all we can determine
empirically, falling in the gravitational field of some other system. Here again, as in his use of Corollary V, we can see that Newton was being remarkably circumspect about his frame of reference: he needed to show that his analysis of the forces at work, and his conclusion about the nearly-heliocentric structure of the system, are not affected by any unknown forces acting on the system as a whole, and his appeal to Corollary VI precisely satisfies this need. By the same token, however, the accelerations relative to this frame cannot be
known to be the “true accelerations”; they may be
accelerations relative to a freely-falling trajectory just in case the
center of mass is itself freely falling, in which case they have to be
added to the gravitational acceleration of the center of mass before we
can arrive at the true accelerations. But the acceleration of the
center of mass may have to be added to some larger acceleration—and so on. This means that we can't know the true strength of the
gravitational field by observing the motions in this frame. The only
hope of doing so would be to include all the mass in the universe in
one dynamical system; if we knew the center of mass of the entire
universe, we could rule out the possibility that something else is
exerting an accelerative force, since by hypothesis there would be
nothing else. </p>

<p>

We can see the significance of this more clearly by looking at the
equations of motion (in a very simplified form). Newton's equation of
motion for a particle subject to no force asserts that it moves
uniformly, with zero acceleration. Obviously, in a gravitational field,
the particle's acceleration will depend on the field. In effect, we are
accounting for the trajectory of the falling particle by
“decomposing” it into two parts, the part determined by its
natural tendency to move uniformly in a straight line, and the part
contributed by the gravitational field. But by the analysis of the
equivalence principle, determining the inertial part—and
therefore determining the gravitational part—depends on our
assumption that the center of mass frame is inertial rather than freely
falling. And this assumption is arbitrary; that is, it amounts to an
arbitrary choice of the coordinate system in which we define the
equation of inertial motion. This implies that the gravitational field
depends on the coordinate system in precisely the same way.</p>

<p>

The principle of general covariance, then, acquires its physical
significance in conjunction with the equivalence principle. By itself,
it says that the geometrical structures of spacetime don't depend on
the coordinates in which we express them, or on the set of points that
we may think comprises spacetime. This is an important principle, but
it doesn't recommend general relativity over other theories, since
special relativity and Newtonian mechanics also involve spacetime
structures that can be defined in a generally-covariant way, through
the same kinds of coordinate-independent mathematical objects that we
use in general relativity. Combined with the equivalence principle,
however, it implies that a central Newtonian idea—that gravity
is a force causing deviations from uniform rectilinear motion—is based on an arbitrary choice of coordinates. For a trajectory that
satisfies all empirical criteria for being inertial in a particular
frame of reference—e.g. the trajectory of the center of mass in
our example—may be freely falling relative to some other
trajectory that satisfies the same criteria. By contrast, a
freely-falling trajectory is a freely falling trajectory in any
coordinate system; it is only the decomposition of it into its inertial
and gravitational parts that will be different in different coordinate
systems.</p>

<h3><a name="IneFraCurSpa">2.9 From Inertial Frames to Curved Spacetime</a></h3>

<p>

General covariance is thus not an argument against privileged states
of motion, as Einstein had hoped it would be. It is an argument that
the privileged states of motion should not be mere artifacts of our
choice of coordinates, i.e. that they should be coordinate-independent.
Precisely what this means depends, then, on what physical means we have
at our disposal to identify states of motion other than by simply
setting down coordinates. Combined with the equivalence principle, it
is an argument for regarding gravitational free-fall as the privileged
state of motion, rather than as a forced deviation from the privileged
state of motion. And in this way it provides an argument for spacetime
curvature. As we saw, in Newtonian and Minkowski spacetime the inertial
trajectories are, by definition, the straight lines or geodesics of
spacetime. And the flatness of spacetime consists in the fact that
these geodesics behave like straight lines in a flat space or surface:
parallel geodesics remain parallel, and non-parallel geodesics do not
accelerate relative to one another. (In any inertial frame, the motion
of any other inertial frame appears uniform.) By the equivalence
principle, however, free-fall trajectories satisfy all empirical
criteria for being inertial trajectories, and so the distinction
between the two types of trajectory depends on the mere choice of
coordinates. General covariance suggests, then, that the free-fall
trajectories ought to be identified as the inertial trajectories—and therefore, as the geodesics of spacetime. But if free-fall
trajectories are the geodesics of spacetime, then spacetime is curved.
For the free-fall trajectories exhibit relative accelerations, and the
relative acceleration of geodesics is a defining characteristic of
curved geometry. The curvature of the earth's surface, for example, is
revealed in the fact that geodesics that begin in parallel directions
can begin to approach one another—for example, two lines of
longitude can both be perpendicular to the equator, but converge on one
another as they approach the poles. And since the relative
accelerations of falling bodies depend on the distribution of mass, as
we already knew from Newton's theory, we now conclude not only that
spacetime is curved, but that its curvature is determined by the
distribution of mass. (For further explanation see Geroch 1978.)</p>

<p>

The curvature of spacetime, finally, determines the status of
inertial frames in general relativity. The statement that all
reference-frames, rather than just inertial frames, are equivalent is a
misleading way of describing the situation; rather, the variable
curvature of spacetime makes the imposition of a global inertial frame
impossible. So the status of the latter is like the status of a plane
rectangular coordinate system on the surface of the earth. Over a
sufficiently small area, the coordinate plane may be a good
approximation to the surface, but over increasingly large areas it
diverges increasingly from the contours of the earth. And if two such
coordinate systems, with their origins at different points on the
earth, are extended until they meet, they will be seen to be
“disoriented” relative to one another. In contrast, a flat
plane can be so coordinatized, and coordinate systems originating at
different points can be smoothly combined into one system. Similarly,
in the affine spaces of Newtonian and special-relativistic physics, any
inertial coordinate system can be extended over the whole of spacetime.
And in any system so extended, the trajectory of every other inertial
observer will be a uniform rectilinear motion. But if spacetime is
variably curved, according to the distribution of mass and energy,
local inertial systems will be “disoriented” relative to
one another; indeed, the degree of this “disorientation” is
one of the measures of curvature. And an inertially-moving—i.e.
freely falling—particle will in that case be accelerating in
the local inertial system of another freely-falling particle. Thus
there are inertial trajectories, but no extended inertial systems. See
Figures 10–13:</p>

<blockquote><strong>Figure 10:</strong>
<br />
 This Cartesian coordinate system can evidently be simply “set
down” over the plane below. Any coordinate system defined at any
point of the plane can be smoothly extended over the entire plane.
<br />
 <img src="figure10.gif" alt="Figure 10" /></blockquote>

<blockquote><strong>Figure 11: “Magnified” View of Flat
“Local” Coordinate Systems on a Curved Surface</strong>
<br />
 <img src="figure11.gif" alt="Figure 11" />
<br />
 This arbitrary curved surface won't allow for the global laying down
of a coordinate system, but must be coordinatized in small overlapping
pieces, which generally won't be parallel to one another.</blockquote>

<blockquote><strong>Figure 12:</strong>
<br />
 In a flat spacetime, the rest-frame of any inertial observer an be
“extended” over all of spacetime in such a way that, in
this global inertial frame, the trajectory of every other inertial
observer will be an inertial trajectory.
<br />
 <img src="figure12.gif" alt="Figure 12" /></blockquote>

<blockquote><strong>Figure 13:</strong>
<br />
 In a curved spacetime, inertial trajectories will be relatively
accelerated; indeed the relative acceleration of geodesics is a measure
of curvature. Therefore the local inertial frame of any freely-falling
observer cannot be extended into a global frame in which all other
inertial observers are moving uniformly. The inertial frames of
different freely-falling observers will be, like local coordinate
systems on a curved surface, “disoriented” relative to one
another.
<br />
 <img src="figure13.gif" alt="Figure 13" /></blockquote>

<p>

One could try to express this idea with Einstein's remark about the
need to “free oneself from the idea that coordinates must have an
immediate metrical meaning.” (Einstein 1949, p. 67.)But even this
might be misleading. Einstein evidently was thinking that, in general
relativity, coordinates, and coordinate transformations, no longer
represent the possible displacements of rigid bodies or the transport
of ideal clocks. The insight underlying this is that the notion of
rigid displacement—therefore of rigid coordinate system, and
inertial frame—imposes <em>a priori</em> a degree of
uniformity, or symmetry, on spacetime; the displacement of bodies
without change of dimension, and the transport of an ideal clock
without distortion of time-intervals, requires a homogeneous space. And
so rigid displacement cannot be a basic principle in a theory in which
spacetime curvature varies according to the distribution of mass and
energy. The possibility of a rigid displacement, and therefore the
existence of an inertial frame, can only arise <em>a posteriori</em>,
as the result of a peculiar distribution of mass-energy (for example,
in a universe empty of mass and energy, or with a highly symmetrical
distribution). The serious defect in the notion of inertial frame is
not that it makes an arbitrary distinction among coordinate systems—for the distinction is quite as genuine as the distinction
between flat and curved spacetime—but that it extends
indefinitely over spacetime a structure that, in our universe, only
corresponds approximately to very small regions.</p>
