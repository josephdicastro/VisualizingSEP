<h1>Epistemology in Chinese Philosophy</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Fri Sep 26, 2014; substantive revision Thu Apr 5, 2018</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
Chinese philosophy was developed on the basis of ontological,
epistemological and metaphysical paradigms that differ from those of
Western theoretical discourses.  The concepts and categories used in
Chinese philosophy cannot be easily transferred from one
socio-cultural context into another, and it is often difficult to
understand this philosophy through the lens of traditional Western
thought.  The exclusive application of Western methods can thus lead
to severe misunderstandings and false interpretations of Chinese
discourses.  It is therefore important to use caution so as not to
diminish the richness and depth of Chinese thought or turn it into
a weak version of Western philosophical thought.</p>

<p>
The epistemological dimensions of Chinese texts and their role in the
context of Chinese thought has been developed increasingly
successfully under the aegis of rediscovering and applying specific
traditional Chinese methodological approaches and categories (Lenk and
Paul 1993). The present entry similarly explores Chinese epistemology
through the lens of conceptual and ideational assets created and
developed in the Chinese tradition (Creller 2014: 196).</p>

<p>According to the prevailing traditional European epistemologies,
knowledge has mainly been gained through observation and reasoning.
However, in traditional Chinese thought, knowledge has been understood
in a much broader sense, namely as something which also (or primarily)
stems from moral contents and which cannot be separated from (social)
practice. The method which determined most of the epistemological
teachings found in the Chinese classics was based on a holistic world
view, and was directed towards a comprehension which could be achieved
through education and learning. The basic contents of these teachings
were rooted in the premises of pragmatic and utilitarian ethics.
Chinese epistemology was relational (Rošker 2012), meaning that it
understood the external world to be ordered structurally, while the
human mind was also structured in accordance with its all-embracing
but open, organic system (<em>li</em> 理). The relational
correspondence between the cosmic and mental structures thus
represents the basic precondition of human perception and
comprehension.</p>

<p>This entry will provide a systematic overview of the special
features, the central methods and the main developmental streams of
classical Chinese epistemological discourses that were based on a
structurally ordered holistic worldview and rooted in axiological
premises.</p>

<h2><a id="BasCat">1. Basic Categories</a></h2>

<h3><a id="HeaMinThiEve">1.1 The Heart-Mind and the Things-Events</a></h3>

<p>In classical Chinese philosophy the meaning of the Chinese
word <em>xin</em> 心, which literally refers to the physical
heart, is not limited to its common connotations. Unlike Western
definitions, the Chinese metaphorical understanding of this notion not
only denotes this organ as the center of emotions, but also as the
center of perception, understanding, intuition and even rational
thought. As ancient Chinese believed that the heart was the center of
human cognition, the notion of <em>xin</em> is most commonly
translated as “heart-mind” in philosophical
discourses. This understanding was determined by the absence of the
contrast between cognitive (representative ideas, reasoning, beliefs)
and affective (sensation, feelings, desires, emotions) states.</p>

<p>In classical Chinese epistemologies, each person’s self-awareness
was based upon a holistic understanding of the world, which was
structured as an interactive relationship between humanity and nature
(<em>tianren heyi</em> 天人合一). The unity of
all cosmic beings was seen in terms of the organismic and dynamic
wholeness of nature and society. Hence, self-awareness as the basis of
any kind of comprehension originated with the awareness that one’s own
being was organically embedded and interwoven with (rational)
indeterminate, constitutive cosmic structures. The heart-mind which
represents the crucial part of this self-awareness, is innately
equipped with the basic structure of (moral) recognition.</p>

<p>The origins of this tradition are remote, and reach far back into
pre-Qin intellectual history. The human heart-mind was not only
posited as the seat of the concept of mind or consciousness and thus
the source of both emotions and reasoning, but was also perceived as a
kind of sense organ by the ancient Chinese. Indeed, Mengzi
(372–289 BC) sometimes even views it as the principal sense
organ, responsible for selecting and interpreting the sensations
transmitted to it by other sense organs (Mengzi CTP: <em>Gaozi shang</em>,
15). In other words, while the latter enabled perception, the
heart-mind enabled the comprehension of external reality or that part
of reality transmitted by the sense organs. In <em>Guanzi</em>, a
philosophical work ascribed to the legalist politician Guan Zhong
(7<sup>th</sup> century BC, although probably dating much later) the
leading function of mind does not refer merely to the sense organs,
but also to all other major organs as for instance intestines or
bladder (Guanzi CTP: <em>Jiu shou</em>, 6). Later on, such an approach was
typical of the legalist scholars, who set the concepts of Confucian
hierarchy upon absolutist foundations. Such discourses also recall the
relation between the (inferior) body and the (superior)
spirit. However, in the early Chinese philosophical texts hearing and
seeing seem to be regarded as the most important senses in that they
play the most significant role in acquiring knowledge (Geaney
2002). In most ancient Chinese philosophical discourses the body-mind
relationship was seen as an organic unity, determined by the principle
of complementarity. This led to the establishment of bodily
recognition (<em>tiren</em> 體認 or <em>tiyan</em>
體驗) that belongs to the fundamental methods of
perception (Ni 2002: 287) in traditional Chinese epistemology.</p>

<p>Thus, with the exception of the Mohist school which elaborated some
divisions regarding the problem of <em>things as they are</em>
(<em>shi</em> 是) and <em>things as they appear</em>
(<em>ran</em> 然) (Mozi CTP: <em>Xiao qu</em>, 8), the
heart-mind as the inherent organ of perception was seen as
continuously integrated with the phenomena of the external world that
manifested themselves in the notion things-events (<em>wu</em>
物). Hence, instead of establishing a clear demarcation line
between the subject and the object of comprehension, human perception
and recognition of reality were mostly seen as a product of a
coherent, structurally ordered and complementary interaction between
the heart-mind and the things-events.  This continuity of internal and
external worlds prevailed in classical Chinese epistemology until the
11<sup>th</sup> century, i.e., till the earliest beginnings of
Neo-Confucian philosophy, when it was further developed.</p>

<h3><a id="NamActLanMea">1.2 Names and Actualities, Language and Meaning</a></h3>

<p>The harmonic regularity, which represents the elementary postulate
for the comprehension process, has been linked to questions of
language and its relation to the world. The realization of such
regularity has therefore been preconditioned by language which was
intended to provide a formal framework for social understanding. The
standardization of language (and thus of cognitively reflected
perception) had to be realized in accordance with the structural
regularity of existence.  According to most scholars, the elementary
categorization which defined the essential and formal assumptions of
classical Chinese epistemologies was therefore closely connected to
issues concerning the regulation of the relationship between the
structure of language and reality. This categorization has been
expressed in the bipolar complementary relationship between the terms
names (<em>ming</em> 名) and actualities (<em>shi</em>
實).</p>

<p>The Confucian glorification of the perfect, harmonious and utopian
society of the past was also reflected in the discourse on <em>Proper
Names</em> (Lunyu CTP: <em>Zi lu</em>, 3), which envisioned a society in
which everyone lived in accordance with the original meaning of that
which expressed their social position. According to this approach,
words in ideal, past society incorporated the core of the realities
denoted by them, while the crisis of the Warring States period
(475–221 BC) emerged from the growing discrepancies between the
names (social positions) of individuals and their actual behavior. The
ideal conditions for society could therefore only be established when
everyone acted in accordance with their (social) name (Lunyu CTP:
<em>Yanyuan</em>, 11).</p>

<p>In contrast to Confucius, Mo Di (ca 650–200 BC), the founder
of the Mohist school, questioned the existence of an ideal language
(the essence of the concept <em>ming</em>) to which (external) reality
and society had to adapt. Instead of shaping social interactions
according to language standards, which Confucians viewed as
incorporating the essential structure of natural order and humanness,
the Mohists adopted the opposite approach, arguing that since language
was a means for transmitting realities, it was language which had to
adjust to such realities and not vice-versa. According to Mo Di, the
criteria for such adjustment had to be based on actual social needs,
and not on the idealized and alien models of a bygone era.</p>

<p>However, in both cases, the realization of a regulation that could
provide a framework for a social understanding needed to be
preconditioned by the standardization of language, which is a possible
factor in the problem of the relation between actualities
(<em>shi</em>) and proper naming (<em>ming</em>) became the basic
epistemological question in ancient China. Naturally, the question as
regards the normative criteria for such a relational structure arose
at the very outset of this approach. The standardization or
continuation (<em>chang</em> 常) of language had to be carried
out in accordance with the formal premises of a binary structured
(<em>shi</em> 是 : <em>fei</em> 非) valuation
(<em>bian</em> 辨). Only when these conditions were met, was it
possible to achieve the ultimate goal of pragmatically oriented
epistemology in classical Chinese discourses: every linguistic
expression, every name (<em>ming</em>) could (and should) therefore be
applied in accordance to the principles that determined actuality
(<em>shi</em>).</p>

<p>The adherents of the School of Names (<em>ming jia</em>
名家) believed that, with respect to the concrete
situation to which language has been applied, each single thing could
have a single meaning. Gongsun Long (ca 325–250 BC)
understood this in a way in which mutual coverings of meanings could
only exist on an abstract level. He attempted to eliminate semantic
overlapping, or at least to reduce it to a level on which language
could still be overseen and controlled.</p>

<p>However, according to the Neo-Mohist school the semantic
overlapping of different terms was a natural quality of human language
which meant that the Neo-Mohist philosophers saw no need to eliminate
it. They were far more interested in the question of language as a
means for categorizing the natural and social worlds.</p>

<p>Semantic approaches occupied a privileged position within these
models of thought. These proto-epistemological discourses would have a
decisive impact on later developments in this specific area, most of
which took place between 2<sup>nd</sup> and 6<sup>th</sup> centuries
AD This epistemological shift followed the debate on the nature of the
relation between names (or concepts) and realities (<em>ming
shi</em>), which would reappear in a slightly modified form within
later Neo-Daoist discourses on the relation between language and
meaning (<em>yan yi</em> 言意), i.e., between
comprehension and interpretation. However, the discourses of the
philosophers of the Wei Jin era (265–420) also began to
investigate the structure of meaning in a way that was no longer
limited to the sphere of the concrete, existing, objective, external
actuality (Tang 1955: 68). The focus of the scholars from this period
was no longer limited to responding to the questions concerning
“proper” behavior, i.e., “proper” rituals, or
formulating wise maxims that inspired people to a wiser, more ethical
life, leading to a more harmonious society. Instead, they were
interested in the question of expressions and in investigating the
relations between these maxims or sayings and the reality to which
they referred. This meant determining which names were suitable for
denoting certain things and which were not and, conversely, which sort
of realities could be designated by certain names, and which could
not.  Based on these investigations, they tried to establish a system,
based on the semantic structure of names (<em>mingli lun</em>
名理論, see Tang 1955: 66) that divided specific
concepts from one another, in order to be able to identify the errors
and misapprehensions that resulted from the improper use of names. In
effect, these scholars discovered the epistemological dimension of
meta-language, which was certainly a higher level of thought than that
of simple teachings that merely implied direct and one-dimensional
reasoning about things and the external reality. According to Tang
Junyi (1955: 66), teachings formulated at this level were more
abstract and belonged to higher cognitive levels. They were teachings
about “how teachings were made”. The principles derived
from them were principles of “how principles were
established”. This new dimension, in turn, would lead them to
analyze the relation between human reasoning and their own cognitive
concepts and, ultimately, these concepts as such.</p>

<p>In later, pre-modern critical approaches to philosophical thought,
it was exposed that even though names do not comprise the meanings of
an original Heavenly essence, they should not be regarded as
arbitrary; the naming of reality has to be performed in accordance to
the objective and generally valid principles. The prime innovation in
this regard was Dai Zhen’s (1724–1777) emphasis on the concept
of the “exhaustive comprehension of concrete facts (actualities)
(<em>jinqi shi</em> 盡其實)” pertaining to the
reality we seek to comprehend (Xia 1996b: 417).</p>

<h3><a id="KnoAct">1.3 Knowledge and Action</a></h3>

<p>In traditional China knowledge and the way in which it is obtained
(method of comprehension) was viewed as an important element of human
existence. The dispute as to which of the elements forming the binary
categorical pair of knowledge and action (<em>zhi</em>, <em>xing</em>)
had priority, constituted one of the crucial debates in traditional,
as well as modern Chinese epistemology. In the context of the
classical holistic worldview that was inherently permeated with
ethical values, the recognition of reality was linked to the active
involvement of humanity in their interactive relationship with their
social and natural environment. Knowledge (<em>zhi</em>) was thus seen
as a valuable factor, necessarily and inextricably linked to human
activities and the implementation of social practice (<em>xing</em>):
any separation of knowledge and (social) practice was equated with the
separation of human beings from the world in which they have found
themselves. The close proximity between knowledge and action was seen
as the close proximity between an individual and the world, because
action was a means for his/her self-transformation and the
transformation of the world in the world. Hence, the unity or
non-unity of knowledge and action was always a measure of the unity or
non-unity of humanity and the world (Cheng 1989: 207).</p>

<p>This crucial aspect of the unity between knowledge and action
(<em>zhi xing heyi</em> 知行合一) has been
emphasized and upgraded in the developing course of Neo-Confucian
philosophy during the Song and Ming dynasties. Wang Yangming’s
(1472–1529) holistic response to the question of knowledge and
action (Wang 1933: Xu Ai yinyan, 5) not only defines the entire
ethical foundation of the epistemology of the School of Heart-Mind
(<em>Xin xue</em> 心學) but is also typical of most
similar philosophical precepts. </p>

<p>In the 17<sup>th</sup> century, the Academy of the Eastern Forest
(<em>Donglin shuyuan</em> 東林書院) and the
materialist philosopher Wang Fuzhi (1619–1692) advocated the
priority of action (<em>xing</em>). Since this position was in
opposition to the views of the orthodox Neo-Confucians, and since it
represented a new, predominantly materialistic opposition to the
Neo-Confucian tradition, it set the stage for the ideological
struggles which took place during the last Chinese dynasty. The
contribution of scholars from the School of Practical Learning
(<em>shixue</em> 實學) is especially valuable in the
context of the further development of the binary category of knowledge
and action. Due to their rediscovery of the orthodox classics and
their unstinting emphasis on the significance of the practical
applicability of ideas, they not only consistently placed the archaic
connection between knowledge and action at the center of
epistemological thought, but also gave it a more concrete emphasis, as
in the relationship between thought and (political) practice. This
rediscovered and somehow remodeled traditional connection would
subsequently influence the great majority of later Chinese theories of
knowledge, while also underpinning one of the crucial approaches to
the specifically Chinese understanding of Marxist philosophy. In his
essay “On Praxis” (<em>Shijian lun</em>), even Mao Zedong
explicitly argued for a similar epistemological and axiological
primacy of praxis over theory (2014: 8). It should be pointed out, however, that in
their social theories, Chinese Marxists subscribed to the idea of the
inseparability and dialectical relation of both categories, which in
the context of Chinese ideal tradition had always been viewed in terms
of complementary bipolarity. Although they considered social praxis as
the element which imparted meaning to any (theoretical) reasoning, it
was precisely this kind of renewed synthesis of knowledge and action
which formed the epistemological bridge linking the classical Chinese
tradition to the new ideas of Western Modernity. </p>

<h2><a id="SpeFea">2. Specific Features</a></h2>

<h3><a id="RelEpi">2.1 Relational Epistemology</a></h3>

<p>The naturalistic epistemologies that prevailed in Western
discourses were dealing with the external world (or objective
reality), which was to a great extent independent from the subject of
comprehension.  Chinese approaches to knowledge can be called
relational epistemologies, because they refer to relations. This
applies not only to radical holistic epistemologies, which denied the
notion of substance, but also to a number of contemporary theories
which advocate a strict division between the subject and object of
comprehension (see Xia 2000: 4)</p>

<p>Chinese relational epistemology was based upon viewing the world as
a complex structure composed of relations, intersections and
interacting feedback loops. Specific Chinese models for investigating
questions related to knowledge were thus premised upon a structurally
ordered external reality; since natural (or cosmic) order is organic,
it naturally follows the “flow” of structural patterns and
operates in accordance with structural principles that regulate every
existence and are manifested in the concept of <em>li</em>
理. In this worldview, the human mind is also structured in
accordance with this all-embracing but open organic system. The axioms
of our recognition and thought are therefore not coincidental or
arbitrary, but follow this dynamic structure. In this view, the
compatibility or correspondence of both the cosmic and mental
structures is the basic precondition that enables human beings to
perceive and recognize external reality (Rošker 2010:
79–82).</p>

<p>In most traditional discourses (with the exception of the Mohist
school, The School of Names and certain representatives of the
Neo-Confucianism), the focus upon relations was linked to the unity of
the subject and object of comprehension. If we posit that the relation
represents the object of comprehension, we must also specify that this
object is not automatically to be seen as a counter-pole to the
subject of comprehension. Relational epistemologies are not based upon
a strict division between these entities, nor upon a strict (or
necessary) demarcation of what, with respect to the subject of
comprehension, we are accustomed to see as the external or internal
world. Therefore, the methods used by certain philosophers in various
currents of the Chinese tradition, are by no means decisive for
defining the positions of the subject and the object of comprehension,
or the nature of their mutual relations. The methods for exploring
(external) reality (<em>gewu</em> 格物) and introspective
recognition (<em>fanxing</em> 反省) were both important
as perceptive tools that primarily served to understand
relations. However, these relations can be either continuous or
discontinuous. This means that the relation between <i>A</i>
and <i>B</i> can be changed into a relation between <i>A</i>
and <i>C</i>. In Chinese epistemologies, such de-composition and
changing of positions is in the nature of comprehension (Zhang 2002:
78). In this context, knowledge (<em>zhi</em>) was primarily
understood as recognition (<em>shi</em> 識) of the structural
principles (<em>li</em>) of the all-embracing Way (<em>dao</em>),
which, among all other entities of being, was also expressed in
linguistic terms.</p>

<p>The relation as a basis or a central object and goal of any
recognition manifests itself on all levels of comprehension and
transmission of being. Hence, the relational aspect as a core of
comprehension was already apparent in the specific structure of
Chinese cosmology, which was based upon the holistic unity of humanity
and nature (<em>tian ren heyi</em>). The complexity and integrity of
relations in nature and society therefore represent a basic aspect of
Chinese epistemology. This aspect was expressed in all classical
debates, which were based upon the elementary traditional
epistemological categories of name (<em>ming</em>) and actualities
(<em>shi</em>). Relations also formed the basic postulate of
traditional thought which defined the nature of the central
epistemological relation between knowledge (<em>zhi</em>) and action
(<em>xing</em>). Primarily due to the impact of the Buddhist thought,
the ancient holistic approach to perception and understanding reality
through substance (<em>ti</em> 體) and functions (<em>yong</em>
用) was later replaced by the subject (<em>neng</em> 能)
and object (<em>suo</em> 所) of comprehension. This kind of
categorical demarcation that derived from the Indian tradition of
thought would subsequently, in the 19<sup>th</sup> and especially the
20<sup>th</sup> centuries, help Chinese philosophers gain a better
understanding of theories of knowledge in western philosophy, which
were based on the ontology of dividing substance from phenomena.</p>

<h3><a id="AxiCom">2.2 The Axiology of Comprehension</a></h3>

<p>While in the most influential European theories, knowledge has
mainly been gained through reasoning, traditional Chinese thought
understood this question in a much broader sense, namely as something
which also (or primarily) stems from moral contents. Chinese
epistemology also included teachings of wisdom and dealt with
questions such as “how is metaphysics (or metaphysical wisdom)
possible?” and “how can an ideal personality be
cultivated?” Hence, Chinese epistemology focuses upon the
internal relationship between good and truth, between virtue and
reason; it needs morality to acquire knowledge, and regards
epistemology and axiology as overlapping (Xu and Huang 2008:
42). Thus, traditional Chinese, and especially traditional Confucian
epistemology, greatly emphasizes the concept of moral
cultivation. Confucius believed that all genuine knowledge and
comprehension arises from humanness (<em>ren</em> 仁), and thus
morality should be valued to gain knowledge (Lunyu CTP: <em>Li Ren</em>, 2,
7). Classical Chinese epistemological teachings of cultivation and
theories of values both dealt with criteria and methods that evaluate
proper attitudes, ways of thinking and feelings (Xu and Huang 2008:
39). </p>

<p>In contrast with the view that the human mind is defined merely by
its cognitive potential and could thus not be autonomous, Mengzi
introduced the concept of a moral Self which is incorporated in the
original heart-mind (<em>ben xin</em> 本心, Mengzi CTP:
<em>Gaozi shang</em>, 10) i.e., the heart-mind of goodness and
morality. Xu Fuguan (1902/03–1982) noted that the moral
Self—at least in terms of its basic characteristics—was
already present in the early Zhou Dynasty (10<sup>th</sup> century
BC). When this moral consciousness is seated within a person, it
will—according to this Modern Confucian interpreter (Xu 2005:
178)—naturally begin to direct his/her life and guide his/her
desires through something he calls “moral reason”
(<em>daode lixing</em> 道德理性).</p>

<p>This spirit was focused on subjectivity; its bodily desires were
incorporated into its moral responsibility and they thus manifested
themselves in rationality and autonomy (Xu 2005: 34). This Mencian
line of thought has been developed and elaborated upon within the
scope of Neo-Confucian philosophy, especially Wang Yangming’s concept
of innate moral knowledge (<em>liang zhi</em> 良知).</p>

<p>However, due to the specific economic and political factors that
determined traditional Chinese culture, the traditional Chinese
concept of moral Self could not provide (or, at least, formulate) the
possibilities for gaining “objective” knowledge (i.e.,
knowledge not necessarily linked to morality) and exploring
“natural” phenomena. For Mou Zongsan (1909–1995),
this was the key ideological factor that explained why traditional
Chinese culture did not develop discourses of science and
democracy. He therefore argued that the traditional Confucian moral
Self should (temporarily) negate itself (<em>ziwo kanxian</em>
自我坎陷), in order to make it possible for
these discourses to develop.</p>

<p>A similar critique of classical Confucian moral epistemology
was—although from a different perspective—formulated
already by his teacher Xiong Shili (1885–1968). Based on his
central thesis dealing with the inseparability of substance and
function (Rošker 2009a: 377), Xiong created an ethical system rooted
in the classical Confucian paradigm of the nobleman (<em>junzi</em>
君子), defined as someone who possesses the qualities of
the “inner sage” and the “outer ruler.” The
concept of the inner sage refers to spiritual adjustment, while the
concept of the outer ruler has to do with that person’s social and
political activities. While this moral directive, which was expressed
in the ancient phrase <em>nei sheng wai wang</em>
內聖外王, was based on classical Confucian
political studies, Xiong criticized classical Confucianism, especially
the Neo-Confucianism of the Song and Ming dynasties, precisely in this
regard, accusing them that their epistemologies exaggeratedly
emphasized the principle of inwardness and ignored the social aspects
of the binary category.</p>

<h3><a id="OntEpi">2.3 Onto-Epistemology</a></h3>

<p>In the Chinese holistic tradition epistemology is inseparable from
ontology, as in its view of the world every object of cognition is
also cognition itself; the manner of its existence is thus linked to
our understanding of it. Because this connection goes both ways, i.e.,
their relation is not a relation of single sided dependency and
determination, but an interaction that includes mutual co-dependency,
we cannot state that this is a solipsistic conceptualization of the
world. The same as can be said for the perception of the existing
world can also be said for its comprehension and interpretation. This
cannot be separated from the wholesome, but changeable and totally
individualized existence of objects of cognition; this is clearly
manifested in the theoretical system of the so-called
onto-hermeneutics (<em>benti quanshi xue</em>
本體詮釋學), which was developed by
Chung-ying Cheng (Cheng Zhongying) (see Nelson 2011: 335; Cheng
2008). </p>

<p>In the work of the representatives belonging to the realist
currents of Neo-Confucian philosophy, as well as in the later
developments which took place during the 16<sup>th</sup>,
17<sup>th</sup> and 18<sup>th</sup> centuries, especially in the
formation processes of new methodologies and the processes of
incorporating the Buddhist thought, this unity of reality and
comprehension was modified through a gradual constitution of a
dualistic demarcation line manifesting itself in the differentiation
between the subject (<em>zhu</em>主, <em>neng</em> 能) and
the object (<em>ke</em> 客, <em>suo</em> 所) of
recognition. This demarcation line has been additionally strengthened
by the subsequent influence of Western philosophy from the
19<sup>th</sup> century onwards. The search for a synthesis between
the classical Chinese paradigm of the unity of existence and (its)
perception on one side, and the dualistic view, according to which
both realms are mutually separated on the other, led to the modern
debates on the priority of ontology and epistemology.  These debates
culminated in several attempts to revive, modernize and re-establish
the classical Chinese view of structural, organic and dynamic links
between ontology and epistemology.</p>

<h2><a id="ClaApp">3. Classical Approaches</a></h2>

<p>In the pre-Han era, the most influential epistemological debates
were conditioned by the question as regards the relations between
language, thought and reality. Hence, according to Chad Hansen (1989:
107–120), the classical Chinese discussions on language offers
new insights and a distinctive perspective on the developments of the
central discourses within this field.</p>

<h3><a id="LanCom">3.1 Language and Comprehension</a></h3>

<p>These debates were determined by the conflict between classical
Confucianism and orthodox Mohism, with the representatives of the
former advocating traditionalist positions, while the latter argued
for more utilitarian approaches (Hansen 1989: 108). In contrast to the
classical Confucian position which had been formulated in
the <em>Discourse on proper names</em>
(see <a href="#NamActLanMea">section 1.2</a>) and follows the
presumption that names imply the essence of realities, this
utilitarian position derived from their awareness of the relativity of
comprehension. Just as we can never know whether the things we
perceive are identical to reality, we can also never be certain
whether the meanings we express are actually understood in the same
way as they were intended (see Mozi CTP: <em>Jing xia</em>,110).</p>

<p>The reaction to these traditionalistic and utilitarian positions
within ancient Chinese epistemology expressed itself in two different
epistemological viewpoints that can both be designated as
“uniformist”. The foundations of the first approach were
established by the Confucian Xunzi (ca 230–310 BC) while the
central premises of the second were founded by his disciple and
founder of the Legalist school (<em>Fa jia</em> 法家) Han
Fei (280–233 BC).</p>

<p>Xunzi did not advocate the positions of pure traditionalism.  And
while he saw his epistemology as an elaboration of the traditional
Confucian teachings, it can in qualitative terms be considered as a
new reaction to traditional approaches. In this respect, Xunzi can be
placed among the precursors of the new epistemology, which advocated
universalistic positions. However, Xunzi’s own teachings were based
upon relativistic approaches. Because language depended on social
conventions, he knew how difficult it was to choose criteria for
selecting names. However, despite these views, he sharply condemned
the Mohist reformism, arguing that the Confucian system of
standardization was still the best possible way to ensure a
well-regulated and harmonious society. Contrary to the
Confucian <em>Analects</em>, he did not believe in the primary mission
of some ideal language which incorporated the essence of existing
realities, but considered names and linguistic concepts as merely
arbitrary means for expressing concrete (objective) social
realities. Despite this fundamental difference, for purely pragmatic
reasons he continued to advocate the Confucian <em>Discourse on proper
names</em>, for he was convinced that names (<em>ming</em>) also
transmitted values, thus serving the social order, and therefore had
to be adequately standardized (Xunzi CTP: <em>Zheng ming</em>, 4). He also
argued that the classification and categorization of names were not
necessarily as difficult as it first appeared, for the human senses
perceived different realities in a structurally similar way; this
physiologically conditioned similarity therefore provided a basis for
the formation of common linguistic conventions (Xunzi CTP: <em>Zheng
ming</em>, 5). These standardized agreements made a functioning social
coordination—including the connection between human acts and
moral postulates—possible. Names therefore had to be regulated
in such a way that they could serve the elite as a formal tool for
restoring and preserving their political power: It was precisely these
arguments which, in the works of his followers, would come to form the
basis for the legalistic epistemology that shaped the doctrine of one
of the most totalitarian governments in Chinese history.</p>

<p>Xunzi’s disciple Han Fei developed a philosophy that combined the
basic concepts of the traditionalistic and utilitarian approaches.
His epistemology, which was based upon the concepts of authority
(<em>wei</em> 威) and advantage (<em>li</em> 利),
represented a unified system founded on the idea of political
absolutism (see Han CTP: <em>Gui Shi</em>, 1).</p>

<h3><a id="NegLinPos">3.2 Neglecting Linguistic Positivism</a></h3>

<p>The second basic approach can be seen as derived from the negation
of the two positions we have just described, or their common features
and, in fact, denied the positivistic functions of language. This
approach also contained two different epistemological currents: the
first was pre-linguistic and had its main representative in Laozi (ca
6<sup>th</sup> century BC), while the second current, which found its
most famous exponent in the Confucian Mengzi, argued that language was
not necessarily innate (Mozi CTP: <em>Gongsun Chou shang</em>, 2.8, also see
Hansen 1989: 110–111). Their moral epistemology was equally
based solely upon introspection.</p>

<p>However, while <em>Laozi</em> represented a current which could be
defined as pre-linguistic, and though the Daoist school differed from
many of the basic premises of Mengzi’s teachings, Laozi’s negation of
language closely resembles that of Mengzi. While Laozi suggests that
the natural behavior generated by our natural constitution requires
the abandonment of language, it is hardly coincidental that the
declarative Confucian, Mengzi never mentions the <em>Proper names</em>
discourse, which occupies such an important position in
the <em>Analects</em>. They both accept the action or behavior
generated by the natural human constitution. Although they disagree on
how rich and extensive these natural dispositions are, both scholars
share the common belief that behavior should primarily be guided
through their use (Hansen 1989: 110–111).</p>

<p>While Laozi’s dao cannot be contained or inscribed within any kind
of linguistic structure, it still represents the basic cosmic and
moral force, creating and immanently governing everything that exists.
He viewed knowledge (in the sense of learning virtues) as a kind of
social pressure which impeded our natural spontaneity (Laozi CTP:
18).  In Laozi’s view, every linguistic concept is determined by time
and space, and can therefore represent only a partial, incomplete
expression of reality, which he saw as integral, dynamic and
holistically structured. Consequently, in order to preserve the
naturalness of our existence, we must withdraw from all conventions,
including that of language itself. Laozi thus sought a radically
different process of comprehension: one of non-linguistic
introspection (Laozi CTP: 47).</p>

<p>Mengzi believed that the inborn qualities of human beings
(<em>xing</em> 性) are naturally disposed towards the good If
individuals are in touch with their true nature, their actions will
inevitably tend towards the good (Allinson 1989: 17) without needing
to rely on linguistic maxims. In this sense, he formulated the first
anti-linguistic version of Confucian epistemology (Mengzi CTP: Wan
zhang shang, 5; Jin xin shang, 1, 5, 15; Liang Hui wang shang,
6). With this approach, he wanted both to refute one of the central
tenets of Mohist theory, while also resolving (or avoiding) the
central problem of Confucian epistemology, i.e., the insertion of
moral principles into behavior patterns through linguistic
interpretations (Hansen 1989: 110).</p>

<p>According to Chad Hansen (1989: 111), Mengzi did not view language
as being an innate system which contained the essence of proper social
norms, and instead believed that all traditional Confucian conventions
were ‘wired’ into the human heart-mind
(<em>xin</em>). However, this view has been challenged by other
sinologists (e.g., Shun 1997; Van Norden 2000; Ivanhoe 2002), who have
pointed out that only the four ‘sprouts’ (<em>si duan</em>
四端) of essential moral qualities (Ivanhoe 2002: 43) were
innate to heart-mind, and that these had to be properly cultivated in
order to enable human beings to comprehend the world and act in
accordance with moral virtues. But given that proper names (<em>zheng
ming</em>) did not represent a system of (moral) recognition for
Mengzi, such cultivation was not based on a shared linguistic system
or consensus (Mengzi CTP: <em>Jinxin shang</em>, 15). This position allowed
him to formulate a series of well-grounded arguments against the
challenges presented by the Mohist school.</p>

<h3><a id="ProAnaApp">3.3 Proto-analytic Approaches</a></h3>

<p>The next position which decisively influenced the further
development of epistemological debates derived from certain analytical
approaches based either upon isomorphic assumptions, as advocated by
the representatives of the School of Names (Ming jia), especially by
Gongsun Long, or upon linguistic relativism. The latter was elaborated
by the followers of the so-called Neo-Mohist school (<em>Houqi Mo
jia</em> 後期墨家) through a purely formal
analytical method. However, the approach to the linguistic analysis of
the two most important representatives of the School of Names, i.e.,
Gongsun Long and Hui Shi (ca 370–310 BC), sustained
fundamentally divergent views regarding the relationship between names
and actualities, with Gongsun Long arguing that the ideal construct of
an accomplished language was still of crucial importance, and that
language and social reality were inseparably linked and semantically
overlapping (Xiang 2000: 52). His arguments were founded upon the
Confucian premise that the ideal application of language was based
upon a complete mutual congruency of the name and the object to which
it referred (Gongsun Longzi CTP 2014: <em>Bai ma lun</em>, 4). Despite his
idealistic stance, he believed language was not only a consecrated
structure which embraced the essence of all existence, but that the
crucial function of language remained that of denominating actualities
(Gongsun Longzi CTP 2014: <em>Ming shi lun</em>, 13). This is the hypothesis which
underpins his main arguments on this topic, entitled <em>The Dispute
on Names and Actualities</em> (<em>Ming shi lun</em>).</p>

<p>Hui Shi instead believed names (<em>ming</em>) provided a basis for
categorizing reality (Xiang 2000: 51), a position which placed him in
direct opposition to Mohist approaches. His ‘constant’
relativism was also a response to Neo-Mohist realism, which was
founded upon formal distinctions as a necessary precondition for
comprehension. As his 11<sup>th</sup> paradox (see Zhuangzi CTP:
Tianxia, 7) indicates, the Neo-Mohist “obsession” with
definitions of particular terms (or names) was likewise redundant.</p>

<p>In any case, this analytic epistemological current of the ancient
Chinese tradition, which was rediscovered only in the latter half of
the 20<sup>th</sup> century, helped dispel a number of prejudices
concerning the methodological uniformity of classical Chinese thought
(Allison 1989: 8). Certain similar “realist” currents
within ancient Chinese discourses formulated additional
epistemological questions related to binary oppositions of identity
and difference (<em>tong/yi</em> 同/異), or the
consistency and quality (<em>jian/bai</em> 堅/白) of the
objects of comprehension.</p>

<p>Gongsun Long’s arguments were founded upon Confucius’ premise that
the ideal application of language was based on a complete mutual
congruency of the name and the object to which it referred.  Despite
his idealistic stance, he believed language was not only a consecrated
structure which embraced the essence of all existence, but that the
crucial function of language remained that of denominating actualities
(Gongsun Longzi CTP: <em>Bai ma lun</em>, 4). This is the hypothesis
which underpins his main arguments on this topic, entitled <em>The
Dispute on Names and Actualities</em> (<em>Ming shi lun</em>). With
respect to the concrete situation to which language has been applied,
each single thing could have only one single meaning. Of course, this
projection is in contrast with the usual application of language, for
people tend to use different names for the same objects. In everyday
language, the meanings of words usually overlap. Gongsun Long
attempted to eliminate this semantic overlapping, or at least to
reduce it to a level on which language could still be overseen and
controlled. The famous ‘White horse not horse’ debate was
an attempt to deal with these concerns.</p>

<p>For the Neo-Mohist philosophers, however, the semantic overlapping
of different terms was a natural quality of human language and,
consequently, they saw no need to eliminate it. They were far more
interested in the question of language as a means for categorizing
society.</p>

<p>However, given that the variegated complexity of language could not
be molded into a reliable regulatory structure within the linguistic
conventions (Mozi CTP: <em>Jing xia</em>, 140), they acknowledged the <em>de
facto</em> unreliability of language, concluding that a general, valid
standardization of language was impossible. In their view, the formal
indefinableness of language was, to a degree, a part of its intrinsic
structure(Mozi CTP: <em>Jing xia</em>, 168).</p>

<p>Instead of the endless search for definitions of the semantic
extensions of terms, the Neo-Mohists preferred to deal with questions
that addressed causal connections. However, their approach to these
questions differed greatly from that of formal logic in many respects.
They were disinterested in the attempts to construct an ideal
language, as expressed in the discourses on names; instead, they
focused on linguistic analyses, which led them to conclusions that
were diametrically opposed to Gongsun Long’s ideas and the early
Confucian views on the relation between names and actualities.</p>

<p>More specifically, their analyses led them to conclude that the
connections between certain individual names (<em>ming</em>), which
were simply understood as arbitrary entities of language, were
multi-layered and incoherent. While some compound terms could embrace
semantic scopes that extended beyond all the partial meanings of the
individual <em>mings</em> (i.e., the linguistic entities of which they
were compounded), in other instances the exact opposite was true (Mozi
CTP: <em>Jing xia</em>, 102).</p>

<p>However, the fragments of their analyses which have survived do not
contain any substantial discovery that goes beyond the recognition or
acknowledgment of the inconsistent nature of linguistic structures.
Thus, in contrast to Gongsun Long, their investigations were not aimed
at establishing a universal linguistic system that could unify
divergent models of language application. A fundamental premise of
their work was that the formal shapes of naming could not embrace the
complex integrity of existence, as reflected in actualities. Language
could never attain, let alone go beyond actual existence;
consequently, the objective features of reality automatically
determined and limited the structures of language, and thus our
application of linguistic constructs and expressions (Mozi CTP: <em>Da
qu</em>, 25).</p>

<p>However, this did not mean that language was exclusively a product
of arbitrary social conventions. Despite its fundamental importance,
the only Neo-Mohist attempt to establish a formal linguistic basis for
this notion can be found in their analysis of the classical
distinction between identity and difference (<em>tong yi</em>, Mozi
CTP: <em>Da qu</em>, 22).</p>

<p>The issue here is the problem of the essential relativity of this
distinction with respect to various contexts, for the difference
between the two antipodes is by no means more constant than, for
example, the difference between the notions of largeness and
smallness, or length and shortness. From a realistic viewpoint, this
can appear as paradoxical, and this paradox was formulated and
analyzed by Hui Shi, a Nominalist philosopher who was the closest to
Daoist discourses. By means of his apparently paradoxical
suppositions, Hui Shi attempted to situate the problem of identity and
difference within the context of holistic relativity. Through his
exposition of contradictions, by which he showed the limits of the
semantic extensions of certain attributes, he wished to demonstrate
the relativity of time and space as expressed in the names
(<em>ming</em>) applied in different contexts.</p>

<p>One of his most significant contributions to the classical
epistemology of linguistic analysis can be found in his comment on the
general problem of identity and difference which, as we have seen, the
representatives of the Neo-Mohist school were unable to develop to a
concise conclusion (Hui Shi in Zhuangzi CTP: <em>Tianxia</em>, 7). He claimed
that any two things were always different in something, no matter how
equivalent they were in all other respects (otherwise they could not
represent two separate entities). Yet even two things that seemed to
be completely different were likewise identical in at least one
quality, since they were both parts of a unified structure (otherwise,
it would not be possible to express, or even think of them in the
framework of language).</p>

<p>Hui Shi’s “constant” relativism was, of course, a
response to the Neo-Mohist realism, which was founded upon formal
distinctions as a necessary precondition for comprehension. As his
11<sup>th</sup> paradox indicates, the Neo-Mohist obsession with
definitions was likewise redundant (Hui Shi in Zhuangzi CTP:
<em>Tianxia</em>, 7). His categorization of identity and difference,
or of the absolute relativity of objects, was thus based upon the
impossibility of conceptual definitions of reality, since every
linguistic comprehension was necessarily limited to a contextually
determined meaning which was incapable of embracing all dimensions of
the object of comprehension. </p>

<h3><a id="EgaEpi">3.4 Egalitarian Epistemology</a></h3>

<p>Although the Neo-Mohists were never able to formulate an exhaustive
response to Hui Shi’s radical relativism, his contemporary Zhuangzi
(4<sup>th</sup> century BC) clearly found it to be an important
stimulus for his own thought, and was definitely influenced by him
when elaborating his own epistemological system. Zhuangzi believed
that because knowledge was infinite, the human capacity for
comprehension was too limited to enable us to gain any true knowledge
(Zhuangzi CTP: <em>Yang sheng zhu</em>, 1). Thus, he believed that
comprehension is always something relative (Zhuangzi CTP: <em>Qiwu lun</em>,
11). As a result, we are lost in a labyrinth of real and false
recognitions. But this apparently tragic situation is mitigated by the
fact that we do not have to face it alone, we are always accompanied
by other people who are just as blind as we are. All of us are busy
dealing with questions of mastering our reality and thus with
questions of the indefinite nature of our existence (Zhuangzi CTP:
<em>Qiwu lun</em>, 3).  Since we are determined by the limitations of our
senses, we naturally tend to acknowledge the truth of those kinds of
recognitions that happen to match our own value systems (Zhuangzi
CTP: <em>Yu yan</em>, 1).  Ultimately, human subjectivity determines what
should be regarded as (true and universally valid) knowledge. The
apparent objectivity and independence of the human mind has repeatedly
been proven to be a false, illusory chimera, which only leads to
self-deception. The quality, the features and the extent of our
perception are always determined by the actual conditions of our
existence. Hence, our perception—and the actions resulting from
it—are always dependent upon external factors, even though
ultimately, every form of dependence is actually a form
of <em>self</em>-dependence. Of course, such dependence and
determination are connected to our ignorance, to our incapacity to
recognize our essence and the essence of our surroundings (Zhuangzi
CTP: <em>Qiwu lun</em>, 13).</p>

<p>Zhuangzi believed that acknowledging the relative nature of all
existence was still not sufficient in order to define equivalents and
distinctions (Zhuangzi CTP: <em>Qiwu lun</em>, 10). In each concrete case,
the structure of our cognition enables us to identify at least one
common or different quality, which then allows us to make a
distinction, no matter how atypical it might be.</p>

<p>This position of radical relativism was common to both Hui Shi and
Zhuangzi. They also shared a skepticism concerning the idea that the
categorical mechanism of identity and difference (<em>tong/yi</em>)
could provide an adequate basis for a universal, permanently valid
(<em>chang</em>) standardization of concepts or names
(<em>ming</em>). </p>

<p>Following the tradition of classical Daoism, Zhuangzi also believed
in the inherent inexpressibility of the holistic essence of all being.
This led him to espouse the classical Daoist method of comprehension,
i.e., introspection (Zhuangzi CTP: <em>Qiwu lun</em>, 5). Although he did not
offer an instant solution to the eternal issues that form the heart of
his philosophical discourse, he tried to create a new approach to the
complex problem of human interactions. For him, the internalization of
language is a process inherent to human nature, just like eating,
drinking and breathing, or anything else that conditions our survival
(Zhuangzi CTP: <em>Qiwu lun</em>, 9).</p>

<p>However, the uncertain connection between language and thought is
not a one-way street (Allinson 1989: 11) and, in fact, the
communicative potential of language was trapped on the narrow
footbridge between speaker and hearer, between transmitter and
receiver. Therefore, Zhuangzi believed that language was inseparably
connected to comprehension; in essence, they share the same qualities
(Zhaungzi CTP: <em>Qiwu lun</em>, 2). As a result, all linguistically
determined boundaries within holistically structured reality are, in
fact, false, since language cannot express itself (Zhuangzi CTP:
<em>Qiwu lun</em>, 10).</p>

<p>Just like <em>dao</em> in its original function of the fundamental,
all-embracing essence of all beings, and just like our recognition of
this original path, language itself is also absolute in the sense of
the unity of all relative contradictions of which it is composed
(Zhuangzi CTP: <em>Qiwu lun</em>, 12).</p>

<p>Zhuangzi showed little interest in the problems that occupied the
majority of philosophers of his time, i.e., problems of connecting
different, individual minds into one comprehensible unity. He
evidently believed that the problems of inter-subjectivity were not
imposed upon us from outside; rather, he saw them as resulting from
our being trapped in patterns of socially determined ambitions. We
could never master our destinies by forceful interventions into the
integrity of everything that exists, neither by artificial and false
distinctions nor by absolute valuations. The reason for this was that
human existence was not subordinated to any external, higher powers
that could be controlled through comprehension (Zhuangzi CTP: <em>Qiwu
lun</em>, 3).</p>

<p>In such an egalitarian epistemology, each type of understanding is
equally possible. Zhuangzi’s correlativity does not provide an
absolute perspective that could overrule the judgments or valuations
of any method of comprehension.</p>

<h2><a id="BudInfNeoConEpi">4. Buddhist Influences and the Neo-Confucian Epistemology</a></h2>

<h3><a id="GenOve">4.1 General Overview</a></h3>

<p>Epistemology was the leading field of progress in Song-ming
Neo-Confucianism (Wen 2011: 271). Its systematic discussion began
after the Buddhist philosophy reached its high point in China. The
Buddhist distinction between the subjective perception (<em>neng</em>
能) and the objects of comprehension within external reality
(<em>suo</em> 所) influenced already the earliest precursors of
this intellectual stream, such as for instance Shao Yong
(1011–1077). However, in this context the most influential
stream of thought was Chan-Buddhism (<em>Chan</em> 禪). In
contrast to other schools of Chinese Buddhism, for example the School
of Pure Consciousness (<em>Wei shi zong</em>
唯識宗), the Tiantai (<em>Tian tai zong</em>
天台宗 ) and the Huayan (<em>Huayan zong</em>
華嚴宗) schools, Chan discarded traditional Indian
methods of realizing the Buddha-nature and proposed a teaching of
enlightenment in accordance with Chinese philosophical
sensibility. Its adherents, especially its last patriarch Hui Neng
(638–713) exposed the possibility of enlightening humans without
the use of words. The central topic of interest within this context
shifted from trying to understand what the world was, to understanding
the world and Buddha’s wisdom. Since the latter issue falls within the
scope of understanding a certain kind of knowledge, this discourse
represented an innovative shift from metaphysics to epistemology.</p>

<p>In this shift of philosophical paradigms, Chan Buddhism infused the
relationship between heart-mind and things-events with a distinct
sensibility that derived from classical Chinese discourses: the
continuity of heart-mind and things-events (Wen 2011: 272). In this
way, the Chan teachings synthesized earlier Buddhist and classical
Chinese epistemology, which provided a starting point for the
Neo-Confucian epistemology.</p>

<p>According to Wen Haiming (2001: 271), the general line of
development in solipsistic epistemology could be drawn as follows: the
epistemology of Chan Buddhism and Li Ao’s (772–841) study of
“<em>recovering human nature</em>” (<em>fu xing</em>
復性) provided the foundations for Neo-Confucian
epistemology; Zhou Dunyi’s (1017–1073) concept
of <em>creativity</em> (<em>cheng</em> 誠) and his
epistemological structure linking the Great Ultimate (<em>taiji</em>
太極) with the Great Ultimate of Humans (<em>renji</em>
人極), as well as Shao Yong’s teaching of <em>observing
things</em> (<em>guan wu</em> 觀物) comprehensively raised
the basic questions of this new discourse; Zhang Zai’s
(1020–1077) paradigm of <em>expanding one’s heart-mind to be
continuous with things</em> (<em>da xin ti wu</em>
大心體物) and Cheng Hao’s (1032–1085)
elaborations on <em>stilling the nature</em> (<em>ding xin</em>
定性) served as the basic frameworks and major discourses
for Neo-Confucian epistemology; Cheng Yi’s 程頤
(1033–1107) study of <em>Heavenly patterns</em> (<em>tian
li</em> 天理) and Zhu Xi’s
(1130–1200) <em>Exploration of things</em> (<em>gewu</em>)
reached their first peak in this new epistemology of the Song and Ming
periods; after them, another peak was reached in Lu Jiuyuan’s
(1139–1192) and Wang Yangming’s agreement that <em>nothing is
outside one’s mind</em> (<em>wu xinwaizhi wu</em>
無心外之物). The final stage of
Neo-Confucian breakthroughs in the epistemology field can be found in
Wang Ji’s (1498–1583) concept of <em>intentional propensity</em>
(<em>ji</em> 幾) and Liu Zongzhou’s (1578–1645) teaching
on <em>intention as the root</em> (<em>yigen</em> 意根) of
the heart-mind.</p>

<h3><a id="SubObjKno">4.2 Subjective and Objective Knowledge</a></h3>

<p>This distinction which was most often expressed in later,
17<sup>th</sup> century epistemology with the binary category of the
subject (<em>neng</em>) and the object (<em>suo</em>) of
comprehension, also definitely reveals the influence of Buddhist
thought upon the entire Neo-Confucian philosophy. In Chinese Buddhist
terminology, the term <em>neng</em> has namely also been used to
express the ability to perceive phenomena; the compound <em>neng
bie</em> 能別, for instance, was placed in opposition to
the term <em>suobie</em> 所別, whereas the first one was
understood as “that which differentiates” and the latter
as “that which is differentiated.” The two terms together
(<em>nengsuo</em>) refer to active and passive ideas; <em>neng</em>
indicates the ability to transform and <em>suo</em> the object that
was transformed (Soothill and Hodous 2014: 337).</p>

<p>However, the earliest Neo-Confucian philosophers, such as Shao
Yong, developed similar epistemological distinctions in order to
differentiate between the subject (me, <em>wo</em> 我) and
object (thing, <em>wu</em>) of comprehension, gradually leading to a
direct definition of subjective and objective knowledge.</p>

<p>In his fictional dialogue between the woodcutter and his friend,
the fisherman (Xingli da quan 1989: XIII, 3b, 932), Shao Yong
elaborated the traditional distinctions between identity and
difference into the fundamental epistemological division between
subjective and objective comprehension. This development took place in
a discourse on the nature of comprehension and the relation between
ourselves and the things we perceive.</p>

<p>In the philosophy of the main exponent of the Neo-Confucian system
of thought, Zhu Xi, these categories were developed so as to become
crucial criteria for the proper method of comprehension (Zhu 1999: 14,
53). Similar to Shao Yong, he also argued for an objective
epistemological method and tried to avoid subjective projections upon
the object of comprehension (Zhu 1999: 11, 8). In this way, he tried
to define the separation between the subject (<em>zhu</em> 主)
and the object (<em>ke</em> 客) of comprehension (Zhu 1999:
45).</p>

<p>A few centuries later, Wang Fuzhi (1619–1692) elaborated
these two basic categories from a realistic viewpoint, denied the
classical concepts of non-existence and emphasized the objective
reality that exists independently of human perception. Following the
Buddhist terminology, Wang denoted them as the comprehensive potential
(<em>neng</em>) and its material basis (<em>suo</em>). In the context
of Buddhist teachings, both the term <em>suo</em>, which referred to
the external reality and the object of comprehension, and the
term <em>neng</em>, which referred to subjective perception and the
subject of comprehension, were essentially empty (i.e., illusory),
whereas Wang includes them in his materially determined world of
comprehension and defines their relation as analogous to the relation
between function or applicability (<em>yong</em>) and (physical)
substance or essence (<em>ti</em>), with the latter as the primary and
determinant factor (Wang 1982: V., 122).</p>

<h3><a id="StrPriLeaPriCom">4.3 The Structural Principle as the Leading Principle of Comprehension</a></h3>

<p>Following the Chinese Middle Ages, the main Neo-Confucian
ontological concept of structural pattern or principle
(<em>li</em>理), as opposed to vital creativity (<em>qi</em>
氣), gradually evolved into a new, crucial epistemological
notion.</p>

<p>In the context of Neo-Confucian philosophy, things can generally be
recognized or understood through their basic structural principles.
Just as <em>dao</em> in classical Daoist cosmogony represents the
all-embracing fundamental law which manifests itself simultaneously
within every single entity of being, the Neo-Confucian <em>li</em>
expresses itself on both, the level of cosmic unity, as well as on the
level of its concrete manifestations. The nature of <em>li</em> is
thus both holistic and dualistic. According to this new aspect of
being, knowledge can only be achieved by following these principles of
the external world.</p>

<p>Although <em>dao</em> as the elementary metaphysical force is
abstract and therefore cannot be apprehended directly, it can, in
Neo-Confucian thought be recognized not only through intuition, but
also through reason. The epistemological role of the
concept <em>li</em> becomes even more salient, for <em>li</em> was
developed not only as the structural principle that defines the
concrete state of being of everything that exists, but also as the
leading structural principle of human reason (see
 <a href="#NamActLanMea">section 1.2</a>).</p>

<p>After distinguishing between subjective and objective knowledge,
Shao Yong warns against subjectivity, which is a consequence of our
inability to recognize or understand structural principles underlying
reality, making him one of the first philosophers to apply the
term <em>li</em> in the Neo-Confucian sense. In this relatively new
context, he often applied the term <em>wu li</em> 物理
(lit.: structural patterns or principles of things), which would, in
modern Chinese, serve as the translation of the Western word physics
(in the sense of physical science). Given his approach, it comes as no
surprise to find him stressing the distinction between
“true” recognition and false mysticisms. Zhu Xi also
advocated comprehension in accordance with the principle <em>li</em>
(Zhu 1999: 8, 25). Like Shao Yong, he was convinced that li was not
only the structural principle that governs the existence of all
external things, but also a necessary and inseparable part of the
human heart-mind (Zhu 1999: 60, 6, 7). However, in Zhu Xi’s view the
spiritual functions of <em>li</em> did not refer only to human reason,
but also represented the human ability to perceive and comprehend the
external world (Zhu 1999: 47). Following the priority of moral
principles within Confucian (and Neo-Confucian) epistemologies, as the
central and universal principle, Zhu Xi’s <em>li</em> also naturally
incorporated ethical components (Zhu 1999: 8, 20).</p>

<h3><a id="UltKnoExpThiVsSecMed">4.4 Ultimate Knowledge and the Exploration of Things vs. Secluded Meditation</a></h3>

<p>These new concepts led to a polarization of epistemology which also
manifested itself in the methods of comprehension. Neo-Confucian
philosophy presents two epistemological currents, which were named
“realistic” and “idealistic” (or
“intuitionistic”) by Western sinology. Both were based on
the different portions of <em>The Book of Rituals</em> (<em>Li ji</em>
禮記 ), which is part of the classic Confucian canon. </p>

<p>The epistemology of the “realistic” current followed
the paradigms of the <em>Great learning</em> (<em>Da xue</em>
大學), which postulates the exploration of things
(<em>gewu</em>) for the purpose of attaining ultimate knowledge
(<em>zhi zhi</em> 至知). These approaches were previously
advocated by Han Yu (768–824), a precursor of Neo-Confucianism,
and by most of the above mentioned Neo-Confucians such as Zhou Dunyi,
Cheng Yi and especially Zhu Xi (Zhu 1999: 14, 48). However, in
Zhu Xi’s understanding the exploration of things (<em>gewu</em>) was
not limited to the process of investigation. In order to explore a
thing one should exhaustively recognize all of its qualities (Zhu
1999: 15, 3). For him, exploring things (<em>gewu</em>) and ultimate knowledge
(<em>zhizhi</em>) form a unity (Zhu 1999: 15, 17).</p>

<p>The “idealistic” or “intuitive” studies of
knowledge of Neo-Confucian epistemology was derived primarily from
the <em>Doctrine of the Mean</em> (<em>Zhong yong</em>
中庸) and sought to achieve recognition of reality based
upon the practice of secluded meditation or concentration
(<em>shendu</em> 慎獨). The main Neo-Confucian exponents
of this epistemological current were Li Ao and Cheng Hao.  According
to them, the indeterminable cosmic force <em>dao</em> represented the
only true base of comprehension. The main goal of the introspection in
the sense of secluded meditation was thus to understand <em>dao</em>
(Cheng and Cheng 1981: I, <em>Yi Shu</em>, 13, 221).</p>

<h3><a id="InnKno">4.5 Innate Knowledge</a></h3>

<p>During the Ming Dynasty (1368–1644) this epistemological
split in Neo-Confucian philosophy manifested itself in the
establishment of two divergent streams of thought, represented by the
“realist” current of the School of the Structural
Principle (<em>Li xue</em> 理學) on one side, and the
“idealist” School of the Heart-Mind (<em>Xin xue</em>
心學) on the other. Wang Yangming, the most influential
representative of the latter, provided a crucial node in the
inextricable link between Chinese epistemology and ethics, something
that is especially evident in the main concepts of his epistemological
system: the ideas of heart-mind (<em>xin</em>), the unity of knowledge
and action (<em>zhi xing heyi</em>) and innate knowledge
(<em>liangzhi</em>). The latter notion represents an original, natural
truth in the sense of the basic recognition of the most profound
structure of existence. Innate knowledge is inborn and thus
necessarily implied in every person, forming an inseparable part of
the human heart-mind. In the same way as the heart-mind, of which it
is a part, innate knowledge also contains the basic structure of
natural principles (<em>li</em>) (Wang 1933: II, 57). This basic
epistemological concept also forms the foundation of Wang’s ethic in
the sense of moral recognition, or the distinction between good and
evil (Wang 1933: III, 26). Thus, innate knowledge represents the basic
criterion for the recognition and evaluation of individual
comprehension, as well as social interactions. Since Neo-Confucian
ideology is based on the Mencian interpretation of ancient
Confucianism, this unity of innate knowledge and moral goodness is
quite unsurprising. Therefore, Wang pointed out that Mengzi, in
contrast to Xunzi, stressed the goodness of human nature. However,
innate knowledge is not merely a passive substance of ethical
comprehension. Through the process of “successful”
introspection, it also automatically leads to “proper”
(and, thus, morally good) action, and can therefore provide a
criterion for our behavior. Here, Wang, obviously influenced by Chan
Buddhism, tried to expand upon Mengzi’s teachings, stressing that the
notions of good and evil are not absolute concepts, since all that
exists is regulated in accordance with the all-embracing and
all-encompassing structure of the natural order of cosmic reason, and
thus with the system of the structural, absolutely valid principles of
nature (<em>li</em>) (Wang 1929: II, 29a).</p>

<p>According to Wang Yangming, good and evil cannot be separated from
human “intention” (<em>yinian</em> 意念).
Hence, human action can only be evaluated in the context of specific
concrete situations. The impulse which tells us what is right
(<em>shi</em>) or wrong (<em>fei</em>) in a particular situation is,
once again, the concept of innate knowledge (<em>liangzhi</em>). As we
have seen, the binary category of knowledge and action and the
question of the relation between these two concepts represented one of
the fundamental problems of Chinese epistemology. Hence, “innate
knowledge”, the inborn capacity in which the boundary between
knowledge and action apparently disappeared, was of utmost
importance. </p>

<h2><a id="LatConDevModChiEpi">5. Later Conceptual Developments and Modern Chinese Epistemology</a></h2>

<h3><a id="PreModMet">5.1 Pre-modern Methodologies</a></h3>

<p>At the threshold of the 18<sup>th</sup> century, Chinese
epistemologists sought to establish a new analytical and critical
methodology for “exploring things (<em>gewu</em>).”
Similar tendencies could be observed already in Wang Fuzhi’s and Gu
Yanwu’s (1613–1682) notion of evidence (<em>kaozheng</em>
考證). Gradually, they acquired greater importance within
the framework of new practice-oriented approaches.</p>

<p>Wang and Gu profoundly influenced the epistemology of the School of
Practical Learning (<em>Xi zhai</em>) which consisted of two main
currents; the most important representatives of the first, Yan Yuan
(1635–1704) and Li Gong (1659–1746), followed the
essential approaches of Huang Zongxi (1610–1695) and Wang Fuzhi,
while the chief proponent of the second, the philosopher Dai Zhen,
founded his epistemological system upon Gu Yanwu’s methodology. Their
emphasis on the practical, physical aspects of knowledge and the
significance of sensations led them to rehabilitate human feelings,
inclinations and desires as a driving force that motivated human
beings to seek knowledge. By so doing, they unknowingly prepared the
terrain for the later Chinese understanding of the European notion of
the individual as the subject of comprehension.</p>

<p>Dai Zhen is widely considered to be the first Chinese philosopher
to have described the relation between the subject and object of
comprehension by defining the subject’s potential for comprehension as
a tool, which can be compared to light that makes objects visible. Xia
Zhentao (1996b: 405) especially indicates his elaboration of the
notions of the potential for comprehension (<em>xin zhi shenming</em>
心之神明), elucidation, exposure and
illumination (<em>zhao</em> 照). Xia stresses that Dai’s
reflective method, by which reality is perceived through its
reflection (<em>fanying</em> 反映) in the human mind,
pertains to basic theories of materialistic epistemology, given that
the objective reality (which is external to the subject of
comprehension) is seen as a necessary precondition of reflection (Xia
1996b: 405).</p>

<p>At this point we should mention China’s first encounter with
Western thought, which slowly began to seep into the Middle Kingdom at
that time. During the 18<sup>th</sup> century, the Jesuit influence on
the Chinese academic world grew steadily.</p>

<p>Hence, Tang Sitong (1865–1898) believed that the central
Confucian virtue of humanness (<em>ren</em>) is not merely an ethical,
but also an epistemological term that determines the social function
of the basic stuff of which everything is composed, namely of ether,
which makes it possible for people to experience circulation
(<em>tong</em> 通), i.e., one of the principal components in the
process of comprehension. In accordance with this mechanistic
understanding of concrete reality, circulation provides both the inner
and external conditions of perceiving, comprehending and transmitting
reality. In terms of inwardness, circulation makes the harmonic,
coordinated operation of the senses (<em>wu guan</em>
五官), brain (<em>nao</em> 腦) and nervous system
(<em>nao qi jin</em> 腦氣筋) possible. Tan Sitong
was one of the first Chinese scholars who accepted the Western notion
that mind and consciousness arise from the brain and not from the
heart (<em>xin</em>), as was widely believed in traditional China.</p>

<h3><a id="SynMetDis">5.3 Syntheses of Methods and Disciplines</a></h3>

<p>The majority of 20<sup>th</sup> century Chinese epistemologists
advocated the conceptual divisions between the subjectivity and
objectivity of comprehension. While analytical and/or Marxist scholars
(such as Jin Yuelin) gave absolute priority to the rational method,
most Modern Confucians (principally Xiong Shili and Mou Zongsan)
applied the intuitive one. He Lin drew attention to the traditional
complementary comprehension of reason and intuition (He 1982: 27). In
this context, the two methods are not only inseparably connected to
each other, but are also connected to the method of reasoning itself,
which is based upon distinctions. In his view, philosophers who apply
the method of intuition, simultaneously apply methods of formal logic
and dual differentiations; others, who apply the rational method, also
use the intuitive method, as well as dual distinctions. All three
methods, the formal analysis and inferences, as well as methods of
dual distinctions and intuition, are necessary compounds for any
philosophical activity (Zhang 2000: 75).</p>

<p>Within the framework of his structurally ordered system of thought,
Zhang Dongsun tried to unify both methods, and by so doing he
decidedly rejected the Modern Confucian paradigm expressed in the
glorification of intuition as the most objective mystical method for
innate knowledge. Zhang believed that reason was the only reliable and
unequivocal method of comprehension; because it led us to knowledge
that was not only logically consistent but also applicable, there was
no need to search for any other, more reliable method. However, the
rational method was not one-dimensional and undiversified, for it not
only functioned in accordance to the pure formal structure, but also
with the aid of the so-called intuitive insight (<em>touzhi</em>
透智), which represented an inseparable and complementary
part of intuitive methods. Thus, by proceeding from ratio centrism,
Zhang Dongsun finally managed to overcome the boundary between ratio
and intuition (Zhang 1924: 76). However, according to him, the thing
we are directly confronted with, is neither ratio nor intuition, but
knowledge itself. Knowledge is a result of ratio, but it implies
intuition on an unconscious level. Intuition is not mysterious. It
merely represents a process of applying a philosophical “method
of counter-investigation”, by which we peel away from the image
of knowledge the ultimate, most intimate thing. And this thing is the
pure, completely unregulated “that.” (Zhang 1924:
64–65)</p>

<p>The Taiwanese Modern Confucian philosopher Mou Zongsan tried to
define the position of reason within traditional Chinese thought by
comparing Western and Chinese culture, arguing that they were based on
different representational forms of human reason. He called the
Chinese form “functional or intensive” (<em>lixingzhi
yunyong biaoxian</em>
理性之運用表現) and the
Western “constructive or extensive” (<em>lixingzhijiagou
biaoxian</em>
理性之架構表現) (Mou 1995:
544–553). This distinction could be compared to the Kantian
differentiation between practical and theoretical reason. The
“reason” which appears in the functional representation is
a practical one. It is not abstract, but concrete, connected to actual
life. This reason can thus be equated with morality within the
personality (Mou 1995: 544–545). However, Mou endows functional
reason with intellectual intuition (<em>zhide zhijue</em>
智的直覺) which is—in contrast to Kant’s
epistemology—a potential implied not only in Divine
consciousness, but also in the human heart-mind.</p>

<p>In his treatise on Kant’s philosophy, Jin Yuelin established a
clear and insuperable demarcation between synthetic and analytical
propositions: if a certain proposition is synthetic, it cannot be at
the same time necessary or <em>a priori</em>; and if it is necessary
or <em>a priori</em>, it cannot be synthetic (Jin 1996: 46). This
difference is clearly of great importance for the elementary framework
of Jin’s theory of knowledge. Modern Confucian epistemology criticized
a similar division, since ethics and their pragmatic social
implications were still at the heart of their theoretical
efforts. Feng Youlan also encountered many difficulties related to
analytic and universal (synthetic) propositions: on one hand, he did
not wish to abandon the universality of the metaphysical statements,
because in this way he could express the ideal of every single thing,
but, on the other hand, he tried to respond to the attacks against
synthetic propositions carried out by the Viennese circle (Jin 1996:
78).</p>

<p>Zhang Dongsun maintained that a pure form of either proposition did
not exist in reality. The absence of distinctions between analytic and
synthetic propositions implies the abolition of the demarcation
between (posterior) experience and (<em>a priori</em>) knowledge and,
consequently, between metaphysics and the (natural) sciences. Most
Chinese scholars from the latter half of the 20<sup>th</sup> century
argued that the reason for this demarcation was to be found in the
fact that metaphysics only referred to the formal regulation of
experiences, while science also explained their contents (Feng 1986:
166–167).  However, some recent Chinese epistemological theories
likewise reject the reasoning behind such demarcations and criticize
the existence or methods of the discourses based upon them. For them,
both science and metaphysics explain experience; in addition, both
represent a formal kind of explanation. Hence, Zhang Dongsun
transcended the boundary between science and metaphysics, while Feng
was convinced that it was insuperable. In Zhang Dongsun’s view, the
only difference between metaphysics and science lay in the fact that
science applied the postulate of relations, while metaphysics applied
the postulates of being and existence (Zhang 2002: 77).</p>

<p>This all-embracing, specifically Chinese tendency towards
transcending abstract demarcations ultimately also manifested itself
on the level of heuristics, with respect to the question of the nature
of creating theories. In the context of the neo-holistic research,
which was, in the field of epistemology, founded by Zhang Dongsun, and
further elaborated primarily by Zhang Yaonan, the demarcation between
the concepts of discovery (<em>faxian</em> 發現) and
invention (<em>faming</em> 發明) was also considered to be
artificial. This assumption was developed as a negation of Jin
Yuelin’s paradigm which stated that theories could not be created (or
“invented”), but only discovered. Zhang Dongsun denied
this affirmation, declaring that there was no qualitative difference
between these two concepts (or methods), given that science was not a
reflection, but an explanation or interpretation of the world. He
argued that scientific discourses were a method of selection, that is,
they selected and isolated specific entities in (originally chaotic)
reality or nature, defining them as facts, even though they only
represented a kind of abstract reality. By “discovering”
facts in this way, science simultaneously created them. Thus, the
existence of facts co-existed with the results of science. Although
facts as such were not separated from nature, they could not be a part
of “pure” nature either, for in Zhang’s view, pure forms
that would be separated from our awareness, perception and
apprehension, did not exist. However, since Zhang Dongsun cannot be
considered a solipsist, for whom mind or consciousness is the sole
“creator” of reality, there had to be something apart from
humans (or living beings), despite the non-existence of substance. Of
course, this “something” was an (at least potentially)
all-connecting and all-embracing structure, which was neither material
nor ideal in its essence. In fact, this structure represented a
concretization of manifold relations. It was precisely here that
contemporary Chinese theories of knowledge once again revealed their
traditional connotation.</p>
