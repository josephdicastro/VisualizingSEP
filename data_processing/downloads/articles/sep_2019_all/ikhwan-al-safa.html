<h1>Ikhwân al-Safâ’</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Tue Apr 22, 2008; substantive revision Fri Jul 8, 2016</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
The Ikhwân al-Safâ’ or “Brethren of
Purity”, as their name is commonly translated, are the authors
of one of the most complete Medieval encyclopedias of sciences,
antecedent at least two centuries to the best known in the Latin world
(by Alexander Neckham, Thomas de Cantimpré, Vincent de
Beauvais, Bartholomaeus Anglicus, all dating back to the
13<sup>th</sup> century). The “encyclopedia” is a
collection of Epistles, the Arabic title of which is
<em>Rasâ’il Ikhwân al-Safâ’ wa
Khullân al-Wafâ’</em> (Epistles of the Pure Brethren
and the Sincere Friends). It consists of extremely heterogeneous
materials, reworked to represent the whole educational training
intended for an <em>élite</em> (see later). It is very well
known, and a great deal of research into it has been done by Eastern
and Western scholars, but the variety of topics addressed and the
questions raised as to the identity and ideology of its authors remain
unsolved. In an isolated form, and under a false attribution, some of
these treatises came to the Latin Middle Ages through the Spanish
version by Maslama al-Majrîtî, which is traditionally
placed at the beginnings of the 11<sup>th</sup> century. This already
discussed chronology (Carusi 2000, 494–500) is recently
questioned by de Callataÿ 2014. The development of research in
this direction was encouraged by the pioneer study, Fierro 1996, part.
94 and 106–108; cf. also Hamdani 1978, 350. </p>

<h2><a name="Aut">1. Authorship</a></h2>

<p>
The authors introduce themselves as a kind of
“brotherhood” (<em>ma‘âshara</em>) of sages.
Their work is addressed to “beginners,” who may thereby
increase their knowledge. The literary scholar Abû Hayyân
al-Tawhîdî (922-32/1023), basing his work on the ideas of
his master Abû Sulaymân al-Mantiqî (c. 912/c. 985),
and the mu‘tazili theologian ‘Abd al-Jabbâr
al-Hamadânî (c. 936/1025) have identified the names of
these authors. They are understood to be the <em>qâdî</em>
Abu ’l-Hasan ‘Alî b. Hârûn
al-Zanjânî and his three friends, Abû Sulaymân
Muhammad b. Ma‘shar al-Bustî, called al-Maqdisî,
Abû Ahmad al-Nahrajûrî and al-‘Awfî. All
of these men came from Basra and were linked to the Chancellery
secretary Zayd b. Rifâ‘a (cf. Stern, 1946; Stern,
1964).The text of al-Tawhîdî is accurately examined in
Kraemer 1986, 136, 230 ff. This authorship is now also questioned by
de Callataÿ 2014, because the scholar who transmitted the
Epistles to al-Andalus appears to be Maslama al-Qurtubî
al-Majrîtî, not later than the first half of the
10<sup>th</sup> century. </p>

<h2><a name="NamDat">2. Naming and Dating</a></h2>

<p>
With regard to the common denomination of “Ikhwân
al-Safâ’,” the old hypothesis by I. Goldziher
deserves mention: according to which the name could have been borrowed
from the famous collection of fables of indo-persian origin
<em>Kalîla wa Dimna</em> to indicate a group of loyal friends.
Stern (1964, 421), however, considers the name as a way of hinting at
<em>Ismâ‘îliyya</em>. The most convincing hypothesis
seems to be that which links the name to the content and goals of the
encyclopedia – the salvation of soul through attainment of
knowledge and purification of heart (Diwald 1975, 16–22).</p>

<p>
As to the date, in the 19<sup>th</sup> century F. Dieterici proposed
961 to 986, basing his estimate on the work of the seventeenth century
lexicographer Hâjjî Khalîfa and on the presence in
the treatises of verses by the famous poet al-Mutanabbî (d.
965). Massignon (1913, 324) used a verse by the poet Ibn
al-Rûmî (d. 896) to establish these years as the earliest
possible date, and took the latest possible date to be that indicated
by the definition of sine given by the Ikhwân (he referred to
the Bombay edition, vol. I, p. 46). The “expected event”
frequently mentioned in the encyclopedia would then be the Fatimid
conquest of Egypt, which can be traced back to those years. On the
basis of astronomical data, Casanova (1915) moved the dates about a
century forward, assigning the work to the years 1047–51.
Marquet reconfirmed Dieterici's earlier hypothesis, placing the
compilation of the work between 961 and 980 (al-Tawhîdî's
testimony is dated 981), but he also brought the date back to 909.
Consequently, the “expected event” might have been the
proclamation of the Fatimid caliph ‘Ubaydallâh
al-Mahdî in Ifriqiyya, which happened in that year. Hamdani
(1978) summarizes various opinions concerning the dates of the
encyclopedia, and establishes that it was composed in its whole
between 873 and 909 (Hamdani 1996, 146; Hamdani 2008 proposes the
period around 903 to 980, based on internal references and an
Ismâ‘îli interpretation). The fourth section, apart
from the first and the last treatises, is claimed to be the core
around which the first three sections have been composed (Marquet
1998, 5), as well as the culmination of the epistles, which
demonstrates the importance of the mystery of prophecy and of
imâmate (Marquet 1998, 8–9 and note 21). The authors have
also been placed in an earlier age, under the Qarmat influence
(Marquet 1977; Qarmats were the opponents of the Fatimid caliph
‘Ubaydallâh al-Mahdî), or confined to a
Mu‘tazilite approach.</p>

<p>
The traces of classical thought in the encyclopedia, as well as their
literary form, equally give an indication that the work was assembled
in the course of several decades between the 9<sup>th</sup> and the
first half of the 10<sup>th</sup> century, and that it may have
undergone further elaborations. Such a collective enterprise can be
considered as the result of a “stratified” compilation.
The supposed reworking of the whole by members of the Brotherhood
might also have shifted some Epistles from their original to their
present place. Even the headings of the four sections of the
encyclopedia are misleading. The way in which the treatises follow one
another is often inconsistent. The authors must have planned a special
use of the enormous amount of foreign philosophical and scientific
knowledge that is explained in the treatises and to develop it in
relation to the doctrinal conflicts and political changes that were
occurring in their own times. In this sense the presentation of the
encyclopedia as a “popular” work (Rudolph, 2004, 39)
should be rejected.</p>

<h2><a name="IdeCom">3. Ideological commitment</a></h2>

<p>
Because their aim is clearly salvation, it has often been supposed
that the <em>Rasâ’il</em> were inspired by the
Shî‘ites, or perhaps even the Ismâ‘îlis,
both of whom claim the ideological commitment of the encyclopedia. For
Marquet (1975, 585) the encyclopaedia is the most ancient general
exposition of the Ismâ‘îli doctrine. In 1150, the
Sunni orthodoxy in the person of the caliph al-Mustanjid judged the
work heretical and sent the existing versions to be burnt. Yet in
spite of this, the encyclopedia survived and was translated into
Persian and Turkish (Corbin, 1964, 193–194). A harsh judgment on
the Ikhwân was delivered by the famous Mamlûk muftî
and theologian Taqî al-Dîn Ahmad ibn Taymiyya (d. 1328).
He considered them as Shî‘i esotericists whose doctrines
contradict the religion of Islam. For this reason, he rejected the
attribution of the <em>Rasâ’il</em> to such an eminent
religious scholar as Ja‘far al-Sâdiq (Michot 2008).</p>

<p>
Attempts to define the Ikhwân's ideological commitment have been
made, but there has been no consensus on the matter. The
Ikhwân's view of ‘Alî as the Prophet's legitimate
legate (<em>walî</em>) persuaded some scholars to link them to
the <em>Shî‘a</em>, though scattered references in
negative terms to the “hidden” <em>imâm</em> appear
contrary to twelver Shî‘ism. Other elements have been
alleged as proofs of the Ikhwân's Ismâ‘îli
inspiration, such as the hierarchical structure of universe,
references to septenary cycles, distinction between elect and masses,
the use of Ismâ‘îli symbols (e.g., the bee as symbol
of the <em>imâm</em>, etc.). Corbin (1964, 190) openly and
radically affirmed that the Ikhwân belonged to
Ismâ‘îlism. He gave an esoterical interpretation of
the religious, philosophical, and the Brotherhood rites described in
Epistle 50 <em>On the kinds of administration</em> (Corbin 1950).
Hamdani (1996, 146) considers this treatise to be "the most explicitly
Shî‘i or Ismâ‘îli" of the entire
encyclopaedia. The main lines of Corbin's presentation are shared,
though in more nuanced terms, by Mattila 2016. Corbin was followed by
Marquet (1968, 1071) who stressed their attacks on Mu‘tazili and
Ash‘arite ideas. Stern (1964, 416–417) and Diwald (1975,
26ff.) remarked that the Epistles exercised their influence on the
Ismâ‘îlis only from the twelfth century. The
concepts and historical ideas that are at least close to those of the
<em>Shî‘a</em> – such as deprecation of the
slaughter of Karbalâ’, the allegorical interpretation of
the Qur’ân and prophecy, or the aversion to political
governments and the hope that they will fall when the present
septenary cycle comes to an end – show according to Stern (1964,
421) and later Bausani (1978, 14–16) that the authors were
representative of an Ismâ‘îli tendency, but not of
the official <em>da‘wa</em> (propaganda). Marquet 1973, on the
other hand, recognizes in the encyclopedia (in Epistle 48 in
particular, <em>On the invitation (da‘wa) to God</em>) the
official Ismâ‘îli organization at the time (see also
Marquet 1981, 95; Marquet 1998, 5, 7–8), and remarks that the
propaganda appeals here to philosophers, mystics, and rulers.
According to Hamdani (1996, 150), the event expected by the
Ikhwân is the advent of the Fatimids. Epistle 48, Marquet
claims, was written before 910, and almost entirely preserved in its
original form; but even if it was composed after the advent of the
Fatimids, its meaning would not have been perverted (Marquet 1984,
77–78). Other scholars have remarked that even when discussing
number seven, so linked to <em>Ismâ‘îliyya</em>, the
Ikhwân criticize the "supporters of the seven" (Hamdani 1979,
68; Netton 1996, 28–29). Non-Ismâ‘îli ideas
can also be found in the work, for example the invitation to celibacy
proper of Sufism. In general, the evidence supporting such theories
derives mostly from doctrines or parts of doctrines hinted at in the
encyclopedia. In denying the Brethren's Ismâ‘îli
commitment, for instance, Netton (1996, 28) remarks that, if the issue
of such an allegiance is widely debated, scholars have much less
addressed the "broader topic [...] of whether the Ikhwân
al-Safâ’ should even be considered to be Muslims". The
enormous variety of its contents and, often, their inconsistency seem
to have hindered scholars from reaching unanimous conclusions on the
authors' religious (or rather ideological) commitment and,
consequently, on their goals. The main lines of research in this field
were resumed in Kraemer 1992, 165–178. </p>

<h2><a name="ExtCor">4. The extant <em>corpus</em></a></h2>

<p>
The encyclopedia consists of 52 treatises divided into four sections
on the introductory (<em>al-riyâdiyya</em>), natural,
psycho-rational and metaphysical-theological sciences.</p>

<p>
Two additional Epistles, entitled “Comprehensive Epistle”
(<em>al-Risâla al-Jâmi‘a</em>) and
“Supercomprehensive Epistle” (<em>Risâla
Jâmi‘a al-Jâmi‘a</em>) are thought to complete
the <em>corpus</em> and explain its esoteric (hidden) meanings. Two
versions of the <em>Jâmi‘a</em> are extant. One is
currently ascribed to al-Majrîtî, the Spanish scientist
and astronomer who is alleged to have transmitted the Epistles to
Spain. Godefroid de Callatay identifies this personnage with Maslama
al-Qurtubî (m. 353/964), and the time in the first half of the
10<sup>th</sup> century, so confirming Hamdani's opinion that the
Ikhwân are located between al-Kindî and
al-Fârâbî (2014, 200). The other is ascribed to
Ahmad ibn ‘Abd Allâh ibn Muhammad ibn
Ismâ‘îl ibn Ja‘far al-Sâdiq, the second
of the three “veiled” (<em>mastûr</em>)
<em>imâm</em>s who were intermediate between Muhammad ibn
Ismâ‘îl and ‘Ubaydallâh, the founder of
the Fatimid dynasty. Recent studies on aspects of this work by
Baffioni (2011b, 2012). The <em>Risâla Jâmi‘a
al-Jâmi‘a</em> is also (Tamir s.d., 18) ascribed to Ahmad,
which strengthens the link of the <em>corpus</em> with the
Ismâ‘îli tradition. Hamdani 2008 hypothesizes a more
recent compilation for the <em>Risâla
al-Jâmi‘a</em>. At present, scholars take the study of the
manuscript tradition of this text, including an inquiry into its use
and evidence in Ismâ‘îli literature, to be an urgent
task. Epistle 52 <em>On magic</em> is the last in the <em>corpus</em>,
missing in some editions and considered by some scholars (Bausani
1978, 12) as spurious, and of little value, so the <em>Risâla
al-Jâmi‘a</em> would be the true fifty-second one (cf. de
Callataÿ 2011, 3). However, de Callataÿ inclines to the view
that the ‘short version’ of this treatise, namely, the
part approximately corresponding to the first thirty pages of the
Beirut edition, is genuine (de Callataÿ 2011, 5ss).</p>

<p>
Each Epistle starts by stating its particular goal. All of them
contain a core of technical teachings and a conclusion regarding the
<em>haqîqa</em>, the inner meaning of the contents. The texts
contain frequent invocations to the learning “brethren”
– that is, the elect who are studying the sciences – that
enhance their didactical and exhortative style; these invocations mean
that the students will be awakened “from the sleep of matter and
the negligence of ignorance” if they apply themselves
assiduously to study “with the assistance
(<em>ta’yyid</em>) of a spirit coming by God”.</p>

<p>
The Epistles vary in length and their style is plain. There are,
however, numerous ambiguities, due to language and vocabulary, often
of Persian origin, and to mistakes in the transmission of the text.
Bausani (1978, 11) thinks the authors were of Persian origin. In
general, however, the doctrines are fully and clearly exposed, with
repetitions where necessary to the didactic function of the
treatises.</p>

<p>
Diwald (1975, 12–15) has even wondered whether there were in
fact several authors of the encyclopedia because of the use at times
of the first person singular. The basic question, of course, is
whether the authors unify the doctrines of more numerous groups, as
suggested by the different contexts and even their
inconsistencies.</p>

<p>
The Ikhwanian encyclopedia is typical of the changes in Greek science
and philosophy during the tenth century as a result of the increasing
<em>Shî‘a</em> influence. In the ninth century and at the
beginnings of the tenth century, the prominent philosopher Abû
Yûsuf Ya‘qûb b. Ishâq al-Kindî (d. ca.
870) had already developed single philosophical doctrines (e.g. in
cosmology or psychology). Though elaborating them in an original way,
he had not tried to combine such doctrines with the basics of Muslim
faith. Theological considerations remain parallel with philosophical
issues. The physician Muhammad ibn Zakariyyâ’
al-Râzî (d. ca. 925), mainly interested to natural
philosophy, had even questioned the legitimacy of prophecy.</p>

<p>
At the time of al-Fârâbî (d. 950), ancient knowledge
will be considered as an organic whole – not only a sum of
theoretical elaborations, but as a real encyclopedia of sciences. It
should provide at every level, from the most elementary to the most
complex, the necessary premises for the acquisition of ultimate
knowledge – the knowledge of God. Then, authentically Muslim
thought – religious in the strict sense – begins with the
substitution of the schemes of Greek philosophy for those of the
Sacred Text. This is what I. Netton (1989) defined as “the
progressive estrangement from the Qur’anic Creator
Paradigm”. Ancient knowledge is the basis on which the patrimony
of faith is built: sciences are significant not merely in themselves
so much as a partial reflection of the single and unique divine Being.
See Heck (2008, 2002) for interesting articles that focus on both the
Ikhwân’s and al-Fârâbî’s
‘willingness to turn to philosophy to explain religion and trace
its boundaries.’</p>

<p>
The sense of truly “Muslim” science is largely a product
of the ideological commitment of the authors. Consequently, scholars
arrived to consider the Ikhwân al-Safâ’ as
representatives of a "humanistic approach" to Islam (e.g., Albert
Reyna 2007). This view, however, is challenged by their attitude, to
see the ultimate goal of their gnosiological experience as an attempt
of separating the soul from the ties of matter and purifying it to
achieve happiness in the hereafter (see also Reymond 2012, 126;
Raymond 2014, 150). For them, purification can be reached by following
prophetic revelation with the help of reason. Certainly, the study of
ancient sciences is not viewed, as by "orthodox theologians", as a
vehicle of heresy and even atheism. Rather, sciences explain the
underlying reality of the universe and so allow rational understanding
of the contents of Revelation and of religious Law. As Reymond (2012,
143) puts it, the Brethren's intellectual attitude demonstrates "une
mentalité en construction", announcing "une avancée dans
une mentalité forgée par le <em>terminus ad quem</em>
prévisible d'une autorité du dogme achronique et
indépassable".</p>

<p>
The blending of scientific and religious issues is evident from the
beginning. Sciences should be the main topic in the first and the
second sections and, partially, in the third, and theology in the rest
of the <em>corpus</em>. In spite of the fact that ancient texts are
always quoted with great accuracy from a philological point of view,
the Ikhwân deeply rework the Greek sources in line with their
goals that are completely different from those of the ancients. Thus
religion should not be underestimated in order to attain the best
comprehension of its various contents and real aims.</p>

<h2><a name="ClaHer">5. The classical heritage</a></h2>

<p>
Let us approach the first feature of the encyclopedia, that is, its
reworking the of foreign “scientific” contents. Various
cultural elements come together in the Epistles: Babylonian, Indian
and Iranian astrology, Indian and Persian narrative, biblical
quotations and cabbalistic influences, references to the New Testament
and Christian gnosis (A good survey of these contents can be found in
Netton 1991, 53ff., 89ff. More recently, the scholar has emphasized as
"Philosophically, the <em>Rasâ’il </em> [...] constitute a
marvelous epitome of the mixing of Aristotelianism and Neoplatonism in
the caldron of Islamic intellectual endeavour"; Netton 2009, 109. In
spite of the commixtion of Aristotelian and Neoplatonic ideas –
e.g., for identifying Aristotle's active cause with the faculties of
the Universal Soul, "Aristotle's terminology is all-pervasive in the
<em>Rasâ’il</em>", ibid., 111–112). Most attention
is paid to the Greeks, from the so-called “pre-socratics”
to Plato, Aristotle, Plotinus and the Stoics. The encyclopedia can
thus be considered a <em>compendium</em> of foreign sciences,
deserving attention even by those who are only interested to ascertain
the extent of what the Arabs knew of ancient doctrines at that
time.</p>

<p>
Comparisons between the Ikhwân's quotations and the extant
Arabic versions of classical works often show that they might have
used the same translations at our disposal now. When such comparisons
are not possible, the ancient <em>excerpta</em> usually correspond to
the extant original texts. We should conclude, then, that in quoting,
reporting – and, perhaps, translating – ancient sources
the Ikhwân display the same philological and philosophical
expertise associated with the scholars to whom we owe the flourishing
of the translation movement in Baghdâd. In some cases, they have
even preserved the only Arabic fragments of Greek authors known to us,
as exemplified by the well-known case of the story of Giges from
Plato's <em>Republic</em> in Epistle 52. (The story of Giges is
analyzed in Baffioni 2001, 168–170, 175–178). Platonic
references in the encyclopedia are also scarce. The majority of them
are found in the fourth section and concern the trial and death of
Socrates. There is also a hint at the doctrine of reminiscence, that
is seldom mentioned in Muslim sources; cf. for the Ikhwân
al-Safâ’ Epistle 42, III, 424, 15). The Ikhwân are
also informed about the Platonic view on pleasures and about Plato's
conception of the soul as consisting of three distinct parts: the
rational soul, which resides in the head; the irascible soul, which
resides in the heart and is the seat of courage; and the appetitive
soul, the seat of desire, which resides in the abdomen (III, 68,
4–6). The Platonic references are religiously rather than
philosophically oriented. That can perhaps be explained by the
influence of the Hellenistic <em>curricula scientiarum</em> (courses
of study) designed for philosophers. These began by a reflection on
the Stoic <em>bios theoretikòs</em> (the philosophical attitude
towards life), continued with Aristotelian works representing the
“scientific” side of knowledge, and ended with Platonic
writings, representing the “theological” knowledge
(D’Ancona Costa 1996, 30–31). The religious approach to
ancient heritage leads the Ikhwân to consider philosophy as an
“imitation of God according to human capacity”. This
definition immediately clarifies Hellenism as the authors' first
theoretical and historical reference. Their source is here Plato or,
rather, his Hellenistic reading (Kraus 1986, 99, note 4).</p>

<p>
Although the Ikhwân appear widely Aristotelian (for instance,
for their presentation of the terrestrial world or the theory of
knowledge rooted in sensation), the wealth of the available sources
led the “Pure Brethren” to support their doctrines by a
variety of theoretical models, often melted together (which even
affects the consistence of the Ikhwanian idea of God, Islamic and
Neoplatonic at the same time, Netton 2009, 108).</p>

<p>
The first topic addressed in the first section are the so-called
“quadrivium” (a Latin term meaning “the four
ways”) sciences (arithmetic, geometry, astronomy and music):
Epistle 1 deals with arithmetic, Epistle 2 with geometry, Epistle 3
with astronomy and Epistle 5 with music. Arithmetic, geometry and
music are later approached together in Epistle 6 <em>On
proportions</em>. Between these two treatises another one is added,
Epistle 4 <em>On geography</em>: <em>‘ilm al-hay’a</em>
(literally “cosmography”) was evidently considered part of
astronomy.</p>

<p>
References for the various sciences are, generally identifiable:
Euclid, Nicomachus and sometimes even Archimedes for mathematical
tenets (Epistles 1, 2 and 6); Ptolemy supports astronomy and geography
(Epistles 3 and 4); the Pythagoreans and again Nicomachus are the
sources for musical theory (Epistles 5 and 6). The Greeks already saw
arithmetic and geometry as the necessary, though not unique, means of
attaining philosophical knowledge.</p>

<p>
Much of this section is devoted to logic, the “instrument”
of sciences according to Aristotle and a view widely shared by Muslims
(see Epistles 10–14). These treatises take the place of grammar,
logic and rhetoric, that in Middle Ages constituted the
“trivium” (in Latin: “the three ways”)
sciences and were the basis of a “liberal arts” education.
There is no place for poetry or for rhetorical devices in the
encyclopedia. Dialectics increases damaging opposition among the
learned. Although the Ikhwân appear interested in spoken
language and even in phonetics, they never approach grammar as a
science. Rather, they examine the technique of the
“universal” form of language – logic. In the
well-known 10<sup>th</sup> century debate on the superiority of
grammar or of logic, they might have sided with the Christian logician
Abû Bishr Mattâ ibn Yûnus more than with the
grammarian Abû Sa‘îd al-Sirafî (cf. Heck 2008,
11 for a new perspective on this issue). “Trivium” was
considered preparatory for the “quadrivium,” which was in
turn considered preparatory for the study of philosophy and theology.
The “trivium” and “quadrivium” sciences are
described in the encyclopedia in an original way as distinct from that
of other Muslim writers as well as the Latin west (de Callataÿ
2005, 61–62). Hellenistic influence is remarkable even when the
Ikhwân rely on Aristotelian logic. The logical treatises include
paraphrases of Porphiry's <em>Isagoges</em>, which the later Greeks
considered to be the first book of <em>Organon</em> (<em>Rhetoric</em>
and <em>Poetics</em> were taken to be its last books). It is followed
by Aristotle's <em>Categories</em>, <em>De interpretatione</em>,
<em>Prior</em> and <em>Posterior Analytics</em>.</p>

<p>
This choice of texts shows that the Ikhwân conform to the
“old” tradition that restricted research to the first
Books of the <em>Organon</em>, not to that of their great contemporary
al-Fârâbî, who expanded it to the whole logical
<em>corpus</em>. This might be due to the religious aims of the
encyclopedia. Religious matters can only be treated by relying on the
sound (<em>sahîh</em>) method for knowledge, while procedures
aiming at mere persuasion or linked to the attainment of that which is
useful (and not true) are not to be employed. Logic is no longer a
simple instrument of science as it was for Aristotle, but a true
science, perhaps the most important one. The Brethren call it
“the scale of sciences” through which the wise men are
able to discern “true from false in speeches, right from wrong
in opinions, truth from vanity in beliefs and good from evil in
acts” (cf., e.g., Epistle 7, I, 268, 14–16).</p>

<p>
Epistle 7 <em>On the theoretical arts</em> carefully sketches the
Ikhwân's epistemological vision. A sort of “table”
of human sciences is given (I, 266, 14–274, 21). There are three
kinds of sciences in hierarchical progression: the
“propaedeutical” (or preparatory,
<em>al-riyâdiyya</em> again), those imposed by religious Law
(<em>al-shar‘iyya al-wad‘iyya</em>) and the
“philosophical sciences allowing the full comprehension of
truth” (<em>al-falsafiyya al-haqîqiyya</em>, higher than
the religious sciences). The sciences listed first in the table are
labelled “propaedeutical” just as the
“trivium” and “quadrivium” sciences of the
encyclopedia, but here the term is used in a totally different sense.
It concerns matters of practical utility, such as reading and writing,
grammar and poetry (someway close to the “trivium”
sciences), but also magic, mechanics, arts, trades, history and so on.
Although the Ikhwân state that the sciences of the third group
– the “philosophical” in the higher sense of the
word – are the object of their Epistles, they do not coincide
exactly with the contents of the encyclopedia, at least, with those of
the <em>corpus</em> now available. So, the table can be considered as
evidence of the fact that the whole encyclopedia has been produced
during a very long period of time. On the one hand, it might have been
retained as a first draft of the future enterprise; on the other, it
shows the further elaborations of the <em>corpus</em> over the
centuries.</p>

<p>
Epistles 7 and 8 explicitly recall the Aristotelian division of the
theoretical and practical sciences. Epistle 7 is extensively based on
Aristotle (when the Ikhwân introduce the nine
“philosophical questions,” they are thinking of the
Aristotelian categories, cf. I, 262, 14–266, 7; Epistle 29, III,
35, 6–7; Epistle 40, III, 345, 6–346, 6; Epistle 42, III,
513, 14–16 and 514, 13–516, 5). However, the ultimate goal
of the scientific investigation is identified with the path towards
hereafter and even connected to asceticism where scientists and
prophets follow the same way: Aristotelian science is linked to the
Isma‘ili teaching (<em>ta‘lîm</em>, cf. I, 274,
20–275, 4). The “programmatic” aim of Epistle 7
leads us to consider it as the ideal introduction to the whole
<em>corpus</em>. On the other hand, the authors'
Ismâ‘îli commitment is proven by the fact that in
the complementary treatise <em>On the practical arts</em> the ancient
“banausic” (utilitarian) activities are dealt with which
were held in high esteem in Ismâ‘îlism (cf. Lewis
1943; Marquet 1961; Daftary 2007, 115; and more recently, Yasien
2006).</p>

<p>
Although the content of the first section is the most
“uniform,” inconsistencies are found already in it. This
is especially clear in Epistle 9, which portrays the “ideal wise
man” from the standpoint of the encyclopedia, where moral
edification is never separated from theoretical teaching. The approach
is more than an echo of the well known Aristotelian division of
philosophy: it stems from the view of the Ikhwân that he who
searches for true wisdom must be endowed with a true mind as well as a
pure heart. Epistle 9 breaks the series of the scientific treatises.
Various moral behaviours are considered, with the support of a long
series of anecdotes about prophets and wise men. There is also textual
evidence that the Ikhwân may in practice have found asceticism
(Sufism?) as another way of attaining or “enhancing”
purification (cf. Epistles 6, 16 and 24).</p>

<p>
The composed and eclectic character of the whole is even more evident
in the three other sections. In the second section, the Epistles
15–22 follow the Hellenistic arrangement of Aristotle's works on
physics. Epistle 15 echoes the themes addressed in the
<em>Physics</em>. In Epistle 16, entitled, <em>On the heaven and the
world</em>, the Ikhwân are shown to be in line with the Muslim
tradition which transformed the ancient <em>De caelo</em> into a new
book <em>De caelo et mundo</em>. Epistle 17 deals with <em>De
generatione and corruptione</em>. Epistle 18 about meteorological
phenomena and Epistle 19 about minerals recall the contents of
<em>Meteorology</em> I-III and IV respectively. <em>Meteor.</em> IV,
sometimes considered spurious and “the first chemical work in
ancient world” according to scholars, was the basis of the
theories of “chemical” or “alchemical”
transformations in Islamic sciences and of mineralogy. The Ikhwanian
treatise deals with mineralogy, geology and gemmology and in the
correspondence established between the celestial and sub-lunar worlds,
between the stars and minerals, it expresses one of the main tenets of
alchemy. Further Aristotelian echoes are found in Epistle 24 <em>On
sense and sensation</em>, to which Epistle 35 <em>On intellect and
intelligible</em> corresponds in the third section. After topics
concerning nature, such as the human body in Epistle 23, conception in
Epistle 25, and man as microcosm in Epistle 26 [on the relationship
between micro- an macrocosm see Maukola, 2009 and, in quite a new
perspective, Nokso-Koivisto, 2011) the most important topic for the
Ikhwân, the human spiritual dimension is addressed. It is
discussed in terms of the relationship between soul and body in
Epistles 27 e 28, life and death in Epistle 29, and pleasures in
Epistle 30. The Aristotelian theory of the immovable mover, which is
introduced in Epistle 37 <em>On love</em>, to explain the movement
imparted to stars by the heavenly Universal Soul accomplishes its
religious meaning. It serves to confirm the love human beings feel for
permanence and their hatred for death: God is the most beloved as the
everlasting cause of all beings.</p>

<p>
On the other hand, natural treatises reflect the availability of the
rich range of mineralogical, botanical and agricultural works, but
none of the works by Aristotle on minerals or plants were known to the
Arabs. The <em>corpus</em> <em>aristotelicum</em> on animals reached
them (apart from the <em>De partibus</em> and the <em>De generatione
animalium</em>) in an abridged form under the title of <em>kitâb
al-hayawân</em>, but Epistle 22 <em>On animals</em> is quite far
in its content and goals from the Aristotelian <em>corpus</em>. In
fact, it places the whole matter within the well-known metaphysical
dispute on the superiority of man on animals (besides some attempts of
viewing it even in an "ecological perspective"; see, more recently,
Darraz 2012; Raymond 2014, 151). .</p>

<p>
The authors' view of embryology (Epistle 25) is also a collection from
different sources. On the one hand, the Ikhwân were not
physicians, though they display extensive knowledge of anatomy and
share the Aristotelian thesis of the origin of the embryo from the
sperm and menstrual blood, while they did not accept the ancient
Hippocratic theory as developed by Galen, of a female sperm coexisting
with that of the male in the formation of the human being. On the
other hand, they emphasize an astronomical/astrological approach to
embryology that was not in Greek sources. It is considered to be a new
idea introduced by Islamic scientists, from whom it passed into the
Latin world. Greek sources for Epistle 37 on love also vary.</p>

<p>
The real deviation from Aristotelianism is Epistle 20 <em>On
nature</em>. In that it shows how nature as taught by Aristotle was
received and theorized by the authors, this treatise could serve as
the perfect introduction to the section on natural sciences. However,
its main part regards angelology. It also introduces a Neoplatonically
inspired conception of Nature, suggestive of
Ismâ‘îli philosophical positions, as Abû
Ya‘qûb al-Sijistânî's representation of Nature
as “agent power” and “principle of
movement”.</p>

<p>
Though the Ikhwân never mention Plotinus explicitly, the third
section opens with two treatises that deal with rational beings as
understood by the Pythagoreans (Epistle 32) and the Ikhwân
al-Safâ’ (Epistle 33). These treatises demonstrate beyond
doubt that these authors considered themselves true Muslim
Pythagoreans. Pythagoras is said to be “a monotheist from
Harrân”. The Pythagorean idea of the one as the principle
of numbers, and not as a number itself explains that God is the origin
of beings, and not a being like others. If God is like the one, the
Active Intellect is compared to number 2, the Universal Soul to number
3 and Nature (or Matter) to number 4 (cf. e.g. Epistle 40, III, 347,
5). The encyclopedia resumes Pythagorean mathematical and musical
theories and adopts a numerological approach on the basis of the
Pythagorean tenet that “existing beings correspond to the nature
of number”. The whole reality is considered under a
numerological perspective. Every aspect of nature – and even of
religion – follows a numeric pattern. This should demonstrate
that the cosmos – also introduced as a
“macranthropos” (man as the pattern of the external world
as a whole) in Epistle 34 – is organized according to recurrent
and well-determined quantitative models, being at the same time
completely dependent on God, the principle of everything just as one
is the root of each number.</p>

<p>
Among the other philosophical schools and doctrines quoted in the
encyclopedia an important role is played by hermetism (the religion of
the philosophical elite in Ancient Egypt, founded by Hermes
Trismegistus), as in Epistle 3 <em>On astronomy</em> and, more
broadly, in Epistle 52 (Marquet 1973, 1988). Ancient theories on the
movements of the stars will finally evolve in Epistle 36 <em>On cycles
and revolutions</em> into that which, following Cumont, G. de
Callataÿ (1996, 36–37) has defined as a “fatalisme
astral”.</p>

<h2><a name="RelCom">6. The religious component</a></h2>

<p>
Just like philosophy, as a way towards salvation, is an imitation of
God and implies that the disciple is provided not only of an acute
mind, but also of a pure heart (through which God will be recognized
as the sole and the supreme teacher in knowledge and deeds, as the
Holy Book demonstrates, cf., e.g., Qur., II, 31: ‘And He taught
Adam the names', mentioned in Epistle 28, III, 18, 14–16 and in
Epistle 31, III, 112, 19 and 141, 13–14; cf. also Epistle 23,
II, 381, 17), the Ikhwân consider prophetic message (both
esoteric and exoteric, hidden and clear) as the second necessary means
for human salvation and happiness. This brings us back to the second
aspect of the encyclopedia, its religious commitment.</p>

<p>
We already saw that the Ikhwân rework the classical heritage in
religious terms. They also deal with doctrinal questions linked to
religion. Epistle 42 <em>On opinions and religions,</em> the other
“programmatic” treatise of the encyclopedia that opens the
fourth section, is a discussion of the basic ideas of the Brotherhood
such as the multifaceted epistemological problems, the origin of the
world, morals and theodicy and the imamate as well as the various
doctrines critically considered by the Ikhwân, such as
eternalism and dualism. It also develops the apologetic side of
Ikhwanian thought. From Epistle 43 onwards, the Ikhwân build
their own system from a religious point of view, often in the
fragmentary style typical of Muslim esoteric writings. Epistle 43
considers the way towards God through purification; then the beliefs
of the Ikhwân al-Safâ’ and of the so-called
“Divines,” the heirs of a prophetic tradition whose origin
is ascribed to the ancient wise men (Epistle 44). Epistle 45 expounds
the organization of the Brotherhood based on mutual help. Epistle 46
considers the faith, not only of Islam, but also of the former
monotheistic religions and of the ancient wise men. Epistle 47
considers prophecy and the imamate. Epistle 48 discusses propaganda.
Epistle 49 deals with the so-called “spiritual beings,”
that is the angels charged with the motion of the spheres. Epistle 50
discusses the various kinds of 'administration' (physical, spiritual,
personal, familiar, etc.), the core of the Epistle being the religious
and philosophical approach to God. Epistle 51 duly gathers up the
threads of the whole, followed by Epistle 52 on magic.</p>

<p>
Epistle 40 <em>On causes and effects</em> addresses the crucial
problem of the origin of the world. The Ikhwân subvert to
religious purposes Aristotle's teleological approach that
“nature does not make anything in vain.” Understanding
creation, one of the basic Muslim tenets, is recognized as the highest
attainment of knowledge. So, the ancients are defended from the charge
of eternalism (cf. III, 356, 11–18) and, for the sake of the
masses, creation is even explained through the comparison of God with
a confectioner. However the Ikhwân – like the
Ismâ‘îlis – adopt Neoplatonic views as the
best explication of the origin of the world by God. The world, then,
emanates from God through the hypostases of Intellect and Soul.
Emanationism is the philosophical expression of creation; it also
explains the encyclopaedic structure of the treatises. The various
levels of reality down to the three kingdoms of the generated beings
(animal, vegetable and mineral) originate continuously through
intermediaries from the One. For this reason, by acquiring all the
sciences from the lowest to the highest it is possible to attain the
common source of everything, the ‘science of God’ in the
double sense of pertaining to God and concerning God – the
ancient metaphysics (<em>metà ta physikà)</em> no longer
indicates what comes “after” physics but what is
“beyond” it. Thus, rather than a mere foreign source,
Neoplatonism (merged with Neopythagorism) can be considered as the
Ikhwân's proper philosophy. Philosophy as imitation of God
continues as the guiding principle of the Ikhwân's system,
together with equal emphasis on divine revelation.</p>

<p>
The <em>corpus</em> addresses other main religious issues in Muslim
faith: the unity and uniqueness, and the attributes of God, angels,
human destiny, good and evil, resurrection. Divine will and power are
also considered when trying to explain evil in the world, though, of
course, Muslim faith does not allow identifying God as the cause of
evil (Epistle 19). Ultimately, the Ikhwân attribute it to human
responsibility, or, better, to the responsibility of creatures in
general and they do so in quite a Mu‘tazilite perspective. In
the hierarchical disposition of universe there are
“intermediate” beings to which everything that happens in
the world may be related. God, a quite remote “first
beloved” is beyond all this, like the kings, whose orders are
behind everything built during their reigns. Epistle 39 <em>On the
kinds of movement</em> considers the movement of the whole cosmos,
from that of the stars down to those (natural and voluntary) of human
beings. Its aim is to demonstrate the existence of a God who created
the world and who will bring it to an end. In Epistle 27 souls (that
are self-subsistent according to the ancient doctrine) unite
themselves to human bodies in order to ensure human salvation; hence
wise men and prophets are said to be the “physicians of the
souls” (III, 13, 7 ff.). The main religious topic is, however,
resurrection, thoroughly examined in Epistle 38 where it is also
considered as the supreme science (III, 288, 3–5). The theme was
already addressed in Epistle 29 (wisdom is recognizable in death in
that it allows the vision of God, hence the highest sorrow is
damnation). On the same line, Epistle 30 states that the real
“Hell” is earth, “Paradise” is heaven.
However, the Ikhwân deem as “providential” the
ignorance of the beauties of the afterlife, which might urge people to
desire death before the natural end of life. In doing so, they are far
from the Pythagorean doctrine that considered the soul as a fallen
divinity imprisoned within the body as in a “tomb”.</p>

<p>
In conclusion, whereas in <em>Ihsâ’
al-‘ulûm</em> (“The Enumeration of the
Sciences”), al-Fârâbî deals with Muslim
sciences such as theology (<em>kalâm</em>) and law
(<em>fiqh</em>), the Ikhwân mainly stress religion. In the
<em>Rasâ’il</em>, the usual distinction between
philosophy/sciences (the rational or <em>‘aqliyya</em>
knowledge) and theology (the received or <em>naqliyya</em> knowledge),
or between reason and faith is not valid as both are combined.</p>

<p>
On the formal side, the religious commitment appears in the frequent
Qur’anic quotations in support of ancient doctrines, sometimes
through interpretations that are not in line with the theological
ones. Above all, the Ikhwân appropriate the Muslim ideal of
attaining happiness in this world and the hereafter and indicate in
the treatises how to reach it. In physical terms it is by caring for
the body, which when healthy and balanced is the condition of the
purification of the soul. In metaphysical terms, the purified soul is
said to be capable of knowledge, so of being saved – even
though, like the Ismâ‘îlis, the Ikhwân deny
salvation as attainable through solely philosophy.</p>

<p>
Prophethood is an undeniable part of the theoretical experience
featured by the Ikhwân. Their political vision is linked to this
and implies that attainment of happiness is considered in political
terms, too, where it results in examination of what has to be
accomplished to be worthy of entering the entourage of the
<em>imâm.</em> In Epistle 40 the science of the esoteric
interpretation of the Qur’ân (explaining its hidden
meaning) is emphasized as the highest divine gift (in doing this the
Ikhwân give an interpretation of Qur., III, 7 which precedes
that, much more well-known, given by Averroes two centuries later, cf.
III, 344, 10–345, 5).</p>

<p>
The second pivot of the Ikhwân's philosophy in addition to
creation is their discussion of the imamate. It has its first origin
in Epistle 31 <em>On the diversity of languages</em> (now considered
from the standpoint mentioned in the title by Albert Reyna 2009). Here
the Ikhwân show that religious creeds change as a result of
language transformations. More particularly, differences and contrasts
within the <em>umma</em> due to changes in the Arabic language are
linked to the debate regarding the identity of the Messenger's deputy,
which is the main cause of schism in Islam “until their
time,” the Ikhwân say (cf. Epistle 31, III, 153,
8–10 and 165, 8–12). While everybody agrees on the tasks
of the <em>imâm</em>, there is a disagreement as to his
identity. This is because imamate is of two kinds: prophetic and
regal. Usually the tasks of the ruler are neatly distinguished from
those of the prophet, because governance is a mundane business and
prophecy is related to the life to come (III, 497, 5–6). On
occasion these qualities are combined in a single person, who is then
the delegated prophet and also the ruler (III, 495, 18–19).
While the Prophet Muhammad was both prophet and ruler of the Muslim
<em>umma</em>, so ensuring its best defence, his possible successors
did not always match him in nobility. Subsequently, prophecy and
governance are sometimes found in two different persons, one of whom
is the prophet delegated to that community and the other the person
who has been given power over them. They support one another (III,
495, 19–21). The real problem seems, then, to be the dignity of
the person appointed as the caliph, which alone is the condition of a
legitimate prophetical succession. The Ikhwân's specific idea on
the identity of such a person is not clear. In addition, there is
apparently no distinction between the prophet, the <em>imâm</em>
or the ruler with regard to the required qualities, as Epistle 47
<em>On the essence of divine Law</em> demonstrates. The sole
“doctrinal” solution offered in the encyclopedia seems
that a ruler with ascetic tendencies can legitimately take the place
of the <em>imâm</em>.</p>

<p>
The political ideas of the Ikhwân al-Safâ’ have not
been extensively analyzed by scholars, except when they have been
considered as a political movement. (The Ikhwân's interest in
political issues is mainly emphasized by Eastern scholars who in
general incline towards the hypothesis of their being
[“filo]-Isma‘ili”. Cf. Hijab, 1982; Tamir, 1983,
89–108). In fact, the “Pure Brethren” are contrasted
with the “philosophers,” who were understood to have taken
an alienist position with regard to the political expectations of the
society in which they lived, as a consequence of their evaluation of
Plato's <em>Republic</em> (cf. e.g. Kraemer 1987 and Stroumsa 2003).
However, the Ikhwân do not fail to approach policy from a
theoretical standpoint and the philosophical doctrines developed in
their Epistles can be understood to be a functional element of their
political vision. In Epistle 48 <em>On the invitation to God</em>, a
<em>madîna al-fâdila</em> (perfect city) is featured
– less known but no less worthy than that proposed by
al-Fârâbî. This time the Ikhwân do not hide
themselves behind the ancient Platonic heritage: they openly adapt a
Greek idea to a Muslim situation, and various aspects of the
'Ismailism' of the treatise have been highlighted in Baffioni, 2014a.
</p>

<p>
Were the Ikhwân Ismâ‘îlis? This of course
opens the way to the second side of the argument – the
Ismâ‘îli commitment of the Ikhwân.</p>

<p>
The saying “<em>dîn</em> and <em>mulk</em> are
twins” in reference to the prophet and the king empowered to
perform the functions of the <em>imâm</em> in the sense preached
by the Ikhwân perfectly fits the Fatimid rulers. If this
hypothesis is tenable, the debated “traditions” mentioned
in Epistle 31 with reference to the misunderstandings due to the
diversity of languages might be understood as the Fatimid versions of
the divine Law. If the Ikhwanian “Lawgiver” is identified
with the historical incarnation of the Isma‘ili faith, that is,
with the Fatimid caliph, and if the “perfect city” is the
one ruled by these caliphs, then the Ikhwân al-Safâ’
are his <em>du‘â’</em>. Epistle 48, with the mention
of the term <em>da‘wa</em> in the title, might further support
the hypothesis of a project of concrete militancy by the
Ikhwân.</p>

<p>
The Ikhwân appear as the learned people who have the task of
promoting propaganda (<em>da‘wa</em>). Sometimes they even seem
to appropriate the qualities of the king-<em>imâm</em>; in
Epistle 47 they introduce themselves as the best guides for the
defence of Islam in terms of <em>al-hukamâ’ wa
al-falâsifa wa al-fudalâ’</em> (“wise men,
philosophers and excellent people”) and of the
<em>anbiyâ’</em>, <em>khulafâ’
al-anbiyâ’ wa</em> <em>al-a’imma
al-mahdiyûn</em> (“prophets, successors of the prophets
and well-guided <em>imams</em>,” IV, 126, 5-17). That the
Ikhwân aim to be the guides of the elect community is further
confirmed by a passage in Epistle 9. The ascetics are described as
those “who know the shortcomings [of the world], who crave for
the hereafter and are convinced of it, firmly rooted in its science,
that is the sincere Friends of God, [His] faithful servants, the cream
of all [His] creatures, whom the Creator – may [He] be exalted
– called ‘persons of understanding, persons of view,
persons of mind’” (I, 357, 5–9). These qualities
correspond to those of the Ikhwân engaged, as the leaders of
their community, in their philosophy of salvation; but they also fit
the prophets and the <em>imâm</em><em>s</em> perfectly. From
this point of view the reading of the Holy Book our authors have in
mind – rather than a Shî‘i or Isma‘ili
perspective – might be the <em>ta’wîl</em> performed
in their own encyclopedia, where God's Word is continually quoted and
commented (Baffioni 2012b; Gobillot 2013). And they refer to the
spiritual city as “our spiritual city,” which coincides
with Paradise.</p>

<p>
In Epistle 47 the legacy of the Prophet is said to be inherited by
“the most intelligent” (<em>al-‘uqalâ’
al-akhyâr</em>) which emphasizes the epistemological function of
the Shî‘ite caliph. In this case a temporal ruler, the
“ruler <em>imâm</em>,” is no longer necessary
because the rational Law is the real guide, “incarnated”
in the “rightly guided” <em>imâm</em> and in his
reason and knowledge. In contrast to Baffioni 2006, 149–150,
Heck (2008, 205–209) seems to side with Netton's reading of the
intellect-guide in terms of a rational intellect.</p>

<p>
Further elements allow a better defining of the Ikhwân's
political position. The history of early Islam is approached from a
Shî‘i perspective; some important events of the prophet
Muhammad's life and mission are recalled; soon attention shifts to two
fatal events which led to the defeat of Shî‘ism, the
battle of Siffîn and the slaughter of Karbalâ’. In a
passage on the struggles for imâmate, the “representatives
of the Muhammadic (<em>Muhammadiyya</em>) Law and of the Hashimi
federation” (cf. Epistle 31, III, 165, 11–12) are opposed.
If the latter are the ‘Abbasids (or even the supporters of
Abû Hâshim, son of Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyya), the former
should be understood as the direct descendants of the Prophet through
Fâtima, whence the Ikhwân's strict ‘Alid militancy
should be demonstrated.</p>

<p>
Another passage from Epistle 31 (III, 153, 11–156, 9) might urge
to suppose that the authors' target was the caliph
al-Ma’mûn, in spite of his pro-‘Alid policy (and
political support of Mu‘tazilism). The Ikhwân report on a
ruler, who encouraged politico-religious controversies among the
<em>‘ulamâ’</em> (learned) of different persuasions,
claiming for himself the right to interpret the Law on the basis of
the Mu‘tazili doctrine of the created Qur’ân.
Juxtaposed to him is <em>ahl bayt al-nubuwwa</em> (the immediate
family of the Prophet: Muhammad, his daughter Fâtima, his cousin
and son-in-law ‘Alî and their sons, al-Hasan and
al-Husayn) as the guarantors of the true tradition concerning
prophetic succession. The Ikhwân could then still be identified
with the supporters of the strict ‘Alid conception of the
imamate, according to which the science of caliphate belongs to the
family of the Prophet only.</p>

<p>
If this hypothesis is tenable, Epistle 31 contains not only the core
of the Ikhwân's political thought, but also of their
Ismâ‘îli commitment. Their presentation of the
“perfect city,” in which mutual love is the basis and the
goal of the community, does not help us to ascertain whether the
Ikhwân have in mind spiritual rule or a true government such as
that of the Fatimid caliph, of whom they might be the
<em>du‘â’</em>. Scholars tend to consider this
“perfect city” as utopian as the Farabian (cf. e.g.
Marquet 1973, 153; Hamdani 1999, 81). The defeat of evil people is
also often foreshadowed in the encyclopedia (cf. e.g. Epistle 31, III,
154, 19–24 and 156, 2–3). In Epistle 4 the Ikhwân
present a cyclical conception of ruling dynasties, and state that
“the dynasty of the evil reached its apex,” hence only
decline and diminution are to be expected in the future. According to
Tibawi (1955, 37, note 4), the Ikhwân forebode here the fall of
the ‘Abbasids. Cf. also Tibawi, 1978, 60.) The dynasty of the
good begins when the learned agree “on a unique doctrinal school
and a single religion,” commit themselves to mutual help, and
desire the vision of God and doing God's will as their [sole] reward
(I, 181, 14–182, 2).</p>

<p>
On the basis of his previous researches, ‘Abbas Hamdani
introduced the Ikhwân al-Safâ’ as a “group of
intellectuals working as a think-tank for the Fatimid
<em>da‘wa</em> and preaching an activist philosophy of change
needed in the Muslim world”. Moh. Jalub Farhan, however,
describes the Ikhwân as opposed to the Buyid regime, in spite of
the fact that it supported science (1999, 30, 31). The Brethren who
cooperated in the final version of the encyclopedia in the tenth
century might have been disguised adversaries of the Buyids, who were
Shî‘ites, not Ismâ‘îlis.</p>

<p>
On the whole, the political vision outlined above is founded on
doctrinal elements of Ismâ‘îli nature. The division
between the “elect” and the “masses” destines
the former only for investigation of the <em>curriculum studiorum</em>
at the basis of the “philosophy of salvation”. A rigid
hierarchy of universe links each level of existence, physical and
spiritual, to that which precedes and that which follows it where the
beings that belong to the various levels cannot go beyond them. (It
should be noted that this may question the idea of
“evolution” in the Ikhwân that some scholars have
ascribed to them; cf. e.g. Vernet Ginés 1990, 190; Marquet
1992). The didactic aims of the ruler mirror the aspect of
Ismâ‘îli propaganda known as
<em>ta‘lîm</em> (lit.: “teaching”).</p>

<p>
The influence of the <em>Epistles</em> on later
Ismâ‘îli literature has been widely recognized
(Daftary 2007, 236). Their content has been transmitted and developed
by subsequent thinkers of various persuasions. It is noteworthy,
however, that extended literal quotations (and even translations) from
the Ikhwân al-Safâ’ are found in the famous
Ismâ‘îli thinker and missionary Nâsir-e
Khosrow (1004–1074) (see Baffioni 2013b: this may be a proof of
the use of the <em>Rasâ’il</em> in 11th century
Ismâ‘îli authors, in contrast to Diwald 1975, 27. If
the Ikhwân al-Safâ’ were Ismâ‘îlis
or in someway linked to Ismâ‘îlism, then
Ismâ‘îlism influenced a much wider part of Islamic
thought and culture than previously recognized.</p>

<p>
With regard to an Ismâ‘îli commitment to the
Ikhwân al-Safâ’, some aspects of their philosophy of
nature (geology, mineralogy, and botany) have been recently examined
(Baffioni 2008, 2009, 2010b; de Callataÿ 2008). Mineralogy and
botany have been explored in order to find similarities with
Ismâ‘îli philosophy, in particular with the
Ismâ‘îli thinker and missionary Hamîd
al-Dîn al-Kirmânî. The result is that they share
many basic views, but the Ikhwân has greater detail. Moreover,
some aspects of the Ikhwân’s cosmology, and in particular
their use of the term and concept of <em>ibdâ‘</em>, are
relevant in identifying the similarities (Baffioni 2011a; 2013a;
2013c). One final interesting question is how the meaning of
<em>abâlisa</em> and <em>shayatîn</em> in the
<em>Risâla al-Jâmi‘a</em> is related to the
interpretation of those terms in other esoteric writings such as the
<em>Shajarat al-Yaqîn</em> (probably, of Qarmatian origin).</p>
