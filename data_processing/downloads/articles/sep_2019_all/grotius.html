<h1>Hugo Grotius</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Fri Dec 16, 2005; substantive revision Thu Jul 28, 2011</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>

Hugo Grotius (1583–1645) [Hugo, Huigh or Hugeianus de Groot] was a
towering figure in philosophy, political theory, law and associated
fields during the seventeenth century and for hundreds of years
afterwards. His work ranged over a wide array of topics, though he is
best known to philosophers today for his contributions to the natural
law theories of normativity which emerged in the later medieval and
early modern periods. This article will attempt to explain his views on
the law of nature and related issues while simultaneously providing
some broader assessment of his place in the history of ideas.</p>

<h2><a name="LifWor">1. Life and works</a></h2>

<h3>1.1 Life</h3>

<p>

Prison escapee, high-stakes politician, shipwreck survivor, Grotius
was a remarkable man who led a remarkable life. Born on April 10, 1583
in Delft, Holland—Easter Sunday, as his biographers invariably
note—his family was moderately prosperous, well-educated and
ambitious. From these nourishing if not particularly distinguished
origins, Grotius soon proved himself exceptional. When he was eight,
he began writing skilful elegies in Latin; by eleven, he was a student
in the Faculty of Letters at the University of Leiden. In 1598, at the
tender age of fifteen, he accompanied the leading Dutch politician of
the day, Johan van Oldenbarnevelt, on an embassy to the royal court of
France. There King Henry IV, impressed by his extraordinary
learnedness, hailed him as “the miracle of Holland.” And three years
later, when the United Provinces decided to reinforce their autonomy
from Spain by retaining an official Latin historiographer to chronicle
their history, they chose Grotius over Dominicus Baudius, a full
professor of rhetoric at Leiden, for the position.</p>

<p>

In the small world of Dutch high society, Grotius had clearly been
identified as a young man going places. While in France, he had earned
(or possibly just bought) a law degree from the University of
Orléans. After returning to The Hague, he established a law
practice and within a short time, his clientele included
Oldenbarnevelt, the Dutch East India Company (V.O.C.) and Prince
Maurice of Nassau. Apparently he impressed Maurice, for when the
position of Attorney General of Holland, Zeeland and West Friesland
became available in 1607, the Prince chose him over two other older
and more experienced candidates. Grotius didn't particularly enjoy the
practice of law—in letters he voiced complaints familiar to
today's lawyers, bemoaning the tedium of the work and obstreperous
clients—so he closed his firm upon being made Attorney
General.  Perhaps capitalizing on his new position and the healthy
salary it paid, he soon married the redoubtable Maria van
Reigersbergen, with whom he would eventually have three daughters and
four sons.</p>

<p>

After several years as Attorney General, Grotius was appointed
Pensionary (roughly equivalent to Governor of an American state) of
Rotterdam in 1613. That same year, he was called to put theory into
practice when a dispute arose between the English and the Dutch over
the freedom of the seas. The details are interesting but complicated:
in essence, on the basis of the claim that two Dutch vessels were
trespassing on seas owned by England near Greenland, a small British
fleet seized the contents of the Dutch ships. Grotius led a delegation
to England in protest of the English actions. While history may have
favoured Grotius—his view that the seas are open to all would
eventually come to be international law—real politick made
victory impossible for him at the time. The English were more powerful
than the Dutch, and they neither returned the cargo nor conceded the
legal point.</p>

<p>

1613 may have carried some excitement but the end of the decade was
one of the true zeniths (or nadirs, depending on one's perspective) of
Grotius' life. A dispute between orthodox Calvinists and reformers
over arcane theological matters which no longer seem important to us
quickly assumed enormous political significance. Grotius,
Oldenbarnevelt and other supporters of religious tolerance were
aligned on the side with the reformers or “Remonstrants”; Maurice, the
Calvinist establishment and other so-called “Contra-Remonstrants” were
on the other. On August 29, 1618, Maurice and his allies staged a
coup, overthrowing the States General (of which Grotius was a member
by virtue of his position as Pensionary of Rotterdam) and imprisoning
him along with Oldenbarnevelt and Rombout Hoogerbeets, the Pensionary
of Leiden. Consolidating his grip on power, Maurice soon moved to
eliminate the Remonstrants and their supporters in government; as part
of this putsch, Oldenbarnevelt was executed and Grotius and
Hoogerbeets were sentenced to life imprisonment. It would be overly
dramatic to say Grotius languished there: he was allowed to correspond
with outsiders; moreover, he had books and writing materials, and
indeed he composed much important work during this time. But the cold
and damp cell was far from pleasant and there was the looming danger
that the authorities would revisit his case and impose an even harsher
punishment. So in March 1621, Grotius and his wife Maria decided
enough was enough. Placing himself in a large trunk that Maria had
shipped to him, Grotius escaped prison by having the trunk carried out
on the pretence that it contained a number of books. He fled to
Antwerp and thence to Paris, where his family eventually joined
him.</p>

<p>

Now began a more stable and productive period. The French authorities
welcomed Grotius by awarding him an annual pension which, while not
always paid, at least gave the promise of security. He began
composition of <em>De iure belli ac pacis (On the law of war and
peace</em>), which was published by a Parisian press in 1625. It
quickly made Grotius famous: for example, in a letter to Grotius,
Vossius says that Descartes told him that he had recently met the
Dutchman (in reply, Grotius wrote that he didn't remember meeting
Descartes, an indication of their relative stature at the time).
Perhaps encouraged by the reception of his work, Grotius tried
returning to the Netherlands in 1631. Initially, he may have had
reason to be optimistic: after practicing law for a little while in
Amsterdam, he was offered the Governor Generalship of the V.O.C. in
Asia. Soon enough, however, the authorities moved against him, placing
a large price on his head and forcing him in April 1632 to flee his
home country. Grotius would never set foot there again.</p>

<p>

This time, he went to Hamburg, Germany. Nearby Sweden (one of the
superpowers of the day) had numerous connections to the city, which
made it quite natural for Swedish authorities to notice the presence
and availability for hire of such a luminary. Moving to take advantage
of the situation, they made him their Ambassador to France in
1634. Grotius began his diplomatic duties in Paris the following year.
It is hard to gauge his success as ambassador: while he did help to
negotiate a treaty which led to the end of the Thirty Years' War, he
could also be outmanoeuvred in the diplomatic game—at one
point, his bumbling forced the Swedish Chancellor Axel Oxenstierna to
come to Paris and sort things out. Still, such stories
notwithstanding, it is true that he lasted ten years in one of the
highest and most demanding diplomatic postings of his day (Sweden
being of the superpowers of mid-seventeenth century Europe).</p>

<p>

During this time, Grotius returned to the theological issues which had
earlier caused him such grief. The project of Christian 
unity—harmonizing both the various Protestant factions and the Protestants
with the Catholics—became increasingly important to him. Both
intellectually and practically, it was a task which suited him and his
place in life: intellectually, because Christian unity raised many
conceptual puzzles which challenged his mind; practically, because as
ambassador for one of the great European powers, he could use his
position to press the cause. Of course, the cause was doomed to
failure—certainly, it was well beyond Grotius' abilities. Yet,
it did lead him to write some extremely interesting and influential
works, many of which were collected in his <em>Opera Omnia
Theologica</em>.</p>

<p>

After Queen Christina ascended to the throne in 1644, she
systematically began to undermine her rival Oxenstierna and—as
part of this infighting—recalled Grotius from his
ambassadorship. She didn't fire him; instead, she instructed him to
come to Stockholm and assume a different position. At first, Grotius
didn't want to go, but bowing to the force of royal prerogative (not
to mention economic necessity), he set sail for Stockholm in March
1645.  It was a fateful decision: travelling conditions on the Baltic
in late winters can be harsh; his ship wrecked and Grotius barely
escaped with his life. After spending a few months in Sweden, he
decided to return to Germany and so undertook another voyage. Again,
conditions were poor; it took eight long days to cross the relatively
narrow stretch of water. This time, it was too much: weakened by
recent events, Grotius died on August 28, 1645, in Rostock,
Germany. While they are probably apocryphal, his supposed last words—“By attempting many things, I have accomplished nothing”—do evoke the span of his life's work and his personal
assessment of the results.</p>

<h3>1.2 Works</h3>

<p>

Given that he led such an active public life while also raising a
large family, the sheer quantity of Grotius' works is nothing short of
astonishing. Typical, for him, was the time of his embassy to France.
The same year as the embassy, he published <em>Pontifex Romanus</em>,
a collection of six essays on recent political events. While working
on this, he produced what are in essence critical editions of two
works: the <em>Phaenomena</em>, an astrononomical work of the
3<sup>rd</sup> century BCE by Aratus of Soli, and Martianus Capella's
handbook of the seven liberal arts. He also began research on a
history of the Netherlands, research would which much later would
result in the <em>Annales et Historiae de Rebus Belgicis</em>. And he
did all this while still in his late teens. Over the full course of
his life, Grotius would write or edit some five-dozen book-length
works and innumerable smaller pieces.</p>

<p>

To philosophers and the philosophically-minded, two of these stand
out: <em>De iure praedae commentarius</em> (<em>Commentary on the law
of prize and booty</em>, henceforth referred to as “<em>DIP</em>”) and
<em>De iure belli ac pacis</em> (<em>“DIB</em>”). The former was
almost lost. Placed in a trunk sometime during or after his life, the
sole manuscript copy was uncovered when some of his descendents sold a
collection of his papers in 1864 (for an account of these events, see
Knight (1925), Chap. 5). It was apparently commissioned by the V.O.C.
around 1603. In it, Grotius was to defend the capture of a large
Portuguese merchant ship by a V.O.C. fleet in the area around
modern-day Singapore. The key legal and conceptual question was
whether any private agent (such as the V.O.C.) could legitimately
employ force against another private agent which was impeding its
actions (see Tuck (1993), 170). But it also had an important
propagandistic objective, which was to defame the Portuguese (and
Spanish) while extolling the V.O.C. and Dutch (for more on the general
historical context of the <em>DIP</em>, see van Ittersum
(2002)). Modern philosophical readers will find the “Prolegomena” of
Chapter Two especially interesting, since that is where Grotius lays
out his views on the nature and bases of rights. While Grotius chose
not to publish this or most of the manuscript, he did see Chapter
Twelve into press. Given the title <em>Mare Liberum</em> (<em>On the
freedom of the seas</em>), it was both influential and controversial:
among others, the Englishman John Selden published a critical
reply.</p>

<p>

Whatever the merits of the <em>DIP</em>, it is on the <em>DIB</em>
that the bulk of Grotius' reputation rests. It consists of an
introduction and three books, totalling more than 900 pages in
translation. As with <em>DIP</em>, the introduction or “Prolegomena”
holds the greatest interest for philosophers, for it is here that
Grotius articulates and defends the philosophical foundations of the
<em>DIB</em>. While philosophers are naturally attracted to the
“Prolegomena,” the body of the <em>DIB</em> is also redolent with
themes of philosophical interest. Book One defines the concept of war,
argues for the legitimacy of war, and identifies who may legitimately
wage war. Book Two deals with the causes of war, the origins of
property, the transfer of rights and more, while Book Three is
dedicated primarily to the rightful conduct of belligerents in war.
After the initial publication in 1625, Grotius ushered several more
editions to press during his life, each time adding more references
without substantially changing the arguments. (A word of explanation
about citations to the <em>DIB</em>: they commonly take the form of
book, chapter, section and—where applicable—paragraph;
so, “I.1.10.1” means “Book One, Chapter One, Section Ten, Paragraph
One”.)</p>

<h2><a name="Met">2. Method</a></h2>

<p>

The first reaction of many readers is to the very style of Grotius'
prose. So before getting to his ideas and arguments, a few words
should be said his method, both in the <em>DIP</em> and the
<em>DIB</em> (differences between the two—and there are
differences—can be ignored for our purposes). There are
several distinct sets of issues. First and most obviously, there is
the question of what we should make of the voluminous references to
ancient, medieval and early modern works which can be found in the
margins of both books. Some have taken a rather dim view of them; in a
scornful passage of <em>Emile</em>, Rousseau wrote:</p>

<blockquote>

True political theory [<em>le droit politique</em>] is yet to appear,
and it is to be presumed that it never will. Grotius, the master of
all the savants in this subject, is but a child; and, what is worse, a
dishonest child [<em>enfant de mauvaise foi</em>]. When I hear Grotius
praised to the skies and Hobbes covered with execration I see how far
sensible men read or understand these two authors. The truth is that
their principles are exactly the same: they only differ in their
expression. They also differ in their method. Hobbes relies on
sophisms, and Grotius on the poets; all the rest is the same.
(Rousseau (1915), vol. II, 147)</blockquote>

<p>

It would be absurd to deny that Grotius does rely “on the poets”—after all, he said in the “Prolegomena” to the <em>DIB</em>
that “the testimony of philosophers, historians, poets, finally also
of orators” will be used to “prove the existence of this law of
nature” (§40). Arguments from authority carried great weight
for him: the more <em>illuminati</em> one could cite, the better for
one's argument. Philosophers today are not going to be impressed by
such arguments, though they can be instructive to historians of
philosophy.  By studying Grotius' use of texts, one can learn how they
were interpreted in the early modern period—and this can
unlock one of the many barriers to understanding that time.</p>

<p>

But is there more to his citations of these texts than just an overly
respectful attitude toward authority? Most scholars think there is,
though they are divided on what it might be. One possibility is that
they reflect Grotius' commitment to the idea of <em>philosophia
perennis</em>. Like Leibniz a few decades later, Grotius thought there
were elements of truth in virtually all great thinkers. He writes, “I
quote them as witnesses whose conspiring testimony, proceeding from
innumerable different times and places, must be referred to some
universal cause” (<em>DIB</em>, Prol. §40). His job as heir to
ideas of the great dead is to combine or synthesize them into a single
unified theory. And doing that requires him to draw on them as
frequently as possible.</p>

<p>

Another suggestion sees Grotius as deeply concerned to refute
scepticism about international law. Grotius was upset when the
powerful French Cardinal Richelieu told him, “the weakest are always
wrong in matters of state.” How is it that he can convince doubters
such as Richelieu of the existence and force of a set of norms
governing the conduct of governments both domestically and
internationally? The argument will never be easily won but the burden
may be lightened by sharing the load. If Grotius can show that so many
people throughout history have accepted what the sceptic denies, then
perhaps the force of numbers may change the sceptic's mind.</p>

<p>

Quite apart from the questions posed by the marginalia, an entirely
different aspect of Grotius' method concerns his refusal to divide
ethics, politics and law into separate subjects. These days,
compartmentalization is the norm; ordinarily, we study one of these
subjects while paying scant attention to the others. Now, it is true
that Grotius does often identify ways in which legal norms differ from
moral or political ones (see, e.g., the discussion of laws at the
beginning of <em>DIB</em> I.1). At the same time, he does not think
that law, politics and ethics are entirely distinct domains. If one
reads Grotius with the expectation that he will keep them apart, one
will likely be befuddled by the way he ignores distinctions which are
important to us. It may help to know that he does this because he is
interested in picking out the fundamental principles which lie at the
basis of <em>all</em> normativity, not just a portion thereof. He
cannot talk just about ethics, say, because his views on ethics are
informed by his views on politics and the law. A fundamental tenet of
his thought is that moral, political and legal norms are all based on
laws derived from or supplied by nature.</p>

<p>

The issues here are complex and much discussed. For more, see Dufour
(1980), Tanaka (1993), Vermeulen (1983) and Whewell (1853).</p>

<h2><a name="NatLaw">3. Natural Law</a></h2>

<p>

Natural law is multiply ambiguous. It can be descriptive, in that it
is sometimes supposed to describe a certain set of facts which obtain
because of some natural features. At the same time, it can also be
prescriptive, in that it is sometimes supposed to prescribe certain
forms of behaviour as acceptable and proscribe others as unacceptable.
On another level, its scope or range of application is unfixed. Some
natural law theories pertain to political entities (typically states
and relations among states); others, to civil laws; yet others, to
moral agents. On still another level, the ambiguities can be seen as
stemming from the very notions of “natural” and “law.” “Natural” can
refer to human nature, or to the nature of the universe in general, or
both. One's sense of the validity and force of a natural law theory
will vary enormously depending on which reference is employed. “Law”
was similarly contested. One extreme interpreted it literally, so that
a natural law is a rule implemented by some agent (typically God)
which compels obedience on pain of some penalty. The other extreme
took “law” completely metaphorically, picking out some standard or
norm perceivable in natural phenomena which governs behaviour through
entirely impersonal means.</p>

<p>

Such variation should not be surprising, for the natural law tradition
was long and robust. Though there were ties to the ancient world, it
began in earnest with Aquinas, since he was the first to formulate a
group of ideas systematic enough to be called a theory. The tradition
continued through the middle ages and into the early modern era before
(allegedly) meeting its demise in Kant. Given that natural law was
<em>the</em> dominant paradigm in ethics, politics and law for
hundreds of years—much longer than the period from Kant to us—it is entirely predictable that theorists would have pushed
that paradigm in so many directions. It may be that there is some
essence shared by all natural law theories; for example, one recent
commentator has suggested that the “stable core in [the natural law
tradition] is the idea that morals is primarily a matter of norms or
prescriptions and only derivatively about virtues and values”
(Haakonssen (1992), 884). But those who study natural law in the
period of its flourishing will be impressed by the almost unlimited
possibilities of interpretation.</p>

<p>

Though this is not an article on the natural law, these points are
necessary preliminaries for considering Grotius' natural law views. If
Grotius is at all known to philosophers today, it is for being “the
father of natural law” (as put by, e.g., Vreeland (1917)). At this juncture, we need not assess the validity of this claim (for more on Grotius' originality, see Section 6 below).  Instead, we ought to understand Grotius' actual views on the laws of nature.  To understand his views, four issues need to be examined: first, the source of the laws; second, their nature or content; third, their force or obligatory status; finally, their scope.</p>

<p>

Why are there natural laws? Do they exist in virtue of the nature of
things or for some other reason? These are the questions lurking
behind the issue of source. Grotius changed his mind on how they
should be answered. In the <em>DIP</em> he declares that “What God has
shown to be His Will, that is law. This axiom points directly to the
cause of law, and is rightly laid down as the primary principle”
(Chap. II).  Here Grotius announces a thesis about the relation
between normativity and the divine being which is commonly known as
“voluntarist”: by an act of volition, God determines the full and
exact content of all normative categories—justice, goodness
and so forth.  Voluntarism was a well-established tradition of natural
law theories; the <em>DIP</em> belongs firmly in that tradition. In
later works, however, Grotius departs from it. For example, in the
<em>De summa potestatum</em>, he declares that normativity of any kind
“arises from the nature of the action itself, so that it is right
<em>per se</em> to worship God and it is right <em>per se</em> not to
lie” (<em>Opera Omnia Theologica</em>, vol. III, p. 187). A much more
famous expression of non-voluntarism appears in the “Prolegomena” to
the <em>DIB</em>. In the first few sections of the “Prolegomena,”
Grotius lays the groundwork for his natural law theory. Then, in
section eleven, he writes that “What we have been saying would have a
degree of validity even if we should concede [<em>etiamsi
daremus</em>] that which cannot be conceded without the utmost
wickedness, that there is no God, or that the affairs of men are of no
concern to him.” Instead of emerging from or being otherwise dependent
on God, the fundamental principles of ethics, politics and law obtain
in virtue of nature. As he says, “the mother of right—that is,
of natural law—is human nature” (Prol. §16). Somewhat later, he clarifies why it is that human nature produces the natural law: “The law of nature is a dictate of right reason, which points out
that an act, according as it is or is not in conformity with rational
nature, has in it a quality of moral baseness or moral necessity; and
that, in consequence, such an act is either forbidden or enjoined”
(I.1.10.1). If an action agrees with the rational and social aspects
of human nature, it is permissible; if it doesn't, it is impermissible
(cf. I.1.12.1). That is to say, the source of the natural law is the
(in)compatibility of actions with our essences as rational and social
beings.  For discussion of the <em>etiamsi daremus</em> passage, see St. Leger (1962) and Todescan (2003).</p>

<p>

Suppose we have established where the laws come from. This will reveal
nothing about the second of our four issues: viz., the content of the
laws or what they actually say. Grotius' views on how we should learn
about this were quite consistent: throughout his corpus, he continued
to maintain that (as he put it in the <em>DIP</em>), “The Will of God
is revealed, not only through oracles and portents, but above all in
the very design of the Creator; for it is from this last source that
the law of nature is derived” (Chap. II). As he put it in the
<em>DIB</em>, the law of nature “proceeds from the essential traits
implanted in man” (Prol. §12). Where some other natural law
theories solved the problem of knowledge through recourse to the
supernatural, Grotius did not. For him, a study of nature itself—and more specifically, a study of human nature—can
suffice to teach us the essentials of ethics, politics and law.</p>

<p>

And what, exactly, does such a study reveal about those fundamental
normative principles? The reasoning in both the <em>DIP</em> and
<em>DIB</em> may be reconstructed as follows. Human nature is
constituted by two essential properties: the desire for
self-preservation and the need for society (see <em>DIP</em>, Chap. 2,
and <em>DIB</em>, Prol. §§6–7). These two properties
temper and inform each other: the desire for self-preservation is
limited by the social impulse, so that humans do not naturally seek to
maintain and enhance their being at all costs; conversely, the need
for the company of other humans is limited by the self-preservation
drive, for individuals must naturally strive to secure the means for
their well-being. Moreover, the self-preservation drive and the
sociability impulse are both emotive and cognitive; they are both
non-rational and rational, having the force of unreflective instinct
as well as well-thought-out plans. Because we are essentially both
social and self-preserving beings, it follows that two things are
imperative for our successful existence. We ought to abstain from what
belongs to other persons, and we ought to engage in the reasonable
pursuit of what genuinely serves our interest. Accordingly, Grotius
makes these the first two elements of natural law in the <em>DIB</em>
(see Prol.  §§8, 10); they form the core of the first
four “laws” in the <em>DIP</em> (see Chap. II). While these principles
enjoy lexical priority in the hierarchy of natural norms, they do not
exhaust the list. A study of nature also teaches us that “Evil deeds
must be corrected” and “Good deeds must be recompensed” (Laws V-VI of
the <em>DIP</em>). In fact, Grotius derives a list of some 22
fundamental natural tenets in the <em>DIP</em> and a similarly large
group (though not numbered in the same way) in the <em>DIB</em>. Any
explanation of Grotius' natural law theory should begin by citing
these first-order tenets or principles, for they are what constitute
its substance.</p>

<p>

But why are they operative on us? Why do they enjoin or prohibit us
from performing certain specific actions? Here we come to our third
issue, concerning the laws' force or obligatory status. Traditionally,
natural law theorists tended to invoke God for their solution to this
very deep mystery. Aquinas, for example, argued that obligation is the
result of an action of will by a superior on an inferior (see, e.g.,
<em>Summa Theologica</em> II.ii.q104). We are obliged to follow civil
laws because our political superiors have forced us to do so through
actions of their more powerful wills. And we are obliged to follow
natural laws because God has forced us to do so through his infinitely
more powerful will. Grotius was tempted by this view; he writes in
<em>DIB</em> that morally necessary acts must be “understood as
necessarily commanded or forbidden by God” (I.1.10.2).</p>

<p>

As any parent knows, however, “because I said so” is not the
most compelling reason for action.  That is true even when the person speaking is God. Hence thinkers have long sought to articulate other grounds for
obligation. In Grotius' time, for example, Suarez wrote, “to break the
natural law without sinning involves an inconsistency… and
therefore the existence of an obligation which is imposed by the
natural law but which is not a matter of conscience also involves an
inconsistency” (<em>De legibus</em>, II.IX.6). Here we find a very
different account of the basis of obligation: we are obliged to
perform or avoid certain actions which are incompatible with our
consciences, because we will be guilty of inconsistency if we
don't. To put it in slightly different terms, we are obliged to
perform or avoid certain actions which are compatible or incompatible
with our natures as rational beings, because we will be less than
human if we don't.  Grotius adopts this idea for himself, modifying it
in keeping with his rich conception of human nature: for him, natural
law obliges us to perform actions which conduce to our rationality,
sociability and need for self-preservation. This thought underlies
several of his specific laws of nature—such as, for instance,
the law that evil deeds must be corrected. Grotius places this
obligation under the heading of compensatory justice (<em>DIP</em>,
Chap. Two). The “task of compensatory justice” is “restitution”: using
the example of theft, Grotius explains that “such justice requires
that the thing taken shall be returned” (ibid.). Evil deeds have
disturbed the moral and legal equilibrium of society; they have
unjustly benefited some while unjustly harming others. Since it is
imperative to maintain healthy social relations, it is imperative that
evil deeds be punished.</p>

<p>

The problem of explaining why we should obey the laws of nature—or indeed, why we should obey any set of norms—is one
of the most enduring in philosophy; it would be rash to suppose that a
solution can be found in Grotius. One inadequacy of his account is
inspired by Richelieu: while Grotius tries to separate and equalize
our rational, social and self-interested motives for action, one may
question whether they are in fact distinct and equal. If it can be
shown that one is more fundamental than the others—that, say,
self-interest is our first and most basic reason for action—then our reason for obeying the laws of nature and being moral will be
very different from what Grotius argued. (For additional discussion,
see Korsgaard (1996), 7, 21–22 and 28–30.)</p>

<p>

Moving on, we come to the last of our four issues—i.e.,
scope. In Grotius' day, this issue was made urgent by European
encounters with indigenous peoples in the Americas and elsewhere (for discussion, see Tierney (1997), Chapter XI). Some
theorists tried to place epistemic or doxastic restrictions on the
scope of the laws, arguing that they enjoined and protected only those
who held certain beliefs. Since the beliefs which determined the
applicability of the laws were usually religious in nature, it was
commonly argued that natural laws were pertinent only to Christians
and did not cover non-Christians. Given that natural laws form the
basis for morality, then since they do not cover non-Christians, it
follows that Christians were under no obligations to treat
non-Christians morally. Like many others, Grotius strongly disagreed
with such arguments. For him, natural laws apply to all rational and
social beings as such. It doesn't matter what they think or believe;
if they are rational and social, they are bound by the law of nature
(see, e.g., <em>DIB</em> II.20.44).</p>

<h2><a name="Pol">4. Political Philosophy</a></h2>

<p>

As the previous section stressed, Grotius' natural law theory was
about much more than politics; it offered an account of normativity of
all kinds. At the same time as he was concerned to explicate
normativity generally speaking, the evidence unambiguously suggests
that he was especially interested in political issues. After all, he
did lead a very political life and his two greatest works are
eminently political. In this section, a few of his political ideas are
discussed.</p>

<p>

Let's start with one closely connected to the problem of obligation.
Just now, it was said that the ground of obligation lay in our natures
as rational, social, self-preserving beings. This is correct but it
needs amplification. Grotius did not conceive of our essences as
static; instead, they are dynamic, expressive of our abilities and
activities. This is emphatically reflected in his conception of rights
(<em>ius</em>, or <em>iura</em> in the plural). He distinguishes
between several meanings of <em>iura</em>, the most important of which
conceives of a <em>ius</em> as “a moral quality of a person, making it
possible to have or to do something correctly” (<em>DIB</em> I.1.4).
For Grotius, a <em>ius</em> or right is a capacity or power possessed
by the agent; it is a “faculty” or an “aptitude” of the person
(ibid.).  To have a <em>ius</em> is to have the ability to engage in
certain specified actions without moral or legal sanction. So, for
example, when he endows humans with the right to self-preservation, he
grants us the power to pursue our own interests without needing the
permission or assistance of the state or any other authority. Because
rights are centred on the individual subject, one will often read that
Grotius propounded a theory of “subjective right” (see, e.g.,
Kingsbury and Roberts (1990), 31 and references there).</p>

<p>

The import of Grotius' theory of rights can be
clarified contrasting it with the dominant medieval conception of
<em>iura</em>. This conception stems primarily from Aquinas, who held
that “the word <em>ius</em> was first of all used to denote the just
thing itself” (<em>ST</em> II.ii.q57.art1). In its original usage,
<em>ius</em> was applied to things—actions, entities,
situations—and not persons. As Aquinas and his followers
conceived of it, things earn the appellation “right” when they align
fully with the natural law. For two reasons, then, the medieval
conception of rights can be thought of as “objective”: first, because
the things which are right are <em>objects</em> (and not subjects);
second, because things become worthy of the label “right” when they
satisfy an <em>objective</em>, agent-independent set of necessity and
sufficient conditions, viz., those conditions required for conformity
to the natural law. Now, it is true that this medieval view had begun
to be displaced by Grotius' time; for example, Suarez says that a
“strict acceptation of <em>ius</em>” bestows it “upon a certain moral
power which every man has, either over his own property or with
respect to that which is due to him” (<em>De legibus</em>
I.2.5). However, Grotius is usually given the credit for shifting the
paradigm fundamentally (see, e.g., Haakonssen (1985), 240;  for an opposing view, see Irwin (2008), 98). While it
took time for his paradigm to become hegemonic, it did eventually
prevail. When we say that so-and-so has the <em>right</em> to
such-and-such, we usually mean that he has the <em>means</em> or
<em>power</em> to do such-and-such: for example, the assertion that
someone has the right to freedom of thought means that he has the
ability to think as he pleases and no one or no thing can force him to
do otherwise. This was Grotius' view; though subsequently mediated by
many others, his contribution was essential.</p>

<p>

In addition to its intrinsic interest, Grotius' innovative conception
of rights had numerous important consequences. Two examples may serve
as illustrations. First, whereas medieval theorists tended to speak of
“the right,” Grotius and his successors stressed the powers and
entitlements of the person who has rights. By associating rights with
the powers of a person, moderns were able to distinguish sharply
between rights on the one hand versus duties on the other (cf. Finnis
(1980), 209). Second, because Grotius made rights into powers or
faculties which humans <em>possessed</em>, he played a crucial part in
the commoditization of rights. Once rights became possessions, they
can be traded away just like all other possessions. The means of
transfer might not be identical to other exchanges of goods but the
essential idea of giving away something in one's possession for
something which isn't is there. As commentators have argued, the
commoditization of rights was one of the most important political
developments of the seventeenth century (for more, see especially
Macpherson (1962), 3f).</p>

<p>

Grotius exploited the latter idea in some of the more notorious parts
of his corpus. Take the following:</p>

<blockquote>

At this point first of all the opinion of those must be rejected who
hold that everywhere and without exception sovereignty resides in the
people, so that it is permissible for the people to restrain and punish
kings whenever they make a bad use of their power… We refute it
by means of the following arguments.

<p>

To every man it is permitted to enslave himself to any one he
pleases for private ownership, as is evident both from the Hebraic and
from the Roman Law. Why, then, would it there not be as lawful for a
People who are at their own disposal to deliver up themselves to some
one person, or to several persons, and transfer the right of governing
them upon him or them, retaining no vestige of that right for
themselves? (<em>DIB</em> I.3.8.1).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>

Grotius extends the case elsewhere, insisting that a people may give
their rights to a ruler, receiving a peaceful and stable society in
return (<em>DIB</em> I.4.2.1). But what are the limits placed on the
ruler who has taken possession of these rights? To some readers,
Grotius' willingness to allow agents to transfer their rights leaves
him open to charges of befriending despots. Provided that the initial
transfer of rights was legitimate, then once the ruler is in
possession of rights, those living under him or her have no right to
complain that certain forms of behaviour are unjust, for they have no
relevant rights at all. As Rousseau put it, Grotius “spares no pains
to rob the people of all their rights and invest kings with them”
(<em>Social Contract</em>, Book II, Chapter Two). To be sure, other
readers denied that Grotius' theory allowed agents a total transfer of
their rights; in particular, they contended that agents will always
retain their fundamental rights, such as the right of self-defence
(see Locke as interpreted by Tuck (1979), 172–3). Nevertheless,
whatever the theory itself actually implies, it remains that Grotius
himself seems to have believed that agents may surrender all liberties
in certain circumstances (for more, see <em>DIB</em> I.3.9–16).</p>

<p>

On a more positive note, Grotius' recognition of the transferability
of rights led him to a novel solution for one of the great problems of
political philosophy. What is the source of the state's right or
power?  Two traditional answers were (1) God—he set up the
state and it derives its authority from his sanction—and (2)
might—because the state is powerful, it has the authority to
govern, for might makes right. While Grotius flirts with both of
these, he finally settled for something else. He writes in the
<em>DIP</em>, “just as every right [<em>ius</em>] of the magistrate
comes to him from the state, so has the same right come to the state
from private individuals; and similarly, the power of the state is the
result of collective agreement” (Chap. Eight). Through innumerable,
separate, sequential decisions occurring over a protracted period of
time, individuals gradually agreed to form institutions for governing
society by imbuing them with some of power which they naturally
possess.  Eventually, these institutions gelled into a single coherent
entity which is the state. The state's power, then, is the product
neither of God nor of sheer force but instead of the wilful
transference of individuals' powers or rights to it. It may be a
mistake to interpret this idea as a nascent contractualism (see Tuck
(1993), 178–9) but likewise, it would be a mistake to deny the appeal
it would have to later contractualists such as Hobbes.</p>

<p>

All of this underscores Grotius' real but uneven contributions to the
doctrines of political liberalism which were being formulated in his
time. To the emerging theory of liberalism, he gave the idea that
individuals—both individual persons and individual groups of
persons—are bearers of rights. Also, he advanced the
compelling second-order account of the nature of those rights
described above. And he argued strongly in support of the attribution
of several specific first-order rights: for example, besides those
which have already been mentioned (such as self-defence), he
vigorously defended rights to property. However, as important as these
and other contributions to liberalism are, they must be balanced
against some of Grotius' other views. For instance, while it is true
that he thought individuals had rights, it is also true that he
thought there were a number of circumstances in which those rights
might be surrendered or even just overridden. So the rights that we
are supposed to have in Grotius' theory are not completely
assured. More sinister are his views on slavery, which is or at least
can be an entirely just institution. In the <em>DIP</em> he writes
that Aristotle is not “mistaken when he says that certain persons are
by nature slaves” (Chap. Six, Quest. V, Art.  One). While Grotius may
have repudiated this thought in the <em>DIB</em> (see III.7.1—but see also I.3.8.4), a simple argument continued to convince him
that slavery is compatible with a just society. If individuals may
sell their labour, Grotius reasons, then they should also be able to
sell their liberty. If they sell all of their liberty, then they are
of course slaves (I.3.8.1). A final weight to be placed on the balance
of Grotius' liberalism is his view on the status of rulers or
sovereigns. Because sovereignty is “that power… whose actions
are not subject to the legal control of another” (<em>DIB</em>
I.3.7.1), it follows as a necessary truth that those who hold
sovereignty are necessarily superior to all others.  Because they are
necessarily superior to the rest, Grotius considers rebarbative the
suggestion that sovereigns are answerable to their subjects. They may
wish to take the needs of her or his subjects into account (III.15)
but this is only “praiseworthy” and not imperative. In sum, then,
Grotius' contributions to political liberalism are comparable to
Hobbes, Spinoza, Locke and other seventeenth century luminaries. They
are genuine and significant while mixed with decidedly non-liberal
themes.</p>

<h2><a name="JusWarDoc">5. Just war doctrine</a></h2>

<p>

As the title of his <em>magnum opus</em> implies, the normative status
of war was of paramount concern to Grotius. The common distinction
between <em>ius ad bellum</em> and <em>ius in bello</em>—the
distinction between the rightful causes of war versus the rightful
conduct of war—is useful for understanding his views.
Regarding <em>ius ad bellum</em>, Grotius devotes <em>DIP</em> Chap.
Three and <em>DIB</em> I.2 to the question of whether it is ever
lawful to wage war. He argues that war is not only compatible with but
sometimes compelled by all three major kinds of law—the law of
nature, the law of nations or international law, and divine law. In
support of his answer, he adduces a number of conceptual, historical
and theological arguments. It would be tendentious to recount all of
his arguments, so take just one influential example of the first
sort:</p>

<blockquote>

He who wills the attainment of a given end, wills also the things
that are necessary to that end. God wills that we should protect
ourselves, retain our hold on the necessities of life, obtain that
which is our due, punish transgressors, and at the same time defend the
state… But these divine objectives sometimes constitute causes
for undertaking and carrying on war… Thus it is God's Will that
certain wars should be waged… Yet no one will deny that
whatsoever God will, is just. Therefore, some wars are just.
(<em>DIP</em> Chap. Three)</blockquote>

<p>

Far from believing that war is a condition outside the realm of
morality and law, Grotius took it to be an instrument of right (cf.
Dumbauld (1969), 73). As he wrote, “where judicial settlement fails,
war begins” (<em>DIB</em> II.1.2.1). Wars may be justly undertaken in
response either to “wrongs not yet committed, or to wrongs already
done” (ibid.). The list of wrongs which justify war is long, including
the inflicting of punishment (ibid.), self-defence (II.1.3), the
defence of chastity (II.1.7), etc. At the same time as he countenances
war, Grotius does set limits, some of them controversial. For example,
he argues that one doesn't have the right to defend oneself against an
assailant who is “useful to many” (II.1.9.1). This principle applies
to both individuals and states. So it follows that both individuals
and states may be obliged to acquiesce when attacked by someone
important to society—whether the society of a single nation or
the society of nations. Overall, it has been argued, what sets
Grotius' analysis of <em>ius ad bellum</em> apart from his
predecessors is “in his detailed and systematic elaboration of the
‘just causes' of war’” (Draper (1992), 194).</p>

<p>

Even supposing that a war has been undertaken rightly, it must also be
fought rightly for it to be just. And here we come to <em>ius in
bello</em>, a topic treated in <em>DIB</em> III. Grotius begins by
setting three rules governing the conduct of war (<em>DIB</em>
III.1.2–4), the first and most basic of which is that “In war things
which are necessary to attain the end in view are permissible”
(III.1.2). This obviously places wide limits on permissible conduct,
though it isn't as chilling as a first reading might suggest, for the
necessity requirement can be hard to meet. After advancing these
rules, Grotius considers the permissibility of a large number of
actions. The variety and amount of detail in this discussion is
fascinating. Typical is his analysis of ruses, deceit and
falsehood. Not only does he distinguish between those three ways of
conveying false impressions but also he distinguishes variations
within each of them (see III.1.6–20).  For example, if deceit is a
genus, then deceit in a negative action is one species (III.1.7) and
deceit in a positive action is another (III.1.8). And deceit in a
positive action can in turn be divided into two sub-species
(ibid.). The practical aims of <em>DIB</em> come through plainly here
and throughout Book III, where the priority seems to be clarifying
what exactly is and is not permissible in war by considering a large
number of actions which could belligerents could undertake and
determining their moral and legal standing. In general, Grotius held
that war is justifiable when, and only when, it serves right. Since
the conditions for service to right are numerous and non-obvious, he
must expend considerable effort identifying and explicating them (for
more, see Draper (1992), 191–207).</p>

<h2><a name="Inf">6. Originality and Influence</a></h2>

<p>

Coming at last to a broader assessment of Grotius' contributions to the history of ideas, we should start by distinguishing the question of his originality from that of his influence.  For our purposes, it will suffice to define originality as involving the formation of novel and important new concepts and/or methods while taking influence to consist in having major effects on others.  Let us handle originality first before coming to the easier question of Grotius' influence.</p>

<p>

Given that his work ranged across so many different fields—ethics, political theory, politics, religion—it is impossible to make a blanket statement that Grotius was or was not an original thinker.  Instead, the only responsible approach is to deal with his alleged contributions on a case-by-case basis.  Because it would be tedious to go through all the cases here, let us just take the two which are likely to be of greatest interest to philosophers:  ethics and political theory.</p>

<p>

There is scholarly dispute about the originality of Grotius' ethics.
Irwin (2008) has recently argued that because he merely extracts the
major elements of his theory of morality from other authors,
especially Aquinas and Suarez, “Grotius is no pioneer” in the history
of ethics (98).  By contrast, Schneewind (1993) thinks that Grotius
deserves credit for introducing agonism into ethics—the notion
that “conflict is ineradicable, and could not be removed, even in
principle, by the completest possible metaphysical knowledge of how
the world is constituted” (58).  Others who have weighed in include
Kilcullen (1995) and Darwall (forthcoming).  A clear and balanced
assessment is given by Tierney (1997), Chapter XIII.</p>

<p>

Turning to political theory, Sections 4–5 above identified
various concrete contributions of Grotius' to politics.  For many
scholars, however, Grotius is important not so much for his new ideas
as for his new way of thinking about political problems.  So,
Kingsbury and Roberts (1990) say, “the greatest direct contribution
of” the <em>DIB</em> is “the systematic reassembling of practice and
authorities on the traditional but fundamental subject of the <em>jus
belli</em>, organized for the first time around a body of principles
rooted in the law of nature” (3–4).</p>

<p>

There is a different gauge of Grotius' originality in the domain of
politics.  Through his writings, he gave rise to a theory of statehood
and the relations among states which has come to be known as, simply,
“Grotian” (the labels are used by Wight (1991), among others). This
theory is an account of the origins and identity conditions of states.
It conceives of states as existing not in a pre- or anti-social
condition but rather in an international society governed by a system
of norms.  Those norms hold apart from a positive action by a
legislature or legislator. At the same time as it insists on the
existence and relevance of these norms (which are, of course, the laws
of nature), it is also cognizant of the force of real
politick. Individual states will engage in the pursuit of their own
perceived interests, regardless of whether such pursuits place them in
conflict with the natural law. By doing all of this, the Grotian
school is supposed to negotiate a middle way between bare-knuckled
“Machiavellianism” and excessively idealistic “Kantianism” (for more,
see Wight together with the criticisms in Bull (1976)). Depending on
the fortunes of these schools at any particular moment in history,
Grotius' influence on international relations will be waxing or
waning.</p>

<p>

That mention of the influence brings us to the second broad topic of this concluding section.  Scholars may argue about whether and how Grotius was original but no one can doubt his influence. For example, the Swedish King Gustav Adolph is supposed to have kept a copy of the <em>DIB</em> under his pillow, next to the Bible. And King James I reacted strongly (and negatively) to Grotius' presentations during a diplomatic mission to England.</p>

<p>

So Grotius' influence was felt on some of the major actors of his day.  Naturally, though, his main impact was on other scholars.  Bayle called him “one of the greatest men in Europe.” Leibniz hailed “the incomparable Hugo Grotius.” Thomas Reid spoke of “the immortal Hugo Grotius,” Hutcheson drew on him extensively, and Hume approvingly cited an argument of his about the origins of property in the third appendix of his second <em>Enquiry</em>. To be sure, not all were so impressed. Rousseau's opinion has already been cited; the natural law theorist Samuel Pufendorf was also sceptical. And Voltaire found Grotius to be simply boring. Still, whether for good or for ill, Grotius was at the centre of letters for an enviably long time.  For a brief synopsis of Grotius' influence, focusing on the <em>DIB</em> , see Tuck (2005), pp. ix-xii.</p>
