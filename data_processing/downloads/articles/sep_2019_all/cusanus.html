<h1>Cusanus, Nicolaus [Nicolas of Cusa]</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Fri Jul 10, 2009; substantive revision Thu Jun 8, 2017</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>

Arguably the most important German thinker of fifteenth century,
Nicholas of Cusa (1401–1464) was also an ecclesiastical
reformer, administrator and cardinal. His life-long effort was to
reform and unite the universal and Roman Church, whether as canon law
expert at the Council of Basel and after, as legate to Constantinople
and later to German dioceses and houses of religion, as bishop in his
own diocese of Brixen, and as advisor in the papal curia. His active
life as a Church administrator and bishop found written expression in
several hundred Latin sermons and more theoretical background in his
writings on ecclesiology, ecumenism, mathematics, philosophy and
theology. Cusanus had an open and curious mind. He was learned and
steeped in the Neoplatonic tradition, well aware of both humanist and
scholastic learning, yet mostly self-taught in philosophy and
theology. Nicholas anticipated many later ideas in mathematics,
cosmology, astronomy and experimental science while constructing his
own original version of systematic Neoplatonism. A whole range of
earlier medieval writers, such as Thierry of Chartre, Ramon Llull and
Albert the Great, influenced Nicholas, but his important intellectual
roots are in Proclus and Dionysius the Areopagite. In spite of his
significance few later thinkers, apart from Giordano Bruno, understood
or were influenced by him until the late nineteenth century.</p>

<h2><a name="Bio">1. Biography</a></h2>

<p>

Nicholas of Cusa (Nikolaus Cryfftz or Krebs in German, then Nicolaus
Cusanus in Latin) was born in 1401 in Kues (now Bernkastel-Kues) on the
Moselle River between Koblenz and Trier. He was one of four
children in a bourgeois family. His father, Johan Cryfftz, was a
prosperous merchant who became one of the landed gentry in Trier. The
first record we have of Nicholas’ early education comes from his
study of the liberal arts at University of Heidelburg in 1416–17.
He then moved to the University of Padua where he studied canon law,
receiving his Doctor of Canon Law in 1423. In Padua he met the
physician and mathematician Paolo Toscanelli, the canonist Giuliano
Caesarini, and the humanists Guarino da Verona and Vittorino da
Feltre.</p>

<p>

In 1425 he entered the service of the archbishop of Trier and, as his
secretary, received income from several benefices. By 1426 he was
in Cologne where he may have lectured on canon law, studied philosophy
and theology, and began researches into original source material and
into the annals of German law. There he was able to prove that
the Donation of Constantine was an eighth-century forgery, and he found
manuscripts of Pliny’s <em>Natural History</em> and of
Plautus’ comedies. In Cologne he met Heimerich of Campo,
who introduced him to the writings of Ramon Llull, Albert the Great and
his commentary on Dionysius, and Proclus’ commentary on
Plato’s <em>Parmenides</em>. In 1428 and 1435 Nicholas was
offered positions teaching canon law at the University of Louvain, but
he turned them down to remain in church administration.</p>

<p>

Ordained a priest sometime during the 1430s, Nicholas first gained
wider notice for his work as a conciliarist at the Council of
Basel. There he wrote <em>De concordantia catholica</em> (1433),
arguing for the authority of the council over that of the pope and
stressing the notions of consent and representation. After the turmoil
at Basel split the council, Nicholas ultimately sided with the papal
party and left the conciliarists. In 1437 he was part of an embassy
sent to Constantinople to seek reconciliation of the Greek Church with
Rome. He reported that, during the voyage home, the insights of <em>De
docta ignorantia</em> (1440) came to him as a kind of divine
revelation. He continued as a papal legate to Germany from
1438–48. Named cardinal in 1446 by Eugenius IV, Cusanus was
elevated to that position in 1448 by Nicholas V and was sent to
Germany in 1451 as papal legate to reform the church.</p>

<p>

Nicholas’ most important philosophical works were written in the
twenty-four years between the appearance of <em>De docta
ignorantia</em> and his death. <em>De coniecturis</em>
(1442–43), <em>De dato patris luminum</em> (1445), <em>Apologia doctae
ignorantiae</em> (1449), <em>Idiota de sapientia, Idiota de mente,
Idiota de staticis experimentis</em> (all 1450) were among important
works of the decade from 1440–1450, as were many sermons and works on
mathematics. The final fourteen years of his life saw the
appearance of <em>De visione Dei</em> (1453), <em>De beryllo</em>
(1458), <em>De possest</em> (1460), <em>De li non aliud</em> (1461),
<em>De ludo globi</em> (1462–63), <em>De venatione sapientiae</em>
(1462), <em>Compendium</em> (1464) and <em>De apice theoriae</em>
(1464), more works on mathematics and many more sermons. Of particular
note are two works he wrote during these years that reached out to
other religions, especially Islam, <em>De Pace Fidei</em> (1453) and
<em>Cribatio Alchorani</em> (1461).</p>

<p>

In 1450 he was named bishop of Brixen in the Tirol. In 1452 he
began active administration in Brixen, but his attempts at reform led
to threats and clashes with Sigismund, the count of Tirol. Many
of his over two hundred sermons date from this time in Brixen, though
his reform efforts there and earlier in Germany mostly
failed. Nicholas finally retreated from the conflict in
Brixen to Rome, where he remained in the papal curia advising Pius
II. He died in 1464 in Todi on his way from Rome to Ancona.
His remains were buried in his titular Church, St Peter in Chains, at
Rome; his heart was sent to Kues and buried in the chapel of the
hospice for elderly men there that he endowed in his will. The
hospice survives and his remarkable library is housed there today.</p>

<h2><a name="NicTho">2. Nicholas’ Thought</a></h2>

<p>

Nicholas of Cusa may arguably be best understood as employing a
Christian Neoplatonic framework to construct his own synthesis of
inherited ideas. His thought witnesses to his own reading in a
variety of predecessors, while side-stepping the methods of the
medieval scholastic <em>summae</em> and their typical controversies and
arguments. Trained as a canon lawyer, Nicholas is mostly
self-taught in theology and philosophy; both his ideas and his language
may present some difficulties to contemporary readers. His
thought has to be viewed as a whole, for it works more by
correspondences and parallels between the domains he is interested in
expounding than in a linear fashion or by direct argument. What
is noteworthy are the flexible metaphors he uses as he moves across
what we designate today as ontology, philosophy of mind and
epistemology, and philosophical theology. His metaphors provide
some methodological clue to understanding how Nicholas proposes that we
should think God and creatures together. It is not just that God
exceeds our conceptual reach and grasp as well as our literal
language. The asymmetry between God and creatures also provides a
measure or norm for the appropriateness of any metaphor exploring or
attempting to explain their relationship.</p>

<h3><a name="MetOnt">2.1 Metaphysics and ontology</a></h3>

<p>

Nicholas of Cusa’s most complete set of proposals about what is
real occurs in his best-known work of 1440, <em>De docta
ignorantia</em>: <em>On Learned Ignorance</em>. Here Cusanus
addresses the four categorical realities traditionally found in
Christian thought: God, the natural universe, Christ and human
beings. <em>On Learned Ignorance</em> devotes its first book to
God, the second to the universe and a third to the God-man, Jesus
Christ. While its order mirrors the outflow from God and return
to him, this book does not distinguish philosophy and theology as
contemporary thinkers might, but unites them in a single overview of
Neoplatonic Christian reality.</p>

<p>

Nicholas begins with a single trope or symbol to lay out the parallels
between his teachings in the three books, that of the
“maximum.” God is the absolute Maximum; the universe is a
created image of God, the “contracted” or restricted
maximum. Christ unites the first two as the Maximum at once
absolute-and-contracted. “Contraction” is a metaphor for the finite
status of creatures, all of whom are limited images of God.
“Absolute” is used in its etymological sense of “free from”
(<em>ab-solutus</em>) to characterize God’s infinity. As absolute
maximum God is both unlimited and transcendent, unreachable by human
conceptions that measure the limited or contracted realm of more and
less. Once Cusanus conceptualizes human knowing as measuring, he
proposes that our knowledge also cannot measure exactly the essence of
any limited thing. A fortiori, when it comes to the unlimited God,
Nicholas asserts that “there is no proportion between finite and
infinite.” The infinite God remains beyond our ken. Human
efforts to understand the depth and implications of this assertion are
what will render our ignorance “learn-ed.”</p>

<p>

As so often in Christian thinking, this sort of apophatic preamble does
not prevent Cusanus from spending a whole book proposing how we might
comprehend the incomprehensible God
“incomprehensibly.” His first proposal is that God is
the “coincidence of opposites.” This turns out to be
a way both of recalling the negative theology to be found in Dionysius
the Areopagite and his other predecessors and at the same time of going
beyond it. Put in the language of the “maximum,” in
God both maximum and minimum coincide in the divine infinite Oneness,
for both take the mind beyond the measurable created domain of more and
less and end up meaning just the “superlative” or
transcendent. The implication, in other words, is that
God’s reality lies beyond any familiar domain where the principle
of contradiction holds sway.</p>

<p>

At the same time this “coincidence” underlines the divine
Oneness that comprehends all else in undifferentiated and unlimited
unity. It is not that creatures coincide with God or God with
creatures, but that in God all else coincides as nothing else than
God. As so often in negative and apophatic
“theology,” we are not only told what God is not but led to
reflect explicitly on what God must be, even if we have no conceptual
clarity about what we assert. The result is a kind of
second-order language about the ways in which we are forced to think
and talk about divinity.</p>

<p>

Nicholas then proposes some geometrical “exercises” to
provide his readers some object lessons designed to teach how we might
reach for the unlimited even while we are aware that we cannot grasp
what the infinite God may be. For instance, we are to imagine a
circle and a straight line or tangent that meets the circle. From
a certain perspective, as the diameter or circumference of the circle
increases, its circumference approaches the straight line and appears
less and less curved. If we then imagine and extrapolate
the circumference to the infinite, we can almost
“see” that both straight tangent and curved
circumference should coincide—a kind of “coincidence of
opposites” that is a figure of how we may think beyond limited
things toward the transcendent One. All this is mathematically
impossible, of course, but it demonstrates some metaphorical steps for
moving beyond the finite toward the infinite that might be transferred
from geometrical figures to created beings and their
Creator.</p>

<p>

In Book II of <em>On Learned Ignorance</em> Cusanus deals with the
created universe. The natural universe counts as the limited or
contracted maximum that is the image of the absolute Maximum.  Here
Nicholas introduces another central metaphor to capture the
relationship between God and creatures, the metaphor of enfolding and
unfolding (<em>complicatio/explicatio</em>). He expands the “folding”
metaphor he inherited from the twelfth-century school of Chartres.
While all beings are “enfolded” in the undifferentiated
oneness of their Divine Source, they are at the same time an
“unfolding” of God in time and space. “Insofar as He
is the unfolding,” Nicholas writes, “in all things He is
that which they are, just as in an image the reality itself
[<em>veritas</em>] is present” (II.3, Hopkins translation). In
Neoplatonic terms, one must think the unfolded universe we experience
and all that is real in it as at once enfolded in the Creator on whom
it depends.  God encompasses every thing created in a dialectical
outflow and return to God without any creatures ever being identified
with the God on whom they depend, that One who remains both present to
them yet ever absent and beyond. What the
“unfolding/enfolding” couple captures is the dynamic
relationship between divine Original and created image.</p>

<p>

The natural universe, then, is the whole or contracted maximum
collectively constituted by the many beings in space and
time. Nicholas proposes the quasi-Anaxagorean slogan that
“each thing is in each thing: <em>quodlibet in
quolibet</em>” to emphasize that the individual beings or parts
are no less “contracted” images of the whole created
universe. Just as God is present to each creature that stands as
a contracted image of the divine, so the universe as a macrocosm is
present to each creature or constitutive part as microcosm. In that
way, each natural thing is an image of the collective whole. But
since this collectivity is made up of interrelated parts, each thing is
also the totality of its connections with everything else.
“Each thing is in each thing” because each is an image
reflecting the oneness of the whole and thus of all other individuals
that are the interrelated parts of that whole.</p>

<p>

Nicholas also recognizes in Book Two that the natural universe is
characterized by change or motion; it is not static in time and
space. But finite change and motion, ontologically speaking, are also
matters of more and less and have no fixed maximum or minimum. This
“ontological relativity” leads Cusanus to some remarkable
conclusions about the earth and the physical universe, based not on
empirical observation but on metaphysical grounds. The earth is not
fixed in place at some given point because nothing is utterly at rest;
nor can it be the exact physical center of the natural universe, even
if it seems nearer the center than “the fixed stars.”
Because the universe is in motion without fixed center or boundaries,
none of the spheres of the Aristotelian and Ptolemaic world picture
are exactly spherical. None of them has an exact center, and the
“outermost sphere” is not a boundary. The universe is
therefore “infinite,” in the sense of physically unbounded. Cusanus
thus shifts the typical medieval picture of the created universe
toward later views, but on ontological grounds.</p>

<p>

For Nicholas, the exact center and circumference of the created
universe are to be found only in God. What <em>we</em> take to be
center and outer limits depends on our viewpoint. If we change
perspectives, say to that from another planet (which might indeed be
inhabited) and take it to be center, then earth might be zenith. In
this way we come to realize that what is taken as fixed or central can
be altered to be moving and at the zenith, depending on the location of
the standpoint we pick in the unbounded universe. The reason, Cusanus
writes, is that there is no exactness outside of God, and only
“God, who is everywhere and nowhere, is its [the
universe’s] circumference and center”
(II.12, Hopkins translation).</p>

<p>

In this way learned ignorance recognizes that the natural universe
itself, as a contracted image of God, has a physical center that can be
anywhere and a circumference that is nowhere. That is why
Nicholas characterized the natural universe as a contracted maximum or
“privative” infinite while God remains the
“negative” infinite or absolute maximum. This means
that the universe merely lacks set physical bounds or limits, while God
has no ontological limits in being all that can possibly be. This
enables the “infinite” universe, as the whole constituted by all creatures, to be
an image of the divine oneness, but only in a contracted or attenuated
fashion.</p>

<p>

Nowhere is the Christian bearing of <em>On Learned Ignorance</em> more
obvious than in Book III, where Nicholas treats of the God-man, Jesus
Christ, as a third “maximum,” the Maximum at once
absolute-and-contracted. Once again, however, Cusanus uses the
orthodox teaching of early Christian councils such as Chalcedon more as
a background guide than as providing a straightforward Christology or
text for exposition. He returns to the contrast between absolute
God and contracted creatures that he used throughout Books I and II to
interpret and contrast the relation between infinite God and finite
creatures, even though there is no real proportion between
them.</p>

<p>

God was construed as the absolute maximum and divine infinite Oneness,
while Nicholas viewed the natural universe as a contracted maximum
whose unity-in-multiplicity and lack of physical limits
“reflected” God’s positively unlimited oneness.
Nicholas now entertains a third possibility, an anomalous joining of
absolute and contracted in the God-man. He reviews, borrowing
from Aristotle, the ordered universe of things belonging to natural
types (genera and species), then modifies it by extending to
individuals his idea of contraction or limitation. Individual
specimens are all that exist, but not only are they contracted images
of God’s oneness, but also contracted images of their types
insofar as each more or less fulfills the possibilities of its
nature.</p>

<p>

Cusanus thereupon asks a hypothetical question. What would happen
were a perfect specimen, an individual fulfillment of its type, to
actually exist? In his language of maximality, it would be
another maximum contracted to a unique individual of a given
kind. But what would make such a maximum individual possible in a
universe of more or less? Only its unique union with God, the
absolute divine Maximum that is the source of every contracted reality,
a union signaled in the traditional “hypostatic
union.” The whole of this maximal yet finite human nature
is created and united with the absolute God so that God remains
transcendent, yet inseparable from this one human creature. In
terms of enfolding and unfolding, this unique unfolding in a human
being is at the same time to reveal the God enfolding Jesus
Christ. Jesus is an image of God so utterly transparent as
to remain opaque except to the eyes of faith.</p>

<p>

Cusanus relies on the traditional microcosm/macrocosm trope to explain
why human nature would be the contracted nature best suited for union
with the divine Absolute. Human nature is the created nature
“more common to the totality of beings” (III.3, Hopkins
translation) because the intermediate status of human beings between
angels and all other bodily creatures provides common ties to the
whole range of created things. These ties are based on its capacities
as “what is highest of the lower and what is lowest of the
higher” natures (<em>ibid.</em>), so that it stands as
representative microcosm of the created macrocosm. The upshot is that
the historical Jesus Christ is human in such a way as to be
divine <em>and</em> divine in such a way as to be human, the Maximum
at once contracted <em>and</em> absolute, the human image who is
simultaneously the divine Original. Because the divine Word is one
with Jesus’ human nature, that nature is perfect of its kind, at the
same time contracted and maximal. Learned ignorance may thus press the
Cusan metaphors and ideas to the limit in dealing with Jesus Christ,
because the hypostatic oneness of the incarnate God will always elude
full human understanding.</p>

<p>

This third book realigns the order of Christian metaphysics so that the
God-man stands between God and the rest of creation, for it is through
the mediation of the Incarnate Word that creatures are made and
creatures return to their source. In Book I, Nicholas proposed
that there is no proportion or measure between the infinite and the
finite that will enable us to grasp the Infinite God or even
God’s contracted image in the natural universe. This is
what learned ignorance establishes for and contributes to human
wisdom. Yet the historic reality of Jesus Christ has a
theoretical role to play in interpreting Nicholas’ metaphysical
vision. The Cusan Christ stands as a more adequate norm and
measure for theory and practice. Jesus Christ is the historical human image of the
Absolute One beyond our ken and thus the paradigm that reveals our
creaturely connection with the infinite God. Christ is the disclosure in time of
what God is. In this way learned ignorance points to Jesus Christ
as the <em>medium</em>, the measure and mediator between finite and
infinite, and, as well, the concrete norm for what human beings may
become.</p>

<p>

The three books of <em>On Learned Ignorance</em> thus represent a
series of powerful proposals for reinterpreting Christian
reality. Throughout Nicholas uses metaphors such as the
coincidence of opposites, absolute/contracted and enfolding/unfolding
to relate God and creation. His proposals are established by
seeking out parallels between the infinite divine Original and limited
created images and by drawing out the implications of these
parallels. This book is neither medieval Aristotelian scholastic
disputation nor later Cartesian rationalism, but its own kind of
Christian Neoplatonic speculation that teases the philosophical
imagination as much as it may frustrate any contemporary philosophical
search for arguments or proofs. It is the coherence of the
parallels or correspondences within the overall view of reality that
gives Cusan metaphysics and Cusan metaphors their persuasive power.</p>

<h3><a name="MinHumKno">2.2 The Mind and Human Knowing</a></h3>

<p>

Nicholas of Cusa does not neatly divide ontology from epistemology any
more than he separates faith and reason, so it seems fitting that his
ideas on human knowing emphasize the metaphor of mind as measure
(<em>mens/mensura</em>) already mentioned in <em>On Learned
Ignorance</em>. This becomes the significant way that human
minds are images of the divine mind. In his 1450 dialogue,
<em>Idiota de mente: The Layman: About Mind</em>, the first
“definition” proposed for mind may fit the divine mind
better than the human: “Mind is the limit and measure of all
things” (c.1). Cusanus proceeds to employ the quasi-technical
metaphor from <em>On Learned Ignorance</em>,
“enfolding/unfolding—<em>complicatio/explicatio</em>,”
to spell out just how our minds are images of God’s mind. These moves
already separate his ideas about human knowing from those of both his
scholastic predecessors and his post-Renaissance successors. He
writes:</p>

<blockquote>

You know how the divine Simplicity enfolds all things. Mind is the
image of this enfolding Simplicity. If, then, you called this divine
Simplicity infinite Mind, it will be the exemplar of our mind. If you
called the divine mind the totality of the truth of things, you will
call our mind the totality of the assimilation of things, so that it
may be a totality of ideas. In the divine Mind conception is the
production of things; in our mind conception is the knowledge of
things. If the divine Mind is absolute Being, then its conception is
the creation of beings; and conception in the human mind is the
assimilation of beings. (c.3)</blockquote>

<p>

This extension of the metaphor used in metaphysics to capture how
things simultaneously proceed from and return to God spells out where
human knowledge stands. God’s utterly simple divine mind enfolds the
true natures of all the actual things “unfolded” from it
in the created universe. The human mind is a parallel though limited
oneness that can enfold or encompass the concepts of all it knows
while unfolding them in a conceptual universe. While divine knowing
amounts to the creating of beings, human knowing amounts to the
creating of concepts that are “the assimilation of
beings.” The <em>idiota</em>/layman continues:</p>

<blockquote>

What suits the divine Mind as infinite Truth suits our mind as its
close image. If all things are in the divine Mind as in their exact
and proper Truth, all things are in our mind as in the image or
likeness of their proper Truth, that is, as known; for knowledge takes
place by likeness. All things are in God, but there as exemplars of
things.  All things are in our mind, but there as likenesses of
things. (c.3)</blockquote>

<p>

Two points here are essential. First, the conceptual content of
our knowledge is tied to the things God created as to their epistemic
likenesses. Nicholas thus stands in the tradition of Christian
realism. Second, the correspondences between divine mind and
human mind are severely modified by the fact that God’s purported
“concepts,” the “exemplars” of things, are
really nothing else in God but God’s undifferentiated
oneness. Oneness is primary in God’s knowledge,
“manyness” and “otherness” characterize our
conceptual domain. At best we humans are unitary sources of
our own knowledge and can give our ideas an overall oneness as a more
or less organized whole—a quite imperfect and faint mirroring of
God’s mind.</p>

<h4>2.2.1 Human Knowing is Conjecturing</h4>

<p>

Nicholas’ second major treatise (1442–43) that again explains his
vision of all there is in Neoplatonic Christian terms is entitled
<em>De coniecturis: On Conjectures</em>. Here he employs the
contrasting terms of <em>unitas/alteritas:</em> oneness/otherness, as
well as enfolding/unfolding to propose how we might understand from a
somewhat different viewpoint God, the universe and human beings.
Oneness is characteristic of God, while otherness stands for the
contingent plurality and variety of limited created things. In
this work Nicholas also introduces an explicit contrast between the
human capacities of <em>ratio</em> and <em>intellectus</em>.
<em>Ratio</em> or discursive reason is our capacity for thinking, using
concepts and judgments. <em>Intellectus</em>, by contrast, is a
direct intellectual vision. Nicholas parallels the way our plural
capacities for reason, imagination and sensation are founded in
“intellectus” as their single source to the simultaneous
outflow and return of the plurality of creatures to their single divine
Source. (<em>Ratio</em> and <em>intellectus</em> may recall in some
ways <em>dianoia</em> and <em>noesis</em> in Plato’s famous image
of the divided line.)</p>

<p>

The title, <em>On Conjectures</em>, is also intriguing because here
Cusanus makes explicit the limits of human knowing only hinted at in
<em>On Learned Ignorance</em> and in his later <em>The Layman: On
Mind</em>. As his Prologue puts it, “You have seen that the
exactness of truth cannot be attained. The consequence is that every
positive human assertion of the truth is a conjecture….  And
so the unattainable Oneness of truth is known in conjectural otherness
and the conjecture of otherness is itself known in the most simple
Oneness of truth.” Here the Neoplatonic dialectical principle
that insists we never think anything apart from the First is applied
even to human knowing. And such knowing is conjecturing.</p>

<p>

Cusan “conjecture” is not to be taken as what we normally
mean by the word in contemporary English where it covers the range from a
guess or hunch to a typical surmise to a provisional proposal to be
investigated or checked against usually empirical evidence.
Nicholas only considers “true” conjectures and believes
that our conceptual and judgmental knowledge is conjectural or
provisional because human reason never grasps the essence of anything
precisely as it is. This does not mean we cannot improve our
understanding or that we are simply making things up; rather, it
follows from the fact that our knowledge is a likeness of actual things and
real characteristics whose complete and “true” natures are only
known to their Creator. To quote the Prologue again, “while
our actual knowledge is incommensurable with the greatest knowledge,
something humanly unattainable, the unsure falling away of our weak
apprehension from the purity of truth makes our assertions of what is
true conjecture.”</p>

<p>

Nicholas composed <em>On Conjectures</em> as a letter treatise
addressed to Cardinal Cesarini. In chapter 11 of Book One he
proposes a scenario where the cardinal views the pope. This scenario leads
into his sole explicit description of <em>coniectura</em>. This
example of visual perception lets us recognize that we readily make
perceptual assertions about what we see or hear. And when we
reflect on these perceptual judgments we realize that we go beyond what
sensation alone delivers, for we use reason to interpret and make sense
of what we see. Reason and sense operate inseparably in our
perceptual experience. Reason discriminates, recognizes and may
explicitly formulate in language or thought what the experience comes
to, for instance, “There’s the pope.”</p>

<p>

Further reflection enables us to realize that what visual perception
delivers is limited, that is, partial and perspectival, because our
perceptual judgments reflect at least the constraints of the
perceiver’s bodiliness. These constraints include what
physical eyes can see, as well as one’s physical location and
viewpoint. Nicholas terms this a twofold “otherness”
that conditions and limits all sensory perception, limitations that we
are implicitly aware of in making perceptual judgments. So
Nicholas’ description of <em>coniectura</em> reflects the
“otherness” of our finite human estate. As he writes,
“A conjecture, then, is a positive assertion that participates in
truth as it is, but in otherness.” (Bk. I, c. 11) “Truth as
it is” refers, of course, to what is enfolded in the divine
Mind. What is unfolded in our concepts and assertions shares that
truth but only approximately, “in otherness.”</p>

<p>

Two other sources of “otherness” besides bodiliness
underlie the limitations on perceptual knowledge. One is the fact
that the objects of perception are themselves limited. The
cardinal’s sight of the pope has to be conjectural because
anything extended can show, as it were, but one side of itself to
another embodied viewer. A second “otherness” in perception
is due to the “otherness” of the mental and linguistic signs,
images, and symbols we use to think and talk about what we
perceive. These differ from both our mental capacities and what
we are looking at or listening to. This means the terms in which
perceptual judgments are expressed reflect the broader historical
background and interests of the perceiver as well as his or her
linguistic community.</p>

<p>

Given all these constraints we may wonder why Nicholas believes that
conjectural knowledge “participates in the truth as it
is.” Fundamentally, he is convinced that our status as
images of God’s mind and its oneness secures the cognitive
validity of what we know. Our knowledge is
“conjectural” in contrast to God’s knowledge, for
divine knowledge is complete and exact, both aperspectival and
omniperspectival, where knower and known coincide in infinite
Oneness. Our recognition of the limits in our own knowing and its
contents can keep us in touch, at least implicitly, with what is beyond
our ken in that ideal oneness of knower and known. The separation
of the human mind from the universe of knowable things is at the same
time a connection that results in conjectural knowledge. Just so,
conjectural knowledge is also an outcome of the separation and
connection of the human mind and the divine Mind, of image and
Original.</p>

<h4>2.2.2 Knowing as Assimilative Measuring</h4>

<p>

Recall once more the Cusan “definition” of mind already
alluded to in <em>The Layman: About Mind</em>: Mind is “that from
which comes the limit and measure of all things.” (c.1) If we set
this beside the comment quoted above that “conception in the
human mind is the assimilation of beings,” it is clear that
“assimilating” and “measuring” are the dominant
metaphors Nicholas uses to understand what we do as knowers. As
knowers we <em>measure</em> the things we know and we also are
<em>assimilated</em> or <em>likened</em> in some way to the objects of
knowledge. Along with the “horizontal” notion of our
concepts being images of things as well as of the mind’s own
oneness, <em>assimilatio</em> also has a “vertical”
dimension because in knowing we liken ourselves to our divine
Original.</p>

<p>

What is at issue is the connection and tension between the two
metaphors. Supposedly complementary, <em>assimilatio</em> and
<em>mensura</em> give no obvious answer to what provides the measure
for the content and validity of our knowledge—is it the things
known or our knowing minds? Nicholas never questioned that the
varied things we discover in the natural universe and fashion ourselves
in the social and cultural milieu exist independently of our minds (if
not of God’s). But the question here is whether our
knowledge is derived from what is independent of mind or is in whole or
part the result of the linguistic and conceptual measures we learn,
construct and employ in dealing with reality. If knowing is
creative or productive, solely a matter of our “measuring,”
it is easy to see how it is an image of God’s creating, but not
how it is a likening to extra-mental things. If things outside
measure and cause what we know, we can see why human knowledge is a
likening to things, but not how it is an image of God’s creative
mind. The two metaphors may well run counter to each other.</p>

<p>

Because Nicholas himself does not frame the question in this way, he
provides ample evidence for both answers. Some interpreters, such
as J. Hopkins (1996), see his use of medieval scholastic language for
the powers and activities of the mind as placing him mainly in the
medieval Aristotelian-Thomist tradition of critical realism, while
emphasizing anew the active character of knowing at all levels and thus
stressing that the mind is an active power. Those interpreters
whose proclivities are more Kantian, for instance, K. Flasch (1998) and
K. Kremer (1978, 2000), find in his texts gestures towards what would
in Kant become “the transcendental unity of apperception”
and “a priori” concepts of the understanding, not to
mention the stress on active judgment. The view of the present
author is that both of these interpretations may miss the Neoplatonic
context in which Nicholas discusses human knowledge and may
underestimate how important philosophical theology is to the Cusan
exposition of knowing.</p>

<p>

What are the clues we need to connect the metaphors of likening and
measuring in a complementary way? We must return to
Nicholas’ underlying conviction that our minds are images of
God’s mind and that this connection between them is constant and
thoroughgoing and thus should never be overlooked. Then we may
begin to understand that just as God’s creative measuring sets
the ontological limits of everything God creates, so our corresponding
measuring can at best be assimilative of the mind-independent things we
wish to know but do not create or place in reality, and yet be creative
in measuring and adjudicating the conceptual domain that results from
our knowing them.</p>

<p>

Both of these strands can seen to be operative in chapter 7 of <em>The
Layman: About Mind</em>. There Cusanus gives a somewhat more
detailed account of how he sees the mind’s cognitive functions
operating at the levels of sensation, imagination, reasoning and
intellectual vision or intuition. Here, as in his later work
entitled <em>Compendium</em>, we find that Nicholas inherited a
technical vocabulary and conceptual framework for human knowing that
embodies the medieval Aristotelian view that natural things are the
causes and measures of perceptual and conceptual human knowledge.
On that view, what we understand is to correspond to the intelligible
aspects of things that are mind-independent so that an identity in
intelligibility between mind and thing results—the mind is
measured by things. While Nicholas insists that the active, self-moving
mind directs and integrates the joint operation of our knowing
capacities, he also agrees that the mind has no innate ideas and that
mental life has to be awakened or stimulated by direct contact with the
perceptible world. He never questions that the perceptible world
(“the plurality of things”) exists and is independent of
our minds and our knowledge.</p>

<p>

It is the mind’s power to discriminate and make sense of what we
perceive, imagine or remember that Cusanus emphasizes. He writes,
speaking of imagination, “When sensible things are not present,
it [imagination] conforms itself to things in a confused way and
without discriminating one condition from another. But [when]
functioning with thinking imagination conforms itself to things while
discriminating one condition from another.” (<em>Idiota de
mente,</em> c.7)</p>

<p>

To help us understand the mind’s engagement in perceptual
“assimilation,” Nicholas turns to the work of sculptors and
craftsmen who use wax or clay to make an impression of some shape so
they can work from that likeness. When it is a matter of planning
something to do or make, it is easy to see our minds as active.
What about perceptual experiences where what we encounter is not up to
us? Nicholas returns to the wax, asking us to imagine wax
informed by mind in the way mind informs our capacities for sensing and
proposing that mind so imagined could “form the wax to every
shape presented to it.” (c.7) Nicholas is saying, in
effect, that “assimilation” in perception is indeed a
matter of reason’s active selecting and managing the deliverances
of sense and imagination that result from our encounters with
perceptible things. We are not mere passive recipients of colors,
sounds, textures and so on, but our minds differentiate and connect
perceptions and images in order to form concepts based on the
discriminations of reason.</p>

<p>

Nicholas avers that our knowledge of the natural and cultural world
embodied in and made systematic in the technical and mechanical and
liberal arts will remain “conjectural.” The reason is
that we are not dealing with the true reality of mind-independent
things whose true forms are one with God. We only encounter the
physically located temporal realities that are images of the really
real. As he remarks, “the notions that are attained through
the assimilations of reason are uncertain, because they are in accord
with the images of forms rather than with their true [forms].”
(<em>ibid.</em>, c.7) Only the concepts of mathematics are not
conjectural because we fashion or construct these ideas
ourselves. Consequently our conceptions of them can be precise
and certain, for as conceptual entities they escape the sorts of change
and bodily limits characteristic of the physical world.</p>

<h4>2.2.3 The Measure of Knowledge</h4>

<p>

But this sketch of our knowing powers as assimilative does not settle
what is normative for human knowing or what it means to take the mind
as a measure. Nicholas takes up this explicitly a bit later in
chapter 9 of <em>The Layman: About Mind</em>. When he is
questioned how the mind can be a measure adequate to such a variety of
things, the layman responds somewhat cryptically:</p>

<blockquote>

In the way an “absolute” face would make itself the
measure of all faces. For when you attend to the fact that mind is a
certain absolute measure that cannot be greater or smaller since it is
not restricted to quantity, and when you attend to the fact that this
measure is alive so that it measures by itself (as if a living compass
were to measure by itself), then you grasp how it makes itself into a
concept, measure, or exemplar so that it attains itself in everything.
(c.9)</blockquote>

<p>

Earlier the layman had described the human mind as a measure that
sets limits, conceptual and linguistic boundaries, to all that it
knows. What this presupposes are the requirements of any
measuring, quantitative or qualitative: (1) something measurable
to be ascertained, (2) a measure, that is a criterion or norm embodying
standard units, (3) the actual measuring that employs the norm, (4) the
results of the process, the measure taken.</p>

<p>

All these requirements can be found in the passage above. What we
want to know counts as the cognitively measurable (“such a variety of
things”). These knowables span items in the natural world
and the cultural sphere and their features, as well as concepts in the
realm of thought itself. The “concept, measure, or
exemplar” is the qualitative norm the mind employs and of which
it is the source. The mind does the actual measuring
(“measures by itself”) and “makes itself a
measure” or norm in judging and taking the measure of each item across the
range of things it knows. What results is the knowledge we obtain
when the mind becomes “equal to such a variety of things” and
“attains itself in everything.” Our knowledge
includes what we gain from everyday experience in society, from the
natural and human sciences, and from literature and the other arts.</p>

<p>

What does the reference to “absolute face” in the passage
quoted come to? “Absolute” is a term Cusanus usually
reserved for God as the infinite One free from every limitation and
restriction. Here it is transferred to our minds as images of
God. Our minds are not limited to quantitative measures and thus
can determine the conceptual measures or “units” that best
fit or are adequate to the different sorts of things we want to
know. We can answer questions of “what sort,” not
just of “how much.” Our concepts and judgments are
assimilative or actively likened to what we know because we construct
the conceptual measures appropriate, if never wholly adequate, to what
we are investigating or thinking about. As thus relatively
unrestricted or “absolute,” our minds can be conformed to
whatever is knowable in whatever way we can grasp it. Just as the
absolute divine “face” or mind is the infinite measure of
all the creaturely minds that are its images, so the human mind
measures the determinate conceptual realities that reflect its own finite
unity or oneness.</p>

<p>

Human concepts are measures insofar they involve choice and
construction, application and interpretation, whether quantitative or
qualitative. The use of a given group of concepts or a particular
scheme of ideas or interpretative framework is a matter of human
creating. If we recognize some mind-independent phenomena we want
to explore and come to know, whether in nature or in culture, we should
also recognize that it is up to us to construct and employ the
appropriate cognitive measures in order to “take the
measure” of the state of affairs in question. Being
introduced to some cognitive domain or area of practice we are
unfamiliar with involves learning “a new vocabulary” and
set of ideas already utilized and standard in that area.
Unless and until we can understand the concepts and language in
question, we cannot make sense out of what we perceive and continue to
understand in our previous terms.</p>

<p>

That Nicholas is using “measuring” in this sense is brought
home to us by the metaphor he employs in the passage quoted above from
chapter 9 where he says the mind is “a living compass that
measures by itself.” In contrast with a fixed or non-adjustable
straight ruler, a compass or caliper can be adjusted to fit a range of
sizes and shapes. Cusanus’ fanciful “living”
compass reminds us that as knowers we can actively accommodate our
ideas to what we want to know. As a compass can be adjusted to
find the quantitative measure of a variety of sizes and shapes, so our
minds are able to fashion, adopt, modify and utilize both the literal
and the symbolic ideas and concepts available to us for exploring and
understanding the natural, social and conceptual worlds we inherit and
extend.</p>

<p>

This may help us understand why Nicholas’ sketch of <em>mens</em>
involves both the mind-independent things and the mind itself as
normative measures of the assimilation that is human cognition.
We become like the knowable features of the things we know and we
fashion the conceptual and judgmental measures whereby we take them
into ourselves as known. The full determinate intelligibility of
mind-independent things and states of affairs provides a kind of ideal
limit that we acknowledge in recognizing the inadequacy and
shortcomings of what we do know about them. That is why Nicholas
deems our knowledge “conjectural.”</p>

<p>

Along with providing this ideal limit to what we know, things outside
the mind also stand as referents that themselves measure our cognitive
assimilating. Recognizing that they exist, we also acknowledge
that they are what our knowledge is about. And we constantly
return to what we seek to understand to assess the adequacy of our
conceptions and to correct any mistakes or misinterpretations in our
interpretations. Deprived of these independent measures, our
knowledge has no reference outside the mind and no standard for
revising or improving our conceptual measures as more or less adequate
to what we are trying to understand.</p>

<p>

The Cusan answer, then, to the question of whether mind or the
mind-independent realities are the “measures” of what we
know may thus be seen as an attempt to have it both ways. We are
both measured by the things we know and we construct the concepts and
conceptual frameworks whereby we measure them, however
“conjecturally.” There are situations and realities
we want to understand that challenge us to adjust to what we perceive,
examine, and experience. So, too, there are situations and
realities that require us to modify our ideas and concepts and symbols
so that they will be consistent one with another and with the rest of
our beliefs.</p>

<p>

Nicholas of Cusa thus combines the metaphors of <em>assimilatio</em>
and <em>mensuratio</em> in his account of what provides the cognitive
norms or criteria for human knowing. We cannot resolve the
tension between the two that we find in what he says, but must hold
onto it. The reason is that, as God’s images, we do not
create but must recognize what God has created as independent of human
knowledge. We may fashion the interpretative measures whereby we
know created things, but we do this while acknowledging that the full
intelligibility of each determinate reality is ultimately identical
with God’s unknowable Oneness. We may aspire to full
intelligibility but can reach it only in mathematics. That is why
our best knowledge, even of the mind itself, remains conjectural,
sharing God’s truth but limited to human ways of knowing.</p>

<h3><a name="SymPhiThe">2.3 Symbols and Philosophical Theology</a></h3>

<p>

The relationship between <em>On Learned Ignorance</em> and <em>On
Conjectures</em> sets a pattern for the many shorter theoretical works
Nicholas was to write in the two decades that followed. The basic
insights and the framework laid out in <em>On Learned Ignorance</em>
is never discarded and never substantively modified. Instead Nicholas’
dialogues and briefer treatises can be read as proposing many
different metaphors or symbols for understanding his teaching about
the relationship between God and creatures. Three examples of these
metaphors may give some idea of the power and freshness of his
speculative imagining. The first is his use of the icon and the wall
in <em>The Vision of God</em> (1453); the second his attempt to
capture the God-creature connection by describing God as “Not
Other” in the dialogue by that name (<em>On the Not Other</em>,
1461); the third his fascination with mathematics and its symbolic
potential. While Cusanus never surrenders his initial insight that
there is no proportion between infinite and finite, thinking through
these later symbols and neologisms lets us see how these indirect
means enable some movement of mind and heart towards the divine
Mystery with whom we are ever connected.</p>

<h4>2.3.1 The Icon and the Wall</h4>

<p>

Cusanus wrote <em>The Vision of God</em> in the form of a prayer,
responding to the request of the Benedictines of Tegernsee for a
treatise on mystical theology. With it he sent them an
“all-seeing” icon and proposed an exercise for its use to
give them some understanding of God’s seeing their attempts to
see God. The icon was probably a “Veronica” or image
of the face of the suffering Jesus in which the eyes were portrayed as
looking out of the picture plane. As a result, from whatever
standpoint one looked at the painting, it seemed the eyes of Jesus
looked directly into the viewer’s own eyes. Thus it could
symbolize at once both God’s vision of us and our vision of God
(the combined objective and subjective senses of <em>visio
Dei</em>).</p>

<p>

Nicholas begins by warning that “Whatever is apparent with regard
to the icon of God’s sight is truer with regard to God’s
true sight.”(c. 1) And what does appear when we place
ourselves with the monks viewing the painting and reflect? Since
it is a painting we see, what we seem to experience as we look into the
eyes of Jesus is not really taking place. The face portrayed
neither looks at nor sees anyone; in fact, the viewer’s gaze is
the norm for this experience of a face-to-face encounter. Yet
because of the spatial and temporal simultaneity the apparent gaze of
the icon invites the viewer to enter into the world of the painting and
tends to privilege what is portrayed, namely Jesus gazing at me.
I move back and forth from my customary reactions when eyes are looking
into my eyes to the realization that this eye contact is
illusory.</p>

<p>

But the illusory image in this case is of Christ suffering and looking
at me. If this painting is to mediate between my reality and what
it portrays, it obviously invites me to look beyond, since this is an
image of the One who <em>is</em> the image of the Father. Twice
removed from the actual divine seeing and being seen it is supposed to
symbolize, Nicholas’ use of this icon lets us understand how far
we stand from God’s own seeing. Yet Nicholas’ initial
warning also reminds us that what is symbolized here by the painting is
all the more so in reality. We are in truth preceded and embraced
by Christ’s seeing us.</p>

<p>

In seeing we are seen—this mutual relatedness is at least what
the icon symbolizes. But Nicholas goes further, proposing that
God’s seeing and God’s being seen are identical:</p>

<blockquote>

O Lord, when you look upon me with an eye of graciousness, what is
your seeing, other than your being seen by me? In seeing me, you who
are <em>deus absconditus</em> [hidden God] give yourself to be seen by
me. No one can see You except insofar as you grant that you be
seen. To see you is not other than that you see the one who sees you.
(c.5, Hopkins translation)</blockquote>

<p>

In this way God seen is identically God seeing. The reason is
that for God to be seen by any creature is nothing else than for God to
“see” that creature gazing. But the icon also reminds
us of our distance from seeing God. I can see the depicted eyes
of Jesus even though no real eyes are present. But I cannot see
the divine face or its vision even though God’s reality is
present and “sees” me. The dialectic of divine
presence and absence, of human seeing and not seeing that I experience
with the icon is thus turned inside out. When I look at the icon
of Christ, what seems present, its seeing, is really absent, yet
God’s seeing is really present though it seems absent.</p>

<p>

What the icon thus symbolizes is the experienced simultaneous
connection of different levels of reality. Indeed, I have
separate reality as a contracted image of God only through my relation
to my divine Source. What is telling about Nicholas’
version of seeing God is neither what vision discerns nor what
practices one must follow in order to gain the correct standpoint for
such seeing. Rather he revises the meaning of “seeing
God” so that God is both subject and object of our purported
vision of God.</p>

<p>

Yet this vision of God is merely purported. Cusanus leads us
through a series of reflections on seeing and on the face of God only
to let us realize that, whatever <em>ratio</em> or discursive reason
comes to realize, God is located beyond both imaginative exercise and
conceptual understanding. Nicholas symbolizes our approach to
this beyond by encouraging us to enter “into a certain secret and
hidden silence wherein there is no knowledge or concept of a
face,” characterizing it as an “obscuring mist, haze,
darkness or ignorance.” (c.6) He invokes the
coincidence of opposites from <em>On Learned Ignorance</em> and, in
chapter 9 of <em>The Vision of God</em>, proposes his second central
metaphor: the wall of paradise. God dwells inside this
wall, and the wall also symbolizes the coincidence of opposites and
thus the defeat of discursive reason and the principle of
contradiction.</p>

<p>

Just how are we to think through the coincidence of opposites and
attempt to move beyond the wall to some sort of “seeing”
God? Nicholas proposes that three locations in relation to the wall
map three stages in the mystical quest, using the metaphorical couple
of “enfolding/unfolding” from <em>On Learned
Ignorance</em>. Reason can understand things enfolded in or identical
with God as different from the same things unfolded in the created
universe. At this first stage we are outside the wall. The second
stage is at the wall itself, where Nicholas places us with Christ at
the door or threshold of an entrance in the wall. Here enfolding and
unfolding coincide and we encounter the barrier of the coincidence of
opposites. At best we acknowledge that creating and being created are
one and the same in God. A third stage is beyond the entrance and
inside the wall where enfolding/unfolding fall away and Cusanus points
to God’s silent presence and utter transcendence, “free from
whatever can be spoken of or thought of” (c.11) The third stage
involves recognition that God’s infinity remains unknowable to us in
conceptual terms.</p>

<p>

Cusanus proposes some possible indirect routes that will give us no
positive insight or conceptual grasp of the divine Essence. For
instance, if we look to the very oppositions and contradictions that
plague our normal thinking about God, we may do more justice to the
unique relation between God and creatures. In his words,
“the oppositeness of opposites is oppositeness without
oppositeness.” (c.13) He identifies the infinite God with
this “oppositeness of opposites.” Now the
“opposites” in question are the ordinary things of our
experience that are separate and distinct and that may have opposed or
mutually exclusive properties.</p>

<p>

Designating God as the Oppositeness of such opposites can take us from
the distinctions and oppositions with which we are familiar to the One
who is responsible for there being such oppositions. God is
distinct from these oppositions and differences but only in a way that
establishes their reality. Yet God’s oppositeness is
“without oppositeness” since God’s distinctiveness is
unlimited and beyond familiar oppositions. In fact, God’s
oppositeness encompasses or enfolds all opposites in God as identically
God and encompasses or unfolds all opposites in creation by
constituting them as what they are in all their determinate, finite
differences. We are to think together <em>both</em> the way
finite things are opposed <em>and</em> God’s transcendent
oppositeness that is “opposed” to those opposites, not as
they are to one another, but so as to be ontologically responsible for
the oppositions with which we are familiar.</p>

<h4>2.3.2 God is the Not Other</h4>

<p>

In <em>De li Non Aliud/On the Not Other</em> (1462) Nicholas returns
to the ancient Platonic categories of the One and the Other in order to
re-construe in novel language what Christians believe about the
dependence of creatures on their Creator. Several of
Cusanus’ later works use verbal coinages or Latin neologisms as
“names” or characterizations of God that are original with
him, though they have earlier echoes in Christian Neoplatonism.
In this dialogue he uses the expression “the not other” as
a substantive for God as the divine Not-Other, even though we are more
familiar with the phrase in comparative expressions that are negative
ways of stating self-identity. For instance, “the tree is
not other than (= the same as, identical with) the
tree.”</p>

<p>

When we use reason to recognize differences and to make distinctions,
we are attempting to do justice to the plurality and variety of the
natural and cultural realms with which we are most familiar. Even
things of the same kind are different numerically, and speaking and
thinking clearly about things and their features requires our
differentiating what is determinate about them. We expect them to
stay the same as they are and to remain different from other things and
we reflect this in our language of identity and difference when we
describe and define what we perceive and understand.</p>

<p>

Nicholas is attempting to capitalize on the way we differentiate
created things to signal and symbolize their divine Creator.
While each created thing is not other than itself, so to speak, it
certainly is other or different from other things. And
created things are different from God as well. But Nicholas is
proposing a way of “naming” God that will underline how
God’s difference from God’s creatures is not even close to
one creature’s difference from another creature.
God’s difference is categorially different, so to speak, from one
creature’s otherness from a second creature. Cusanus can
thus paradoxically assert that God is “not other” than
anything God has created and is sustaining in being. Indeed, we
do well to think of God as “the Not-Other.”</p>

<p>

Here is what Nicholas writes:</p>

<blockquote>

Not Other is not an other, nor is it other than any other, nor is it
an other in an other—for no other reason than that it is Not
Other, which can in no way be other, as if it something were lacking
to it, as to an other. For an other which is other than something
lacks that than which it is other. But Not Other, because it is not
other than anything, does not lack anything nor can anything be
outside it. (c.6)</blockquote>

<p>

We may paraphrase this rather cryptic passage as follows. The
divine Not-Other is simply not one of the things we are familiar with
in the world we inhabit, where all is multiplicity and difference,
where each thing or state of affairs is other than or different from
every other existent thing or situation that obtains. Nicholas
terms the multiple things we deal with “others” because
each one of them, each “other,” is distinct from every
other thing. Nicholas also proposes that such finite things
possess and lack what things different from them possess—to be
other or distinct is precisely not to be one or any of the finite
others. Our language and thought busy themselves in finding and
making further distinctions and divisions between things and parts of
things, between one condition and another, between one state of affairs
and another. So we come to know that one thing is other than or
separate from another thing or that we find it in another that is
related to, yet different from, something else.</p>

<p>

Nicholas’ central point is that the divine Not-Other is nothing
like all the finite, limited others of our experience. Nicholas
writes, “Not Other does not lack anything.” Even in
common sense terms, any given thing is “plenty lacking,” to
speak colloquially. No matter what it has, it arguably is lacking
some of what it should have as a specimen of its type, and it certainly
lacks what other things not of its kind possess. One way to think of
the finite things with which we are familiar is to consider that their
being limited means that they are just so much and not more. But this
is exactly how we should not think of God, who “does not lack
anything” and outside of whom nothing can exist. As
Nicholas says, “But God is Not-Other because God is not other
than other, even though ‘not other’ and ‘other’
seem opposed. But other is not opposed to God from whom it has that it
is other.” (c.6)</p>

<p>

The opposition in this case is entirely different because, though
creatures are dependent functions of God and may be interdependent
functions of one another, God is not a dependent function of
creatures. God is precisely not any of the others and so is not
other or different in the way creatures are. We thus have two
sorts of differentiation or otherness, the opposition between distinct
creatures and the opposition between creatures and God. The
“Not” in “Not-Other” differentiates God from
creatures but does not exclude the divine Not-Other since the Not-Other
ontologically determines creatures. Thinking God as Not-Other
requires a characteristic Cusan dialectical thinking, not simply
affirming or denying difference. We are to recognize and
acknowledge that the divine Not-Other is <em>both</em> not one of the
others <em>and</em> at once not other than any or all of them.</p>

<p>

To put this more formally, the difference or opposition between created
things is both symmetrical and transitive. The basis for their
distinction is their identity: their symmetrical otherness is the
result of their substantial not-otherness, so to speak. But
created things’ difference from God is asymmetrical and
intransitive. True, the divine Not-Other is not one of the
creatures, but in a different way than they are different from one
another. Cusanus gives expression to this important difference
between finite and Infinite when he asserts that the divine Not-Other
is <em>not other</em> than any created other. Negatively, the
Not-Other is not finite as the others are; positively, the reflexivity
characteristic of a limited thing’s self-identity also
characterizes the Not-Other’s relation with it.</p>

<p>

Just as any creature is not other than itself so it is not other than
the divine Not-Other. The divine Not-Other both is and is not
every finite other. The reason is that distinct created things
possess their very status as beings, and thus their otherness, from and
through God. God, the divine Not-Other, is causally responsible
for things’ existing as separate and self-identical
others. For Nicholas, nothing can have being outside of
God.</p>

<h4>2.3.3 Mathematics and God</h4>

<p>Recent publications, and in particular,
D.Albertson’s <i>Mathematical Theologies</i>(2014), have
highlighted another key theme and its attendant metaphors in Nicholas’
works: mathematics and number. Cusanus believes that no knowledge we
have is more certain than mathematics, given that it is the
construction of our own minds.  Mathematical ideas are the paradigm of
how the human mind unfolds a conceptual universe that parallels and
forms an image of God’s unfolding of the created world. Number here
refers primarily to arithmetic and geometry, to the whole numbers and
to plane and solid figures. The latter are often imagined as in
movement or constructing other figures.  Nicholas joins
enfolding/unfolding and the certainty of mathematics to the Christian
tradition that everything is created in the divine word or Logos.</p>

<p>

Geometrical figures are used early in Book 1 of <em>On Learned
Ignorance</em> to illustrate how our knowledge of created things is
only approximative.  A bit later we are led to extrapolate straight
and curved lines as an aid to understanding the coincidence of
opposites and to moving human thought towards the God who is
unknowable by reason. Book 2 uses number to illustrate enfolding and
unfolding—as the number series unfolds what is enfolded in the unit,
so God unfolds all created things.  Nicholas later introduces the
geometrical image of the sphere whose center is everywhere and whose
circumference is nowhere to explain how the physical universe’s lack
of boundaries is an image of God’s infinity. Book 2 also opens and
closes with reflection on the quadrivium: arithmetic, geometry, music
and astronomy. Book 3 returns to the image of the infinite sphere for
the combination of absolute and contracted reality in the God-man.</p>

<p>

<em>On Conjectures</em> moves directly into arithmetic and geometry
with its conjectural reflections on the decade’s embracing all number
and with its ordering of reality’s oneness and otherness using the
spatial diagrams P and U that employ cones and spheres.  Just as the
number series unfolds the unit, so the created universe unfolds God’s
creating, and human concepts (such as numbers and geometric figures)
unfold the oneness of the human mind.  In this way a human being is
truly a “second God.”</p>

<p>

Nicholas’ later works of the 1450s extend the notion of number and of
enfolding/unfolding that he inherited from Boethius and the
twelfth-century school of Chartres.  Number and size (<em>multitudo et
magnitudo</em>) are central to <em>The Layman: On Mind</em> where
measuring is proposed as the layman’s definition of the human mind.
Measuring is then used directly in <em>The Layman: Experiments with
Weights</em>. Nicholas proposes that the Divine Word in whom all
things are created or unfolded in time is to be thought together with
human measuring as the closest sign or image of the Divine Oneness. In
the background stands the saying from the <em>Book of Wisdom</em>11.21
that in creating God ordered “all things in measure, number and
weight.”  This way number and mathematical ideas take on more than
their usual employment for human ends and become a way to the Creator
always present to creaturely unfoldings in human thought. </p>

<p>

<em>The Vision of God</em> (1453) proposes an exercise for the monks
based on the center and circumference of circle wherein seeing from
the circumference and being seen from the center collapse into a
figure of mystical oneness: being seen seeing.  In the same year
Nicholas composes <em>Complementary Theological Considerations (De
theologicis complementis)</em>. There he features God as a
mathematician who creates in the Equality of the Divine
Word—unfolding as well human beings whose quadrivial mathematics is
an image of the divine creativity. God is now named “infinite angle”
that unites maximal and minimal angles and the non-quantitative number
of everything. Nicholas thus brings together his theological and
mathematical concepts from the 1440s and unites number,
enfolding/unfolding and the Divine Word.</p>

<h2><a name="NeoHisOwn">3. A Neoplatonism of His Own</a></h2>

<p>

How does Nicholas’ Neoplatonism aid his thinking about
God? One advantage is that Nicholas can take the basic asymmetry
between paradigmatic Platonic Forms and the perceptible realm of
particular things that are images of the Forms and apply that asymmetry
to the way the First Principle, God, is related to all other created
realities. In working out this relationship, Plato proposed that
what results for individual Forms is that all particulars
“participate” in the relevant Form just the way an image
reflects and depends on its original. That is to say, the Form
does not require the particulars but is prior ontologically. The
relation between Form and particulars is not one of reciprocal
dependence. Applied to the first ontological principle, or to the
Christian God, the result is to let all the multiple, complex creatures
participate in their ultimate Source while the divine Creator remains
simple, unparticipated and unchanged. As Christian medieval
thinkers (even the Aristotelians agreed on this point) were accustomed
to express it, creatures depend on God while God is not at all
dependent on creatures. All the dependence is one-way.</p>

<p>

And that dependence is interpreted in Platonic and Biblical terms,
as the dependence of creaturely images on a divine Original.
While the total reality of an image requires the influence of the
original, there is nothing about the latter that is ontologically in
need of the image. In Platonism this effectively means there is
“separation” of the intelligible and perceptible realms,
for in fact the perceptible cannot exist without the very intelligible
that abides unaffected by the realm of multiplicity and change. While
not being themselves Forms, perceptible things are not really separate
from the intelligible Forms on which they depend. No less than
Form and perceptible thing in Platonism and Neoplatonism, in Christian
Neoplatonism Creator and creature are bound together in a parallel
asymmetry.</p>

<p>

If this asymmetry is rethought in terms of the presence required for
the creatures to be all that they are by nature, it will turn out that
God (or the One in non-Christian Neoplatonisms), the greater and prior
reality, must always be there if creaturely reality is to be
forthcoming and to continue. Now creatures as created images can
stand for manifestation and reflection of (and for Christian thinkers,
likeness to) as well as for dependence on God, for the divine presence penetrates
and encompasses each and all creatures without ever being limited or
captured by any of them. While Plato’s Forms play a
definitive role in the perceptible realm as responsible for the
determinate characteristics of things, they count as a kind of present
absence. No less determinative is the ongoing presence of the
Christian God and that, too, has become a kind of absence. How
should we attempt to understand this?</p>

<p>

Our conceptions of the absence or presence of one thing to another are
taken originally from and remain most at home in the realm of limited
physical beings. Here presence to or absence from another involves the
same sort of mutuality or reciprocity that the same corporeal realm of
limited things must always manifest. If body A is present to or absent
from body B, B is present to or absent from A and vice versa. The
other sorts of important presence or absence we are familiar
with—presence in thought, in memory and imagination and
affection, for instance—are metaphorical to some degree and are
extensions from and find their source in our experience of some prior
physical presence, whether merely perceived and understood, or hoped
for, or feared. So too with the kinds of metaphorical absence we
recognize when some present person is, as we say, “just not
there.” And absence, whether indifferent, bad or good,
presupposes presence. Such metaphorical presences and absences of
limited things to one another might thus be understood as absent
presences or present absences.</p>

<p>

And so we are able to speculate about the case of a non-finite
presence-in-absence by starting with but moving beyond the limits of
the presence and absence we are familiar with in the realm of limited
things. Now we turn to the presence of the unfamiliar infinite One as
what is finally required, even if not obviously experienced, to keep
the creaturely image present and real. In this case, we may think that
absence becomes what is metaphorical and the presence of the First is
in truth ineluctably and literally necessary to explain the reality of
anything and everything. But God’s presence is hardly like that of one
physical thing to another.</p>

<p>

This means that the presence of God and God’s identity with
things is not to be thought as the kind of reciprocity, say, that two
created physical things have that are present to one another, let alone
similar or identical to each other. What is distinctive about Christian Neoplatonism is
its ability to hold together dialectically in thought the insight it
provides about this asymmetrical, non-reciprocal ontological connection
between God and creatures. God penetrates and surpasses or
exceeds each thing God creates and encompasses. Creatures are thus
themselves real with the limited sort of independence they manifest,
yet they are at once in God and indeed one with God without being
themselves divine.</p>

<p>

But what has all this to do with Nicholas of Cusa’s having a
Neoplatonism of his own? What is characteristic of his thought, I want
to propose, is that in key passages of major works he proposes this
same kind of dialectical thinking to enable our grasping the general
relationship between God and creatures. But the thinking is supposed to
reflect an ontological dialectic, that is to say, a relationship that
is real whether we acknowledge it or not. The dialectical
relation between God and creatures is something towards which we mostly
gesture in our efforts to do it justice in thought and speech.
But is this not merely Proclus or Dionysius or Eriugena or Eckhart
revisited in the fifteenth century? The answer is both yes and
no.</p>

<p>

Yes, the dialectical reality envisioned by Nicholas should be little
different than that pointed to by earlier Christian
Neoplatonists. Neither Plato’s Forms nor the Christian God
did or could change over the centuries nor did the need of particulars
and creatures for their intelligible and divine originals. But
also, no, for Cusanus gives the dialectical relation his own expression
in a series of novel metaphors for the connection between God and
creatures. Some of his original metaphors, such as the
coincidence of opposites, enfolding/unfolding, God as the Not Other,
and as the Oppositeness of opposites, are controlled by and witness to
that same asymmetrical relationship, yet lead our speculative
imaginations in some new directions that would otherwise remain
unexplored.</p>

<p>

If only God can bespeak Godself in literal terms, then we humans are
graced with metaphors. What Cusanus provides in his metaphorical forays
is not simply imaginative originality, but a series of metaphors
designed to remind us that there is no proportion between creatures and
creator; that indeed there is an asymmetry between them.
Moreover, our best ways of conceiving and asserting this necessary lack
of reciprocal dependence should be built into the metaphors we
choose. This is why one may not need a theory of metaphor to do
justice to the Cusan project of philosophical theology. Rather,
the Cusan project is Neoplatonic and has its own traditional strictures
on any metaphors he chooses: the ontology determines the metaphors, the
metaphors do not determine the ontology. What makes
Nicholas’ thought a Neoplatonism of his own is precisely the
grasp his metaphors demonstrate of those ontological strictures, as
well as the speculative imagination he evinces in the range,
originality and variety of metaphors for what we can and cannot
understand about God’s connection with creatures.</p>

<h2><a name="ConPolIde">4. Contribution to Political Ideas</a></h2>

<p>Nicholas of Cusa has attracted frequent notice in the history of
political ideas because of his early work, <em>The Catholic
Concordance/De Concordantia Catholica (1433–34).</em>  This lengthy
work in three books is aimed first of all at an ecclesiatical audience
at the Council of Basel and only secondarily, in Book 3, at the Holy
Roman Empire and its electors of the emperor.  Nicholas’ ideas stand
squarely in the conciliarist tradition following proposals from the
Council of Constance (1414–18), and thus privilege the council’s
authority above the pope’s. In Book 1 he expounds a hierarchical view
of creation and of the church, following Dionysius the Areopagite.
Then he uses both canon law and historical documents from and about
the early church councils to undergird his view of council and papacy.
Yet he never denies the importance of the positions of pope and
emperor. Throughout Nicholas works to harmonize
(=<em>concordantia</em>) the many different strands in church law and
political theory.</p>

<p>

Over the last century scholars of political history have singled out
chapters, particularly in Book 2, where Nicholas discusses consent as
a prerequisite for legitimate law and government.  Going beyond
tradition and canon law, he argues on the basis of people’s natural
freedom (“men are by nature equal in power and equally free”) that all
governance comes from the consent of the subjects.  This argument to
explicitly institutionalize consent is Nicholas’ original
contribution.  He follows it with proposals on representation that
move from representation as virtual impersonation to representation as
delegation based on those represented selecting their
representatives. This is one of the first explicit statements in the
West of the institutional limits to be placed on rulers and of the
idea that people must consent to their representative
institutions.</p>

<p>

Even after he changed allegiance to the side of papal supremacy,
Nicholas used his ideas to argue in later brief writings that Basel
was not truly representative and that consent was embodied in the
college of cardinals.  In the following centuries, secular parliaments
returned to ideas of consent and representation (though not directly
to Nicholas’ book) in attempting to restrict the power of monarchs.
In the church itself, tradition continued to outweigh innovation, and
the idea of conciliar superiority to the pope seemed dead for
centuries. Some twentieth-century thinking in the Roman Catholic
Church has returned to and enlivened ideas about council and papacy
propounded by Nicholas of Cusa.</p>
