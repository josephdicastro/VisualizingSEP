<h1>The Chinese Room Argument</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Fri Mar 19, 2004; substantive revision Thu Feb 20, 2020</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
The argument and thought-experiment now generally known as the Chinese
Room Argument was first published in a 1980 article by American
philosopher John Searle (1932– ). It has become one of the best-known
arguments in recent philosophy. Searle imagines himself alone in a
room following a computer program for responding to Chinese characters
slipped under the door. Searle understands nothing of Chinese, and
yet, by following the program for manipulating symbols and numerals
just as a computer does, he sends appropriate strings of Chinese
characters back out under the door, and this leads those outside to
mistakenly suppose there is a Chinese speaker in the room. </p>

<p>
The narrow conclusion of the argument is that programming a digital
computer may make it appear to understand language but could not
produce real understanding. Hence the “Turing Test” is
inadequate. Searle argues that the thought experiment underscores the
fact that computers merely use syntactic rules to manipulate symbol
strings, but have no understanding of meaning or semantics. The
broader conclusion of the argument is that the theory that human minds
are computer-like computational or information processing systems is
refuted. Instead minds must result from biological processes;
computers can at best simulate these biological processes. Thus the
argument has large implications for semantics, philosophy of language
and mind, theories of consciousness, computer science and cognitive
science generally. As a result, there have been many critical replies
to the argument.</p>

<h2 id="Over">1. Overview</h2>

<p>
Work in Artificial Intelligence (AI) has produced computer programs
that can beat the world chess champion, control autonomous vehicles,
complete our email sentences, and defeat the best human players on the
television quiz show <i>Jeopardy</i>. AI has also produced programs
with which one can converse in natural language, including customer
service “virtual agents”, and Amazon’s Alexa and
Apple’s <i>Siri</i>. Our experience shows that playing chess or
<i>Jeopardy</i>, and carrying on a conversation, are activities that
require understanding and intelligence. Does computer prowess at
conversation and challenging games then show that computers can
understand language and be intelligent? Will further development
result in digital computers that fully match or even exceed human
intelligence?
 <a href="../turing/">Alan Turing</a>
 (1950), one of the pioneer theoreticians of computing, believed the
answer to these questions was “yes”. Turing proposed what
is now known as
 ‘<a href="../turing-test/">The Turing Test</a>’:
 if a computer can pass for human in online chat, we should grant that
it is intelligent. By the late 1970s some AI researchers claimed that
computers already understood at least some natural language. In 1980
U.C. Berkeley philosopher John Searle introduced a short and
widely-discussed argument intended to show conclusively that it is
impossible for digital computers to understand language or think.</p>

<p>
Searle argues that a good way to test a theory of mind, say a theory
that holds that understanding can be created by doing such and such,
is to imagine what it would be like to actually do what the theory
says will create understanding. Searle (1999) summarized his Chinese
Room Argument (herinafter, CRA) concisely:</p>

<blockquote>
Imagine a native English speaker who knows no Chinese locked in a room
full of boxes of Chinese symbols (a data base) together with a book of
instructions for manipulating the symbols (the program). Imagine that
people outside the room send in other Chinese symbols which, unknown
to the person in the room, are questions in Chinese (the input). And
imagine that by following the instructions in the program the man in
the room is able to pass out Chinese symbols which are correct answers
to the questions (the output). The program enables the person in the
room to pass the Turing Test for understanding Chinese but he does not
understand a word of Chinese.
</blockquote>

<p>
Searle goes on to say, “The point of the argument is this: if
the man in the room does not understand Chinese on the basis of
implementing the appropriate program for understanding Chinese then
neither does any other digital computer solely on that basis because
no computer, qua computer, has anything the man does not
have.”</p>

<p>
Thirty years after introducing the CRA Searle 2010 describes the
conclusion in terms of consciousness and
 <a href="../intentionality/">intentionality</a>:</p>
 
<blockquote>
I demonstrated years ago with the so-called Chinese Room Argument that
the implementation of the computer program is not by itself sufficient
for consciousness or intentionality (Searle 1980). Computation is
defined purely formally or syntactically, whereas minds have actual
mental or semantic contents, and we cannot get from syntactical to the
semantic just by having the syntactical operations and nothing else.
To put this point slightly more technically, the notion “same
implemented program” defines an equivalence class that is
specified independently of any specific physical realization. But such
a specification necessarily leaves out the biologically specific
powers of the brain to cause cognitive processes. A system, me, for
example, would not acquire an understanding of Chinese just by going
through the steps of a computer program that simulated the behavior of
a Chinese speaker (p.17).
</blockquote>

<p>
“Intentionality” is a technical term for a feature of
mental and certain other things, namely being about something. Thus a
desire for a piece of chocolate and thoughts about real Manhattan or
fictional Harry Potter all display intentionality, as will be
discussed in more detail in section 5.2 below.</p>

<p>
Searle’s shift from machine understanding to consciousness and
intentionality is not directly supported by the original 1980
argument. However the re-description of the conclusion indicates the
close connection between understanding and consciousness in
Searle’s later accounts of meaning and intentionality. Those who
don’t accept Searle’s linking account might hold that
running a program can create understanding without necessarily
creating consciousness, and conversely a fancy robot might have dog
level consciousness, desires, and beliefs, without necessarily
understanding natural language.</p>

<p>
In moving to discussion of intentionality Searle seeks to develop the
broader implications of his argument. It aims to refute the
 <a href="../functionalism/">functionalist</a>
 approach to understanding minds, that is, the approach that holds
that mental states are defined by their causal roles, not by the stuff
(neurons, transistors) that plays those roles. The argument counts
especially against that form of functionalism known as
 <a href="../computational-mind/"> the Computational Theory of Mind</a>
 that treats minds as information processing systems. As a result of
its scope, as well as Searle’s clear and forceful writing style,
the Chinese Room argument has probably been the most widely discussed
philosophical argument in cognitive science to appear since the Turing
Test. By 1991 computer scientist Pat Hayes had defined Cognitive
Science as the ongoing research project of refuting Searle’s
argument. Cognitive psychologist Steven Pinker (1997) pointed out that
by the mid-1990s well over 100 articles had been published on
Searle’s thought experiment – and that discussion of it
was so pervasive on the Internet that Pinker found it a compelling
reason to remove his name from all Internet discussion lists. </p>

<p>
This interest has not subsided, and the range of connections with the
argument has broadened. A search on Google Scholar for “Searle
Chinese Room” limited to the period from 2010 through 2019
produced over 2000 results, including papers making connections
between the argument and topics ranging from embodied cognition to
theater to talk psychotherapy to postmodern views of truth and
“our post-human future” – as well as discussions of
group or collective minds and discussions of the role of intuitions in
philosophy. In 2007 a game company took the name “The Chinese
Room” in joking honor of “...Searle’s critique of AI
– that you could create a system that gave the impression of
intelligence without any actual internal smarts.” This
wide-range of discussion and implications is a tribute to the
argument’s simple clarity and centrality. </p>

<h2 id="HistBack">2. Historical Background</h2>

<h3 id="LeibMill">2.1 Leibniz’ Mill</h3>

<p>
Searle’s argument has four important antecedents. The first of
these is an argument set out by the philosopher and mathematician
Gottfried Leibniz (1646–1716). This argument, often known as
“Leibniz’ Mill”, appears as section 17 of
Leibniz’ <em>Monadology</em>. Like Searle’s argument,
Leibniz’ argument takes the form of a thought experiment.
Leibniz asks us to imagine a physical system, a machine, that behaves
in such a way that it supposedly thinks and has experiences
(“perception”).</p>

<blockquote>
17. Moreover, it must be confessed that perception and that which
depends upon it are inexplicable on mechanical grounds, that is to
say, by means of figures and motions. And supposing there were a
machine, so constructed as to think, feel, and have perception, it
might be conceived as increased in size, while keeping the same
proportions, so that one might go into it as into a mill. That being
so, we should, on examining its interior, find only parts which work
one upon another, and never anything by which to explain a perception.
Thus it is in a simple substance, and not in a compound or in a
machine, that perception must be sought for. [Robert Latta
translation]
</blockquote>

<p>
Notice that Leibniz’s strategy here is to contrast the overt
behavior of the machine, which might appear to be the product of
conscious thought, with the way the machine operates internally. He
points out that these internal mechanical operations are just parts
moving from point to point, hence there is nothing that is conscious
or that can explain thinking, feeling or perceiving. For Leibniz
physical states are not sufficient for, nor constitutive of, mental
states.</p>

<h3 id="TuriPapeMach">2.2 Turing’s Paper Machine</h3>

<p>
A second antecedent to the Chinese Room argument is the idea of a
paper machine, a computer implemented by a human. This idea is found
in the work of Alan Turing, for example in “Intelligent
Machinery” (1948). Turing writes there that he wrote a program
for a “paper machine” to play chess. A paper machine is a
kind of program, a series of simple steps like a computer program, but
written in natural language (e.g., English), and implemented by a
human. The human operator of the paper chess-playing machine need not
(otherwise) know how to play chess. All the operator does is follow
the instructions for generating moves on the chess board. In fact, the
operator need not even know that he or she is involved in playing
chess – the input and output strings, such as
“N–QB7” need mean nothing to the operator of the
paper machine.</p>

<p>
As part of the WWII project to decipher German military encryption,
Turing had written English-language programs for human
“computers”, as these specialized workers were then known,
and these human computers did not need to know what the programs that
they implemented were doing.</p>

<p>
One reason the idea of a human-plus-paper machine is important is that
it already raises questions about agency and understanding similar to
those in the CRA. Suppose I am alone in a closed room and follow an
instruction book for manipulating strings of symbols. I thereby
implement a paper machine that generates symbol strings such as
“N-KB3” that I write on pieces of paper and slip under the
door to someone ouside the room. Suppose further that prior to going
into the room I don’t know how to play chess, or even that there
is such a game. However, unbeknownst to me, in the room I am running
Turing’s chess program and the symbol strings I generate are
chess notation and are taken as chess moves by those outside the room.
They reply by sliding the symbols for their own moves back under the
door into the room. If all you see is the resulting sequence of moves
displayed on a chess board outside the room, you might think that
someone in the room knows how to play chess very well. Do I now know
how to play chess? Or is it the system (consisting of me, the manuals,
and the paper on which I manipulate strings of symbols) that is
playing chess? If I memorize the program and do the symbol
manipulations inside my head, do I then know how to play chess, albeit
with an odd phenomenology? Does someone’s conscious states
matter for whether or not they know how to play chess? If a digital
computer implements the same program, does the computer then play
chess, or merely simulate this? </p>

<p>
By mid-century Turing was optimistic that the newly developed
electronic computers themselves would soon be able to exhibit
apparently intelligent behavior, answering questions posed in English
and carrying on conversations. Turing (1950) proposed what is now
known as the Turing Test: if a computer could pass for human in
on-line chat, it should be counted as intelligent. </p>

<p>
A third antecedent of Searle’s argument was the work of
Searle’s colleague at Berkeley, Hubert Dreyfus. Dreyfus was an
early critic of the optimistic claims made by AI researchers. In 1965,
when Dreyfus was at MIT, he published a circa hundred page report
titled “Alchemy and Artificial Intelligence”. Dreyfus
argued that key features of human mental life could not be captured by
formal rules for manipulating symbols. Dreyfus moved to Berkeley in
1968 and in 1972 published his extended critique, “What
Computers Can’t Do”. Dreyfus’ primary research
interests were in Continental philosophy, with its focus on
consciousness, intentionality, and the role of intuition and the
inarticulated background in shaping our understandings. Dreyfus
identified several problematic assumptions in AI, including the view
that brains are like digital computers, and, again, the assumption
that understanding can be codified as explicit rules. </p>

<p>
However by the late 1970s, as computers became faster and less
expensive, some in the burgeoning AI community started to claim that
their programs could understand English sentences, using a database of
background information. The work of one of these, Yale researcher
Roger Schank (Schank &amp; Abelson 1977) came to Searle’s
attention.Schank developed a technique called “conceptual
representation” that used “scripts” to represent
conceptual relations (related to Conceptual Role Semantics).
Searle’s argument was originally presented as a response to the
claim that AI programs such as Schank’s literally understand the
sentences that they respond to.</p>

<h3 id="ChinNati">2.3 The Chinese Nation</h3>

<p>
A fourth antecedent to the Chinese Room argument are thought
experiments involving myriad humans acting as a computer. In 1961
Anatoly Mickevich (pseudonym A. Dneprov) published “The
Game”, a story in which a stadium full of 1400 math students are
arranged to function as a digital computer (see Dneprov 1961 and the
English translation listed at Mickevich 1961, Other Internet
Resources). For 4 hours each repeatedly does a bit of calculation on
binary numbers received from someone near them, then passes the binary
result onto someone nearby. They learn the next day that they
collectively translated a sentence from Portuguese into their native
Russian. Mickevich’s protagonist concludes “We’ve
proven that even the most perfect simulation of machine thinking is
not the thinking process itself, which is a higher form of motion of
living matter.” Apparently independently, a similar
consideration emerged in early discussion of functionalist theories of
minds and cognition (see further discussion in section 5.3 below),
Functionalists hold that mental states are defined by the causal role
they play in a system (just as a door stop is defined by what it does,
not by what it is made out of). Critics of functionalism were quick to
turn its proclaimed virtue of multiple realizability against it. While
functionalism was consistent with a materialist or biological
understanding of mental states (arguably a virtue), it did not
identify types of mental states (such as experiencing pain, or
wondering about OZ) with particular types of neurophysiological
states, as “type-type identity theory” did. In contrast
with type-type identity theory, functionalism allowed sentient beings
with different physiology to have the same types of mental states as
humans – pains, for example. But it was pointed out that if
extraterrestrial aliens, with some other complex system in place of
brains, could realize the functional properties that constituted
mental states, then, presumably so could systems even less like human
brains. The computational form of functionalism, which holds that the
defining role of each mental state is its role in information
processing or computation, is particularly vulnerable to this
maneuver, since a wide variety of systems with simple components are
computationally equivalent (see e.g., Maudlin 1989 for discussion of a
computer built from buckets of water). Critics asked if it was really
plausible that these inorganic systems could have mental states or
feel pain.</p>

<p>
Daniel Dennett (1978) reports that in 1974 Lawrence Davis gave a
colloquium at MIT in which he presented one such unorthodox
implementation. Dennett summarizes Davis’ thought experiment as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>
Let a functionalist theory of pain (whatever its details) be
instantiated by a system the subassemblies of which are not such
things as C-fibers and reticular systems but telephone lines and
offices staffed by people. Perhaps it is a giant robot controlled by
an army of human beings that inhabit it. When the theory’s
functionally characterized conditions for pain are now met we must
say, if the theory is true, that the robot is in pain. That is, real
pain, as real as our own, would exist in virtue of the perhaps
disinterested and businesslike activities of these bureaucratic teams,
executing their proper functions.
</blockquote>

<p>
In “Troubles with Functionalism”, also published in 1978,
Ned Block envisions the entire population of China implementing the
functions of neurons in the brain. This scenario has subsequently been
called “The Chinese Nation” or “The Chinese
Gym”. We can suppose that every Chinese citizen would be given a
call-list of phone numbers, and at a preset time on implementation
day, designated “input” citizens would initiate the
process by calling those on their call-list. When any citizen’s
phone rang, he or she would then phone those on his or her list, who
would in turn contact yet others. No phone message need be exchanged;
all that is required is the pattern of calling. The call-lists would
be constructed in such a way that the patterns of calls implemented
the same patterns of activation that occur between neurons in
someone’s brain when that person is in a mental state –
pain, for example. The phone calls play the same functional role as
neurons causing one another to fire. Block was primarily interested in
qualia, and in particular, whether it is plausible to hold that the
population of China might collectively be in pain, while no individual
member of the population experienced any pain, but the thought
experiment applies to any mental states and operations, including
understanding language.</p>

<p>
Thus Block’s precursor thought experiment, as with those of
Davis and Dennett, is a system of many humans rather than one. The
focus is on consciousness, but to the extent that Searle’s
argument also involves consciousness, the thought experiment is
closely related to Searle’s. Cole (1984) tries to pump
intuitions in the reverse direction by setting out a thought
experiment in which each of his neurons is itself conscious, and fully
aware of its actions including being doused with neurotransmitters,
undergoing action potentials, and squirting neurotransmitters at its
neighbors. Cole argues that his conscious neurons would find it
implausible that their collective activity produced a consciousness
and other cognitive competences, including understanding English, that
the neurons lack. Cole suggests the intuitions of implementing systems
are not to be trusted. </p>

<h2 id="ChinRoomArgu">3. The Chinese Room Argument</h2>

<p>
In 1980 John Searle published “Minds, Brains and Programs”
in the journal <em>The Behavioral and Brain Sciences</em>. In this
article, Searle sets out the argument, and then replies to the
half-dozen main objections that had been raised during his earlier
presentations at various university campuses (see next section). In
addition, Searle’s article in <em>BBS</em> was published along
with comments and criticisms by 27 cognitive science researchers.
These 27 comments were followed by Searle’s replies to his
critics.</p>

<p>
In the decades following its publication, the Chinese Room argument
was the subject of very many discussions. By 1984, Searle presented
the Chinese Room argument in a book, <em>Minds, Brains and
Science.</em> In January 1990, the popular periodical <em>Scientific
American</em> took the debate to a general scientific audience. Searle
included the Chinese Room Argument in his contribution, “Is the
Brain’s Mind a Computer Program?”, and Searle’s
piece was followed by a responding article, “Could a Machine
Think?”, written by philosophers Paul and Patricia Churchland.
Soon thereafter Searle had a published exchange about the Chinese Room
with another leading philosopher, Jerry Fodor (in Rosenthal (ed.)
1991).</p>

<p>
The heart of the argument is Searle imagining himself following an
symbol processing program written in English (which is what Turing
called “a paper machine”). The English speaker (Searle)
sitting in the room follows English instructions for manipulating
Chinese symbols, whereas a computer “follows” (in some
sense) a program written in a computing language. The human produces
the appearance of understanding Chinese by following the symbol
manipulating instructions, but does not thereby come to understand
Chinese. Since a computer just does what the human does –
manipulate symbols on the basis of their syntax alone – no
computer, merely by following a program, comes to genuinely understand
Chinese.</p>

<p>
This narrow argument, based closely on the Chinese Room scenario, is
specifically directed at a position Searle calls “Strong
AI”. Strong AI is the view that suitably programmed computers
(or the programs themselves) can understand natural language and
actually have other mental capabilities similar to the humans whose
behavior they mimic. According to Strong AI, these computers really
play chess intelligently, make clever moves, or understand language.
By contrast, “weak AI” is the much more modest claim that
computers are merely useful in psychology, linguistics, and other
areas, in part because they can simulate mental abilities. But weak AI
makes no claim that computers actually understand or are intelligent.
The Chinese Room argument is not directed at weak AI, nor does it
purport to show that no machine can think – Searle says that
brains are machines, and brains think. The argument is directed at the
view that formal computations on symbols can produce thought.</p>

<p>
We might summarize the narrow argument as a <em>reductio ad
absurdum</em> against Strong AI as follows. Let L be a natural
language, and let us say that a “program for L” is a
program for conversing fluently in L. A computing system is any
system, human or otherwise, that can run a program.</p>

<ol>

<li>If Strong AI is true, then there is a program for Chinese such
that if any computing system runs that program, that system thereby
comes to understand Chinese.</li>

<li>I could run a program for Chinese without thereby coming to
understand Chinese.</li>

<li>Therefore Strong AI is false.</li>
</ol>

<p>
The first premise elucidates the claim of Strong AI. The second
premise is supported by the Chinese Room thought experiment. The
conclusion of this narrow argument is that running a program cannot
endow the system with language understanding. (There are other ways of
understanding the structure of the argument. It may be relevant to
understand some of the claims as counterfactual: e.g. “there is
a program” in premise 1 as meaning there could be a program,
etc. On this construal the argument involves modal logic, the logic of
possibility and necessity (see Damper 2006 and Shaffer 2009)). </p>

<p>
It is also worth noting that the first premise above attributes
understanding to “the system”. Exactly what Strong-AI
supposes will acquire understanding when the program runs is crucial
to the success or failure of the CRA. Schank 1978 has a title that
claims their group’s computer, a physical device, understands,
but in the body of the paper he claims that the program
[“SAM”] is doing the understanding: SAM, Schank says
“...understands stories about domains about which it has
knowledge” (p. 133). As we will see in the next section (4),
these issues about the identity of the understander (the cpu? the
program? the system? something else?) quickly came to the fore for
critics of the CRA. Searle’s wider argument includes the claim
that the thought experiment shows more generally that one cannot get
semantics (meaning) from syntax (formal symbol manipulation). That and
related issues are discussed in section 5: The Larger Philosophical
Issues.</p>

<h2 id="ReplChinRoomArgu">4. Replies to the Chinese Room Argument</h2>

<p>
Criticisms of the narrow Chinese Room argument against Strong AI have
often followed three main lines, which can be distinguished by how
much they concede:</p>

<p>
(1) Some critics concede that the man in the room doesn’t
understand Chinese, but hold that nevertheless running the program may
create comprehension of Chinese by something other than the room
operator. These critics object to the inference from the claim that
the <i>man</i> in the room does not understand Chinese to the
conclusion that <i>no understanding</i> has been created. There might
be understanding by a larger, smaller, or different, entity. This is
the strategy of The Systems Reply and the Virtual Mind Reply. These
replies hold that the output of the room might reflect real
understanding of Chinese, but the understanding would not be that of
the room operator. Thus Searle’s claim that he doesn’t
understand Chinese while running the room is conceded, but his claim
that there is no understanding of the questions in Chinese, and that
computationalism is false, is denied.</p>

<p>
(2) Other critics concede Searle’s claim that just running a
natural language processing program as described in the CR scenario
does not create any understanding, whether by a human or a computer
system. But these critics hold that a <em>variation</em> on the
computer system could understand. The variant might be a computer
embedded in a robotic body, having interaction with the physical world
via sensors and motors (“The Robot Reply”), or it might be
a system that simulated the detailed operation of an entire human
brain, neuron by neuron (“the Brain Simulator Reply”).
</p>

<p>
(3) Finally, some critics do not concede even the narrow point against
AI. These critics hold that the man in the original Chinese Room
scenario might understand Chinese, despite Searle’s denials, or
that the scenario is impossible. For example, critics have argued that
our intuitions in such cases are unreliable. Other critics have held
that it all depends on what one means by “understand”
– points discussed in the section on The Intuition Reply. Others
(e.g. Sprevak 2007) object to the assumption that any system (e.g.
Searle in the room) can run any computer program. And finally some
have argued that if it is not reasonable to attribute understanding on
the basis of the behavior exhibited by the Chinese Room, then it would
not be reasonable to attribute understanding to humans on the basis of
similar behavioral evidence (Searle calls this last the “Other
Minds Reply”). The objection is that we should be willing to
attribute understanding in the Chinese Room on the basis of the overt
behavior, just as we do with other humans (and some animals), and as
we would do with extra-terrestrial Aliens (or burning bushes or
angels) that spoke our language. This position is close to
Turing’s own, when he proposed his behavioral test for machine
intelligence.</p>

<p>
In addition to these responses specifically to the Chinese Room
scenario and the narrow argument to be discussed here, some critics
also independently argue against Searle’s larger claim, and hold
that one can get semantics (that is, meaning) from syntactic symbol
manipulation, including the sort that takes place inside a digital
computer, a question discussed in the section below on Syntax and
Semantics.</p>

<h3 id="SystRepl">4.1 The Systems Reply</h3>

<p>
In the original BBS article, Searle identified and discussed several
responses to the argument that he had come across in giving the
argument in talks at various places. As a result, these early
responses have received the most attention in subsequent discussion.
What Searle 1980 calls “perhaps the most common reply” is
the Systems Reply.</p>

<p>
The Systems Reply (which Searle says was originally associated with
Yale, the home of Schank’s AI work) concedes that the man in the
room does not understand Chinese. But, the reply continues, the man is
but a part, a central processing unit (CPU), in a larger system. The
larger system includes the huge database, the memory (scratchpads)
containing intermediate states, and the instructions – the
complete system that is required for answering the Chinese questions.
So the Sytems Reply is that while the man running the program does not
understand Chinese, the system as a whole does.</p>

<p>
Ned Block was one of the first to press the Systems Reply, along with
many others including Jack Copeland, Daniel Dennett, Douglas
Hofstadter, Jerry Fodor, John Haugeland, Ray Kurzweil and Georges Rey.
Rey (1986) says the person in the room is just the CPU of the system.
Kurzweil (2002) says that the human being is just an implementer and
of no significance (presumably meaning that the properties of the
implementer are not necessarily those of the system). Kurzweil hews to
the spirit of the Turing Test and holds that if the system displays
the apparent capacity to understand Chinese “it would have to,
indeed, understand Chinese” – Searle is contradicting
himself in saying in effect, “the machine speaks Chinese but
doesn’t understand Chinese”.</p>

<p>
Margaret Boden (1988) raises levels considerations.
“Computational psychology does not credit the brain with seeing
bean-sprouts or understanding English: intentional states such as
these are properties of people, not of brains” (244). “In
short, Searle’s description of the robot’s pseudo-brain
(that is, of Searle-in-the-robot) as understanding English involves a
category-mistake comparable to treating the brain as the bearer, as
opposed to the causal basis, of intelligence”. Boden (1988)
points out that the room operator is a conscious agent, while the CPU
in a computer is not – the Chinese Room scenario asks us to take
the perspective of the implementer, and not surprisingly fails to see
the larger picture.</p>

<p>
Searle’s response to the Systems Reply is simple: in principle,
he could internalize the entire system, memorizing all the
instructions and the database, and doing all the calculations in his
head. He could then leave the room and wander outdoors, perhaps even
conversing in Chinese. But he still would have no way to attach
“any meaning to the formal symbols”. The man would now
<em>be</em> the entire system, yet he still would not understand
Chinese. For example, he would not know the meaning of the Chinese
word for hamburger. He still cannot get semantics from syntax. </p>

<p>
In some ways Searle’s response here anticipates later extended
mind views (e.g. Clark and Chalmers 1998): if Otto, who suffers loss
of memory, can regain those recall abilities by externalizing some of
the information to his notebooks, then Searle arguably can do the
reverse: by internalizing the instructions and notebooks he should
acquire any abilities had by the extended system. And so Searle in
effect concludes that since he doesn’t acquire understanding of
Chinese by internalizing the external components of the entire system
(e.g. he still doesn’t know what the Chinese word for hamburger
means), understanding was never there in the partially externalized
system of the original Chinese Room.</p>

<p>
In his 2002 paper “The Chinese Room from a Logical Point of
View”, Jack Copeland considers Searle’s response to the
Systems Reply and argues that a homunculus inside Searle’s head
might understand even though the room operator himself does not, just
as modules in minds solve tensor equations that enable us to catch
cricket balls. Copeland then turns to consider the Chinese Gym, and
again appears to endorse the Systems Reply: “…the
individual players [do not] understand Chinese. But there is no
entailment from this to the claim that the simulation as a whole does
not come to understand Chinese. The fallacy involved in moving from
part to whole is even more glaring here than in the original version
of the Chinese Room Argument”. Copeland denies that
connectionism implies that a room of people can simulate the
brain.</p>

<p>
John Haugeland writes (2002) that Searle’s response to the
Systems Reply is flawed: “…what he now asks is what it
would be like if he, in his own mind, were consciously to implement
the underlying formal structures and operations that the theory says
are sufficient to implement another mind”. According to
Haugeland, his failure to understand Chinese is irrelevant: he is just
the implementer. The larger system implemented would understand
– there is a level-of-description fallacy.</p>

<p>
Shaffer 2009 examines modal aspects of the logic of the CRA and argues
that familiar versions of the System Reply are question-begging. But,
Shaffer claims, a modalized version of the System Reply succeeds
because there are possible worlds in which understanding is an
emergent property of complex syntax manipulation. Nute 2011 is a reply
to Shaffer.</p>

<p>
Stevan Harnad has defended Searle’s argument against Systems
Reply critics in two papers. In his 1989 paper, Harnad writes
“Searle formulates the problem as follows: Is the mind a
computer program? Or, more specifically, if a computer program
simulates or imitates activities of ours that seem to require
understanding (such as communicating in language), can the program
itself be said to understand in so doing?” (Note the specific
claim: the issue is taken to be whether the program itself
understands.) Harnad concludes: “On the face of it, [the CR
argument] looks valid. It certainly works against the most common
rejoinder, the ‘Systems Reply’….” Harnad
appears to follow Searle in linking understanding and states of
consciousness: Harnad 2012 (Other Internet Resources) argues that
Searle shows that the core problem of conscious “feeling”
requires sensory connections to the real world. (See sections below
“The Robot Reply” and “Intentionality” for
discussion.)</p>

<p>
Finally some have argued that even if the room operator memorizes the
rules and does all the operations inside his head, the room operator
does not become the system. Cole (1984) and Block (1998) both argue
that the result would not be identity of Searle with the system but
much more like a case of multiple personality – distinct persons
in a single head. The Chinese responding system would not be Searle,
but a sub-part of him. In the CR case, one person (Searle) is an
English monoglot and the other is a Chinese monoglot. The
English-speaking person’s total unawareness of the meaning of
the Chinese responses does not show that they are not understood. This
line, of distinct persons, leads to the Virtual Mind Reply. </p>

<h4>4.1.1 The Virtual Mind Reply</h4>

<p>
The Virtual Mind reply concedes, as does the System Reply, that the
operator of the Chinese Room does not understand Chinese merely by
running the paper machine. However the Virtual Mind reply holds that
what is important is whether understanding is created, not whether the
Room operator is the agent that understands. Unlike the Systems Reply,
the Virtual Mind reply (VMR) holds that a running system may create
new, virtual, entities that are distinct from both the system as a
whole, as well as from the sub-systems such as the CPU or operator. In
particular, a running system might create a distinct agent that
understands Chinese. This virtual agent would be distinct from both
the room operator and the entire system. The psychological traits,
including linguistic abilities, of any mind created by artificial
intelligence will depend entirely upon the program and the Chinese
database, and will not be identical with the psychological traits and
abilities of a CPU or the operator of a paper machine, such as Searle
in the Chinese Room scenario. According to the VMR the mistake in the
Chinese Room Argument is to make the claim of strong AI to be
“the computer understands Chinese” or “the System
understands Chinese”. The claim at issue for AI should simply be
whether “the running computer creates understanding of
Chinese”.</p>

<p>
A familiar model of virtual agents are characters in computer or video
games, and personal digital assistants, such as Apple’s Siri and
Microsoft’s Cortana. These characters have various abilities and
personalities, and the characters are not identical with the system
hardware or program that creates them. A single running system might
control two distinct agents, or physical robots, simultaneously, one
of which converses only in Chinese and one of which can converse only
in English, and which otherwise manifest very different personalities,
memories, and cognitive abilities. Thus the VM reply asks us to
distinguish between minds and their realizing systems. </p>

<p>
Minsky (1980) and Sloman and Croucher (1980) suggested a Virtual Mind
reply when the Chinese Room argument first appeared. In his
widely-read 1989 paper “Computation and Consciousness”,
Tim Maudlin considers minimal physical systems that might implement a
computational system running a program. His discussion revolves around
his imaginary Olympia machine, a system of buckets that transfers
water, implementing a Turing machine. Maudlin’s main target is
the computationalists’ claim that such a machine could have
phenomenal consciousness. However in the course of his discussion,
Maudlin considers the Chinese Room argument. Maudlin (citing Minsky,
and Sloman and Croucher) points out a Virtual Mind reply that the
agent that understands could be distinct from the physical system
(414). Thus “Searle has done nothing to discount the possibility
of simultaneously existing disjoint mentalities”
(414–5).</p>

<p>
Perlis (1992), Chalmers (1996) and Block (2002) have apparently
endorsed versions of a Virtual Mind reply as well, as has Richard
Hanley in <em>The Metaphysics of Star Trek</em> (1997). Penrose (2002)
is a critic of this strategy, and Stevan Harnad scornfully dismisses
such heroic resorts to metaphysics. Harnad defended Searle’s
position in a “Virtual Symposium on Virtual Minds” (1992)
against Patrick Hayes and Don Perlis. Perlis pressed a virtual minds
argument derived, he says, from Maudlin. Chalmers (1996) notes that
the room operator is just a causal facilitator, a “demon”,
so that his states of consciousness are irrelevant to the properties
of the system as a whole. Like Maudlin, Chalmers raises issues of
personal identity – we might regard the Chinese Room as
“two mental systems realized within the same physical space. The
organization that gives rise to the Chinese experiences is quite
distinct from the organization that gives rise to the demon’s [=
room operator’s] experiences”(326).</p>

<p>
Cole (1991, 1994) develops the reply and argues as follows:
Searle’s argument requires that the agent of understanding be
the computer itself or, in the Chinese Room parallel, the person in
the room. However Searle’s failure to understand Chinese in the
room does not show that there is no understanding being created. One
of the key considerations is that in Searle’s discussion the
actual conversation with the Chinese Room is always seriously under
specified. Searle was considering Schank’s programs, which can
only respond to a few questions about what happened in a restaurant,
all in third person. But Searle wishes his conclusions to apply to any
AI-produced responses, including those that would pass the toughest
unrestricted Turing Test, i.e. they would be just the sort of
conversations real people have with each other. If we flesh out the
conversation in the original CR scenario to include questions in
Chinese such as “How tall are you?”, “Where do you
live?”, “What did you have for breakfast?”,
“What is your attitude toward Mao?”, and so forth, it
immediately becomes clear that the answers in Chinese are not
<i>Searle’s</i> answers. Searle is not the author of the
answers, and his beliefs and desires, memories and personality traits
(apart from his industriousness!) are not reflected in the answers and
in general Searle’s traits are causally inert in producing the
answers to the Chinese questions. This suggests the following
conditional is true: if there is understanding of Chinese created by
running the program, the mind understanding the Chinese would not be
the computer, whether the computer is human or electronic. The person
understanding the Chinese would be a distinct person from the room
operator, with beliefs and desires bestowed by the program and its
database. Hence Searle’s failure to understand Chinese while
operating the room does not show that understanding is not being
created. </p>

<p>
Cole (1991) offers an additional argument that the mind doing the
understanding is neither the mind of the room operator nor the system
consisting of the operator and the program: running a suitably
structured computer program might produce answers submitted in Chinese
and also answers to questions submitted in Korean. Yet the Chinese
answers might apparently display completely different knowledge and
memories, beliefs and desires than the answers to the Korean questions
– along with a denial that the Chinese answerer knows any
Korean, and vice versa. Thus the behavioral evidence would be that
there were two non-identical minds (one understanding Chinese only,
and one understanding Korean only). Since these might have mutually
exclusive properties, they cannot be identical, and ipso facto, cannot
be identical with the mind of the implementer in the room.
Analogously, a video game might include a character with one set of
cognitive abilities (smart, understands Chinese) as well as another
character with an incompatible set (stupid, English monoglot). These
inconsistent cognitive traits cannot be traits of the XBOX system that
realizes them. Cole argues that the implication is that minds
generally are more abstract than the systems that realize them (see
Mind and Body in the Larger Philosophical Issues section).</p>

<p>
In short, the Virtual Mind argument is that since the evidence that
Searle provides that there is no understanding of Chinese was that
<em>he</em> wouldn’t understand Chinese in the room, the Chinese
Room Argument cannot refute a differently formulated equally strong AI
claim, asserting the possibility of creating understanding using a
programmed digital computer. Maudlin (1989) says that Searle has not
adequately responded to this criticism.</p>

<p>
Others however have replied to the VMR, including Stevan Harnad and
mathematical physicist Roger Penrose. Penrose is generally sympathetic
to the points Searle raises with the Chinese Room argument, and has
argued against the Virtual Mind reply. Penrose does not believe that
computational processes can account for consciousness, both on Chinese
Room grounds, as well as because of limitations on formal systems
revealed by Kurt Gödel’s incompleteness proof. (Penrose has
two books on mind and consciousness; Chalmers and others have
responded to Penrose’s appeals to Gödel.) In his 2002
article “Consciousness, Computation, and the Chinese Room”
that specifically addresses the Chinese Room argument, Penrose argues
that the Chinese Gym variation – with a room expanded to the
size of India, with Indians doing the processing – shows it is
very implausible to hold there is “some kind of disembodied
‘understanding’ associated with the person’s
carrying out of that algorithm, and whose presence does not impinge in
any way upon his own consciousness” (230–1). Penrose
concludes the Chinese Room argument refutes Strong AI. Christian
Kaernbach (2005) reports that he subjected the virtual mind theory to
an empirical test, with negative results.</p>

<h3 id="RoboRepl">4.2 The Robot Reply</h3>

<p>
The Robot Reply concedes Searle is right about the Chinese Room
scenario: it shows that a computer trapped in a computer room cannot
understand language, or know what words mean. The Robot reply is
responsive to the problem of knowing the meaning of the Chinese word
for hamburger – Searle’s example of something the room
operator would not know. It seems reasonable to hold that most of us
know what a hamburger is because we have seen one, and perhaps even
made one, or tasted one, or at least heard people talk about
hamburgers and understood what they are by relating them to things we
do know by seeing, making, and tasting. Given this is how one might
come to know what hamburgers are, the Robot Reply suggests that we put
a digital computer in a robot body, with sensors, such as video
cameras and microphones, and add effectors, such as wheels to move
around with, and arms with which to manipulate things in the world.
Such a robot – a computer with a body – might do what a
child does, learn by seeing and doing. The Robot Reply holds that such
a digital computer in a robot body, freed from the room, could attach
meanings to symbols and actually understand natural language. Margaret
Boden, Tim Crane, Daniel Dennett, Jerry Fodor, Stevan Harnad, Hans
Moravec and Georges Rey are among those who have endorsed versions of
this reply at one time or another. The Robot Reply in effect appeals
to “wide content” or “externalist semantics”.
This can agree with Searle that syntax and internal connections in
isolation from the world are insufficient for semantics, while holding
that suitable causal connections with the world can provide content to
the internal symbols. </p>

<p>
About the time Searle was pressing the CRA, many in philosophy of
language and mind were recognizing the importance of causal
connections to the world as the source of meaning or reference for
words and concepts. Hilary Putnam 1981 argued that a Brain in a Vat,
isolated from the world, might speak or think in a language that
sounded like English, but it would not be English – hence a
brain in a vat could not wonder if it was a brain in a vat (because of
its sensory isolation, its words “brain” and
“vat” do not refer to brains or vats). The view that
meaning was determined by connections with the world became
widespread. Searle resisted this turn outward and continued to think
of meaning as subjective and connected with consciousness. </p>

<p>
A related view that minds are best understood as embodied or embedded
in the world has gained many supporters since the 1990s, contra
Cartesian solipsistic intuitions. Organisms rely on environmental
features for the success of their behavior. So whether one takes a
mind to be a symbol processing system, with the symbols getting their
content from sensory connections with the world, or a non-symbolic
system that succeeds by being embedded in a particular environment,
the important of things outside the head have come to the fore. Hence
many are sympathetic to some form of the Robot Reply: a computational
system might understand, provided it is acting in the world. E.g
Carter 2007 in a textbook on philosophy and AI concludes “The
lesson to draw from the Chinese Room thought experiment is that
embodied experience is necessary for the development of
semantics.” </p>

<p>
However Searle does not think that the Robot Reply to the Chinese Room
argument is any stronger than the Systems Reply. All the sensors can
do is provide additional input to the computer – and it will be
just syntactic input. We can see this by making a parallel change to
the Chinese Room scenario. Suppose the man in the Chinese Room
receives, in addition to the Chinese characters slipped under the
door, a stream of binary digits that appear, say, on a ticker tape in
a corner of the room. The instruction books are augmented to use the
numerals from the tape as input, along with the Chinese characters.
Unbeknownst to the man in the room, the symbols on the tape are the
digitized output of a video camera (and possibly other sensors).
Searle argues that additional syntactic inputs will do nothing to
allow the man to associate meanings with the Chinese characters. It is
just more work for the man in the room.</p>

<p>
Jerry Fodor, Hilary Putnam, and David Lewis, were principle architects
of the computational theory of mind that Searle’s wider argument
attacks. In his original 1980 reply to Searle, Fodor allows Searle is
certainly right that “instantiating the same program as the
brain does is not, in and of itself, sufficient for having those
propositional attitudes characteristic of the organism that has the
brain.” But Fodor holds that Searle is wrong about the robot
reply. A computer might have propositional attitudes if it has the
right causal connections to the world – but those are not ones
mediated by a man sitting in the head of the robot. We don’t
know what the right causal connections are. Searle commits the fallacy
of inferring from “the little man is not the right causal
connection” to conclude that no causal linkage would succeed.
There is considerable empirical evidence that mental processes involve
“manipulation of symbols”; Searle gives us no alternative
explanation (this is sometimes called Fodor’s “Only Game
in Town” argument for computational approaches). In the 1980s
and 1990s Fodor wrote extensively on what the connections must be
between a brain state and the world for the state to have intentional
(representational) properties, while also emphasizing that
computationalism has limits because the computations are intrinsically
local and so cannot account for abductive reasoning.</p>

<p>
In a later piece, “Yin and Yang in the Chinese Room” (in
Rosenthal 1991 pp.524–525), Fodor substantially revises his 1980
view. He distances himself from his earlier version of the robot
reply, and holds instead that “instantiation” should be
defined in such a way that the symbol must be the proximate cause of
the effect – no intervening guys in a room. So Searle in the
room is not an instantiation of a Turing Machine, and
“Searle’s setup does not instantiate the machine that the
brain instantiates.” He concludes: “…Searle’s
setup is irrelevant to the claim that strong equivalence to a Chinese
speaker’s brain is ipso facto sufficient for speaking
Chinese.” Searle says of Fodor’s move, “Of all the
zillions of criticisms of the Chinese Room argument, Fodor’s is
perhaps the most desperate. He claims that precisely because the man
in the Chinese room sets out to implement the steps in the computer
program, he is not implementing the steps in the computer program. He
offers no argument for this extraordinary claim.” (in Rosenthal
1991, p. 525)</p>

<p>
In a 1986 paper, Georges Rey advocated a combination of the system and
robot reply, after noting that the original Turing Test is
insufficient as a test of intelligence and understanding, and that the
isolated system Searle describes in the room is certainly not
functionally equivalent to a real Chinese speaker sensing and acting
in the world. In a 2002 second look, “Searle’s
Misunderstandings of Functionalism and Strong AI”, Rey again
defends functionalism against Searle, and in the particular form Rey
calls the “computational-representational theory of thought
– CRTT”. CRTT is not committed to attributing thought to
just any system that passes the Turing Test (like the Chinese Room).
Nor is it committed to a conversation manual model of understanding
natural language. Rather, CRTT is concerned with intentionality,
natural and artificial (the representations in the system are
semantically evaluable – they are true or false, hence have
aboutness). Searle saddles functionalism with the
“blackbox” character of behaviorism, but functionalism
cares how things are done. Rey sketches “a modest mind”
– a CRTT system that has perception, can make deductive and
inductive inferences, makes decisions on basis of goals and
representations of how the world is, and can process natural language
by converting to and from its native representations. To explain the
behavior of such a system we would need to use the same attributions
needed to explain the behavior of a normal Chinese speaker.</p>

<p>
If we flesh out the Chinese conversation in the context of the Robot
Reply, we may again see evidence that the entity that understands is
not the operator inside the room. Suppose we ask the robot system
Chinese translations of “what do you see?”, we might get
the answer “My old friend Shakey”, or “I see
you!”. Whereas if we phone Searle in the room and ask the same
questions in English we might get “These same four walls”
or “these damn endless instruction books and notebooks.”
Again this is evidence that we have distinct responders here, an
English speaker and a Chinese speaker, who see and do quite different
things. If the giant robot goes on a rampage and smashes much of
Tokyo, and all the while oblivious Searle is just following the
program in his notebooks in the room, Searle is not guilty of homicide
and mayhem, because he is not the agent committing the acts. </p>

<p>
Tim Crane discusses the Chinese Room argument in his 1991 book,
<em>The Mechanical Mind</em>. He cites the Churchlands’ luminous
room analogy, but then goes on to argue that in the course of
operating the room, Searle would learn the meaning of the Chinese:
“…if Searle had not just memorized the rules and the
data, but also started acting in the world of Chinese people, then it
is plausible that he would before too long come to realize what these
symbols mean.”(127). (Rapaport 2006 presses an analogy between
Helen Keller and the Chinese Room.) Crane appears to end with a
version of the Robot Reply: “Searle’s argument itself begs
the question by (in effect) just denying the central thesis of AI
– that thinking is formal symbol manipulation. But
Searle’s assumption, none the less, seems to me correct …
the proper response to Searle’s argument is: sure,
Searle-in-the-room, or the room alone, cannot understand Chinese. But
if you let the outside world have some impact on the room, meaning or
‘semantics’ might begin to get a foothold. But of course,
this concedes that thinking cannot be simply symbol
manipulation.” (129) The idea that learning grounds
understanding has led to work in developmental robotics (a.k.a.
epigenetic robotics). This AI research area seeks to replicate key
human learning abilities, such as robots that are shown an object from
several angles while being told in natural language the name of the
object. </p>

<p>
Margaret Boden 1988 also argues that Searle mistakenly supposes
programs are pure syntax. But programs bring about the activity of
certain machines: “The inherent procedural consequences of any
computer program give it a toehold in semantics, where the semantics
in question is not denotational, but causal.” (250) Thus a robot
might have causal powers that enable it to refer to a hamburger.</p>

<p>
Stevan Harnad also finds important our sensory and motor capabilities:
“Who is to say that the Turing Test, whether conducted in
Chinese or in any other language, could be successfully passed without
operations that draw on our sensory, motor, and other higher cognitive
capacities as well? Where does the capacity to comprehend Chinese
begin and the rest of our mental competence leave off?” Harnad
believes that symbolic functions must be grounded in
“robotic” functions that connect a system with the world.
And he thinks this counts against symbolic accounts of mentality, such
as Jerry Fodor’s, and, one suspects, the approach of Roger
Schank that was Searle’s original target. Harnad 2012 (Other
Internet Resources) argues that the CRA shows that even with a robot
with symbols grounded in the external world, there is still something
missing: feeling, such as the feeling of understanding.</p>

<p>
However Ziemke 2016 argues a robotic embodiment with layered systems
of bodily regulation may ground emotion and meaning, and Seligman 2019
argues that “perceptually grounded” approaches to natural
language processing (NLP) have the “potential to display
intentionality, and thus after all to foster a truly meaningful
semantics that, in the view of Searle and other skeptics, is
intrinsically beyond computers’ capacity.” </p>

<h3 id="BraiSimuRepl">4.3 The Brain Simulator Reply</h3>

<p>
Consider a computer that operates in quite a different manner than the
usual AI program with scripts and operations on sentence-like strings
of symbols. The Brain Simulator reply asks us to suppose instead the
program simulates the actual sequence of nerve firings that occur in
the brain of a native Chinese language speaker when that person
understands Chinese – every nerve, every firing. Since the
computer then works the very same way as the brain of a native Chinese
speaker, processing information in just the same way, it will
understand Chinese. Paul and Patricia Churchland have set out a reply
along these lines, discussed below. </p>

<p>
In response to this, Searle argues that it makes no difference. He
suggests a variation on the brain simulator scenario: suppose that in
the room the man has a huge set of valves and water pipes, in the same
arrangement as the neurons in a native Chinese speaker’s brain.
The program now tells the man which valves to open in response to
input. Searle claims that it is obvious that there would be no
understanding of Chinese. (Note however that the basis for this claim
is no longer simply that Searle himself wouldn’t understand
Chinese – it seems clear that now he is just facilitating the
causal operation of the system and so we rely on our Leibnizian
intuition that water-works don’t understand (see also Maudlin
1989).) Searle concludes that a simulation of brain activity is not
the real thing. </p>

<p>
However, following Pylyshyn 1980, Cole and Foelber 1984, Chalmers
1996, we might wonder about hybrid systems. Pylyshyn writes: </p>

<blockquote>
If more and more of the cells in your brain were to be replaced by
integrated circuit chips, programmed in such a way as to keep the
input-output function each unit identical to that of the unit being
replaced, you would in all likelihood just keep right on speaking
exactly as you are doing now except that you would eventually stop
meaning anything by it. What we outside observers might take to be
words would become for you just certain noises that circuits caused
you to make.
</blockquote>

<p>
These cyborgization thought experiments can be linked to the Chinese
Room. Suppose Otto has a neural disease that causes one of the neurons
in my brain to fail, but surgeons install a tiny remotely controlled
artificial neuron, a synron, along side his disabled neuron. The
control of Otto’s neuron is by John Searle in the Chinese Room,
unbeknownst to both Searle and Otto. Tiny wires connect the artificial
neuron to the synapses on the cell-body of his disabled neuron. When
his artificial neuron is stimulated by neurons that synapse on his
disabled neuron, a light goes on in the Chinese Room. Searle then
manipulates some valves and switches in accord with a program. That,
via the radio link, causes Otto’s artificial neuron to release
neuro-transmitters from its tiny artificial vesicles. If
Searle’s programmed activity causes Otto’s artificial
neuron to behave just as his disabled natural neuron once did, the
behavior of the rest of my nervous system will be unchanged. Alas,
Otto’s disease progresses; more neurons are replaced by synrons
controlled by Searle. Ex hypothesis the rest of the world will not
notice the difference; will Otto? </p>

<p>
Under the rubric “The Combination Reply”, Searle also
considers a system with the features of all three of the preceding: a
robot with a digital brain simulating computer in its cranium, such
that the system as a whole behaves indistinguishably from a human.
Since the normal input to the brain is from sense organs, it is
natural to suppose that most advocates of the Brain Simulator Reply
have in mind such a combination of brain simulation, Robot, and
Systems Reply. Some (e.g. Rey 1986) argue it is reasonable to
attribute intentionality to such a system as a whole. Searle agrees
that it would indeed be reasonable to attribute understanding to such
an android system – but only as long as you don’t know how
it works. As soon as you know the truth – it is a computer,
uncomprehendingly manipulating symbols on the basis of syntax, not
meaning – you would cease to attribute intentionality to it.</p>

<p>
(One assumes this would be true even if it were one’s spouse,
with whom one had built a life-long relationship, that was revealed to
hide a silicon secret. Science fiction stories, including episodes of
Rod Serling’s television series <em>The Twilight Zone</em>, have
been based on such possibilities (the face of the beloved peels away
to reveal the awful android truth); however, Steven Pinker (1997)
mentions one episode in which the android’s secret was known
from the start, but the protagonist developed a romantic relationship
with the android.)</p>

<p>
On its tenth anniversary the Chinese Room argument was featured in the
general science periodical <em>Scientific American</em>. Leading the
opposition to Searle’s lead article in that issue were
philosophers Paul and Patricia Churchland. The Churchlands agree with
Searle that the Chinese Room does not understand Chinese, but hold
that the argument itself exploits our ignorance of cognitive and
semantic phenomena. They raise a parallel case of “The Luminous
Room” where someone waves a magnet and argues that the absence
of resulting visible light shows that Maxwell’s electromagnetic
theory is false. The Churchlands advocate a view of the brain as a
connectionist system, a vector transformer, not a system manipulating
symbols according to structure-sensitive rules. The system in the
Chinese Room uses the wrong computational strategies. Thus they agree
with Searle against traditional AI, but they presumably would endorse
what Searle calls “the Brain Simulator Reply”, arguing
that, as with the Luminous Room, our intuitions fail us when
considering such a complex system, and it is a fallacy to move from
part to whole: “… no neuron in my brain understands
English, although my whole brain does.”</p>

<p>
In his 1991 book, <em>Microcognition</em>. Andy Clark holds that
Searle is right that a computer running Schank’s program does
not know anything about restaurants, “at least if by
‘know’ we mean anything like
‘understand’”. But Searle thinks that this would
apply to any computational model, while Clark, like the Churchlands,
holds that Searle is wrong about connectionist models. Clark’s
interest is thus in the brain-simulator reply. The brain thinks in
virtue of its physical properties. What physical properties of the
brain are important? Clark answers that what is important about brains
are “variable and flexible substructures” which
conventional AI systems lack. But that doesn’t mean
computationalism or functionalism is false. It depends on what level
you take the functional units to be. Clark defends
“microfunctionalism” – one should look to a
fine-grained functional description, e.g. neural net level. Clark
cites William Lycan approvingly contra Block’s absent qualia
objection – yes, there can be absent qualia, if the functional
units are made large. But that does not constitute a refutation of
functionalism generally. So Clark’s views are not unlike the
Churchlands’, conceding that Searle is right about Schank and
symbolic-level processing systems, but holding that he is mistaken
about connectionist systems.</p>

<p>
Similarly Ray Kurzweil (2002) argues that Searle’s argument
could be turned around to show that human brains cannot understand
– the brain succeeds by manipulating neurotransmitter
concentrations and other mechanisms that are in themselves
meaningless. In criticism of Searle’s response to the Brain
Simulator Reply, Kurzweil says: “So if we scale up
Searle’s Chinese Room to be the rather massive
‘room’ it needs to be, who’s to say that the entire
system of a hundred trillion people simulating a Chinese Brain that
knows Chinese isn’t conscious? Certainly, it would be correct to
say that such a system knows Chinese. And we can’t say that it
is not conscious anymore than we can say that about any other process.
We can’t know the subjective experience of another
entity….” </p>

<h3 id="OtheMindRepl">4.4 The Other Minds Reply</h3>

<p>
Related to the preceding is The Other Minds Reply: “How do you
know that other people understand Chinese or anything else? Only by
their behavior. Now the computer can pass the behavioral tests as well
as they can (in principle), so if you are going to attribute cognition
to other people you must in principle also attribute it to
computers.”</p>

<p>
Searle’s (1980) reply to this is very short:</p>

<blockquote>
The problem in this discussion is not about how I know that other
people have cognitive states, but rather what it is that I am
attributing to them when I attribute cognitive states to them. The
thrust of the argument is that it couldn’t be just computational
processes and their output because the computational processes and
their output can exist without the cognitive state. It is no answer to
this argument to feign anesthesia. In ‘cognitive sciences’
one presupposes the reality and knowability of the mental in the same
way that in physical sciences one has to presuppose the reality and
knowability of physical objects.
</blockquote>

<p>
Critics hold that if the evidence we have that humans understand is
the same as the evidence we might have that a visiting
extra-terrestrial alien understands, which is the same as the evidence
that a robot understands, the presuppositions we may make in the case
of our own species are not relevant, for presuppositions are sometimes
false. For similar reasons, Turing, in proposing the Turing Test, is
specifically worried about our presuppositions and chauvinism. If the
reasons for the presuppositions regarding humans are pragmatic, in
that they enable us to predict the behavior of humans and to interact
effectively with them, perhaps the presupposition could apply equally
to computers (similar considerations are pressed by Dennett, in his
discussions of what he calls the Intentional Stance).</p>

<p>
Searle raises the question of just what we are attributing in
attributing understanding to other minds, saying that it is more than
complex behavioral dispositions. For Searle the additional seems to be
certain states of consciousness, as is seen in his 2010 summary of the
CRA conclusions. Terry Horgan (2013) endorses this claim: “the
real moral of Searle’s Chinese room thought experiment is that
genuine original intentionality requires the presence of internal
states with intrinsic phenomenal character that is inherently
intentional…” But this tying of understanding to
phenomenal consciousness raises a host of issues. </p>

<p>
We attribute limited understanding of language to toddlers, dogs, and
other animals, but it is not clear that we are ipso facto attributing
unseen states of subjective consciousness – what do we know of
the hidden states of exotic creatures? Ludwig Wittgenstein (the
Private Language Argument) and his followers pressed similar points.
Altered qualia possibilities, analogous to the inverted spectrum,
arise: suppose I ask “what’s the sum of 5 and 7” and
you respond “the sum of 5 and 7 is 12”, but as you heard
my question you had the conscious experience of hearing and
understanding “what is the sum of 10 and 14”, though you
were in the computational states appropriate for producing the correct
sum and so said “12”. Are there certain conscious states
that are “correct” for certain functional states?
Wittgenstein’s considerations appear to be that the subjective
state is irrelevant, at best epiphenomenal, if a language user
displays appropriate linguistic behavior. Afterall, we are taught
language on the basis of our overt responses, not our qualia. The
mathematical savant Daniel Tammet reports that when he generates the
decimal expansion of pi to thousands of digits he experiences colors
that reveal the next digit, but even here it may be that
Tennant’s performance is likely not produced by the colors he
experiences, but rather by unconscious neural computation. The
possible importance of subjective states is further considered in the
section on Intentionality, below. </p>

<p>
In the 30 years since the CRA there has been philosophical interest in
zombies – creatures that look like and behave just as normal
humans, including linguistic behavior, yet have no subjective
consciousness. A difficulty for claiming that subjective states of
consciousness are crucial for understanding meaning will arise in
these cases of absent qualia: we can’t tell the difference
between zombies and non-zombies, and so on Searle’s account we
can’t tell the difference between those that really understand
English and those that don’t. And if you and I can’t tell
the difference between those who understand language and Zombies who
behave like they do but don’t really, than neither can any
selection factor in the history of human evolution – to
predators, prey, and mates, zombies and true understanders, with the
“right” conscious experience, have been indistinguishable.
But then there appears to be a distinction without a difference. In
any case, Searle’s short reply to the Other Minds Reply may be
too short. </p>

<p>
Descartes famously argued that speech was sufficient for attributing
minds and consciousness to others, and infamously argued that it was
necessary. Turing was in effect endorsing Descartes’ sufficiency
condition, at least for intelligence, while substituting written for
oral linguistic behavior. Since most of us use dialog as a sufficient
condition for attributing understanding, Searle’s argument,
which holds that speech is a sufficient condition for attributing
understanding to humans but not for anything that doesn’t share
our biology, an account would appear to be required of what
additionally is being attributed, and what can justify the additional
attribution. Further, if being con-specific is key on Searle’s
account, a natural question arises as to what circumstances would
justify us in attributing understanding (or consciousness) to
extra-terrestrial aliens who do not share our biology? Offending
ET’s by withholding attributions of understanding until after
doing a post-mortem may be risky.</p>

<p>
Hans Moravec, director of the Robotics laboratory at Carnegie Mellon
University, and author of <em>Robot: Mere Machine to Transcendent
Mind,</em> argues that Searle’s position merely reflects
intuitions from traditional philosophy of mind that are out of step
with the new cognitive science. Moravec endorses a version of the
Other Minds reply. It makes sense to attribute intentionality to
machines for the same reasons it makes sense to attribute them to
humans; his “interpretative position” is similar to the
views of Daniel Dennett. Moravec goes on to note that one of the
things we attribute to others is the ability to make attributions of
intentionality, and then we make such attributions to ourselves. It is
such self-representation that is at the heart of consciousness. These
capacities appear to be implementation independent, and hence possible
for aliens and suitably programmed computers.</p>

<p>
As we have seen, the reason that Searle thinks we can disregard the
evidence in the case of robots and computers is that we know that
their processing is syntactic, and this fact trumps all other
considerations. Indeed, Searle believes this is the larger point that
the Chinese Room merely illustrates. This larger point is addressed in
the Syntax and Semantics section below.</p>

<h3 id="IntuRepl">4.5 The Intuition Reply</h3>

<p>
Many responses to the Chinese Room argument have noted that, as with
Leibniz’ Mill, the argument appears to be based on intuition:
the intuition that a computer (or the man in the room) cannot think or
have understanding. For example, Ned Block (1980) in his original BBS
commentary says “Searle’s argument depends for its force
on intuitions that certain entities do not think.” But, Block
argues, (1) intuitions sometimes can and should be trumped and (2)
perhaps we need to bring our concept of understanding in line with a
reality in which certain computer robots belong to the same natural
kind as humans. Similarly Margaret Boden (1988) points out that we
can’t trust our untutored intuitions about how mind depends on
matter; developments in science may change our intuitions. Indeed,
elimination of bias in our intuitions was precisely what motivated
Turing (1950) to propose the Turing Test, a test that was blind to the
physical character of the system replying to questions. Some of
Searle’s critics in effect argue that he has merely pushed the
reliance on intuition back, into the room.</p>

<p>
For example, one can hold that despite Searle’s intuition that
he would not understand Chinese while in the room, perhaps he is
mistaken and does, albeit unconsciously. Hauser (2002) accuses Searle
of Cartesian bias in his inference from “it seems to me quite
obvious that I understand nothing” to the conclusion that I
really understand nothing. Normally, if one understands English or
Chinese, one knows that one does – but not necessarily. Searle
lacks the normal introspective awareness of understanding – but
this, while abnormal, is not conclusive. </p>

<p>
Critics of the CRA note that our intuitions about intelligence,
understanding and meaning may all be unreliable. With regard to
meaning, Wakefield 2003, following Block 1998, defends what Wakefield
calls “the essentialist objection” to the CRA, namely that
a computational account of meaning is not analysis of ordinary
concepts and their related intuitions. Rather we are building a
scientific theory of meaning that may require revising our intuitions.
As a theory, it gets its evidence from its explanatory power, not its
accord with pre-theoretic intuitions (however Wakefield himself argues
that computational accounts of meaning are afflicted by a pernicious
indeterminacy (pp. 308ff)). </p>

<p>
Other critics focusing on the role of intuitions in the CRA argue that
our intuitions regarding both intelligence and understanding may also
be unreliable, and perhaps incompatible even with current science.
With regard to understanding, Steven Pinker, in <em>How the Mind
Works</em> (1997), holds that “… Searle is merely
exploring facts about the English word <em>understand</em>….
People are reluctant to use the word unless certain stereotypical
conditions apply…” But, Pinker claims, nothing
scientifically speaking is at stake. Pinker objects to Searle’s
appeal to the “causal powers of the brain” by noting that
the apparent locus of the causal powers is the “patterns of
interconnectivity that carry out the right information
processing”. Pinker ends his discussion by citing a science
fiction story in which Aliens, anatomically quite unlike humans,
cannot believe that humans think when they discover that our heads are
filled with meat. The Aliens’ intuitions are unreliable –
presumably ours may be so as well.</p>

<p>
Clearly the CRA turns on what is required to understand language.
Schank 1978 clarifies his claim about what he thinks his programs can
do: “By ‘understand’, we mean SAM [one of his
programs] can create a linked causal chain of conceptualizations that
represent what took place in each story.” This is a nuanced
understanding of “understanding”, whereas the Chinese Room
thought experiment does not turn on a technical understanding of
“understanding”, but rather intuitions about our ordinary
competence when we understand a word like “hamburger”.
Indeed by 2015 Schank distances himself from weak senses of
“understand”, holding that no computer can
“understand when you tell it something”, and that
IBM’s WATSON “doesn’t know what it is saying”.
Schank’s program may get links right, but arguably does not know
what the linked entities are. Whether it does or not depends on what
concepts are, see section 5.1. Furthermore it is possible that when it
comes to attributing understanding of language we have different
standards for different things – more relaxed for dogs and
toddlers. Some things understand a language “un poco”.
Searle (1980)concedes that there are degrees of understanding, but
says that all that matters that there are clear cases of no
understanding, and AI programs are an example: “The computer
understanding is not just (like my understanding of German) partial or
incomplete; it is zero.” </p>

<p>
Some defenders of AI are also concerned with how our understanding of
understanding bears on the Chinese Room argument. In their paper
“A Chinese Room that Understands” AI researchers Simon and
Eisenstadt (2002) argue that whereas Searle refutes “logical
strong AI”, the thesis that a program that passes the Turing
Test will <em>necessarily</em> understand, Searle’s argument
does not impugn “Empirical Strong AI” – the thesis
that it is possible to program a computer that convincingly satisfies
ordinary criteria of understanding. They hold however that it is
impossible to settle these questions “without employing a
definition of the term ‘understand’ that can provide a
test for judging whether the hypothesis is true or false”. They
cite W.V.O. Quine’s <em>Word and Object</em> as showing that
there is always empirical uncertainty in attributing understanding to
humans. The Chinese Room is a Clever Hans trick (Clever Hans was a
horse who appeared to clomp out the answers to simple arithmetic
questions, but it was discovered that Hans could detect unconscious
cues from his trainer). Similarly, the man in the room doesn’t
understand Chinese, and could be exposed by watching him closely.
(Simon and Eisenstadt do not explain just how this would be done, or
how it would affect the argument.) Citing the work of Rudolf Carnap,
Simon and Eisenstadt argue that to understand is not just to exhibit
certain behavior, but to use “intensions” that determine
extensions, and that one can see in actual programs that they do use
appropriate intensions. They discuss three actual AI programs, and
defend various attributions of mentality to them, including
understanding, and conclude that computers understand; they learn
“intensions by associating words and other linguistic structure
with their denotations, as detected through sensory stimuli”.
And since we can see exactly how the machines work, “it is, in
fact, easier to establish that a machine exhibits understanding that
to establish that a human exhibits understanding….” Thus,
they conclude, the evidence for empirical strong AI is
overwhelming.</p>

<p>
Similarly, Daniel Dennett in his original 1980 response to
Searle’s argument called it “an intuition pump”, a
term he came up with in discussing the CRA with Hofstader. Sharvy 1983
echoes the complaint. Dennett’s considered view (2013) is that
the CRA is “clearly a fallacious and misleading argument
….” (p. 320). Paul Thagard (2013) proposes that for every
thought experiment in philosophy there is an equal and opposite
thought experiment. Thagard holds that intuitions are unreliable, and
the CRA is an example (and that in fact the CRA has now been refuted
by the technology of autonomous robotic cars). Dennett has elaborated
on concerns about our intuitions regarding intelligence. Dennett 1987
(“Fast Thinking”) expressed concerns about the slow speed
at which the Chinese Room would operate, and he has been joined by
several other commentators, including Tim Maudlin, David Chalmers, and
Steven Pinker. The operator of the Chinese Room may eventually produce
appropriate answers to Chinese questions. But slow thinkers are
stupid, not intelligent – and in the wild, they may well end up
dead. Dennett argues that “speed … is ‘of the
essence’ for intelligence. If you can’t figure out the
relevant portions of the changing environment fast enough to fend for
yourself, you are not practically intelligent, however complex you
are” (326). Thus Dennett relativizes intelligence to processing
speed relative to current environment. </p>

<p>
Tim Maudlin (1989) disagrees. Maudlin considers the time-scale problem
pointed to by other writers, and concludes, contra Dennett, that the
extreme slowness of a computational system does not violate any
necessary conditions on thinking or consciousness. Furthermore,
Searle’s main claim is about understanding, not intelligence or
being quick-witted. If we were to encounter extra-terrestrials that
could process information a thousand times more quickly than we do, it
seems that would show nothing about our own slow-poke ability to
understand the languages we speak.</p>

<p>
Steven Pinker (1997) also holds that Searle relies on untutored
intuitions. Pinker endorses the Churchlands’ (1990)
counterexample of an analogous thought experiment of waving a magnet
and not generating light, noting that this outcome would not disprove
Maxwell’s theory that light consists of electromagnetic waves.
Pinker holds that the key issue is speed: “The thought
experiment slows down the waves to a range to which we humans no
longer see them as light. By trusting our intuitions in the thought
experiment, we falsely conclude that rapid waves cannot be light
either. Similarly, Searle has slowed down the mental computations to a
range in which we humans no longer think of it as understanding (since
understanding is ordinarily much faster)” (94–95). Howard
Gardiner, a supporter of Searle’s conclusions regarding the
room, makes a similar point about understanding. Gardiner addresses
the Chinese Room argument in his book <em>The Mind’s New
Science</em> (1985, 171–177). Gardiner considers all the
standard replies to the Chinese Room argument and concludes that
Searle is correct about the room: “…the word understand
has been unduly stretched in the case of the Chinese room
….” (175).</p>

<p>
Thus several in this group of critics argue that speed affects our
willingness to attribute intelligence and understanding to a slow
system, such as that in the Chinese Room. The result may simply be
that our intuitions regarding the Chinese Room are unreliable, and
thus the man in the room, in implementing the program, may understand
Chinese despite intuitions to the contrary (Maudlin and Pinker). Or it
may be that the slowness marks a crucial difference between the
simulation in the room and what a fast computer does, such that the
man is not intelligent while the computer system is (Dennett).</p>

<h2 id="LargPhilIssu">5. The Larger Philosophical Issues</h2>

<h3 id="SyntSema">5.1 Syntax and Semantics</h3>

<p>
Searle believes the Chinese Room argument supports a larger point,
which explains the failure of the Chinese Room to produce
understanding. Searle argued that programs implemented by computers
are just syntactical. Computer operations are “formal” in
that they respond only to the physical form of the strings of symbols,
not to the meaning of the symbols. Minds on the other hand have states
with meaning, mental contents. We associate meanings with the words or
signs in language. We respond to signs because of their meaning, not
just their physical appearance. In short, we understand. But, and
according to Searle this is the key point, “Syntax is not by
itself sufficient for, nor constitutive of, semantics.” So
although computers may be able to manipulate syntax to produce
appropriate responses to natural language input, they do not
understand the sentences they receive or output, for they cannot
associate meanings with the words.</p>

<p>
Searle (1984) presents a three premise argument that because syntax is
not sufficient for semantics, programs cannot produce minds.</p>

<ol>

<li>Programs are purely formal (syntactic).</li>

<li>Human minds have mental contents (semantics).</li>

<li>Syntax by itself is neither constitutive of, nor sufficient for,
semantic content.</li>

<li>Therefore, programs by themselves are not constitutive of nor
sufficient for minds.</li>
</ol>

<p>
The Chinese Room thought experiment itself is the support for the
third premise. The claim that syntactic manipulation is not sufficient
for meaning or thought is a significant issue, with wider implications
than AI, or attributions of understanding. Prominent theories of mind
hold that human cognition generally is computational. In one form, it
is held that thought involves operations on symbols in virtue of their
physical properties. On an alternative connectionist account, the
computations are on “subsymbolic” states. If Searle is
right, not only Strong AI but also these main approaches to
understanding human cognition are misguided.</p>

<p>
As we have seen, Searle holds that the Chinese Room scenario shows
that one cannot get semantics from syntax alone. In a symbolic logic
system, a kind of artificial language, rules are given for syntax. A
semantics, if any, comes later. The logician specifies the basic
symbol set and some rules for manipulating strings to produce new
ones. These rules are purely syntactic – they are applied to
strings of symbols solely in virtue of their syntax or form. A
semantics, if any, for the symbol system must be provided separately.
And if one wishes to show that interesting additional relationships
hold between the syntactic operations and semantics, such as that the
symbol manipulations preserve truth, one must provide sometimes
complex meta-proofs to show this. So on the face of it, semantics is
quite independent of syntax for artificial languages, and one cannot
get semantics from syntax alone. “Formal symbols by themselves
can never be enough for mental contents, because the symbols, by
definition, have no meaning (or interpretation, or semantics) except
insofar as someone outside the system gives it to them” (Searle
1989, 45).</p>

<p>
Searle’s identification of meaning with interpretation in this
passage is important. Searle’s point is clearly true of the
causally inert formal systems of logicians. A semantic interpretation
has to be given to those symbols by a logician. When we move from
formal systems to computational systems, the situation is more
complex. As many of Searle’s critics (e.g. Cole 1984, Dennett
1987, Boden 1988, and Chalmers 1996) have noted, a computer running a
program is not the same as “syntax alone”. A computer is
an enormously complex electronic causal system. State changes in the
system are physical. One can <em>interpret</em> the physical states,
e.g. voltages, as syntactic 1’s and 0’s, but the intrinsic
reality is electronic and the syntax is “derived”, a
product of interpretation. The states are syntactically specified by
programmers, but when implemented in a running machine they are
electronic states of a complex causal system embedded in the real
world. This is quite different from the abstract formal systems that
logicians study. Dennett notes that no “computer program by
itself” (Searle’s language) – e.g. a program lying
on a shelf – can cause anything, even simple addition, let alone
mental states. The program must be running. Chalmers (1996) offers a
parody in which it is reasoned that recipes are syntactic, syntax is
not sufficient for crumbliness, cakes are crumbly, so implementation
of a recipe is not sufficient for making a cake. Implementation makes
all the difference; an abstract entity (recipe, program) determines
the causal powers of a physical system embedded in the larger causal
nexus of the world. </p>

<p>
Dennett (1987) sums up the issue: “Searle’s view, then,
comes to this: take a material object (any material object) that does
not have the power of causing mental phenomena; you cannot turn it in
to an object that does have the power of producing mental phenomena
simply by programming it – reorganizing the conditional
dependencies of transitions between its states.” Dennett’s
view is the opposite: programming “is precisely what could give
something a mind”. But Dennett claims that in fact it is
“empirically unlikely that the right sorts of programs can be
run on anything but organic, human brains” (325–6).</p>

<p>
A further related complication is that it is not clear that computers
perform syntactic operations in quite the same sense that a human does
– it is not clear that a computer understands syntax or
syntactic operations. A computer does not know that it is manipulating
1’s and 0’s. A computer does not recognize that its binary
data strings have a certain form, and thus that certain syntactic
rules may be applied to them, unlike the man inside the Chinese Room.
Inside a computer, there is nothing that literally reads input data,
or that “knows” what symbols are. Instead, there are
millions of transistors that change states. A sequence of voltages
causes operations to be performed. We humans may choose to interpret
these voltages as binary numerals and the voltage changes as syntactic
operations, but a computer does not interpret its operations as
syntactic or any other way. So perhaps a computer does not need to
make the move from syntax to semantics that Searle objects to; it
needs to move from complex causal connections to semantics.
Furthermore, perhaps <em>any</em> causal system is describable as
performing syntactic operations – if we interpret a light square
as logical “0” and a dark square as logical
“1”, then a kitchen toaster <em>may</em> be described as a
device that rewrites logical “0”s as logical
“1”s. But there is no philosophical problem about getting
from syntax to breakfast. </p>

<p>
In the 1990s, Searle began to use considerations related to these to
argue that computational views are not just false, but lack a clear
sense. Computation, or syntax, is “observer-relative”, not
an intrinsic feature of reality: “…you can assign a
computational interpretation to anything” (Searle 2002b, p. 17),
even the molecules in the paint on the wall. Since nothing is
intrinsically computational, one cannot have a scientific theory that
reduces the mental, which is not observer-relative, to computation,
which is. “Computation exists only relative to some agent or
observer who imposes a computational interpretation on some
phenomenon. This is an obvious point. I should have seen it ten years
ago, but I did not.” (Searle 2002b, p.17, originally published
1993).</p>

<p>
Critics note that walls are not computers; unlike a wall, a computer
goes through state-transitions that are counterfactually described by
a program (Chalmers 1996, Block 2002, Haugeland 2002). In his 2002
paper, Block addresses the question of whether a wall is a computer
(in reply to Searle’s charge that anything that maps onto a
formal system is a formal system, whereas minds are quite different).
Block denies that whether or not something is a computer depends
entirely on our interpretation. Block notes that Searle ignores the
counterfactuals that must be true of an implementing system. Haugeland
(2002) makes the similar point that an implementation will be a causal
process that reliably carries out the operations – and they must
be the right causal powers. Block concludes that Searle’s
arguments fail, but he concedes that they “do succeed in
sharpening our understanding of the nature of intentionality and its
relation to computation and representation” (78).</p>

<p>
Rey (2002) also addresses Searle’s arguments that syntax and
symbols are observer-relative properties, not physical. Searle infers
this from the fact that syntactic properties (e.g. being a logical
“1”)are not defined in physics; however Rey holds that it
does not follow that they are observer-relative. Rey argues that
Searle also misunderstands what it is to realize a program. Rey
endorses Chalmers’ reply to Putnam: a realization is not just a
structural mapping, but involves causation, supporting
counterfactuals. “This point is missed so often, it bears
repeating: the syntactically specifiable objects over which
computations are defined can and standardly do possess a semantics;
it’s just that the semantics is not involved in the
specification.” States of a person have their semantics in
virtue of computational organization and their causal relations to the
world. Rey concludes: Searle “simply does not consider the
substantial resources of functionalism and Strong AI.” (222) A
plausibly detailed story would defuse negative conclusions drawn from
the superficial sketch of the system in the Chinese Room.</p>

<p>
John Haugeland (2002) argues that there is a sense in which a
processor must intrinsically understand the commands in the programs
it runs: it executes them in accord with the specifications.
“The only way that we can make sense of a computer as executing
a program is by understanding its processor as responding to the
program prescriptions as meaningful” (385). Thus operation
symbols have meaning to a system. Haugeland goes on to draw a
distinction between narrow and wide system. He argues that data can
have semantics in the wide system that includes representations of
external objects produced by transducers. In passing, Haugeland makes
the unusual claim, argued for elsewhere, that genuine intelligence and
semantics presuppose “the capacity for a kind of commitment in
how one lives” which is non-propositional – that is, love
(cp. Steven Spielberg’s 2001 film <em>Artificial Intelligence:
AI</em>). </p>

<p>
To Searle’s claim that syntax is observer-relative, that the
molecules in a wall might be interpreted as implementing the Wordstar
program (an early word processing program) because “there is
some pattern in the molecule movements which is isomorphic with the
formal structure of Wordstar” (Searle 1990b, p. 27), Haugeland
counters that “the very idea of a complex syntactical token
… presupposes specified processes of writing and
reading….” The tokens must be systematically producible
and retrievable. So no random isomorphism or pattern somewhere (e.g.
on some wall) is going to count, and hence syntax is not
observer-relative.</p>

<p>
With regard to the question of whether one can get semantics from
syntax, William Rapaport has for many years argued for
“syntactic semantics”, a view in which understanding is a
special form of syntactic structure in which symbols (such as Chinese
words) are linked to concepts, themselves represented syntactically.
Others believe we are not there yet. AI futurist (<em>The Age of
Spiritual Machines</em>) Ray Kurzweil holds in a 2002 follow-up book
that it is red herring to focus on traditional symbol-manipulating
computers. Kurzweil agrees with Searle that existent computers do not
understand language – as evidenced by the fact that they
can’t engage in convincing dialog. But that failure does not
bear on the capacity of future computers based on different
technology. Kurzweil claims that Searle fails to understand that
future machines will use “chaotic emergent methods that are
massively parallel”. This claim appears to be similar to that of
connectionists, such as Andy Clark, and the position taken by the
Churchlands in their 1990 <em>Scientific American</em> article.</p>

<p>
Apart from Haugeland’s claim that processors understand program
instructions, Searle’s critics can agree that computers no more
understand syntax than they understand semantics, although, like all
causal engines, a computer has syntactic descriptions. And while it is
often useful to programmers to treat the machine as if it performed
syntactic operations, it is not always so: sometimes the characters
programmers use are just switches that make the machine do something,
for example, make a given pixel on the computer display turn red, or
make a car transmission shift gears. Thus it is not clear that Searle
is correct when he says a digital computer is just “a device
which manipulates symbols”. Computers are complex causal
engines, and syntactic descriptions are useful in order to structure
the causal interconnections in the machine. AI programmers face many
tough problems, but one can hold that they do not have to get
semantics from syntax. If they are to get semantics, they must get it
from causality.</p>

<p>
Two main approaches have developed that explain meaning in terms of
causal connections. The internalist approaches, such as Schank’s
and Rapaport’s conceptual representation approaches, and also
Conceptual Role Semantics, hold that a state of a physical system gets
its semantics from causal connections to other states of the same
system. Thus a state of a computer might represent “kiwi”
because it is connected to “bird” and
“flightless” nodes, and perhaps also to images of
prototypical kiwis. The state that represents the property of being
“flightless” might get its content from a
Negation-operator modifying a representation of “capable of
airborne self-propulsion”, and so forth, to form a vast
connected conceptual network, a kind of mental dictionary.</p>

<p>

 <a href="../content-externalism/">Externalist</a>
 approaches developed by Dennis Stampe, Fred Dretske, Hilary Putnam,
Jerry Fodor, Ruth Millikan, and others, hold that states of a physical
system get their content through causal connections to the external
reality they represent. Thus, roughly, a system with a KIWI concept is
one that has a state it uses to represent the presence of kiwis in the
external environment. This kiwi-representing state can be any state
that is appropriately causally connected to the presence of kiwis.
Depending on the system, the kiwi representing state could be a state
of a brain, or of an electrical device such as a computer, or even of
a hydraulic system. The internal representing state can then in turn
play a causal role in the determining the behavior of the system. For
example, Rey (1986) endorses an indicator semantics along the lines of
the work of Dennis Stampe (1977) and Fodor’s
<em>Psychosemantics</em>. These semantic theories that locate content
or meaning in appropriate causal relations to the world fit well with
the Robot Reply. A computer in a robot body might have just the causal
connections that could allow its inner syntactic states to have the
semantic property of representing states of things in its
environment.</p>

<p>
Thus there are at least two families of theories (and marriages of the
two, as in Block 1986) about how semantics might depend upon causal
connections. Both of these attempt to provide accounts that are
substance neutral: states of suitably organized causal systems can
have content, no matter what the systems are made of. On these
theories a computer could have states that have meaning. It is not
necessary that the computer be aware of its own states and know that
they have meaning, nor that any outsider appreciate the meaning of the
states. On either of these accounts meaning depends upon the (possibly
complex) causal connections, and digital computers are systems
designed to have states that have just such complex causal
dependencies. It should be noted that Searle does not subscribe to
these theories of semantics. Instead, Searle’s discussions of
linguistic meaning have often centered on the notion of
<em>intentionality</em>.</p>

<h3 id="Inte">5.2 Intentionality</h3>

<p>

 <a href="../intentionality/">Intentionality</a>
 is the property of being about something, having content. In the 19th
Century, psychologist Franz Brentano re-introduced this term from
Medieval philosophy and held that intentionality was the “mark
of the mental”. Beliefs and desires are intentional states: they
have propositional content (one believes that <i>p</i>, one desires
that <i>p</i>, where sentences that represent propositions substitute
for “<i>p</i>”). Searle’s views regarding
intentionality are complex; of relevance here is that he makes a
distinction between the original or intrinsic intentionality of
genuine mental states, and the derived intentionality of language. A
written or spoken sentence only has derivative intentionality insofar
as it is interpreted by someone. It appears that on Searle’s
view, original intentionality can at least potentially be conscious.
Searle then argues that the distinction between original and derived
intentionality applies to computers. We can interpret the states of a
computer as having content, but the states themselves do not have
original intentionality. Many philosophers endorse this intentionality
dualism, including Sayre (1986) and even Fodor (2009), despite
Fodor’s many differences with Searle.</p>

<p>
In a section of her 1988 book, <em>Computer Models of the Mind</em>,
Margaret Boden notes that intentionality is not well-understood
– reason to not put too much weight on arguments that turn on
intentionality. Furthermore, insofar as we understand the brain, we
focus on informational functions, not unspecified causal powers of the
brain: “…from the psychological point of view, it is not
the biochemistry as such which matters but the information-bearing
functions grounded in it.” (241) Searle sees intentionality as a
causal power of the brain, uniquely produced by biological processes.
Dale Jacquette 1989 argues against a reduction of intentionality
– intentionality, he says, is an “ineliminable,
irreducible primitive concept.” However most AI sympathizers
have seen intentionality, aboutness, as bound up with information, and
non-biological states can bear information as well as can brain
states. Hence many responders to Searle have argued that he displays
substance chauvinism, in holding that brains understand but systems
made of silicon with comparable information processing capabilities
cannot, even in principle. Papers on both sides of the issue appeared,
such as J. Maloney’s 1987 paper “The Right Stuff”,
defending Searle, and R. Sharvy’s 1983 critique, “It
Ain’t the Meat, it’s the Motion”. AI proponents such
as Kurzweil (1999, see also Richards 2002) have continued to hold that
AI systems can potentially have such mental properties as
understanding, intelligence, consciousness and intentionality, and
will exceed human abilities in these areas.</p>

<p>
Other critics of Searle’s position take intentionality more
seriously than Boden does, but deny his dualistic distinction between
original and derived intentionality. Dennett (1987, e.g.) argues that
all intentionality is derived, in that attributions of intentionality
– to animals, other people, and even ourselves – are
instrumental and allow us to predict behavior, but they are not
descriptions of intrinsic properties. As we have seen, Dennett is
concerned about the slow speed of things in the Chinese Room, but he
argues that once a system is working up to speed, it has all that is
needed for intelligence and derived intentionality – and derived
intentionality is the only kind that there is, according to Dennett. A
machine can be an intentional system because intentional explanations
work in predicting the machine’s behavior. Dennett also suggests
that Searle conflates intentionality with awareness of intentionality.
In his syntax-semantic arguments, “Searle has apparently
confused a claim about the underivability of semantics from syntax
with a claim about the underivability of the consciousness of
semantics from syntax” (336). The emphasis on consciousness
forces us to think about things from a first-person point of view, but
Dennett 2017 continues to press the claim that this is a fundamental
mistake if we want to understand the mental. </p>

<p>
We might also worry that Searle conflates meaning and interpretation,
and that Searle’s original or underived intentionality is just
second-order intentionality, a representation of what an intentional
object represents or means. Dretske and others have seen
intentionality as information-based. One state of the world, including
a state in a computer, may carry information about other states in the
world, and this informational aboutness is a mind-independent feature
of states. Hence it is a mistake to hold that conscious attributions
of meaning are the source of intentionality. </p>

<p>
Others have noted that Searle’s discussion has shown a shift
over time from issues of intentionality and understanding to issues of
consciousness. Searle links intentionality to awareness of
intentionality, in holding that intentional states are at least
potentially conscious. In his 1996 book, <em>The Conscious Mind</em>,
David Chalmers notes that although Searle originally directs his
argument against machine intentionality, it is clear from later
writings that the real issue is consciousness, which Searle holds is a
necessary condition of intentionality. It is consciousness that is
lacking in digital computers. Chalmers uses thought experiments to
argue that it is implausible that one system has some basic mental
property (such as having qualia) that another system lacks, if it is
possible to imagine transforming one system into the other, either
gradually (as replacing neurons one at a time by digital circuits), or
all at once, switching back and forth between flesh and silicon.</p>

<p>
A second strategy regarding the attribution of intentionality is taken
by critics who in effect argue that intentionality is an intrinsic
feature of states of physical systems that are causally connected with
the world in the right way, independently of interpretation (see the
preceding Syntax and Semantics section). Fodor’s semantic
externalism is influenced by Fred Dretske, but they come to different
conclusions with regard to the semantics of states of computers. Over
a period of years, Dretske developed an historical account of meaning
or mental content that would preclude attributing beliefs and
understanding to most machines. Dretske (1985) agrees with Searle that
adding machines don’t literally add; <em>we</em> do the adding,
using the machines. Dretske emphasizes the crucial role of natural
selection and learning in producing states that have genuine content.
Human built systems will be, at best, like Swampmen (beings that
result from a lightning strike in a swamp and by chance happen to be a
molecule by molecule copy of some human being, say, you) – they
appear to have intentionality or mental states, but do not, because
such states require the right history. AI states will generally be
counterfeits of real mental states; like counterfeit money, they may
appear perfectly identical but lack the right pedigree. But
Dretske’s account of belief appears to make it distinct from
conscious awareness of the belief or intentional state (if that is
taken to require a higher order thought), and so would apparently
allow attribution of intentionality to artificial systems that can get
the right history by learning.</p>

<p>
Howard Gardiner endorses Zenon Pylyshyn’s criticisms of
Searle’s view of the relation of brain and intentionality, as
supposing that intentionality is somehow a stuff “secreted by
the brain”, and Pylyshyn’s own counter-thought experiment
in which one’s neurons are replaced one by one with integrated
circuit workalikes (see also Cole and Foelber (1984) and Chalmers
(1996) for exploration of neuron replacement scenarios). Gardiner
holds that Searle owes us a more precise account of intentionality
than Searle has given so far, and until then it is an open question
whether AI can produce it, or whether it is beyond its scope. Gardiner
concludes with the possibility that the dispute between Searle and his
critics is not scientific, but (quasi?) religious.</p>

<h3 id="MindBody">5.3 Mind and Body</h3>

<p>
Several critics have noted that there are metaphysical issues at stake
in the original argument. The Systems Reply draws attention to the
metaphysical problem of the relation of mind to body. It does this in
holding that understanding is a property of the system as a whole, not
the physical implementer. The Virtual Mind Reply holds that minds or
persons – the entities that understand and are conscious –
are more abstract than any physical system, and that there could be a
many-to-one relation between minds and physical systems. (Even if
everything is physical, in principle a single body could be shared by
multiple minds, and a single mind could have a sequence of bodies over
time.) Thus larger issues about personal identity and the relation of
mind and body are in play in the debate between Searle and some of his
critics.</p>

<p>
Searle’s view is that the problem the relation of mind and body
“has a rather simple solution. Here it is: Conscious states are
caused by lower level neurobiological processes in the brain and are
themselves higher level features of the brain” (Searle 2002b, p.
9). In his early discussion of the CRA, Searle spoke of the causal
powers of the brain. Thus his view appears to be that brain states
cause consciousness and understanding, and “consciousness is
just a feature of the brain” (ibid). However, as we have seen,
even if this is true it begs the question of just whose consciousness
a brain creates. Roger Sperry’s split-brain experiments suggest
that perhaps there can be two centers of consciousness, and so in that
sense two minds, implemented by a single brain. While both display at
least some language comprehension, only one (typically created by the
left hemisphere) controls language production. Thus many current
approaches to understanding the relation of brain and consciousness
emphasize connectedness and information flow (see e.g. Dehaene 2014).
</p>

<p>
Consciousness and understanding are features of persons, so it appears
that Searle accepts a metaphysics in which I, my conscious self, am
identical with my brain – a form of mind-brain identity theory.
This very concrete metaphysics is reflected in Searle’s original
presentation of the CR argument, in which Strong AI was described by
him as the claim that “the appropriately programmed computer
really is a mind” (Searle 1980). This is an identity claim, and
has odd consequences. If A and B are identical, any property of A is a
property of B. Computers are physical objects. Some computers weigh 6
lbs and have stereo speakers. So the claim that Searle called Strong
AI would entail that some minds weigh 6 lbs and have stereo speakers.
However it seems to be clear that while humans may weigh 150 pounds;
human minds do not weigh 150 pounds. This suggests that neither bodies
nor machines can literally be minds. Such considerations support the
view that minds are more abstract that brains, and if so that at least
one version of the claim that Searle calls Strong AI, the version that
says that computers literally are minds, is metaphysically untenable
on the face of it, apart from any thought-experiments.</p>

<p>
Searle’s CR argument was thus directed against the claim that a
computer is a mind, that a suitably programmed digital computer
understands language, or that its program does. Searle’s thought
experiment appeals to our strong intuition that someone who did
exactly what the computer does would not thereby come to understand
Chinese. As noted above, many critics have held that Searle is quite
right on this point – no matter how you program a computer, the
computer will not literally be a mind and the computer will not
understand natural language. But if minds are not physical objects
this inability of a computer to be a mind does not show that running
an AI program cannot <em>produce</em> understanding of natural
language, by something other than the computer (See section 4.1
above.) </p>

<p>

 <a href="../functionalism/">Functionalism</a>
 is a theory of the relation of minds to bodies that was developed in
the two decades prior to Searle’s CRA. Functionalism is an
alternative to the identity theory that is implicit in much of
Searle’s discussion, as well as to the dominant behaviorism of
the mid-Twentieth Century. If functionalism is correct, there appears
to be no intrinsic reason why a computer couldn’t have mental
states. Hence the CRA’s conclusion that a computer is
intrinsically incapable of mental states is an important consideration
against functionalism. Julian Baggini (2009, 37) writes that Searle
“came up with perhaps the most famous counter-example in history
– the Chinese room argument – and in one intellectual
punch inflicted so much damage on the then dominant theory of
functionalism that many would argue it has never recovered.”</p>

<p>
Functionalists hold that a mental state <em>is</em> what a mental
state <em>does</em> – the causal (or “functional”)
role that the state plays determines what state it is. A functionalist
might hold that pain, for example, is a state that is typically caused
by damage to the body, is located in a body-image, and is aversive.
Functionalists distance themselves both from behaviorists and identity
theorists. In contrast with the former, functionalists hold that the
<em>internal</em> causal processes are important for the possession of
mental states. Thus functionalists may agree with Searle in rejecting
the Turing Test as too behavioristic. In contrast with identity
theorists (who might e.g. hold “pain is identical with C-fiber
firing”), functionalists hold that mental states might be had by
a variety of physical systems (or non-physical, as in Cole and Foelber
1984, in which a mind changes from a material to an immaterial
implementation, neuron by neuron). Thus while an identity theorist
will identify pain with certain neuron firings, a functionalist will
identify pain with something more abstract and higher level, a
functional role that might be had by many different types of
underlying system. </p>

<p>
Functionalists accuse identity theorists of substance chauvinism.
However, functionalism remains controversial: functionalism is
vulnerable to the Chinese Nation type objections discussed above, and
functionalists notoriously have trouble explaining qualia, a problem
highlighted by the apparent possibility of an inverted spectrum, where
qualitatively different states might have the same functional role
(e.g. Block 1978, Maudlin 1989, Cole 1990).</p>

<p>

 <a href="../computational-mind/">Computationalism</a>
 is the sub-species of functionalism that holds that the important
causal role of brain processes is information processing. Milkowski
2017 notes that computational approaches have been fruitful in
cognitive science; he surveys objections to computationalism and
concludes that the majority target a strawman version. However Jerry
Fodor, an early proponent of computational approaches, argues in Fodor
2005 that key mental processes, such as inference to the best
explanation, which depend on non-local properties of representations,
cannot be explained by computational modules in the brain. If Fodor is
right, understanding language and interpretation appear to involve
global considerations such as linguistic and non-linguistic context
and theory of mind and so might resist computational explanation. If
so, we reach Searle’s conclusion on the basis of different
considerations. </p>

<p>
Searle’s 2010 statement of the conclusion of the CRA has it
showing that computational accounts cannot explain consciousness.
There has been considerable interest in the decades since 1980 in
determining what does explain consciousness, and this has been an
extremely active research area across disciplines. One interest has
been in the neural correlates of consciousness. This bears directly on
Searle’s claim that consciousness is intrinsically biological
and not computational or information processing. There is no
definitive answer yet, though some recent work on anesthesia suggests
that consciousness is lost when cortical (and cortico-thalamic)
connections and information flow are disrupted (e.g.Hudetz 2012, a
review article). </p>

<p>
In general, if the basis of consciousness is confirmed to be at the
relatively abstract level of information flow through neural networks,
it will be friendly to functionalism, and if it is turns out to be
lower and more biological (or sub-neuronal), it will be friendly to
Searle’s account.</p>

<p>
These controversial biological and metaphysical issues bear on the
central inference in the Chinese Room argument. From the intuition
that in the CR thought experiment he would not understand Chinese by
running a program, Searle infers that there is no understanding
created by running a program. Clearly, whether that inference is valid
or not turns on a metaphysical question about the identity of persons
and minds. If the person understanding is not identical with the room
operator, then the inference is unsound.</p>

<h3 id="SimuDuplEvol">5.4 Simulation, duplication and evolution</h3>

<p>
In discussing the CRA, Searle argues that there is an important
distinction between simulation and duplication. No one would mistake a
computer simulation of the weather for weather, or a computer
simulation of digestion for real digestion. Searle concludes that it
is just as serious a mistake to confuse a computer simulation of
understanding with understanding.</p>

<p>
On the face of it, there is generally an important distinction between
a simulation and the real thing. But two problems emerge. It is not
clear that the distinction can always be made. Hearts are biological
if anything is. Are artificial hearts simulations of hearts? Or are
they functional duplicates of hearts, hearts made from different
materials? Walking is normally a biological phenomenon performed using
limbs. Do those with artificial limbs walk? Or do they simulate
walking? Do robots walk? If the properties that are needed to be
certain kind of thing are high-level properties, anything sharing
those properties will be a thing of that kind, even if it differs in
its lower level properties. Chalmers (1996) offers a principle
governing when simulation is replication. Chalmers suggests that,
contra Searle and Harnad (1989), a simulation of <em>X</em> can be an
<em>X</em>, namely when the property of being an <em>X</em> is an
organizational invariant, a property that depends only on the
functional organization of the underlying system, and not on any other
details.</p>

<p>
Copeland (2002) argues that the Church-Turing thesis does not entail
that the brain (or every machine) can be simulated by a universal
Turing machine, for the brain (or other machine) might have primitive
operations that are not simple clerical routines that can be carried
out by hand. (An example might be that human brains likely display
genuine low-level randomness, whereas computers are carefully designed
not to do that, and so computers resort to pseudo-random numbers when
apparent randomness is needed.) Sprevak 2007 raises a related point.
Turing’s 1938 Princeton thesis described such machines
(“O-machines”). O-machines are machines that include
functions of natural numbers that are not Turing-machine computable.
If the brain is such a machine, then, says Sprevak,: “There is
no possibility of Searle’s Chinese Room Argument being
successfully deployed against the functionalist hypothesis that the
brain instantiates an O-machine….” (120). </p>

<p>
Copeland discusses the simulation / duplication distinction in
connection with the Brain Simulator Reply. He argues that Searle
correctly notes that one cannot infer from <em>X</em> simulates
<em>Y</em>, and <em>Y</em> has property <em>P</em>, to the conclusion
that therefore <em>X</em> has <em>Y</em>’s property <em>P</em>
for arbitrary <em>P</em>. But Copeland claims that Searle himself
commits the simulation fallacy in extending the CR argument from
traditional AI to apply against computationalism. The contrapositive
of the inference is logically equivalent – <em>X</em> simulates
<em>Y</em>, <em>X</em> does not have <em>P</em> therefore <em>Y</em>
does not – where <em>P</em> is understands Chinese. The faulty
step is: the CR operator <em>S</em> simulates a neural net <em>N</em>,
it is not the case that <em>S</em> understands Chinese, therefore it
is not the case that <em>N</em> understands Chinese. Copeland also
notes results by Siegelmann and Sontag (1994) showing that some
connectionist networks cannot be simulated by a universal Turing
Machine (in particular, where connection weights are real
numbers).</p>

<p>
There is another problem with the simulation-duplication distinction,
arising from the process of evolution. Searle wishes to see original
intentionality and genuine understanding as properties only of certain
biological systems, presumably the product of evolution. Computers
merely simulate these properties. At the same time, in the Chinese
Room scenario, Searle maintains that a system can exhibit behavior
just as complex as human behavior, simulating any degree of
intelligence and language comprehension that one can imagine, and
simulating any ability to deal with the world, yet not understand a
thing. He also says that such behaviorally complex systems might be
implemented with very ordinary materials, for example with tubes of
water and valves.</p>

<p>
This creates a biological problem, beyond the Other Minds problem
noted by early critics of the CR argument. While <em>we</em> may
presuppose that others have minds, evolution makes no such
presuppositions. The selection forces that drive biological evolution
select on the basis of behavior. Evolution can select for the ability
to use information about the environment creatively and intelligently,
as long as this is manifest in the behavior of the organism. If there
is no overt difference in behavior in any set of circumstances between
a system that understands and one that does not, evolution cannot
select for genuine understanding. And so it seems that on
Searle’s account, minds that genuinely understand meaning have
no advantage over creatures that merely process information, using
purely computational processes. Thus a position that implies that
simulations of understanding can be just as biologically adaptive as
the real thing, leaves us with a puzzle about how and why systems with
“genuine” understanding could evolve. Original
intentionality and genuine understanding become epiphenomenal.</p>

<h2 id="Conc">Conclusion</h2>

<p>
As we have seen, since its appearance in 1980 the Chinese Room
argument has sparked discussion across disciplines. Despite the
extensive discussion there is still no consensus as to whether the
argument is sound. At one end we have Julian Baggini’s (2009)
assessment that Searle “came up with perhaps the most famous
counter-example in history – the Chinese room argument –
and in one intellectual punch inflicted so much damage on the then
dominant theory of functionalism that many would argue it has never
recovered.” Whereas philosopher Daniel Dennett (2013, p. 320)
concludes that the Chinese Room argument is “clearly a
fallacious and misleading argument”. Hence there is no consensus
as to whether the argument is a proof that limits the aspirations of
Artificial Intelligence or computational accounts of mind. </p>

<p>
Meanwhile work in artificial intelligence and natural language
processing has continued. The CRA led Stevan Harnad and others on a
quest for “symbol grounding” in AI. Many in philosophy
(Dretske, Fodor, Millikan) worked on naturalistic theories of mental
content. Speculation about the nature of consciousness continues in
many disciplines. And computers have moved from the lab to the pocket
and the wrist.</p>

<p>
At the time of Searle’s construction of the argument, personal
computers were very limited hobbyist devices. Weizenbaum’s
‘Eliza’ and a few text ‘adventure’ games were
played on DEC computers; these included limited parsers. More advanced
parsing of language was limited to computer researchers such as
Schank. Much changed in the next quarter century; billions now use
natural language to interrogate and command virtual agents via
computers they carry in their pockets. Has the Chinese Room argument
moderated claims by those who produce AI and natural language systems?
Some manufacturers linking devices to the “internet of
things” make modest claims: appliance manufacturer LG says the
second decade of the 21st century brings the “experience of
conversing” with major appliances. That may or may not be the
same as conversing. Apple is less cautious than LG in describing the
capabilities of its “virtual personal assistant”
application called ‘Siri’: Apple says of Siri that
“It understands what you say. It knows what you mean.” IBM
is quick to claim its much larger ‘Watson’ system is
superior in language abilities to Siri. In 2011 Watson beat human
champions on the television game show ‘Jeopardy’, a feat
that relies heavily on language abilities and inference. IBM goes on
to claim that what distinguishes Watson is that it “knows what
it knows, and knows what it does not know.” This appears to be
claiming a form of reflexive self-awareness or consciousness for the
Watson computer system. Thus the claims of strong AI now are hardly
chastened, and if anything some are stronger and more exuberant. At
the same time, as we have seen, many others believe that the Chinese
Room Argument showed once and for all that at best computers can
simulate human cognition.</p>

<p>
Though separated by three centuries, Leibniz and Searle had similar
intuitions about the systems they consider in their respective thought
experiments, Leibniz’ Mill and the Chinese Room. In both cases
they consider a complex system composed of relatively simple
operations, and note that it is impossible to see how understanding or
consciousness could result. These simple arguments do us the service
of highlighting the serious problems we face in understanding meaning
and minds. The many issues raised by the Chinese Room argument may not
be settled until there is a consensus about the nature of meaning, its
relation to syntax, and about the biological basis of consciousness.
There continues to be significant disagreement about what processes
create meaning, understanding, and consciousness, as well as what can
be proven a priori by thought experiments.</p>
