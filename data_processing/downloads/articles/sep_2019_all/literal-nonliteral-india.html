<h1>The Literal-Nonliteral Distinction in Classical Indian Philosophy</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Sat Nov 26, 2016; substantive revision Fri Apr 27, 2018</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
Indian thinkers demarcate the boundaries between literal and
non-literal meaning early in their history. They do so within
different intellectual genres, each broadly philosophical, but with
varying emphases. Within the grammatical genre, Yāska’s
<em>Semantic Explanation</em> (<em>Nirukta</em>), an early (perhaps
6<sup>th</sup> century to 3<sup>rd</sup> century BCE) etymological
treatise recognizes the difference between ordinary (<em>laukika</em>)
and metaphorical language (<em>upamā</em>). This text, possibly
pre-dating the renowned Sanskrit grammarian Pāṇini (ca
4<sup>th</sup> century BCE), employs etymological analysis in order to
ascertain the meanings of unfamiliar terms used in the Vedas, a
collection of texts including religious hymns, poetry, and rituals. In
portions of the Vedas called Upaniṣads, widely recognized as
proto-philosophical, the limits of language are made explicit:
ordinary speech cannot characterize ultimate reality, though
figurative language can hint at it. These early texts focus on topics
which would give rise to three intellectual traditions: Grammar,
Philosophy, and Aesthetics. (Capital letters distinguish the schools
of thought from their subject matter.)</p>

<p>
Two of the three textual traditions, Grammar and Philosophy, are
identifiable by their relationship to early “root” texts
which form the basis of later commentarial reflection. Within Grammar,
the aforementioned Yāska, as well as Pāṇini,
Patañjali (ca 2<sup>nd</sup> century CE), and Bhartṛhari
(ca 5<sup>th</sup> century CE), are a few of the most crucial thinkers
whose reflections—on the structure of Sanskrit in particular,
and by way of Sanskrit, language in general—informed
philosophical reflection on meaning. For instance,
Pāṇini’s analysis of the morphology, syntax, and
semantics of Sanskrit, in his <em>Eight Chapters</em>
(<em>Aṣṭādhyāyī</em>) continues to be cited
by philosophers a thousand years later. The literal/non-literal
distinction is a topic as well for the various philosophical schools,
each one known as a <em>darśana</em>, roughly a
“viewpoint”. Both those who accept the Vedas as
authoritative and those who do not address the distinction in the
context of testimony and theories of reference. Among the former,
Vedic-accepting thinkers, this article primarily treats the Nyāya
and Mīmāṃsā philosophical traditions, and of the
Veda-denying, the Buddhists and the Jainas. Finally, the tradition
here called Aesthetics (<em>alaṃkāra</em>) is really
focused more narrowly on the aesthetics of poetry and
drama—especially the courtly poetry known as
<em>kāvya</em>. It encompasses topics studied in rhetoric,
poetics, and aesthetics within Western traditions.
<em>Alaṃkāra</em>, despite meaning
“embellishment” or “ornamentation”, (in
reference to figures of speech), studies the psychology of utterances,
their ensuing emotional states in audiences, and their logical or
semantic structures. Until the highly influential <em>Light on
Suggestion</em> (<em>Dhvanyāloka</em>) of Ānandavardhana (ca
9<sup>th</sup> century CE), aesthetic theory was primarily focused on
taxonomies of figuration, but after Ānandavardhana, it drew on
philosophical work, in particular Mīmāṃsā, to
theorize about meaning itself.</p>

<p>
What follows lays out the conceptual space for Indian theorizing about
literal and non-literal meaning by way of each of these three textual
traditions. Since the article’s structure is topical rather than
historical, a chronology of major figures is appended to help orient
readers. The focus of the article is the period demarcated roughly
from 200 CE to 1300 CE, often characterized as the Classical Period of
Indian philosophy.</p>

<h2 id="ConcLangIndiPhil">1. Conceptions of language in Indian philosophy</h2>

<p>
Before delving into the various disputes in Indian philosophy over
what is commonly termed “literal meaning”, let us first
identify the cluster of concepts and corresponding terms Indian
philosophers use in their analysis of meaning. The Sanskrit term for
“meaning”, <em>artha</em>, has a semantic range that
includes also “object”, “wealth”, and
“goal”. It can be used both for external objects to which
words refer as well as meanings “in the head”, although
the term for occurrent mental states is frequently
<em>jñāna</em>, usually translated as
“cognition”. Both words and sentences are said to have
meanings, although in what manner they have them, and how word- and
sentence-meanings interrelate are subjects of debate.</p>

<h3 id="IdenLingCapa">1.1 Identifying Linguistic Capacities</h3>

<p>
Whether in the form of words or sentences, language has
capacities—it can refer to things, cause mental cognitions,
impel action, prompt emotional states, and so on. That such an ability
exists is accepted by everyone, although thinkers enumerate the
linguistic capacities differently, and also identify different results
for them. In terms of outcomes, the meaning which results from the
most fundamental linguistic capacity of the word is said to be its
“primary” meaning (<em>mukhya</em> or
<em>abhidhā</em>). This meaning is defined by Patañjali as
the meaning which is understood first by hearers. (The extent to which
the phenomenology of language comprehension guides distinctions about
meaning will be addressed further below.) From the cognition that
primary meaning causes, another linguistic capacity can subsequently
operate, given certain conditions, to generate a new, secondary
meaning. Secondary meaning is sometimes carved into two varieties:
indication (<em>lakṣaṇā</em>) and qualitative
expression (<em>gauṇa-vṛtti</em>), something like metonymy
and metaphor respectively, although this is to generalize over
distinctions important especially in Aesthetics. A third and fourth
capacity are sometimes adduced: <em>tātparya</em> and
<em>dhvani</em>, which we will examine more closely below. Initially,
let us characterize the first as something like speaker’s
intention and the second, usually translated as
“suggestion”, as encompassing phenomena such as
connotations and implicatures which the other capacities cannot
explain.</p>

<p>
Whatever the number of capacities, they can be characterized
functionally; in fact, the term function (<em>vyāpāra</em>)
or operation (<em>vṛtti</em>) is often used in place of the word
for capacity more generally. In attempts to enumerate the capacities,
philosophers consider questions such as what the basis of a linguistic
function might be, and whether they are one-to-one or one-to-many
functions (<span class="citation">Ganeri 2006</span>). Discussion of
linguistic functions is important for understanding epistemology, a
topic of interest primarily to Philosophy in contrast to Grammar and
Aesthetics (see the entry on
 <a href="../epistemology-india/">epistemology in classical Indian philosophy</a>).
 These thinkers focus on how testimonial uses of language are valid
means of knowledge, or <em>pramāṇa</em>, whether in
ordinary discourse or religious discourse such as the Vedas or the
Buddha’s speech. For one example, consider Nyāya
(“Logic School”), established by Akṣapāda
Gautama (ca 200 CE). In his <em>Aphorisms on Logic</em>
(<em>Nyāya-sūtra</em>, hereafter <em>NS</em>), which is the
Nyāya root text, he defines speech as being the assertion of an
authoritative person (<em>NS</em> 1.1.17). He then goes on to discuss
the relationship between primary and secondary meaning, and the basis
for figurative language use. His aim is to determine what the referent
of a noun is—a generic property, a particular thing, or some
combination.</p>

<p>
Aesthetic thinkers, especially beginning with Ānandavardhana,
focus on distinctions between the capacities of language.
Ānandavardhana himself is primarily concerned to defend the
existence of a new linguistic capacity, suggestion (on which see
 <a href="#SuggMeanSpeaInte">section 3</a>
 below). With illustrations drawn from courtly poetry, he argues that
phonemes, words, sentences, and entire discourse units can suggest
subtle meanings, associated with an aestheticized emotion or
“flavor” (<em>rasa</em>). It is up to later Aesthetic
theorists to explain the status of suggestion with regard to the
ordinary categories of linguistic capacities. Some, like Mukula
Bhaṭṭa (ca 9<sup>th</sup> century CE) give a reductionist
account on which it is equivalent to indication, whereas others, like
Bhaṭṭa Nāyaka (ca 900 CE) deny that it is a
linguistic capacity at all, but argue, rather, that it is
psychological. Aesthetic arguments for and against the various
linguistic capacities draw on philosophical texts from Nyāya as
well as Mīmāṃsā, the philosophers primarily
concerned with principles of Vedic exegesis.</p>

<h3 id="AppePhen">1.2 Appeals to Phenomenology</h3>

<p>
Definitions of meaning often appeal to phenomenology, the way in which
a cognition seems to arise from hearing a word or sentence. This focus
on the psychology of language use is found in all three textual
traditions of Grammar, Philosophy, and Aesthetics. For example, the
Mīmāṃsā (“Hermeneutics”) philosopher
Kumārila Bhaṭṭa (ca 7<sup>th</sup> century CE) writes
in his <em>Exposition on Ritual Practice</em>
(<em>Tantra-vārttika</em>, hereafter <em>TV</em>) that, like a
baby’s face as it is being born, the primary meaning is
perceived first, before anything else, such as secondary meaning
(<em>TV</em> 3.2.1). (The Sanskrit word for a face is <em>mukha</em>,
etymologically related to <em>mukhya</em>, the term for primary
meaning.) The Grammarian Bhartṛhari argues in his <em>Treatise
on Sentences and Words</em> (<em>Vākya-padīya</em>) that
division of sentences into words and phonemes is artificial. This is
in part based his observation that hearers understand meaning as a
unified whole. He claims that what conveys meaning is a
<em>sphoṭa</em>, or “burst”, which is partless and
different from the sequence of sounds composing a sentence (although
see
 <a href="#PraaMiim">section 4.3</a>
 and <span class="citation">Matilal (1990: 84ff)</span> for discussion
about how precisely to characterize <em>sphoṭa</em> in
relationship to meaning.) </p>

<p>
Aesthetic theorists focused on the psychology of the poet and the
hearer, in part to understand the relationship between ordinary
language and poetic language, but also to distinguish among the
varieties of poetic utterances. Among the psychological principles
widely accepted by Indian thinkers is that ordinary conventional
meanings are stronger than analytically-determined ones (<span class="citation">Raja
1969</span>). So the term
<em>paṅka-ja</em> has constituent parts which together mean
“mud-born” but conventionally refers to the lotus, and it
is the latter meaning which would come to a hearer’s mind first.
Aesthetic philosopher Mukula Bhaṭṭa (ca 9<sup>th</sup>
century) argues in his <em>Fundamentals of the Communicative
Function</em>
(<em>Abhidhā-vṛtti-mātṛkā</em>) that some
words become so conventionalized that their status as secondary
meaning is unavailable to the speaker, who takes herself to be
speaking literally (<span class="citation">McCrea 2008</span>).</p>

<p>
However, there is a limit to the role that reflection on psychology
plays in the analysis of meaning. For early
Mīmāṃsā philosophers, only Sanskrit terms have
genuine expressive capacities.This conclusion is not due to an
investigation of the psychology of non-Sanskrit speakers, but the
principle of parsimony. It is explanatorily better to posit a
fundamental language, where word and meaning are fixed in one-to-one
correspondence, which has been corrupted by mispronunciation over time
(see <em>TV</em> 1.3.24ff). So, hearing a foreign word like
<em>gavi</em>, people understand its meaning, “cow”,
through its similarity with the correct Sanskrit word
(<em>gauḥ</em>) whether or not they are aware of the process.
This view is challenged by later philosophers.</p>

<h3 id="RoleSansLang">1.3 Role of Sanskrit Language</h3>

<p>
Reflection on language in Indian philosophy, for the Brahminical,
Veda-accepting traditions at least, begins and ends with the Sanskrit
language, in what has been termed “the Sanskrit
cosmopolis” (<span class="citation">Pollock 2006</span>). It is
not merely that Sanskrit is the vehicle for reflection on language,
but the Sanskrit language itself is a target of inquiry.
Patañjali explains the reasons for this in his <em>Great
Commentary</em> (<em>Mahā-bhāṣya</em>), a commentary
on Kātyāyana’s 3<sup>rd</sup> century commentary on
Pāṇini’s <em>Eight Chapters</em>. These reasons are
largely centered on the preservation and correct performance of Vedic
rituals. Along with these pragmatic aims, there comes the belief in a
special metaphysical and epistemic status for Sanskrit—it has
natural (<em>autpattika</em>, without beginning) connections to its
referents, which other languages lack; thus, at least in the context
of the Vedas, it can give us infallible knowledge about the world,
without the corruption of fallible human intermediaries. This
conception is not shared by all orthoprax thinkers, however, as
Nyāya argues for the conventionality of language (<em>NS</em>
2.1.55).</p>

<p>
Traditions which reject Vedic authority also reject the primacy of
Sanskrit, largely preferring to write in Pāli. At a certain
point, however, and for unknown reasons, Buddhist thinkers such as
Nāgārjuna begin to write in Sanskrit (<span class="citation">Kelly
1996</span>). Regardless of which language they
employ, Buddhists reject the notion of an inherent connection between
the Sanskrit language and reality—indeed, they argue that no
language has such a connection—arguing as early on as the famous
<em>The Questions of King Milinda</em>
(<em>Milinda-pañhā</em>) that language is conventional.
The fact that Naiyāyikas and Buddhists agree on the conventional
nature of language shows that the religious prominence of Sanskrit
does not necessarily lead to specific philosophical commitments about
its referential capacities. However, those who take on the assumption
of an innate connection between Sanskrit word and referent then had
explanatory burdens, such as how to explain linguistic innovation
within Sanskrit and the referential capacities of non-Sanskrit
languages.</p>

<p>
Returning to the orthoprax traditions, we see that they make heavy use
of semantic etymology, an approach to language going back as far as
Yāska’s <em>Nirukta</em>. (This approach is also called
“speculative etymology”, as in Plato’s
<em>Cratylus</em>; see the entry on
 <a href="../word-meaning/#ClaTra">word meaning: classical traditions</a>.)
 Such etymology was employed to understand Vedic words, not in terms
of their actual linguistic history, but by the relationship between
similar constituent parts. Names of gods are often explained in this
manner: in one place, Indra is said to be “the kindler”
(<em>indha</em>) since he kindles (<em>indh</em>), and in another, he
is called “Indra” because “no one has withstood this
power (<em>idam indriyam</em>) in him” (<span class="citation">Bronkhorst
2001</span>). Though semantic etymology
has its roots in Vedic explication, this approach to word-meaning is
central to later Alaṁkāra analysis of bitextuality or
punning (<em>śleṣa</em>), discussed in
 <a href="#BitePoly">section 2.3</a>.
 Further, etymological meaning is one of the three commonly given
varieties of word-meaning: conventional (<em>rūḍhi</em>),
etymological (<em>yoga</em>), and etymological-and-conventional
(<em>yoga-rūḍhi</em>).</p>

<h2 id="PrimSecoMean">2. Primary and Secondary Meaning</h2>

<p>
One of the most central distinctions in Indian philosophy of language
is that between primary and secondary meaning. While this could be
characterized as the distinction between “literal” and
“non-literal” meaning, for some philosophers, word
meanings that seem intuitively literal are classified as being
secondary. For instance, the word “cow” in the sentence
“A cow is to be led out to pasture” would, according to
Mīmāṃsā philosophers following Kumārila (ca
660 CE, see entry on
 <a href="../kumaarila/">Kumārila</a>),
 be taken as an instance of secondary meaning, for reasons discussed
below. Further, since the literal/non-literal distinction in Western
philosophy of language is vexed (see the distinction

<h3 id="LexiMean">2.1 Lexical Meaning</h3>

<p>
Most classical Indian thinkers (the Buddhists being an important
exception, see
 <a href="#Budd">section 4.1</a>)
 understand word meaning, or <em>padârtha</em>, to refer to
objects in the world, and to do so directly. For these
thinkers—the Nyāya and Vaiśeṣika,
Mīmāṃsā—the referential function is
primary. However, despite broad agreement about the basic referential
function of words, they disagree about what its objects are. One such
dispute, which has implications for the primary/secondary distinction,
is over the relationship between words and universals. Kumārila,
following Śabara, argues that the primary referent of words is a
universal. Kumārila’s reasoning is that, without words
denoting the universal property belonging to, for example, all cows,
there would not be a permanent (<em>nitya</em>) relationship between
word and referent. For if “cow” means a specific cow,
Bessie, when Bessie goes out of existence, the word lacks denotation
(<span class="citation"><em>ŚV</em></span>). Further, the Vedic
injunction, “A cow is to be tied up”, can be followed in
numerous rituals—but if a specific cow were intended, it could
be followed only once. (This argument is found in early Grammatical
thought as well, see below.) Still, despite the fact that all
Mīmāṃsakas accept the requirement of fixity of word
and referent, they do not all accept the universal-denotation view.
Some agree with another philosopher, roughly contemporaneous with
Kumārila, Prabhākara (his followers are known as the
“Prābhākara”, with the long “ā”
equivalent to the English “-an” as in
“Fregean”). They reject the universal-denotation view in
connection with their view of sentence meaning (see
 <a href="#SentMean">section 5.1</a>).</p>
 

<p>
In contrast, in the <em>Aphorisms</em>, Gautama argues that words
refer to universals, qualities, and individual things. He points out
that universals are never instantiated without particular things, and
so the universal itself cannot be the referent.
Mīmāṃsā philosophers following Kumārila
continue to defend and refine the universals-denotation view, just as
Nyāya philosophers defend and refine the context-dependent view.
Vātsyāyana, for example, in the <em>Commentary on the
Aphorisms on Logic</em>
(<em>Nyāya-sūtra-bhāṣya</em>, hereafter
<em>NySBh</em>), argues for an epistemic point, that “It is not
known which among these is the object or meaning of the word, or
whether all of them might be meant” (<em>NySBh</em> ad 2.2.59;
Dasti and Phillips, forthcoming). He takes on arguments from
interlocutors who argue that only the individual or the universal is
meant by words. Commenting on Gautama’s central point,
Vātsyāyana observes that, to take the example of
“cow” again, one never encounters a bare particular
(individual). Rather, the individual cow, Bessie, is always found to
be qualified by the universal. <em>Ceteris paribis</em> for
universals, which do not exist apart from individuals. So it is not
possible to disambiguate whether the universal or the particular is
meant when we speak. </p>

<p>
Grammarians also consider the question of word reference.
Pāṇini takes at least a partial position on the question,
claiming that if words only refer to particulars, then someone who
ties up one cow for a sacrifice, in response to a Vedic command, would
be in error if they, in a later ritual, tie up another cow, as the
command could only refer to a single specific animal (<em>Eight
Chapters</em> 1.2.64). After him, Patañjali, in the <em>Great
Commentary</em>, refers to two earlier grammarians (whose work is not
independently available), Vyāḍi and Vājapyāyana,
who differ on this topic. Vyāḍi argues that words primarily
refer to particulars and Vājapyāyana claims they refer to
universals. Patañjali splits the difference, claiming that both
aspects are part of word-meaning, but which one is primary may vary
(see <span class="citation">Deshpande 2003</span>;
 <span class="citation"><em>VM</em></span>;
and <span class="citation">Matilal
1971</span>.) Matilal illustrates the moves
in the debate with the example of a compound, “a
brave-man” (Sanskrit: <em>vīra-puruṣaḥ</em>).
Vājapyāyana would argue that if “brave” refers
to the attribute of braveness, and “man” to the attribute
of manhood, then these two referents can be related together in an
underlying, unifying substratum (the
<em>sāmānâdhikaraṇya</em>). But if his opponent,
Vyāḍi, were correct, there would be no way to make sense of
the compound, since both terms would refer to the same individual, and
thus there would be repetition. However, by making use of the
distinction between expressed meaning and the implied ground for the
meaning, Vyāḍi could reply: yes, ‘brave’
strictly refers to a brave man, but this word is used because of the
man’s braveness, whereas the other word is used because of the
man’s being a man.</p>

<p>
Whether the primary word-function results in a particular or
universal, its aim is to form a basis for unhesitating action. Word
meaning is treated in the context of epistemology and the topic of
verbal testimony. The two sets of philosophers above,
Mīmāṃsā and Nyāya, both agree that verbal
testimony is a source of knowledge. However, for Nyāya
philosophers, testimony carries justificatory weight because of the
features of a speaker while Mīmāṃsā emphasizes
the innate, though defeasible, justificatory nature of statements,
regardless of speaker. While they believe that sentences
(<em>vākya</em>) are truth-bearers, and not individual words,
since sentences are composed of words, Nyāya and
Mīmāṃsā focus on the invariable contributions of
words to sentences—their primary meanings. This emphasis, we
will see, is not shared by everyone, as the grammarian
Bhartṛhari rejects any real distinction between words and
sentences, arguing that such divisions are unreal and arbitrary, even
if useful in some contexts.</p>

<h3 id="VariSecoMean">2.2 Varieties of Secondary Meaning</h3>

<p>
The distinction between primary and secondary meaning is such that any
kind of derivative meaning, whether it be metaphor, metonymy, irony,
hyperbole, punning, etc., is classified as “secondary”.
Again, we are in the realm of word-meanings, although there is
discussion of sentence-level secondary meaning, primarily in
Mīmāṃsā, Vedānta, and Alaṁkāra.
While the task of precisely carving up varieties of secondary meaning
was frequently left to the aesthetic theorists, philosophers also took
an interest in this question. Many stock examples of secondary meaning
are shared among the textual traditions, although it is not until much
later, in the seventeenth century, that Indian linguistic analysis
becomes robustly interdisciplinary. There are various ways to classify
secondary meaning: it may be based on the logical relationship between
primary and secondary meaning, on the semantic distance between them,
or on the role of speaker intention.</p>

<p>
For instance, Mukula Bhaṭṭa, the aforementioned Aesthetic
theorist, distinguishes between secondary meaning that is qualitative
and secondary meaning free from qualities. The qualitative includes
cases which Western rhetoric would call “metaphorical”,
such as “The person is an ox”, where the stubbornness of
the person and the ox are understood to be shared qualities. In
contrast, cases like “The village is on the Ganges” are
free from qualities. Here, the word “bank” is understood
so as to avoid the interpretation that the village is floating on the
river itself—but there are no properties shared between the
village and the Ganges (or the bank). In point of fact, this case
becomes more complex after Ānandavardhana points out that the
reason someone might utter this sentence is to suggest that the
village and the Ganges do share qualities—the holiness of the
Ganges river could be attributed to the village due to their
proximity. Thus whether a speaker intends or does not intend a
secondary meaning becomes relevant. Mukula argues that a speaker may
intend different secondary meanings with the same utterance type.
Finally, both the qualitative and quality-free varieties may differ in
terms of how closely related the primary and secondary meanings are.
Mukula describes highly conventional language use as cases of
“absorption”—for instance, using the term
“ruler” for to someone who is not from the ruling class
(so not strictly a ruler), but who performs the functions a ruler does
(such as protection of people). In contrast, metaphors such as
“The person is an ox” are not absorption, but
superimposition, since some difference is understood. (See Keating
2013 and McCrea 2008 for further discussion of Mukula and
Ānandavardhana on these topics.)</p>

<p>
All of these varieties of secondary meaning are necessitated by three
conditions. First, there must be an obstacle in the primary meaning of
the words. Second, there must some relationship—of which kind,
more below—between the primary and secondary meaning. Third,
there must be a warrant for the secondary meaning, such as a
motivation on the speaker’s part or some accepted conventional
sense. To take a stock example, “Feed the sticks”, the
word “sticks” refers to something which is inanimate and
which cannot be fed. Thus, the first condition is met—an
obstacle to what is called “semantic fit”
(<em>yogyatā</em>) which is necessary for a unified sentence.
Second, there is a relationship of association between brāhmin
priests and sticks—they carry walking sticks. Association is not
the only possible relationship between primary and secondary meaning,
but it is one, and it fulfills the second condition. Finally, a
speaker using this phrase would be trading on a conventionalized use,
and thus meets the third condition, of warrant.</p>

<p>
While this three-fold set of conditions is commonly accepted, given
different analyses of primary word-meaning, the boundary between
primary and secondary meaning will be drawn differently. For instance,
Bhāṭṭa Mīmāṃsā, which
understands the primary word-meaning as being a universal, find cases
of secondary meaning more pervasive than the Nyāya, for whom
word-meaning in the primary sense is more flexible. Given the command,
“A cow is to be tied up”, the correct thing to do is to
find some single cow to fasten to a post. However,
Mīmāṃsā argues that the primary meaning of
“cow” in the command is <span class="sc">cowhood</span>
and cannot be fastened by means of a rope. Thus there is an obstacle
to the semantic fit of the sentence. To resolve this difficulty,
Kumārila invokes the secondary meaning function known as
indication (<em>lakṣaṇā</em>). In <em>TV</em> 1.3.10,
he argues that indication causes hearers to understand that an
individual cow is meant. Hearers understand this from the knowledge
that “cow” means <span class="sc">cowhood</span>, that
individual cows are qualified by <span class="sc">cowhood</span>, and
yet that the sentence is uttered for the purpose of fulfilling
sacrificial aims. Thus the relationship between the primary and
secondary meanings here is inherence (a universal inheres in an
individual), and the speaker aims to pick out a particular cow.</p>

<p>
One of the central categories of secondary meaning is those meanings
which have similarities with the primary meaning. For instance,
Kumārila takes qualitative expression
(<em>gauṇa-vṛtti</em>), figures based on similarities, to
be one of the two major types of secondary meaning, where indication
(<em>lakṣaṇā</em>) is a catch-all category for
figures based on any other kind of relationship. The figure of speech
which Western rhetoric calls “metaphor” would fall under
qualitative expression, although Indian thinkers generally focus on
the logical structure underlying figures rather than a syntactic
structure by which metaphor in the West is often characterized (<span class="citation">Gerow
1971</span>). Kumārila discusses the
common example “Devadatta is a lion”, saying that when
people hear the utterance, they find the word “lion” to be
inexplicable as referring to Devadatta, and therefore conclude that
the term must be used figuratively. However, while some thinkers would
describe metaphors as involving a superimposition of lion on
Devadatta, Kumārila explicitly rejects this analysis, saying that
all that is meant is that there are similar properties that the two
have, such as bravery. Otherwise, superimposition would mean there is
confusion about the genuine difference between people and lions. One
might object that the three examples just given: “Feed the
sticks”, “A cow is to be tied up”, and
“Devadatta is a lion” do not all have the same kind of
obstacle. Philosophers and aesthetic theorists alike work to make the
nature of this failure precise. While initially the emphasis is on the
semantic connection within the sentence itself, for Nyāya and
Mīmāṃsā both, by the time of Maṇḍana
Miśra (ca seventh century CE) and Vācaspati Miśra (ca
tenth century CE), the failure is taken to be wider, including
problems with the larger context. In the ninth century work of Mukula
Bhaṭṭa, such a widening is apparent as he distinguishes
between multiple features of context which may require a word to be
taken in a secondary sense: a speaker, sentence, time, place, and
circumstance. Sometimes there is a clash between a speaker and a
sentence meaning, as in the case taken from courtly love
poetry—a common source of linguistic examples—where a
young woman utters words, “I go alone to the forest along the
riverbank” to a neighbor. She is to be understood as conveying
the opposite (she is not going alone) to her neighbor, but intending
her husband to overhear and believe she is telling the truth. Since we
know facts through the poetic context about the woman’s personal
life, Mukula argues that the sentence cannot be taken to mean the
literal truth.</p>

<h3 id="BitePoly">2.3 Bitextuality and Polysemy</h3>

<p>
An important phenomenon in Indian poetry, double meaning
(<em>śleṣa</em>), garnered the attention of
Alaṅkāra thinkers and, to a lesser extent, philosophers and
grammarians. At its most basic level, the figure involves using a
single word in two or more different senses. It is akin to what is
described as “punning” in Western rhetoric, but without
the connotation of triviality that often accompanies puns, hence the
term “bitextuality” rather than “punning”
(<span class="citation">Bronner 2010</span>). In fact, according to
Rudraṭa, in his <em>Ornaments of Poetry</em>
(<em>Kāvyâlaṅkāra</em>, ca 855 CE), bitextuality
is the perfect figure of speech (<span class="citation">Gerow
1977</span>). The phenomenon in Sanskrit was not limited to a word or
two, here and there, but entire compositions were written which admit
of two different meanings. One of the most prominent examples is of
poems which, read one way tell the story of the
<em>Rāmāyaṇa</em>, and read another way, narrate the
<em>Mahābhārata</em>. Examples are difficult to translate
into English, since they rely on particularities of Sanskrit: word
breaks which are frequently joined together, the ubiquity of
compounds, and the fact of phonemic transformation at word-boundaries
(<em>sandhi</em>) which can be reconstructed in multiple ways. For
instance, <em>dāsyasītyuktvā</em> can be disambiguated
as <em>dāsy asīty uktvā</em> (saying, “you are my
slave”) or <em>dāsyasīty uktvā</em> (saying [to
myself] “you will give!”) (<span class="citation">Bronner
2010:</span> xvii).</p>

<p>
This particular linguistic device is not merely a figurative ornament,
but is at the center of a major intellectual and literary movement.
Lexicons are created containing stipulated meanings for syllables in
order to assist in creating bitextual compositions and commentaries
are written which tease out the multiplicities inherent in poems,
whether or not they are intended by the author. <span class="citation">Bronner
(2010)</span> identifies several ways in
which the existence of bitextuality was a sticking point for theorists
trying to give an account of word-meaning and the relationship between
meaning and aesthetics. First, there is the difficulty of identifying
a particular logical structure underpinning bitextuality. Second,
there is the question of whether bitextuality’s effects are due
to word-meaning or to the sounds of words. Finally, there is the
problem of the psychology of bitextuality.</p>

<p>
One reason that bitextuality resists easy classification is that the
multiple “registers” (ways of reading the text), such as
the story of the <em>Rāmāyaṇa</em> and the
<em>Mahābhārata</em> mentioned above, are not merely two
distinct sets of unrelated meanings. Rather, similes or metaphors
frequently connect the readings. For instance,
Dhanañjaya’s “Poem of Two Targets”, through
setting the <em>Rāmāyaṇa</em> and the
<em>Mahābhārata</em> “side-by-side” allows the
reader to contrast the protagonists of the two epics (<span class="citation">Bronner
2010:</span> 110). Further, even where such
relationships are not obvious, given the important principle that
non-literal utterances must be supported by some warrant, whether
conventional or due to speaker aims, most Sanskrit thinkers argued
that no one would utter a sentence with two meanings that are
unrelated. Mahima Bhaṭṭa (11<sup>th</sup> century CE), in
his <em>Analysis of “Manifestation”</em>
(<em>Vyakti-viveka</em>), argues that paranomasia, as a kind of
meaning, must be coherent in the sense of having semantic fit, even
if, as a kind of secondary meaning, there are cues which lead the
reader to go beyond the strictly literal sense. However, unlike cases
of metaphor, where there is an obstacle to semantic fit, as in
“Devadatta is a lion”, bitextuality requires that there be
(at least) two sets of coherent meanings which have semantic fit and
also that there be a way to bring both meanings together. Further,
since the trigger for bitextuality cannot be a failure of semantic
fit, there must be some cue other than just the mere possibility of
reading a sentence in two ways (<span class="citation">McCrea
2008</span>). Ānandavardhana, however, who comes two centuries
before Mahima Bhaṭṭa, argues that there may be bitextual
poems in which two sets of meanings do not cause a further metaphor or
simile (<span class="citation">Bronner 2010:</span> 204; <span class="citation">McCrea
2008:</span> 434).</p>

<h2 id="SuggMeanSpeaInte">3. Suggested Meaning and Speaker’s Intention</h2>

<p>
During the ninth century CE, Ānandavardhana argues for a new
linguistic capacity, suggestion (<em>dhvani</em> or
<em>vyañjanā</em>), which he argues accounts for important
phenomena not included within existing theories of secondary meaning.
His proposal is elaborated on by his commentator, Abhinavagupta, who
engages more explicitly with existing philosophical theories, and as a
result of these two writers (authoring the <em>Light on
Suggestion</em> and <em>The Eye</em>, respectively), a new debate
opens . It is not much taken up in philosophical circles in the
Classical period—the Nyāya philosopher Jayanta
Bhaṭṭa (ca ninth century CE) has a stray remark
disparaging suggestion in his <em>Flower Garland of Logic</em>
(<em>Nyāya-mañjarī</em>) but with little development.
The debate centers on whether the existing theories of language can
account for the subtleties of meaning found in courtly poetry,
<em>kāvya</em>. Those who agree that suggestion must be accepted
discuss what kinds of suggested meaning ought to be adduced; those who
reject suggestion generally try to show that for each putative
category of suggested meaning, an equivalent explanation can be given,
through existing explanations such as indication or inferential
reasoning.</p>

<h3 id="InsuExisCapa">3.1 Insufficiency of Existing Capacities</h3>

<p>
Ānandavardhana proceeds by citing passages which are generally
accepted to have various kinds of poetic effects, and then analyzing
how these effects are attained by suggestion. He divides the content
of what is suggested into implied meanings, implied figures, and
aesthetic moods (<em>rasa</em>). He also distinguishes among varieties
of suggested meaning according to other criteria such as the
speaker’s intention, how rapidly the hearer recovers the
suggested content, and whether expressions or phonemes are the basis
for what is suggested. When suggestion is a way of conveying the
<em>rasa</em>, the dominant aesthetic mood described or intimated
within a poem, it is called <em>rasa-dhvani</em>. Ānandavardhana
tries to give an account of when it is that suggestion causes poetic
beauty, and argues that <em>rasa</em> is the proper aim of all poetry.
It is important to mark that, for Ānandavardhana, <em>rasa</em>
is found within the text, and not the reader. The reader simply comes
to have a cognition of the text’s <em>rasa</em>. Thus it is
easily understood as meaning, and not a reader’s emotional
state. After Abhinavagupta’s commentary on Ānandavardhana,
the emphasis shifts onto the reader’s emotive experience, and
how to understand <em>rasa</em> in relation to other kinds of meaning
becomes more difficult. Even though many things may be suggested
(figures of speech, facts), the ultimate aim of <em>dhvani</em> or
suggestion in the poetic context is to suggest <em>rasa</em>.</p>

<p>
Take the case of “The village is on the Ganges”. Here,
Ānandavardhana argues that suggestion operates after both primary
and secondary meaning. What is suggested is the purity of the village
which is on the bank of the holy Ganges river. Note, though, that he
does not think that both primary and secondary meaning are always
necessary for suggestion. For instance, the word “Ganges”
itself could suggest purity without being in a metaphorical or
otherwise figurative context (here, it is metonymical).
Ānandavardhana also contrasts the function of suggestion with the
primary meaning function. As for the latter, he says the relationship
between the composition of words in a sentence and its primary meaning
is a “natural relation”. The sense in which the
word—referent relation is “natural” is that it is
fixed. A word’s primary meaning is that meaning which is
cognized in every single instance the word is employed. Suggestion, in
contrast, is an “artificial relation” since it is a
meaning that is not given by its natural word, and the relationship
between suggested meaning and a suggestive word is not
one—to—one.</p>

<p>
On Ānandavardhana’s view, the suggested meaning is a
further step beyond the secondary meaning, but is not necessarily
understood through what is secondarily meant. For example, what is
suggested in this case is understood through the primary meaning of
“Ganges”, since it is the river and not the bank which is
associated with purity and coolness. The crucial aspect of
Ānandavardhana’s view is that while secondary meaning
requires a failure of semantic fit, suggestion does not. A
hearer’s understanding of “on the Ganges” as meaning
“on the bank of the Ganges” is necessary in order for the
sentence not to cause a cognition of a village as floating upon the
Ganges. In contrast, the suggested sense does not rectify any apparent
semantic incompatibility in the literal meaning of the sentence.</p>

<h3 id="VariSuggMean">3.2 Varieties of Suggested Meaning</h3>

<p>
While one can present a definitive number of types of suggestion
(Abhinavagupta says there are thirty-five), Ānandavardhana
himself says there are an endless number of combinations if we take
into account all of the facts involved in creating suggested meaning.
Whether this should be taken literally or as a rhetorical flourish,
the point is that Ānandavardhana does not view his analysis as a
complete taxonomy of suggested meaning. In keeping with this spirit,
only a few of the important divisions are discussed below.</p>

<p>
Ānandavardhana subdivides suggestion in two ways based on two
kinds of intentions a speaker has with regard to the expression she
utters. This is consistent with his view that underlying all cases of
suggestion there is a purpose (<em>prayojana</em>) the speaker has in
choosing a particular expression. In particular, these intentions are
defined in terms of the speaker’s attitude towards the primary
meaning of an expression. First, a speaker may intend to convey the
primary meaning plus some suggested meaning. Second, she may not
intend to convey the primary meaning, but only have an intention to
convey a suggested meaning.</p>

<p>
As an example of the first type, Ānandavardhana cites love poetry
written by the Buddhist philosopher Dharmakīrti (ca
6<sup>th</sup> to 7<sup>th</sup> century CE, see the entry on
 <a href="../dharmakiirti/">Dharmakīrti</a>).
 The poem describes images of birds and fruit which are meant to be
taken literally. However, these images are juxtaposed in a way which
suggests an additional sense consistent with the romantic tone of the
poem. There is no explicit comparison between the images, but the
comparison is suggested. This kind of suggestion is something like the
phenomenon in Ezra Pound’s famous imagist poem, “In a
Station of a Metro”</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The apparition of these faces in the crowd;
<br />
Petals on a wet, black bough. (<span class="citation">Pound
1913</span>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The poet does not necessarily want the hearer to take the natural
imagery <em>as a metaphor</em> but to see comparisons between the two
images. Thus there is both primary and suggested meaning. Other times,
Ānandavardhana says, the speaker intends only to convey a
suggested meaning, so the primary meaning may be entirely replaced or
set aside in some manner. For example, in this passage from the
<em>Rāmāyaṇa</em>, the phrase “blinded” is
not being used in a primary sense, but in a suggestive manner:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The sun has stolen our affection for the moon,
<br />
whose circle is now dull with frost
<br />
and like a mirror blinded by breath,
<br />
shines no more. (<span class="citation"><em>DL</em>:</span> 209)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Since a mirror cannot, strictly speaking, be made blind—breath
merely fogs it—this is a case where suggestion is intended to
replace the primary meaning.</p>

<p>
While the previous categories are distinguished by the speaker’s
aims, the next two categories are distinguished by the hearer’s
experience. Ānandavardhana says that when hearers come to
understand the suggested meaning of a poem, they can do so either
instantaneously or else after a “reverberation”—some
experienced temporal gap between recovering the literal meaning and
recovering the suggested meaning. The suggested content characterized
by reverberation is similar to what contemporary philosophers talk
about in terms of the metaphorical “felt gap” between
literal and metaphorical meanings in particular (e.g., <span class="citation">Camp
&amp; Reimer 2008</span>). However, it also
includes the idea of a temporal gap between understanding the literal
and suggested meaning. The phenomenological observation can, and
should, be distinguished from a claim about content recovery.
Ānandavardhana does not appeal to the phenomenology of suggested
meanings as evidence that they are recovered in a certain way, though
such a move was certainly available to him, as we have seen in
 <a href="#AppePhen">section 1.2</a>.</p>
 
<p>
Ānandavardhana categorizes a case of bitextuality
(<em>śleṣa</em>) as reverberation, as both meanings do not
occur to the reader simultaneously. Further he describes this as a
case where the sentence (rather than individual words) suggests a
second meaning, which comes like a “reverberation” or some
time after the first. This supports the idea that reverberation is
about processing time, rather than (or in addition to) a felt tension.
Elsewhere, Ānandavardhana points out that for many kinds of
suggestion, hearers do not have a “reverberation” or
awareness of a gap between the primary meaning and what is suggested.
Abhinavagupta gives an analogy to explain cases where there is no such
reverberation. He says that when someone has taken to heart the
relationship between smoke and fire, she will be able to reason
inferentially to the existence of fire simply on the perceptual basis
of smoke. There need not be any awareness of inferential processes on
the part of the thinker.</p>

<p>
Ānandavardhana distinguishes in a number of other ways between
varieties of suggestion. He identifies the basis of suggestion: word
meanings, sentence meanings, discourse unit meanings, and even the
sounds of individual phonemes can all give rise to suggested meaning.
A poem’s entire “meaning”, that is, a comparison
which may not be explicit in the poem, but is suggested throughout,
can itself be the basis for a suggested <em>rasa</em>, such as love or
heroism. At a more local level, individual phonemes within a poem may
also suggest an aesthetic mood, through being sonorous or harsh, etc.
These distinctions within suggested meaning underscore the need for
caution in drawing equivalence between suggestion and Western
pragmatic categories, such as implicature (see the entry on
 <a href="../implicature/">implicature</a>)
 which is roughly analogous to, but not co-extensive with,
Ānandavardhana’s <em>dhvani</em>.</p>

<h3 id="ObjeSuggMean">3.3 Objections to Suggested Meaning</h3>

<p>
Although Ānandavardhana’s theory of suggested meaning was
influential for many Aesthetic theorists in the years following his
<em>Light on Suggestion</em>, not everyone accepted the new model.
There were two ways of rejecting suggestion: reducing it to a
non-linguistic capacity or reducing it to an already-existing
linguistic capacity—primary or secondary meaning. The first
strategy is followed, in different ways, by Bhaṭṭa
Nāyaka and Mahima Bhaṭṭa, whereas the second is
followed by Mukula Bhaṭṭa and members of the
Prābhākara school of Mīmāṃsā.</p>

<p>
In his <em>Mirror of the Heart</em>, Bhaṭṭa Nāyaka
(ca. 900 CE) argues that Ānandavardhana is mistaken to think of
<em>rasa</em> as something like linguistic meaning, and instead
focuses on the emotional response of the reader (<span class="citation">Pollock
2016</span>). His argument is that
<em>rasa</em> cannot be the kind of thing which is the meaning of a
sentence—it is an experiential event which is caused by
sentences. Drawing on Mīmāṃsā hermeneutics, which
emphasize the way in which Vedic language causes hearers to follow
injunctions, Bhaṭṭa Nāyaka proposes a multi-part
process in which the primary meaning function operates in a normal
manner, but subsequently there is what Pollock calls an
“aesthetic text-event” that unifies the disparate parts of
a poem through a generalizing power (<em>bhāvakatva</em>, <span class="citation">De
1960</span> and <span class="citation">Pollock
2016</span>). The audience has the ability to enjoy (Pollock:
“experientialize”) the result through a particular
aesthetic capability (<em>bhojakatva</em>), and the result is a
transcendent, rapturous experience of <em>rasa</em>.</p>

<p>
Mahima Bhaṭṭa (ca. 1025 CE) does not consider
<em>rasa</em> anything more than an emotion which has been stabilized
into the object of a particular kind of aesthetic enjoyment. His
<em>Analysis of “Manifestation”</em> argues that, since
the characters in a poem are unreal, the emotions they are
experiencing are also unreal, and must be inferred, or imputed to
them. All of the talk of “manifesting” <em>rasa</em> is
itself a figure of speech, on Mahima Bhaṭṭa’s view.
In addition, he argues that any putative “secondary
meaning” such as indication (<em>lakṣaṇā</em>)
is also inferred. Primary meaning is evidence for an inference based
on rules of pervasion (<em>vyāpti</em>) between the primary
meaning and secondary or suggested meaning. This position is
criticized by later thinkers, since the relationship between primary
meaning and these other meanings do not easily admit of
universalizable regularities, and they are often defeasible (see the entry
on
 <a href="../logic-india/">logic in classical Indian philosophy</a>
 for discussion of inference).</p>

<p>
Like Bhaṭṭa Nāyaka and Mahima Bhaṭṭa,
Mukula Bhaṭṭa agrees with Ānandavardhana that there
are poetic phenomena that require explanation. He argues that, rather
than posit the third linguistic capacity of suggested meaning, we
should take the existing category of secondary meaning, indication
(<em>lakṣaṇā</em>), as an explanation. His
<em>Fundamentals of the Communicative Function</em>, through analysis
of many of the stock examples of suggestion in the <em>Light on
Suggestion</em>, identifies the necessary features which trigger
indication: an obstacle in the primary meaning, a relationship between
the primary and indicated meaning, and a motive or conventional basis
for the indicated meaning. Mukula argues that it is possible to have
cases of indicated meaning which do not completely replace the primary
meaning. Despite his careful delineation of the varieties of indicated
meaning, and a monograph which draws on grammar, philosophy, and
aesthetic theory, Mukula’s work is influential only insofar as
later Aesthetic theorist Mammaṭa excerpts parts of it in his
<em>Illumination of Poetry</em>
(<em>Kāvya-prakāśa</em>) (<span class="citation">McCrea
2008</span>).</p>

<p>
Rather than explain suggested meaning as part of secondary meaning,
the Prābhākara school of Mīmāṃsā
prefers to incorporate it into primary meaning. Their position, which
is discussed in more detail below, criticizes the
Bhāṭṭa distinction between primary and secondary
meaning. On their view, word meanings do not—as per the
Bhāṭṭa Mīmāṃsā view—have a
fixed primary meaning regardless of sentence context. Instead, the
meaning of a word will vary depending on its relationship with other
words in a given sentence. Thus a word can carry a putatively
“suggested” meaning simply through force of context.
Ānandavardhana himself criticizes this position, arguing that
suggested meaning function has a different object, since it does not
result directly from the word, but from the primary meaning of the
word. For instance, the well-known case of “A village is on the
Ganges” suggests the purity of the village—but this cannot
be the primary meaning of the word “Ganges” even
contextually. It is an additional meaning, conveyed subsequent to the
ordinary meaning of “Ganges” (<span class="citation"><em>DL</em></span>).</p>

<h2 id="CritDist">4. Criticizing the Distinction</h2>

<p>
Not all thinkers accept that there is a genuine difference between
primary and secondary meaning. The rejection of this distinction
happens in several different ways. First, and most radically, one
might flatten the distinction to the point at which all language is
equally “non-literal”, and reject the idea that there is a
foundational stratus of meaning. This is the view of some Buddhists,
although just how to cash out their linguistic skepticism is a
significant question. Second, one might argue that while there is a
pragmatic reason to distinguish between primary and secondary meaning,
this distinction does not map onto any genuine facts about language or
its relationship with the world. Loosely, this is the view of
Grammarian Bhartṛhari, whose <em>sphoṭa</em> or
“burst” theory argues that words are simply useful
heuristics, but not real in any interesting sense. Finally, one might
argue that word-meanings are highly context-dependent to the extent
that it is not useful to think of a single “primary”
meaning for a word. This is the position of Prābhākara
Mīmāṃsā who do, however, make room for secondary
meaning in a sense.</p>

<h3 id="Budd">4.1 Buddhism</h3>

<p>
Buddhism and Jainism, two so-called “heteroprax”
(Veda-rejecting) traditions in India, put forward analyses of language
which challenge the notion of a distinction between primary and
secondary meaning, at least as drawn in the orthoprax schools.
Significant textual work—as well as secondary
scholarship—remains to be done in the area of how both of these
traditions (especially Jainism) understand language, but there are
some clear themes.</p>

<p>
Buddhist thinkers are broadly committed to error theories about
ordinary language use. As noted already, early Buddhists, in texts
such as <em>The Questions of King Milinda</em>
(<em>Milinda-pañhā</em>), argue for a kind of
conventionalism: language which seems to refer to persistent whole
objects, such as chariots and persons, does not, as such objects are
taken to lack true existence. Later philosophical reflection, such as
in the <em>Commentary on the Treasury of Dharma</em>
(<em>Abhidharma-kośa-bhāṣya</em>) of Vasubandhu (ca
fourth to fifth century CE, see the entry on
 <a href="../vasubandhu/">Vasubandhu</a>),
 presents a kind of local 
 <a href="../fictionalism/">fictionalism</a>
 or reductionism, as the only truly existing things are atomic simples
which exist momentarily. Thus, all language is, save for claims about
ultimately real constituent parts, loose speech. Buddhist philosophy
of language is famous for its “two truths” doctrine (see
the entry on
 <a href="../twotruths-india/">the theory of two truths in India</a>),
 the notion that there is conventional truth and ultimate
truth—but this gets cashed out variously among the later schools
such as Yogacāra and Madhyamaka (see <span class="citation">Siderits
2003</span> and <span class="citation">Garfield
2006</span>).</p>

<p>
A commitment to the ubiquitous nature of non-literal speech is seen
explicitly in Buddhist texts which pick up on the existing categories
in Grammarian and Aesthetic thought, such as comparative
superimposition or metaphor (<em>upacāra</em>), and employ them
to undermine the orthoprax theories of language which were realist and
referential in nature (<span class="citation">Gold 2007</span> and
<span class="citation">Tzohar 2011</span>). For instance, the
Yogacāra Buddhist Sthiramati, in his <em>Commentary on the Thirty
Verses</em> (<em>Triṃśikā-bhāṣya</em>) (ca
sixth century CE), cites a common Grammarian definition of
<em>upacāra</em>, noting that use of the term “self”
and “things” is an instance of such figurative talk
 (<span class="citation">Tzohar 2016</span>). Not only is the self, when
talked about in apparently ordinary ways, really being talked about
indirectly, but this is so for all words which, on Sthiramati’s
Yogācāra view, refer to an individual’s conscious
experience of qualities, and not things in themselves. For Sthiramati,
at least, there is a sense in which all language is
“metaphorical”, though grounded in the conscious arising
and perishing of experiential events, rather than a (putatively)
objective external reality.</p>

<p>
Another way in which this conventionalism plays out is in the
development of the <em>apoha</em> theory of concepts, which has
important implications for how language functions. The term
‘<em>apoha</em>’ means “exclusion” and is
first presented in the work of fifth to sixth century CE philosopher
Diṅnāga
 (see the entry on 
<a href="../dharmakiirti/#AboTheApo">Dharmakīrti</a>, and
the discussion of the theory of <em>apoha</em>).
 The theory of exclusion is meant to explain how we can have
conceptual connections (linguistic or otherwise) with the world even
though, on the Buddhist view, reality is ultimately a series of
unique, momentarily-existing, ineffable particulars. Without
universals or qualities, the Buddhists have a difficulty explaining,
how talk of a “blue lotus”, for instance, is possible.
Their ingenious solution, much debated after Diṅnāga, is to
propose that we carve up the world conceptually by negation. Blueness
is not a universal, but the exclusion of all non-blue particular
things—it is to be “not non-blue”. How this theory
works in detail is the subject of Dharmakīrti’s work (ca
sixth to seventh century CE) and a whole host of later thinkers, such
as Ratnakīrti (ca eleventh century CE). The Aesthetic theorist
Bhāmaha (ca sixth to seventh century CE) criticizes
<em>apoha</em> in his <em>Ornaments of Poetry</em>
(<em>Kāvyâlaṅkāra</em>), but not with regard to
any distinction between primary and secondary meaning. Rather, he
argues that the sense of a word is positive, and that on
<em>apoha</em>, Buddhists are assigning two capacities to
words—exclusion and positive designation—when there is
only one (<span class="citation"><em>KB</em></span>).
Mīmāṃsā and Nyāya philosophers likewise
criticize <em>apoha</em> extensively on these and similar grounds.</p>

<p>
Another way in which Buddhist thought makes use of figurative language
analysis is in its approach to hermeneutics, with regard to the
interpretation of <em>sūtra</em> passages, not unlike the way in
which Vedic hermeneutics both informs and is informed by
Mīmāṃsā philosophical reflection on language.
Buddhist hermeneutics, despite its being positioned
“outside” of the orthopraxy, employs lists of figures
which pre-date the rise of the textual tradition of Sanskrit poetics,
in a way which demonstrates that there were links between the
Grammarian, Nyāya, Mīmāṃsā, and Buddhist
theories of meaning (<span class="citation">Tzohar 2011</span>). A
crucial concept in Buddhist hermeneutics, which does utilize a
distinction between literal and non-literal, is that of
<em>upāya</em> or “skillful means”. With the
assumption that the Buddha speaks both truthfully and with an eye
towards the abilities of his particular audience, the notion of
“skillful means” allowed Buddhist hermeneuticists to
explain apparently contradictory elements within Buddhist texts. As
with Bhāṭṭa Mīmāṃsā, recourse to
secondary meaning in the face of apparent contradiction, skillful
means allowed for truth-preservation while constraining the
interpretive process.</p>

<h3 id="Jain">4.2 Jainism</h3>

<p>
Originating with Mahāvīra, who lives around the same time as
Siddhārtha Gautama, the founder of Buddhism (sixth century BCE),
Jainism is known for its emphasis on language’s representational
limitations. This is because of their view that reality is
multi-faceted (<em>anekânta-vāda</em>) and any single
description will necessarily involve some apparent contradiction, due
to the fact that it is incomplete (<span class="citation">Balcerowicz
2001</span>). Without relativization to a standpoint (<em>naya</em>),
the sentences “<em>o</em> is <em>P</em>” and
“<em>o</em> is not-<em>P</em>” are contradictory. To
address this, Jainas propose that there are seven ways to characterize
any purported fact, each one preceded by a marker of uncertainty,
<em>syāt</em>. Any object <em>o</em> and its property <em>P</em>
can be described as:</p>

<ol>

<li><em>o</em> is <em>P</em>.</li>

<li><em>o</em> is not-<em>P</em>.</li>

<li><em>o</em> is both <em>P</em> and not-<em>P</em>.</li>

<li><em>o</em> is beyond words.</li>

<li><em>o</em> is beyond words and <em>P</em>.</li>

<li><em>o</em> is beyond words and not-<em>P</em>.</li>

<li><em>o</em> is beyond words and both <em>P</em> and
not-<em>P</em>.</li>
</ol>

<p>
This seven-fold schema is found in many Jaina texts, from the early
works of Kundakunda (3<sup>rd</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> centuries) up to
the to the important <em>Flower Garland of Conditional
Predication</em> (<em>Syād-vāda-mañjarī</em>) of
Malliṣeṇa (13<sup>th</sup> century CE). While some, like
<span class="citation">Priest (2008)</span>, have argued that this
seven-fold classification scheme lends itself to a
 <a href="../logic-paraconsistent/">paraconsistent</a>
 (and perhaps also
 <a href="../dialetheism/">dialethic</a>) formalization, it need
 not be, as within the scheme,
each of the seven standpoints follows the law of non-contradiction,
though within a many-valued truth-system 
(<span class="citation">Ganeri 2002</span>;
 <span class="citation">Schang 2013</span>). The emphasis is,
 instead, upon relativizing the truth of
an utterance to a particular context, in the sense that each
standpoint restricts the context, as Balcerowicz notes, through
indices such as space, time, convention, and so on
 (<span class="citation">Balcerowicz 2001</span>). (Balcerowicz also questions
whether modern formalization is an eisegetical enterprise, reading
into the text conceptions of axiomatization which were not present;
see <span class="citation">Balcerowicz 2015</span>.) Minimally,
according to Siddharṣigaṇi (ca tenth century CE), one must
include in one’s analysis of any given utterance the
speaker’s intention and the relevant linguistic connections
(<span class="citation">Clerbout, Gorisse, &amp; Rahman 2011</span>).
The schema, further, is hierarchically ordered, so that each
standpoint includes more indices than the prior, according to
Malliṣeṇa (<span class="citation">Balcerowicz
2001</span>).</p>

<p>
Emphasis on speaker’s intention is crucial for Jainas,
especially insofar as they hold to a division between two standpoints:
the ordinary standpoint (<em>vyavahāra-naya</em>) and the
transcendent or ultimate standpoint (<em>niścaya-naya</em>,
<em>pāramârthika-naya</em>). Ultimately speaking, language
cannot be said to have any inherent communicative power, but rather
has it due to the speaker’s authority and position as having
unmediated access to the truth. In fact, the Jainas hold that
scriptures containing the words of Mahāvīra are not
efficacious due to the words themselves—a stark contrast to the
Mīmāṃsā view of an unauthored Veda—but due
to a unique suggestive power as well as the religious purity of the
listener. As a result of these principles, any single utterance is
susceptible to a number of different analyses. <span class="citation">Flügel
(2010)</span> distinguishes between four
kinds of analysis in Jaina thinking about language:</p>

<ol>

<li>Principles and criteria for religious speech</li>

<li>General rules and clauses for language usage</li>

<li>Context-sensitive rules for proper ways of speaking</li>

<li>Examples considering social implications</li>
</ol>

<p>
The existence of normative criteria governing language use, aiming at
the avoidance of harm (<em>ahiṁsā</em>) and the
preservation of truth (<em>satya</em>) can be compared to Gricean
conversational maxims, although the intentional flouting of these
principles does not lead to conversational implicatures. In fact,
Jaina doctrines discourage ambiguity and emphasize precise speech
(<span class="citation">Flügel 2010</span>).</p>

<h3 id="PraaMiim">4.3 Prābhākara Mīmāṃsā</h3>

<p>
In their explanation of word-meaning, Prābhākara
Mīmāṃsā emphasizes the relationship of words with
one another in a token utterance. Śālikanātha (ca.
7<sup>th</sup> century CE), in his <em>Monograph in Five Chapters</em>
(<em>Prakaraṇa-pañcikā</em>), argues that, to avoid
multiplying denotative capacities for words in different contexts, one
should posit the ability for words to denote meanings-in-relation.
This position is called “denotation of what is related”
(<em>anvitâbhidhāna</em>) and it is opposed to the
Bhāṭṭa Mīmāṃsā analysis given
earlier. Central to Prābhākara arguments is the principle of
parsimony. On the Bhāṭṭa view, there are multiple
levels of meaning and a complex process of moving from a word to a
word meaning to a unified sentence which connects those meanings.
Prābhākara argues that it would be better to explain the
connected word meaning as being understood directly from the word. The
idea that the same operation is responsible for unifying the word
meanings into a sentence anticipates, to a degree, Frege’s idea
of word meanings as unsaturated entities, although
Prābhākara is not thinking in the same ontological terms
(see the discussion of semantic power and the reduction of semantic properties in 
the entry on 
 <a href="../early-modern-india/#SemPowRedSemPro">analytic philosophy in the entry on early modern India</a>,
 and <span class="citation">Siderits 1991</span>).</p>

<p>
Prābhākara denies that the meaning of a “cow” is
a universal and indication is necessary to shift to a particular cow.
Śālikanātha argues that while it may be true that
something the same is remembered in each case when someone says
“cow”, this remnant of memory is not the same thing as a
word meaning (<span class="citation"><em>PS</em>: 381ff</span>).
Meaning has to do with the role that a word’s cognition plays
within a sentence. Further, he argues that a word conveys the
universal and the particular together, since the first cannot be
understood without the second. So, while he agrees with the
Bhāṭṭa that a series of universals cannot be
connected together in a qualificative relationship, he concludes that
this is a reason to reject the view that words primarily communicate
generalities (<em>sāmānya</em>), arguing that they must
communicate a qualified thing (<em>viśeṣana</em>).</p>

<p>
However, Śālikanātha does leave room for the
distinction between primary and secondary meaning in cases like
“The village is on the Ganges” and “The boy is a
lion”. He argues that where the ordinary meaning of words cannot
form a connective relationship (<em>anvaya</em>) then there is
recourse to secondary meaning. So in the case of words like
“Ganges” and “lion”, the
meaning—in—relation which is in connection with other word
meanings is the secondary meaning, not the primary meaning. Still,
Abhinavagupta, citing Prābhākara as an opponent of
suggestion, characterizes their position as one on which there is no
distinction between primary meaning, secondary meaning, or suggestion.
He says that their view is that the meaning of the word is simply its
final result (1.4b <em>The Eye</em>, <span class="citation"><em>DL</em></span>).
He points, however, out that the
Prābhākara Mīmāṃsā must accept
different kinds of statements in the Vedas for exegetical
purposes—some more direct than others—and thus they should
have no problem in principle allowing for suggested meaning.</p>

<p>
Prābhākara emphasizes three concepts in their account of
word and sentence meaning: expectancy
(<em>ākāṅkṣā</em>), cognitive proximity
(<em>sannidhi</em>), and semantic fittingness (<em>yogyatā</em>).
Depending on the word’s role in a sentence, it will have
different expectancies. This expectancy also varies depending on which
word meanings are presented to the subject’s mind as candidates
for connection—or which meanings have cognitive proximity (these
may not be words which uttered in sequence, as a connected subject and
verb may be separated by a dependent clause). Finally, the goal of a
sentence is to convey something meaningful, so the word meanings in
relation must work together semantically: a sentence such as
“Sprinkle the garden with fire” would fail to have
semantic fittingness. These three criteria determine what the
meaning-in-relations are which result in a sentence. Secondary meaning
is resorted to when there is no relation possible
(<em>anvayânupapatti</em>), such as when the word
“village” cannot be related to “on the
Ganges”, since this expression would lack semantic fittingness.
These three concepts are not restricted to Prābhākara,
however, and are discussed and refined in various ways by nearly all
of the intellectual traditions treating language.</p>

<h3 id="SphoTheo">4.4 <em>Sphoṭa</em> Theory</h3>

<p>
In his <em>Treatise on Sentences and Words</em>, the grammarian
Bhartṛhari (ca. 450 CE) takes up the distinction between primary
and secondary meaning in more detail than previous grammarians such as
Pāṇini and Patañjali. His work is difficult—he
is aware of, and engages with, Buddhist, Jaina, and
Mīmāṃsā views of language, but not in a
straightforward dialectical manner, as is the style of many other
Indian thinkers. This causes controversy over his established views
(for discussion of which see Cardona 1999). In terms of his position
on the division between primary and secondary meaning, the debate
centers on the implications of the <em>sphoṭa</em>-theory for
the possibility of such a distinction.</p>

<p>
In Bhartṛhari’s work, the term <em>sphoṭa</em>,
meaning “burst”, refers to the indivisible nature of the
utterance—it is a sound which carries meaning, and which cannot
be subdivided into words or particular phonemes. (One might think here
of Wittgenstein’s <em>Philosophical Investigations</em>, e.g.,
1953 [2001]: 191, and the idea of grasping meaning in a
“flash”—and indeed, this connection has been
explored in <span class="citation">Bhattacharyya 2002</span> and
elsewhere.) On one prevailing understanding of <em>sphoṭa</em>,
Bhartṛhari is committed to a kind of linguistic monism, which
not only denies the divisibility of utterances into grammatical
categories, but asserts the identity of speech and reality. Thus any
apparent distinctions between categories—letters, words,
semantic powers—are illusory. He uses common examples of
illusion in Indian philosophy to underscore this point: from far away,
a large tree may look like an elephant; at a glance, a rope may appear
to be a snake. However, these are misperceptions, as are the putative
semantic distinctions we make (<span class="citation">Raja
1969</span>).</p>

<p>
Tzohar, drawing on Jan E.F. Houben’s translation of the
“Exposition on (Semantic) Relationship”
(<em>Sambandha-samuddeśa</em>) chapter of the <em>Treatise</em>,
which treats figurative language extensively, argues that
Bhartṛhari does distinguish between primary and secondary
meaning, but on pragmatic grounds. Houben argues that Bhartṛhari
is a linguistic perspectivist, in the sense that his concern is not to
argue against any particular philosophical position, but to show the
limits of formal analysis itself. On this view, when Bhartṛhari
appeals to the analogy with perceptual illusion, it is merely to
dismantle the commitment to a certain theory of reference: that which
presupposes words refer to external reality. Secondary meaning is like
misperceiving a rope as a snake only in the sense that there is
superimposition in both cases. Looking at a rope, one superimposes
similar snake-properties (long, coiled body) upon a rope (long, coiled
shape). This is what happens when one says “The person is an
ox”—the relevantly similar properties of an ox are
superimposed on the person. Bhartṛhari emphasizes that it is
because a snake and a rope have different effects (a rope does not
move or hiss) that we come to realize there was misidentification.
Likewise, in determining the primary meaning of a word, we look at
whether the the state of affairs meets pragmatic expectations (does
the man have horns and four legs?). Failure to meet these expectations
indicates the use is secondary (<span class="citation">Tzohar
2011</span>).</p>

<p>
On the first interpretation, Bhartṛhari is anticipating later
Advaita Vedānta monism, on which empirical reality is illusory
and Brahman, without having any genuine properties, is the basis for
this illusion. His linguistic analysis, however, need not rely on
these metaphysical assumptions in order to underscore the centrality
of the sentence for meaning. Saying that grammatical categories and
stable word-meanings are constructed (<em>kalpita</em>), based on
theoretical needs, is to observe the priority of ordinary use and the
role of context for actual communication. The second interpretation
emphasizes the epistemic elements in theory-construction, preferring
to understand the analogical argument from illusion as less concerned
with error than the pragmatic grounds to our judgments. This approach
leaves questions about how Bhartṛhari distinguishes between
error and metaphor, however. Saying (metaphorically) “The person
is an ox” and (mistakenly) “That rope is a snake”
should not be equally figurative, even if on both utterances, our
pragmatic expectations are flouted.</p>

<h2 id="ImplDist">5. Implications of the Distinction</h2>

<p>
Different positions on the distinction between primary and secondary
meaning have implications for related philosophical topics. In the
realm of philosophy of language, theories of sentence meaning depend
on how word meaning is understood. Within philosophy of religion,
scriptural hermeneutics is also contingent upon approaches to meaning.
Finally, there are normative implications for speaking and producing
works of poetry, given the distinction.</p>

<h3 id="SentMean">5.1 Sentence Meaning</h3>

<p>
While much of the discussion about primary and secondary meaning is
centered on words, there are significant implications for sentence
meaning. Among those who accept the genuine compositionality of
sentences, <em>contra</em> the <em>sphoṭa</em> theorists above,
there are two theories of how words combine in context to convey a
unified meaning which differ over the role of secondary meaning.</p>

<p>
On the “connection of denoted meanings” view
(<em>abhihitânvāya</em>) accepted by
Bhāṭṭa Mīmāṃsā, words convey
their meanings, and then, in conjunction with three conditions, these
meanings are related together through secondary meaning
(<em>lakṣaṇā</em>). The three conditions mentioned in
 <a href="#PraaMiim">section 4.3</a>
 are expectancy of connections
(<em>ākāṅkṣā</em>), semantic fit
(<em>yogyatā</em>), and cognitive contiguity
(<em>āsatti</em> or <em>sannidhi</em>). Expectancy of connections
is defined either syntactically or in terms of a hearer’s
psychological state of desiring words to fit together. Semantic fit is
the requirement that the sentence makes sense, <em>prima facie</em>,
and contiguity is the requirement that words are uttered in a
temporally adjacent sequence or that they are closely related in the
hearer’s mind. The view that the meaning of a sentence is due to
the secondary signification of words is not necessarily connected to
Bhāṭṭa view that words denote universals, as
Vācaspati, in his <em>Drop of Truth</em> (<em>Tattva-bindu</em>),
defends this position despite elsewhere subscribing to Nyāya
theories of meaning. Vācaspati argues explicitly that indication
is responsible for the relationship (<em>anvaya</em>) between
word-meanings and argues that it is commensurate with a Naiyāyika
position (<span class="citation">Sastri 2014</span>; <span class="citation">Phillips
2015</span>).</p>

<p>
In favor of this view, its defenders observe that there must be some
common word-meaning among sentences such as “Bring the
cow”, “See the cow”, “Bring the sheep”,
and “See the sheep” in order for hearers to understand
what is being communicated. What we learn as language-users, through
trial and error and association of these various sentences with the
world, is the invariable meaning of the words. Against this
“connection of denoted meanings” view,
Śālikanātha and other Prābhākara thinkers, as
discussed earlier, argue that what is remembered on hearing an
individual word does not constitute a genuine meaning without its
being connected to the other words—emphasizing the inferential
element of meaning. Their view, the “designation of
meanings-as-connected” (<em>anvitâbhidhāna</em>),
rejects the role of secondary meaning as a sentence-unifier.</p>

<p>
Jayanta Bhaṭṭa, a Nyāya philosopher, takes up a third
position, on which word-purport (<em>tātparya</em>) plays the
unifying functional role. (This sense of <em>tātparya</em> is
different from later uses of the term to mean speaker intention.) His
theory of word-purport is accepted by Abhinavagupta who includes it in
<em>The Eye</em> 1.4 among his list of functions
(<em>vṛtti</em>-s) of language: the primary, secondary,
word-purport, and suggestion. For both Jayanta and Abhinavagupta, the
idea that the secondary meaning function is also responsible for
sentential unity was unacceptable. Abhinavagupta summarizes the four
capacities and their characteristics as</p>

<ol>

<li>Primary meaning (<em>abhidhā</em>) – conveys the
individual word-meanings in their ordinary sense, according to
convention</li>

<li>Purport (<em>tātparya</em>) – conveys the entire
sentence meaning which would not otherwise be intelligible</li>

<li>Secondary meaning (<em>lakṣaṇā</em>) –
along with factors like blocking the ordinary sense, conveys another
meaning</li>

<li>Suggestion (<em>dhvani</em>) – along with the hearer’s
imaginative abilities, based on the first three powers, it suggests
another meaning.</li>
</ol>

<p>
The crucial distinction between the “connection of denoted
meanings” view and the two others is whether the secondary
meaning function has a role to play before the sentence meaning is
understood. Abhinavagupta explicitly says that it is not possible to
have an obstacle for primary meaning without first understanding the
syntactical connections among words. Thus secondary meaning can only
occur after the capacity of purport. He distinguishes between
nonsensical but syntactically acceptable sentences such as
“There are a hundred elephants on the tip of my finger”
and phrases which are syntactically faulty, “Ten pomegranates,
six pancakes” (<span class="citation"><em>DL</em>:</span> 1.4b
<em>L</em>, page 86).</p>

<p>
Finally, Mukula Bhaṭṭa identifies a theory, most likely
his own, which he calls “the combined view”. It takes
secondary meaning to apply both before and after sentence meaning. His
understanding of secondary meaning is broader than both
Śālikanātha and Abhinavagupta, as it does not always
replace the primary meaning. So it can play the role of purport and
can also encompass the function of suggestion. Thus, where the
division between primary and secondary meaning is made, and how
secondary meaning is characterized has important consequences for all
these views of sentence meaning.</p>

<h3 id="ScriHerm">5.2 Scriptural Hermeneutics</h3>

<p>
Primary and secondary meaning, and the boundaries between them,
figured significantly in discussion over scriptural interpretation.
The topic is implicated in general discussions about how to approach
hermeneutics, in particular by Mīmāṃsā and
Vedānta philosophers. Particular doctrinal or philosophical
positions presented in, for example, the Upaniṣads or the Vedas,
are subject to scrutiny based on whether they should be taken
literally or not. The Mīmāṃsā system of
hermeneutics, as <span class="citation">Rajendran (2001)</span> and
<span class="citation">McCrea (2008)</span> have shown, subsequently
comes to influence the analysis of poetic meaning.</p>

<p>
While he is no Mīmāṃsaka (he is called a
<em>sarva-tantra-sva-tantra</em>, someone for whom all systems are his
own), even Vācaspati, in his <em>Drop of Truth</em> mentioned
above, takes up the question of the impact of theories of secondary
meaning on the interpretation of the Vedas. He is a proponent of the
view that indication acts as “glue”, metaphorically
speaking, and secures the relationship between word-meanings—but
this might threaten the possibility that the Vedas convey meaning
secondarily, since indication requires appeal to speaker intention to
make sense. This, says his opponent, threatens Vedic authority. While
Vācaspati’s initial dry remark is to say, well, so much for
Vedic authority, he steps back by postulating that the ordinary use of
elders (<em>vrddha-vyavahāra</em>) lets us understand, lacking a
genuine person who authors the words. He thus preserves the principle
that Vedic and ordinary language are cut from the same cloth, as both
require indication for sentence meaning.</p>

<p>
In the <em>Thorough Investigation of Truth</em>
(<em>Tattva-samīkṣā</em>), a commentary on
Maṇḍana Miśra’s <em>The Demonstration of
Brahman</em> (<em>Brahma-siddhi</em>), Vācaspati argues for the
truth of the Upaniṣadic claim of non-duality between self and
reality, against an interlocutor who would interpret the
Upaniṣads in a figurative manner. At stake is the role of
language in relationship to other sources of knowledge. The opponent
objects to the conflict between sense perception and the putatively
ordinary meaning of the Upaniṣads, since this would entail that
sense perception—which delivers knowledge of a world apart from
the self—is flawed. They argue that, when such conflicts arise,
perception should prevail, and a figurative meaning should be
preferred. Vācaspati objects on a number of grounds, first noting
that there must be a relationship between a primary and secondary
meaning (one cannot simply leap to a secondary meaning when it is
convenient). Then he appeals to the principle already described in
detail—when it is not possible to interpret the ordinary meaning
in a sensible manner, this is the impetus for secondary meaning.
Conflict with other knowledge sources is not the catalyst for
figurative interpretation (<span class="citation">Vācaspatimiśra,
<em>VT</em>:
29–32</span>).</p>

<h3 id="NormImpl">5.3 Normative Implications</h3>

<p>
In addition to contentful philosophical implications, the distinction
between primary and secondary meaning has an impact on how philosophy
is done. For instance, Gautama’s <em>Aphorisms</em> 1.2.10ff, in
outlining the appropriate terms of philosophical debate, defines the
flaw of casuistry (<em>vimāṃsa</em>) as misusing words to
mislead one’s opponent. There are a number of types of
casuistry, one of which is figurative. Vātsyāyana, in his
commentary (<em>NySBh</em> 1.2.14), cites one of the stock examples of
secondary meaning of the indicative type: “The stands are
shouting”. Here, where the meaning is that people seated on
wooden structures are shouting, it would be casuistry to reply,
“No, the stands are not shouting, but the people are
shouting”. This overly literal interlocutor pretends to
misunderstand the speaker’s intention, and makes there to be
conflict when there is none. Whether or not this kind of debate flaw
is an importantly unique kind of casuistry (there is some discussion
about this in the commentaries), Nyāya here emphasizes that
verbal hair-splitting without charity towards one’s debate
opponent constitutes a condemnable manner of intellectual speech
(<em>NS</em> 1.2.2).</p>

<p>
We have already seen in
 <a href="#Jain">section 4.2</a>
 that Jainas emphasize careful speech using the ordinary, not
figurative, meanings of words. Mīmāṃsā has a
similar emphasis on correct speech, especially in the context of Vedic
rituals. The utterances of mantras—parts of the Veda which
accompany ritual practice—had to be performed precisely in order
to guarantee the efficacy of the procedure (and mispronunciation in a
ritual context was equal to sinful lying). Thus the study of
grammatical rules was important, as these included pronunciation and
modification of words to fit a new context (declining nouns into the
plural, adjusting utterances to incorporate different deity names, and
so forth). Further, grammar was a corrective to ordinary use, which is
only an imperfect a guide to correct interpretation of Vedic words.
Distinguishing between commands in the primary sense of words and
figurative language exhortations was also crucial for
Mīmāṃsā, since the proper interpretation of the
latter was relevant for the performance of the ritual. For example,
the exhortation, “The ritual patron is the grass-bedding”
(<em>TV</em> 1.4.13) is a case of secondary meaning of the qualitative
type (<em>gauṇa-vṛtti</em>), which praises the central
role of the ritual patron. Kumārila observes that
misunderstanding this meaning would lead to absurdity, since the
grass-bedding (a woven mat of grass on which ritual implements are
placed) is burned up—and taking the phrase literally would mean
putting an early stop to the ritual process if the patron himself were
burned!</p>

<p>
Finally, Aesthetic theory interweaves normative implications
throughout. Poetry is not merely for pleasure, but incorporates moral
figures (one is instructed to be like Rāma, the hero of the
<em>Rāmāyaṇa</em>, and not like Rāvana, the evil
demon) and presupposes an entire moral structure. Abhinavagupta, in
his independent works, takes up the theory of suggestion into the
philosophy of Kashmir Śaivism, a tantric tradition which devotes
itself to the deity Śiva. For Abhinavagupta, <em>rasa</em> is not
merely an aesthetic phenomenon, but it is a profound sense of unity
with transcendent reality, found in the <em>rasa</em> of peacefulness,
<em>śānti</em>, which encompasses all others. Still, one
need not go so far as Abhinavagupta’s work to see the normative
dimension in Aesthetic theory, since even in
Ānandavardhana’s more ordinary understanding of
<em>rasa</em>, there are certain emotions which are appropriate to
bring into existence, and others which ought to be avoided. What is
appropriate is dependent on the character’s social position,
gender, and so on. These norms also constrain the interpretive
possibilities of suggested meaning, providing a conventional basis for
the creative use of language.</p>
