<h1>Philo of Larissa</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Thu Oct 5, 2006</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>

Philo (159/8–84/3 BC) was the last known head of Plato's
Academy during its skeptical phase. Under his leadership, the Academics
abandoned the radical skepticism of Arcesilaus and Carneades (who
professed to live without rationally warranted beliefs) in favor of a
form of mitigated skepticism allowing for provisional beliefs that did
not claim certainty. But Philo himself seems to have gone a step
further in his controversial ‘Roman Books’, where he
rejected the Stoic definition of knowledge on which the
Academics' mitigated skepticism relied. The evidence suggests
that he proposed instead a weaker, fallibilist theory that allowed for
ordinary knowledge but did not support the theoretical dogmatism of the
Academics' philosophical rivals. By challenging the accepted
epistemological framework of the Hellenistic period, Philo thus
inadvertently helped to set the stage for the subsequent revival of
Platonism as a dogmatic tradition based on the interpretation of
Platonic doctrines. He is most widely known, however, as the teacher of
Cicero, through whose work Academic skepticism became known in the
Latin-reading world.</p>

<h2><a name="LifWor">1. Life and Work</a></h2>

<p>

The external facts of Philo's career are largely undisputed.
After eight years of study with Callicles, a student of Carneades, in
his native Larissa, Philo moved to Athens in 134/3 BC, where he spent
fourteen years with Clitomachus, another of Carneades’ students,
and the scholarch (or head) of the Academy from 129/8 (or perhaps
127/6) to his death in 110/9 BC. Philo was elected to replace him in
that year, and remained the scholarch until his death in 84/3 BC. His
tenure was troubled by two events. First, in the late 90s BC his
authority was challenged by the secession of his student Antiochus of
Ascalon, who set up a rival anti-skeptic ‘Old Academy’. (A
second student, Aenesidemus, also left the Academy to found or revive
the radically skeptical Pyrrhonist school, probably in the 90s BC; but
the dating of this secession to Philo's tenure as scholarch is
insecure.) Secondly, civil unrest in Athens and the threat of the
Mithridatic war led to an exodus of Academic philosophers to safer
cities. Philo himself moved to Rome in 89/8 BC, where he continued to
give lectures and published his ‘Roman Books’. It is
unclear whether he ever returned to Athens after its
‘pacification’ by the Romans in 86 BC. The name of his
successor as scholarch, who probably oversaw the final demise of the
Academy as an institution, is also unclear. (The section of
Philodemus’ <em>Catalogue of Academic Philosophers</em> —
our main source for his biography — dealing with Philo's
death, his students, and his successor, survives in an illegible form.)
None of Philo's written works survive, but we possess a summary
of a work on ethics, some direct evidence for his Roman Books and
earlier epistemological views, and indirect evidence for a work on
rhetoric.</p>

<h2><a name="EviForDevPhiVie">2. The Evidence for the Development of Philo's Views</a></h2>

<p>

Since the evidence for Philo's various epistemological views
is philosophically rich but radically incomplete, their interpretation
is unsurprisingly controversial. The primary sources agree that
Philo's views evolved between his election as scholarch in 110/9
BC and the publication of the Roman Books in 88 BC; but the precise
stages of his epistemological evolution and the arguments that led
Philo to change his mind are not explicitly described in the texts we
have.</p>

<p>

Our evidence indicates (and no scholar disputes this) that Philo
began as an adherent of the radical skepticism attributed to Carneades
by Clitomachus. The two central questions that the evidence appears to
leave open are:</p>

<ol>

<li>Did Philo hold two, or three, epistemological positions over his
Academic career?</li>

<li>Did his Roman
Books advocate a form of mitigated skepticism or of fallibilism or of
Platonism?</li>

</ol>

<p>

Modern scholarship offers three general kinds of answer to these
questions. Scholars who think that Philo held two positions tend to
interpret the Roman Books as embracing mitigated skepticism (e.g.
Glucker 1978, Sedley 1981, Lévy 1992); while those who think he
had three positions interpret the later work as proposing a shift from
mitigated skepticism to either Platonism (Tarrant 1985) or fallibilism
(e.g. Frede 1987, Barnes 1989, Striker 1997, Brittain 2001).</p>

<p>

In order to understand these questions it is important to know
something about the context in which Philo's views evolved.
Several sources make it clear that when Philo arrived in Athens in the
130s BC, the Academy was sharply divided over the legacy of Carneades.
One side, led by Clitomachus, advocated radical skepticism as the
authentic Carneadean position, while another, led by Metrodorus of
Stratonicea, promoted some form of mitigated skepticism. We know,
however, that Philo was elected scholarch in 110/9 BC as a
representative of the Clitomachian, i.e. radically skeptical, wing of
the Academy (see Numenius fragment 28). We also know that the
epistemological views in his Roman Books in 88 BC were regarded as
shocking innovations by Academics of all kinds (see Cicero
<em>Academica</em> [‘<em>Ac</em>.’] 2.18). The first
question is thus whether Philo adopted mitigated skepticism in the
Roman Books or had already done so in the interval between 110/9 and 88
BC. On the first alternative, the Roman Books announced his belated
adoption of something like Metrodorus’ mitigated skepticism; on
the second, they represented a distinct third epistemological
position.</p>

<p>

The resolution of this question depends primarily on an interpretation
of Cicero's <em>Academica</em>, our principal, and only first hand,
philosophical source for Academic skepticism. But this text seems to
offer very strong support for the second alternative above, since
Cicero identifies and distinguishes three positions held by different
Academics in Philo's lifetime: a radical skepticism associated with
Clitomachus (e.g. in <em>Ac</em>. 2.78, 2.108); a form of mitigated
skepticism held by a group of Academics who regarded it as
incompatible with the Roman Books (<em>Ac</em>. 2.148, 2.11–12
&amp; 2.18); and the Roman Book view (<em>Ac</em>. 2.18). So it is
clear that the Roman Books did represent a third distinct Academic
position. But it also seems clear that they represented
<em>Philo's</em> third epistemological view, because the
interpretation of Carneades that generated the second view is
explicitly tied to Philo and Metrodorus (<em>Ac</em>. 2.78,
cf. 2.148), while we know that the Roman Books offered a novel
interpretation of Arcesilaus and Carneades that was contested by the
proponents of the second view (<em>Ac</em>. 2.11–12, 2.18). We
can thus safely infer that Philo advocated mitigated skepticism at
some point in the 90s BC, prior to the Roman Books of 88 BC and after
his election to the scholarchate as a Clitomachian radical skeptic in
110/9 BC. That this is correct is confirmed by the criticisms of
mitigated skepticism aimed at Philo by his student Antiochus before
the Roman Books (see section 3.4 below), and by the fact that
virtually all the generic references to Academic skepticism in later
writers assume that it was a form of mitigated skepticism (see
e.g. Gellius <em>Attic Nights</em> 11.5.8, Photius <em>Library</em>
212.170a, Plutarch <em>Stoic Contradictions</em> ch. 10, and Sextus
<em>Outlines of Skepticism</em> [‘<em>PH’</em>]
1.226–31).  Since Metrodorus was regarded as unorthodox, the
only plausible candidate for the creation of this received view of
Academic skepticism is a work by Philo from the 90s BC.</p>

<p>

The second question above is much simpler to dispose of once the first
has been resolved. If Philo had previously been a mitigated skeptic
and the Roman Books presented an epistemological innovation, his final
position was not mitigated skepticism. But we have excellent evidence
that it wasn’t a (recognizable) form of Platonism, since
Antiochus and Numenius flatly rejected it, despite being avowed
revivers of Platonism. (The only evidence in favor of the Platonist
hypothesis is an explicitly unsupported fantasy in Augustine, to the
effect that Platonist doctrines were secretly taught in the Academy
throughout its skeptical phase [<em>Against the Academics</em>
3.37–43].) The fallibilist interpretation of the Roman Books is
thus at least <em>prima facie</em> the most plausible candidate
offered to date. Whether it is in fact a satisfying candidate will
depend on its ability to present a coherent philosophical
interpretation of the development of Philo's epistemological views
from the evidence we have.</p>

<p>

The following sections thus offer an interpretation of Philo's
philosophical development on the hypothesis that he held three distinct
epistemological views: starting from a position of radical skepticism,
he adopted mitigated skepticism before finally embracing fallibilism.
It is worth stressing, however, that, given the uncertainties of our
evidence, the exegetical and historical arguments above cannot be
regarded as conclusive. The case is not closed (see e.g. Glucker
2004).</p>

<h2><a name="EpiVie">3. Epistemological views</a></h2>

<h3><a name="AcaVsSto">3.1 Academics vs. Stoics</a></h3>

<p>

Philo's distinct epistemological views all share one
fundamental feature: all of them deny the possibility of knowledge
according to the dominant Stoic conception of it. The essential context
for understanding Philo is thus the critique of Stoic epistemology
offered by Academic philosophers, and especially by Arcesilaus and
Carneades, over the preceding hundred and fifty years (c. 280–130
BC).</p>

<p>

The Stoics’ epistemology was designed to accommodate their
belief that it must be possible, in principle, to achieve the sort of
inerrant wisdom Socrates had desired. The Stoic theory depends on three
innovations. (See e.g. Cicero <em>Ac.</em> 1.40–2.) (1) They defined
the formation of a belief as a matter of assenting to an occurrent
thought or impression that something is, or is not, the case. (2) They
isolated a certain kind of perceptual impression as
‘cognitive’ (<em>cataleptic</em>), because it was
self-warranting, such that assenting to these impressions constituted a
‘cognition’ (<em>catalepsis</em> — lit. a
‘grasp’) of the state of affairs they represented. And (3)
they took secure knowledge of the sort Socrates sought to be the state
of an agent whose beliefs are constituted entirely by perceptual
cognitions or the non-perceptual cognitions that derive solely from
them. As a result, given their ethical doctrine that secure knowledge
was necessary and sufficient for happiness, and since, according to
(3), such knowledge could be achieved by restricting one's assent
to cognitive impressions, the Stoics identified the avoidance of
opinion and error — i.e. assent to non-cognitive impressions,
whether inadequately warranted (opinion) or false (error) — as
the overriding principle of rationality.</p>

<p>

The Academics attacked every part of this Stoic theory — their
practice was to argue against all philosophical positions — but
their criticism focused, unsurprisingly, on the central notion of the
cognitive impression. The Stoics standardly defined a cognitive
impression as one that came from what is, was stamped and impressed
exactly in accordance with it, and was, accordingly, such that it
couldn’t be false (see e.g. Sextus <em>Against the
Logicians</em> [= <em>Adversus Mathematicos</em> books 7–8,
‘M.’] 7.248 or Cicero <em>Ac.</em> 2.77). They took this
to mean, roughly, that an impression is cognitive if [a] its content
is true [b] it is caused in the appropriate way for correctly
representing its object, and [c] its truth is warranted by the
inimitable richness and detail of representation guaranteed by its
causal history (see Frede 1999). The general Academic tactic against
this view was to concede the possibility that an impression might meet
conditions [a] and [b], but argue that condition [c] never
obtained. They appealed to our experience of twins etc. and in
abnormal states such as dreams, illusions and episodes of madness to
show that it was always possible to have a false impression with
exactly the same richness and detail of representational content as a
true one, and thus that meeting condition [b] could never suffice to
show that condition [c] obtains, with the result that the warrant
claimed in [c] is never available to us. (See e.g. Sextus
<em>M</em>. 7.402–10 &amp; Cicero <em>Ac</em>.
2.84–90).</p>

<p>

The Academics used these arguments to point out that if our
perception is never self-warranting in the way cognitive impressions
are supposed to be, and if the Stoic definition of the cognitive
impression is correct, there is no cognition. Hence, if all knowledge
depends on cognitions, as the Stoics claim, nothing at all can be
known. The Academics also offered a corollary to this argument, drawing
on the Stoic principle of rationality mentioned above:</p>

<ol type="i">

<li>if there are no
cognitive impressions (as the Academics have argued)</li>

<li>and if the wise
person never assents to a non-cognitive impression (as the Stoics
think)</li>

<li>then the wise person will never assent to anything, viz. he will
suspend his assent universally.</li>

</ol>

<p>

Thus, according to the Stoic theory, once it is shown that there are
no cognitive impressions as they define them, if there are any wise
people, they will have no beliefs; and, whether there are or not, it
is never rational to assent to any impression. (See e.g. Sextus
<em>M</em>. 7.150–7 &amp; Cicero <em>Ac</em>. 2.66–8 &amp;
2.77–8).</p>

<p>

The Stoics, of course, came up with plenty of sophisticated
counter-arguments to the criticisms of the cognitive impression, to
which the Academics devised equally subtle responses. But one argument
in particular seems to have seriously troubled the Academic students
of Carneades: the Stoic ‘inactivity objection’. This was a
very simple practical <em>reductio</em>, connected to the corollary
argument given above: if the Academics were right it would be
impossible to act at all (let alone well), since voluntary action
depends on beliefs and thus on assent (see e.g. Cicero <em>Ac</em>.
2.24–5 and 2.34–7). But since action (indeed, good action)
is possible, the Academics must be mistaken. The later Academics saw
three ways in which they could respond to this counter-argument
without giving up their arguments against cognitive impressions. They
could:</p>

<ol>

<li>deny the connection the Stoics discerned between voluntary action
and belief or assent; or</li>

<li>reject the Stoic
principle of rationality by allowing for rationally defensible assent
to non-cognitive
impressions, i.e. opinions (thus rejecting premise [ii] above and the
conclusion [iii]); or</li>

<li>accept the force of the Stoic position by allowing that knowledge
must after all be possible, though on some weaker definition of
cognition than the Stoic one.</li>

</ol>

<p>

These three options turn out to define the three Academic positions
Philo held: position [1] was the core of Clitomachus’ defense of
radical skepticism; position [2] was the basis of Philo's defense
of mitigated skepticism; and position [3] was the one Philo defended in
the Roman Books.</p>

<h3><a name="RadSke">3.2 Radical Skepticism</a></h3>

<p>

The dialectic of Academic and Stoic argument and counter-argument
outlined above gives the impression that Carneades, and the earlier
Academic skeptics more generally, were committed to the conclusions
that they argued for, i.e. that there are no cognitive impressions,
that nothing can be known, that the wise person will suspend assent
universally, etc. But there are several reasons to doubt that
Carneades straightforwardly believed on the basis of these arguments
that nothing can be known and that it is irrational to assent to any
impression (see Frede 1987). First, such a position is obviously
inconsistent: since beliefs are assents on the Stoic view (and
Carneades’ arguments rely on Stoic assumptions), the two
conclusions cannot be consistently held at one time by a rational
agent. Secondly, the arguments only work if one already accepts a
basically Stoic epistemological framework, i.e. their theory of
impressions, their empiricism, their conception of knowledge, their
psychological doctrine etc. But Carneades had no reason to accept any
of these highly contestable views rather than e.g.  the Platonic or
Epicurean alternatives. And, thirdly, we know that the Academic method
of argument was dialectical: Carneades made it his practice to argue
for and against any and all philosophical views. And, in this case in
particular, there is good reason to think that his arguments were
designed only to show the inadequacies of the Stoic view and their
apparently skeptical consequences for the Stoics themselves.  This is
more or less directly attested in some sources (Numenius fr.  27,
Sextus <em>M</em>. 7.159–64, cf. 7.150), as well as evident from
the fact that Carneades was happy to try several incompatible
responses to the Stoic <em>reductio</em> argument — viz. options
[1] and [2] above — both of which can easily be read as further
criticisms of Stoic epistemological views (see Striker 1980 and Allen
1994).</p>

<p>

So Carneades was not committed to the views that nothing can be
known and that it is always irrational to assent <em>on the basis
of</em> these anti-Stoic arguments: the latter do not give him
<em>reasons</em> to believe their conclusions. Nevertheless, it seems
likely that he was committed to them in some sense, since the Stoics
and other philosophers kept on arguing against these views as if they
were his, or the Academic, position, and some of his students clearly
agreed. (Carneades’ actual position remains controversial; see
Bett 1989.) Clitomachus, at any rate, advocated an interpretation of
Carneades’ skepticism that saw his method of argument on either
side of all philosophical questions as motivated by some sort of
commitment to the view that it is irrational to assent to anything less
than what one knows to be true, and as resulting in a similar kind of
commitment to the view that nothing can be known. And it was this
interpretation of Carneades that Philo held at the start of his
Academic career (Numenius fr. 28).</p>

<p>

Clitomachus defended the consistency of a radical skepticism of this
sort by denying that assent is necessary for action or belief, as the
Stoics had claimed in their inactivity objection to the Academic
corollary argument (section 3.1 above). His defense came in two
stages, both appealing to arguments Carneades had used in response to
the Stoic objection. The first stage identified a way to discriminate
between our thoughts without appealing to their objective status as
true or as ‘cognitive’ impressions (see Cicero
<em>Ac</em>. 2.98–99, cf. 2.32). Here Clitomachus drew on
Carneades’ “theory of probable [or, better,
‘persuasive’ (<em>pithanon</em>)] impressions”
— i.e. the description of ordinary epistemic procedures that
Carneades promoted as an alternative to the Stoic theory of cognitive
impressions (see Sextus <em>M</em>. 7. 166–89 and Allen
1994). In ordinary life, Carneades argued, we proceed without assuming
that a set of what the Stoics call impressions is
‘cognitive’ or immediately warranted to be true. Rather,
some ‘impressions’ leave us with no immediate inclination
to accept them, while some strike us as subjectively
‘persuasive’, at least initially, owing to their internal
characteristics (e.g. the richness of their representation). We can
increase or diminish the initial persuasiveness of our impressions by
considering the perceptual conditions under which we experience them
(e.g. normal perceptual conditions for perceiving the state of affairs
they represent), and their fit with our other impressions (e.g. normal
coherence conditions). And we accept and act on impressions when they
reach the level of persuasiveness we find appropriate to the situation
we are in. But, Clitomachus insisted, none of these procedures is
sufficient to establish that an impression is true or
‘cognitive’, since, as the Academics have argued, the
representational features of any true impression can always be
replicated by a false one. (See Cicero <em>Ac</em>. 2.98–99.)
And there is no reason to think that in ordinary life we assume that
it is (see Plutarch <em>Common Conceptions</em> ch. 36).</p>

<p>

This first stage gives the Academic a procedure that allows for
discrimination between impressions while preserving the Academic
thesis that nothing can be known. The second stage of
Clitomachus’ defense drew on Carneades’ criticisms of the
Stoic unitary notion of assent as simply a matter of taking an
impression (or its content) to be true. Carneades had argued that this
fails to account for the complexity of our cognitive life: many of our
actions are not the product of distinct acts of assent, but rather
unconscious, or habitual, like animal action; and we sometimes
deliberately act without assent, for instance, when we follow
unendorsed hypotheses or act in conditions of uncertainty (see Bett
1990). On the basis of considerations of this sort, Clitomachus argued
that we should distinguish ‘assenting’ to an impression,
in the Stoic sense of taking it to be true, from
‘approving’ an impression, in the sense of acting on it or
accepting it <em>as if</em> it were true. (See Cicero
<em>Ac</em>. 2.104.)</p>

<p>

This second stage gives the Academics a way of accepting impressions
and acting on them that preserves the thesis that rationality demands
that one should always suspend assent. Thus, by combining both stages,
Clitomachus was able to argue that the Academic is free to
‘follow’ or ‘approve’ persuasive impressions
without assenting to them: the Academic has a ‘practical
criterion’ that allows for action without presupposing the
cognitive access to objective truth required for rational assent
(Sextus <em>M</em>. 7. 166; cf. Cicero <em>Ac</em>. 2.108). 
Clitomachus, however, did not restrict the application of this
‘practical’ criterion to cases of action. He also
explicitly claimed that it gave the radical skeptics a means to
explain their philosophical activities, i.e. their arguments and views
(Cicero <em>Ac</em>. 2.104; cf. 2.32). He was thus in a position to
explain the Academics’ apparent commitment to the theses that
assent is irrational and knowledge is unattainable. These are views
that the radical skeptic finds ‘persuasive’; but they are
not ‘beliefs’, at least not in the Stoic sense, because
the Academic does not take them to be true.</p>

<p>

One might plausibly question whether Carneades’ resistance to
(straightforward Stoic) assent was the ‘heroic’ defense of
rationality against opinion and error Clitomachus took it to be
(Cicero <em>Ac</em>. 2.108). It remains very controversial whether
there is a coherent distinction to be made between approving a view
and assenting to its truth (see the wider discussion in Burnyeat &amp;
Frede [ed.]  1997). But there is at least a case to be made that the
process of arguing for and against a thesis, in the way Carneades did,
can leave one stuck with a view one way or the other, but without
being aware of any rational ground for preferring this view. After
constant repetition of this process, one can see how the Academics
might have come to have the view that their views or
‘beliefs’ are all non-rational in the specific sense that
they were not actively formed in accordance with the explicit criteria
of rationality advocated by the dogmatic philosophers. And if they
remained committed — in the same attenuated or
‘non-rational’ sense — to the Socratic ideal of
inerrant knowledge, one can see why they might try to preserve their
rationality by not giving their assent to the views they found
themselves holding. A case along these lines is made in Brittain 2005.
Philo, at any rate, initially agreed with Clitomachus that
Carneades’ ability to maintain something like this critical
stance towards all beliefs — his own as well as the theories of
his philosophical opponents — represented a paradigm of
self-conscious rationality (see Numenius fr. 28).</p>

<h3><a name="MitSke">3.3 Mitigated Skepticism</a></h3>

<p>

Clitomachus’ interpretation of Carneades’ skepticism was
the dominant view in the Academy in the period c. 130–100
BC. But it was always contested, initially by Metrodorus, and later by
Philo himself. The basis for the alternative interpretation was a
second response Carneades had given to the Stoic inactivity objection
(position [2] in section 3.1 above), arguing that it is sometimes
rational to assent to non-cognitive impressions (see Cicero
<em>Ac</em>. 2.78, cf. 2.53). Clitomachus had taken this as just an
<em>ad hominem</em> argument, designed to challenge the Stoic defense
of the view that the overriding principle of rationality is avoidance
of any possibility of error (see Cicero <em>Ac</em>. 2.67–8).
Metrodorus and his followers, however, thought that this was a
statement of Carneades’ own view, and adopted it themselves.</p>

<p>

There is no direct evidence to explain Philo's shift from radical to
mitigated skepticism. But we can learn something about the general
motivations he had for adopting his new position from the ways in
which some mitigated skeptics understood the Carneadean notion of
‘persuasive impressions’. In the case of perceptual
impressions, the difference between their view and the Clitomachian
position is clarified by a criticism from Philo's former student
Antiochus that some Academics took persuasive impressions to be a
‘criterion of truth’, rather than just of action (see
Sextus <em>M</em>. 7.435–8 and Cicero
<em>Ac</em>. 2.32–6). This shows that these Academics understood
the mechanisms Carneades had outlined for increasing the
persuasiveness of impressions to provide a means of confirming or
disconfirming — in various degrees, though never ones that
warranted them conclusively — whether they were likely to be
true or not. These mitigated skeptics thus took the persuasiveness of
perceptual impressions under the right perceptual and coherence
conditions as defeasible, but rational, <em>evidence</em> for their
truth, rather than as merely the ground for their acceptance. We find
a similar move in the case of non-perceptual impressions: some
mitigated skeptics construed the standard Academic practice of arguing
on either side of philosophical questions as a means of rationally
evaluating arguments in order to establish which side is more likely
to be true. These mitigated skeptics thus changed the status of
argument on either side from a critical and, in effect, destructive
practice into a positive method for rationally confirming and,
indirectly, teaching philosophical conclusions. (See e.g. Cicero
<em>Ac</em>. 2.7, 2.60 &amp; <em>On the Nature of the Gods</em> 1.11,
Galen <em>On the Best Method of Teaching</em> ch. 1, and Plutarch
<em>Stoic Contradictions</em> ch. 10.)</p>

<p>

It is not difficult to see how this shift in the understanding of
persuasive impressions might lead to a re-evaluation of the conception
of rationality shared by Stoics and, at least in part, by the radical
skeptics. Clitomachus had agreed with the Stoics that avoiding error is
a necessary condition for rationality, and consequently, given the
apparent unavailability of knowledge, advocated suspending assent
universally. But once Philo had begun to accept that persuasiveness
could be used as a rational method for evaluating impressions, the
radically skeptical position started to look more like an abdication of
rationality than its paradigm. Granted that nothing can be known
— a view the mitigated skeptics continued to find extremely
persuasive (see Cicero <em>Ac</em>. 2.148) — it still seems that
we are rationally obliged to form the best beliefs we can, given the
evidence available to us. And while this will involve the possibility
of practical error, the refusal to use the evidence we have seems
absurd when it is generalized to every case — and immoral in the
case of ethics, since without some regulatory beliefs, it is unlikely
that our lives could be virtuous or happy (see section 4).</p>

<p>

These reasons, then, or something like them, led Philo, along with
other mitigated skeptics, to the formal position that, while nothing
could be known (as shown by the Academic arguments against the
possibility of cognitive impressions), it is nevertheless rational to
assent under certain conditions, i.e. to hold beliefs based on reasons
(Cicero <em>Ac</em>. 2.78). The mitigated skeptics retained the Stoic
characterization of such beliefs as ‘opinions’ to mark the
fact that, despite the rational grounds they had for holding them, they
were just rational <em>beliefs</em> — i.e. they did not amount to
‘cognitions’ or knowledge (Cicero <em>Ac</em>. 2.148). But
they also distinguished <em>rational</em> opinions of this sort from
the general Stoic category of opinion as any assent to a non-cognitive
impression (and hence as always bad), by qualifying their assent to
them as ‘measured’ or ‘virtual’ — that
is, as provisional on their avowedly inconclusive evidence, rather than
as a straightforward commitment to their truth. (See the anonymous
<em>Introduction to Plato</em> chs. 7 &amp; 10 and Gellius <em>Attic
Nights</em> 11.5.8. Sextus mis-ascribes this view to Clitomachus in
<em>PH</em> 1.226 &amp; 1.229–30.)</p>

<p>

The significant difference between this position and radical
skepticism is clear from the principal example of a mitgatedly
skeptical ‘opinion’ that we have: the thesis that nothing
can be known (see e.g. Cicero <em>Ac</em>. 2.148, Gellius <em>Attic
Nights</em> 11.5.8, Galen <em>On the Best Method for Teaching</em> ch.
1). The mitigated skeptics evidently believed this thesis directly
<em>on the basis of</em> the Academic arguments considered in section
3.1 above. But this means that, despite their rejection of the existence
of cognitive impressions and their new principle of rationality, their
skepticism was heavily parasitic on Stoic epistemology: they accepted a
dogmatic epistemological framework, including the Stoic theory of
impressions, Stoic empiricism, the Stoic conception of knowledge, and
so on. One does not need to see this as a weakness to notice that the
ties between mitigated skepticism and its dogmatic framework render it
liable to redundancy, in a way radical skepticism is not, if the
philosophical conception of knowledge itself changes. (Early modern
skepticism has perhaps suffered this fate as the Cartesian framework it
was parasitic on fades.)</p>

<h3><a name="Fal">3.4 Fallibilism</a></h3>

<p>

Philo's motivation for his final shift away from skepticism in the
Roman Books can be seen, at least in part, from the criticisms
directed at him by his ex-student Antiochus before their publication
in 88/7 BC. These criticisms point to a kind of instability inherent
in mitigated skepticism: it seems to waver unhealthily between a
dogmatic position allowing for something approaching certainty about
some questions and a radical skepticism about our ability to make any
epistemic progress. More specifically, it suggests that we can take
persuasive impressions as evidence for the truth that is firm enough
to warrant assent — thus allowing for a life guided by reasoned
belief, and even ethical teaching — while simultaneously
maintaining that even the most perfect rational consideration of the
evidence is compatible with wholesale error. (See the argument in
Cicero <em>Ac</em>. 2.111, addressed explicitly to Philo prior to his
Roman view, and its elaboration in <em>Ac</em>. 2.34–6 &amp;
2.43–44.  These Antiochian criticisms are echoed almost verbatim
by Aenesidemus in Photius <em>Library</em> 212 170a 14–38.)</p>

<p>

The outlines of Philo's response to this problem in the Roman
Books are fairly clear from the direct evidence we have for their
epistemological innovations (Cicero <em>Ac</em>. 2.18 and Sextus
<em>PH</em> 1.235). He argued, first, that the Stoic definition of the
cognitive impression ruled out the possibility of anything being known
— i.e. he restated the standard Academic arguments to this effect
— and, secondly, that this definition was therefore misconceived,
since at least some things could be known. His elucidation of the
second claim is unfortunately not explicit in the surviving evidence.
But its criticism by Antiochus (the context for Cicero's report)
very strongly suggests that Philo offered an alternative and weaker
definition of knowledge of single propositions. For Antiochus both
characterizes Philo's innovations as an attempt to redefine
‘cognition’ (<em>Ac</em>. 2.17 &amp; 2.18 fin.) and
attempts to refute them by arguing that an impression that does not
meet the condition given in the third clause of the Stoic definition
(see section 3.1 above) cannot be ‘cognitive’.
Philo's new definition thus amounted to something like the Stoic
definition minus its third clause (the clause the Academics had always
disputed). If so, Philo claimed that an impression is cognitive if it
is both [a] true and [b] caused in the appropriate way for correctly
representing its object — without adding the disputed Stoic rider
[c], that its truth is warranted by the inimitable richness and detail
of representation guaranteed by its causal history.</p>

<p>

This bare outline of Philo's final position is sufficient to
show its novelty, and thus explain its poor reception by Antiochus and
the Academics alike (see <em>Ac</em>. 2.11–12, 2.18). His new
conception of knowledge was a radical innovation in three respects.
First, given his acceptance of the standard Academic arguments against
self-warranting cognitive impressions, it offered a fallibilist theory,
which allows for unqualified assent to knowledge claims on the basis of
impressions that might nonetheless be false. Antiochus’ criticism
suggests that he defended this view by pointing out that the
theoretical or counterfactual possibility of error was epistemically
irrelevant in cases where the impression is in fact true and our
positive evidence for it is, in practice, conclusive (see Barnes 1989).
But however he justified it, Philo's new conception of knowledge
challenged the fundamental epistemological principle of the Hellenistic
period that knowledge must be certain. Secondly, Philo's new
theory implied that there is in fact a good deal of knowledge. It thus
constituted an apparently radical rejection of the basic thesis that
all the skeptical Academics had shared, that nothing can be known. And,
thirdly, Philo's theory implied a revised principle of
rationality. The mitigated skeptics had responded to the Stoic
inactivity objection by identifying rationality with forming defeasible
beliefs on the basis of the available evidence. But, by qualifying the
assent of the rational agent as ‘measured’ or provisional,
they insulated rationality itself from practical error: whether or not
the belief is false, an agent who forms it on the appropriate grounds
is never mistaken in holding it provisionally. On Philo's new
position, however, rationality is compatible with outright error
because it is rational to give straightforward, unqualified assent to
impressions that might nonetheless be false. The Roman Books thus
marked Philo's final rejection of the joint Stoic and Academic
thesis that the avoidance of error is an overriding principle of
rationality.</p>

<p>

This sketch of their implications explains why Philo's innovations
were decisive enough to startle his contemporaries and, eventually, to
lead to the doxographical classification of his version of Academicism
as a distinct ‘Fourth Academy’ (see e.g.  Sextus
<em>PH</em> 1.220 &amp; 1.235). But two facts imply that his further
elucidation in the Roman Books included some significant limitations
on the range of knowledge Philo came to accept, and hence the sense in
which he rejected the skepticism of his Academic predecessors. The
first is just that his contemporaries (and later historians) continued
to regard him, even at the end of his career, as an Academic, i.e. in
some way a follower of Arcesilaus and Carneades, rather than a
defector like Antiochus or Aenesidemus. The second is that Philo
asserted ‘the unity of the Academy’ in the Roman Books
(see Cicero <em>Ac</em>. 1.13), i.e. claimed that his new view was in
fact the underlying view of all the Academics from Socrates and Plato
to himself. Exactly what he meant by this claim is controversial, but
the tenuous and complex evidence does not suggest that it involved
either accepting an anti-skeptical reading of Plato or denying that
the skeptical Academics were skeptical about the possibility of
achieving theoretical knowledge in philosophy (see Brittain 2001
chs. 4–5).</p>

<p>

By combining these external constraints for our understanding of the
epistemological innovations of the Roman Books with their philosophical
context — Philo's prior position of mitigated skepticism
and the criticisms it faced — we can see, at least roughly, how
Philo may have given flesh to the basic outline above. Taken together,
these considerations suggest three constraints on the range of the
knowledge that Philo accepted. They suggest, first, that Philo
supplemented the externalist bones of his new definition of cognition
with the internalist constraints on assent that the mitigated skeptics
had already identified: assent to a Philonian cognitive impression
would only be warranted when the representational
‘richness’ guaranteed by its causal history (condition [b]
above) was confirmed by meeting the additional perceptual and coherence
conditions Carneades had identified for persuasive impressions.
Secondly, that Philo took Philonian cognition to apply primarily to
experiential knowledge, i.e. the kind that we ascribe to ourselves in
virtue of perception and to experts with practical skills, or something
like ‘ordinary knowledge’. And thirdly, that Philo
accordingly did not assume that the results of philosophical inquiry
would often, or even usually, or perhaps ever, amount to knowledge when
subjected to rational criticism through argument on either side. (The
evidence that might support these three claims is collected in Brittain
2001 ch. 3.)</p>

<p>

The hypothesis that Philo's fleshed out final theory of
knowledge was roughly along these lines makes sense of both the context
and the reception of his innovations. It also allows us to offer a more
philosophically satisfying explanation of his eventual acceptance of
the possibility of knowledge than Antiochus’ suggestion that he
was unable to endure the criticisms he and other Academics had dealt
with for thirty years (Cicero <em>Ac</em>. 2.18). By allowing for the
existence of ordinary, fallible, knowledge, Philo challenged the
epistemological framework of his era; but by limiting knowledge so that
it did not include most of the results of philosophical inquiry, and by
ascribing its acceptance to the Academic tradition, he sought to
redefine the skeptical Academy in terms of its original Socratic
function as the non-dogmatic critic of philosophical pretensions to
theoretical knowledge. On this view, Academic philosophy is not defined
by an epistemological position (as even Clitomachus’ radical
skepticism appears to have been), but by the critical method of
argument on either side.</p>

<h2><a name="EthRhe">4. Ethics and Rhetoric</a></h2>

<p>

Our knowledge of Philo's work in ethics comes almost entirely from an
extended summary of an introductory book or lecture preserved without
any context in an anthology (Stobaeus <em>Anthology</em> 2.7).  The
summary is puzzling because it presents a picture of Philonian ethics
that seems too dogmatic, and too ordinary, for an Academic, even at
the time of the Roman Books. The work presents a method for teaching
ethics in terms of an analogy between philosophy and medicine. This
yields a division of ethical teaching into three parts: a protreptic
stage (showing the need for philosophical guidance), a therapeutic
stage (adjusting the student's evaluative concepts), and a
preservative stage (outlining the life-styles and political
arrangements that promote or maintain happiness by reinforcing these
adjusted concepts). This is intriguing as an example of the way in
which late Hellenistic philosophers approached the teaching of
practical ethics (see Annas 1996). But it does not look
innovative. The analogy itself is a standard one in Plato and in
Hellenistic ethics.  The focus on practical rules and the application
of technical divisions and sub-division is derived from the Stoic
tradition. And its theoretical claims — for instance, that
wisdom or knowledge is necessary for virtue, and that virtue promotes
the goal of happiness — do not identify it as an exception to
the mainstream tradition of weaker or stronger
‘intellectualist’ and ‘eudaemonist’ virtue
ethics. In these respects, the summary suggests the Philo's ethics was
largely unaffected by the wide-ranging and penetrating criticisms of
Hellenistic ethics by his Academic predecessors, and especially by
Carneades (examined in Algra 1997).</p>

<p>

But there is reason to think that the summary — which was
probably written five hundred years after Philo's work — gives a
misleading picture of Philonian ethics by not informing us directly of
the methods it used to enable and secure the possession of
happiness. It is perhaps natural to assume that his methods were the
standard dogmatic ones. Two aspects of the wider context omitted by
the excerptor, however, suggest that Philo's ethics were in fact based
on the Academic method of argument on either side. First, we know that
the mitigated skeptics had already come to see their method of arguing
for and against ethical theses as a way of <em>teaching</em> ethics
that allowed students to evaluate which views were more persuasive,
i.e. had better rational grounds. This is clearest in the case of
Philo's colleague Charmadas in Cicero <em>On the Orator</em>
1.83–93. It is confirmed by the criticisms of mitigated
skepticism from Aenesidemus in Photius <em>Library</em> 212 170a and
Sextus <em>PH</em> 1.226. Secondly, we know that Philo had developed a
way to popularize the Academic method by incorporating it into a
technical system of rhetoric (see Cicero <em>On the Orator</em>
3.110–118 and <em>Tusculan Disputations</em> 2.9). But since the
function of this system was to provide students with forensic
techniques for arguing about moral issues, and given that teaching
rhetoric in any form was a significant departure for an Academic
philosopher, this development must have had some connexion to Philo's
ethical views (see Reinhardt 2000 and Brittain 2001).</p>

<p>

When the summary is read with this wider context in mind, three
apparently minor points stand out. First, the therapeutic stage,
dealing with the students’ fundamental conceptions of value, is
described as the effort to replace “falsely <em>acquired</em>
beliefs” with ones “in a healthy state,” rather than
just false with true beliefs (Stobaeus <em>Anthology</em> 2.7 p.
40.18–20). Secondly, the preservative stage, concerned with the
lifestyles that promote or secure happiness, is framed as an
“<em>investigation”</em> of a set of questions that
correspond precisely with the questions dealt with by argument on
either side in Philo's rhetoric (ibid. p. 41.7–14). And, thirdly,
that kind of general ‘investigation’ is explicitly
distinguished from the provision of straightforwardly
<em>prescriptive</em> advice about how to behave, which is regarded as
a temporary fix for busy people (ibid. p. 41.16–25). These points can
be explained in various ways. But given the wider context, they suggest
that the summary has obscured the central point about Philo's
ethics: its method of teaching was not dogmatic, but the Academic one
of argument on either side.</p>

<p>

If this is right, the summary's apparent ordinariness and dogmatic
structure reflect only Philo's systematic approach to ethical topics,
not its methods or results: Philo did not propose a dogmatic ethics,
but rather a systematic way of structuring its students’ moral
values into a coherent way of life through their rational evaluation
of arguments on either side. A philosophical approach to ethics of
this kind allows students to use their ethical intuitions — the
knowledge provided by their own experience — to revise and
structure their conceptions of value, and, on that basis, critically
evaluate their general social and political roles, and select the
appropriate actions in a particular situation. An approach of this
sort perhaps no longer seems striking or innovative, but if Philo
adopted it in the early 80s BC, it presented no less a challenge to
Hellenistic ethics than his Roman Books did to epistemology. Two
reasons to think that Philo did adopt this approach are, first, that
it yields a conception of ethical knowledge that fits the epistemology
of the Roman Books — a Philonian rational agent will have the
sort of wisdom and happiness that is available to ordinary people,
i.e. something quite unlike the illusory promise of inerrant knowledge
and moral perfection promised by the Stoics. And, secondly, Philo's
student Cicero adopted something like a mitigatedly skeptical version
of this approach both in his personal life (see Griffin 1989) and in
his philosophical works on ethics (see Schofield 2002).</p>

<h2><a name="Con">5. Conclusion</a></h2>

<p>

Philo eventually abandoned both radical and mitigated skepticism, on
this reconstruction of his work, for a form of open-ended critical
inquiry that he described as the basis of the Academic tradition. His
novel conception of Academic philosophy had some impact on the work of
Cicero, Plutarch, Favorinus and Augustine, but his radical innovations
in epistemology and ethics sank almost without trace. The skeptical
tradition survived in the form of Pyrrhonism, but the Academy did not.
Like any interpretation of Philo's philosophical development,
this reconstruction is speculative in some respects. But much of it can
be confirmed or disconfirmed by further work on Cicero's
philosophical treatises, which remain an open field for research.</p>
