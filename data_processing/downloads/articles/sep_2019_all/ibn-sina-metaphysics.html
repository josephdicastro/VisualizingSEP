<h1>Ibn Sina’s Metaphysics</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Wed Dec 2, 2015</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>For Avicenna (Ibn Sīnā) metaphysics is a <em>science</em>
(<em>ʿilm</em>), i.e., a perfectly rationally established
discipline that allows human reason to achieve an authentic
understanding of the inner structure of the world. Metaphysics is the
science of <em>being qua being</em> and therefore the science that
explains <em>every being</em>. In his interpretation, Avicenna fuses
the Aristotelian tradition, which he intends to renew (Gutas 2014),
with the Neo-Platonic idea of emanation, on which he builds his
system: metaphysics thus includes theology, cosmology and angelology,
and provides a foundation for physics, psychology, prophetology and
eschatology. Indeed, metaphysics even demonstrates “the
principles of the particular sciences” that investigate
“the states of particular existent things”
(<em>Ilāhiyyāt</em>, I, 2, 14, 18–15, 7) and are
subordinate to it (Bertolacci 2006: Ch. 7). So metaphysics is
“first” and “at the head” of all sciences
(<em>Ilāhiyyāt</em>, I, 3, 18, 14–17; Houser 1999;
Lizzini 2005) and is universal not only because it concerns
being <em>qua</em> being (instead of just some aspects of it), but
also because it comprehends reality—and the system of knowledge
this implies—as a whole (instead of just some portions of
it).</p>

<p> In this article, which has reference mainly, but not exclusively,
 to the <em>Ilāhiyyāt</em>
 of <em>Kitāb al-Šifā'</em> (known in English as
 the <em>Metaphysics</em> of the <em>Book of the Healing</em> or of
 the <em>Book of the Cure</em>), I shall start—after introducing
 Avicenna's sources—with a brief discussion of the status of
 metaphysics as a science, and then illustrate Avicenna's analysis of
 existence and the theology that arises from it. Thereafter I shall
 focus on Avicenna's theory of emanation, highlighting its essential
 aspects.</p>

<h2><a id="MetSouImp">1. Metaphysics: sources and importance</a></h2>

<p>Avicenna reads his main
reference—Aristotle's <em>Metaphysics</em>—in the light
of two interrelated traditions: that of the Late Ancient commentators
(e.g., Alexander of Aphrodisias, Themistius, Ammonius of Hermias) and
that of the Neo-Platonic writings known in the Arabic world—the
so-called <em>Plotiniana</em> and <em>Procliana
arabica</em><sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-1" id="ref-1">1</a>]</sup>—part
 of which were ascribed to
Aristotle himself. He consequently reinterprets
Aristotle's <em>Metaphysics</em> and gives an original structure to
his own text (Bertolacci 2006: Ch. 5; Menn
2013).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-2" id="ref-2">2</a>]</sup>
 The Arabic-Islamic traditions of philosophy and theology
(Yaḥyā ibn ʿAdī, al-Fārābī, the
Kalām) are also essential to understanding Avicenna's
metaphysics: not only does Avicenna's terminology often depend on his
predecessors, but also some of the solutions he adopts are the result
of the ongoing discussion about their positions. Yet Avicenna
surpasses both his sources and his interlocutors. From a theoretical
point of view, his metaphysics is, in fact, incredibly rich and
refined. Many issues—such as being and universality, the
God-world relationship, the problem of evil—receive a quite
original treatment in Avicenna's system. This clearly explains the
paramount importance Avicenna's metaphysics has for the history of
philosophy, in both the West and the East. Indeed, thanks to the
Toledo Latin version of the <em>Ilāhiyyāt</em>
of <em>Kitāb al-Šifāʾ</em> (<em>Liber de philosophia
prima sive scientia divina</em>), every Latin medieval philosopher
from the late 12<sup>th</sup> century onwards encountered one or more
of Avicenna's interpretations (Hasse and Bertolacci 2011; Bertolacci
2013). In the East (and especially in the Persian area), Avicenna's
metaphysics not only profoundly influenced philosophy and theology,
but also founded a centuries-old tradition which can be considered
still extant (Endress 2006; Michot 1993; Wisnovsky 2004, 2011,
2014). </p>


<h2><a id="MetBetOntThe">2. Metaphysics Between Ontology and Theology</a></h2>

<h3><a id="OntThe">2.1 Ontology and Theology</a></h3>

<p>Avicenna's definition of metaphysics as a science is rooted in a
premise he elaborates on the basis of Aristotle
(<em>Post. Analytics</em> I.10, 76b11–22) and
al-Fārābī (<em>On the aims of the
Metaphysics</em><sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-3" id="ref-3">3</a>]</sup>):
 a science must have a subject-matter
(<em>upokeimenon</em>: <em>mawḍūʿ</em>) and an object
of research
(<em>zetoumenon</em>: <em>maṭlūb</em>; <em>mabḥūṯ
ʿan-hu</em>). The former is assumed to be existent (it is a
starting-point); the existence of the latter has to be established,
which is the purpose (<em>ġaraḍ</em>) of the science or
the aim towards which the science is oriented
(<em>maqṣūd</em>). From this distinction a fundamental
duality emerges: by virtue of its subject-matter (the existent and
its properties), metaphysics is concerned with being and is ontology,
whereas from the point of view of the question which it must answer,
metaphysics establishes (<em>iṯbāt</em>) the existence of
the First Principle and is 
theology.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-4" id="ref-4">4</a>]</sup>
 So Avicenna retains the theological
conception that al-Kindī highlighted (and Aristotle himself
suggested);<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-5" id="ref-5">5</a>]</sup>
at the same time, he develops the line al-Fārābī
initiated by positing being—and not God—as the focus of
metaphysics as a universal science (Bertolacci 2006: Ch. 2–3;
Menn 2013). He thus gives his own solution to a traditional question
(how should Aristotle's metaphysics be defined?): metaphysics fits
the definition given in Gamma 1, 1003a20–26, as the science of
being <em>qua</em> being or, literally, of the existent <em>qua</em>
existent: <em>al-mawǧūd bi-mā huwa
mawǧūd</em> (<em>Ilāhiyyāt</em>, I, 1, 9, 8; 2,
13, 12–13). It is only in terms of the question it must answer
(<em>Ilāhiyyāt</em>, I, 1, 5, 13–7, 2; 9, 6–10; 3, 19, 5–8;
21, 1–8; 23,
1–9), that the science
of metaphysics is “divine” (<em>al-ʿilm
al-ilāhī</em>; cf.  Aristotle's <em>Metaphysics</em> A.2,
982b28–983a11; E.1, 1026a16–21) or “of the divine
things” (<em>ʿilm al-ilāhiyyāt</em>;
cf. <em>Metaph.</em>, 1026a13–16), as the title of the
metaphysical sections of Avicenna's philosophical <em>summae</em>
indicate.</p>

<h3><a id="MeaDuaDef">2.2 The Meaning of the Dual Definition</a></h3>

<p> Avicenna's dual characterization of metaphysics results in a
profound connection between theology and ontology. Inasmuch as It
exists, the First Principle partially coincides with the
subject-matter of metaphysics, so that theology is included in
ontology: the existence of God is <em>part</em> of existence
(<em>Ilāhiyyāt</em>, I, 2, 14, 4–10: the Principle is
the Principle of part of being). The dual definition of metaphysics
reflects a twofold way of considering existence or being itself: when
it is taken as set apart from any condition, and hence taken to be
absolute, being is the subject-matter of metaphysical
investigation. On the contrary, when it is identified as the being of
the Principle, it is necessarily defined as uncaused. In fact, the
definition of metaphysics as a science and its twofold denomination
derive from a logical-predicative distinction: being is either <em>not
on condition of</em> (<em>min ġayr
šarṭ</em>)—and is hence an undetermined common
being—or is <em>on condition of not</em> and requires that
(non-relational) predications be excluded. In more technical terms,
being is either <em>not on the condition of adding a
determination</em> (<em>lā bi-šarṭi
al-ziyāda</em>)—and can therefore be unconditionally
predicated of everything—or is <em>on the condition of not
adding a composition</em> (<em>maʿa šarṭi lā
ziyādati tarkīb</em>; <em>Ilāhiyyāt</em>, I, 2,
13, 8–13; VIII, 4, 347, 10–16; Porro 2011b; Lizzini
2013). In the latter case, being constitutes the divine being which is
the research object of metaphysics, i.e., the answer to the questions:
does an uncaused principle exist? And if so, what are its
properties? </p>

<h3><a id="TheVocMetFirPriAbsCau">2.3 The Theological Vocation of Metaphysics: The First Principle as Absolute Cause</a></h3>

<p> According to Avicenna, metaphysics—and no other
science—can (and must) establish the existence of a First
absolute Principle. Physics, which deals with bodies and their
movement, can explain no more than motion (its result is, in fact, a
Prime Mover) and, unable to answer the fundamental ontological
question about the origin of the world's <em>being</em>, it simply
anticipates the idea of the Principle that metaphysics demonstrates
(<em>Ilāhiyyāt</em>, I, 1, 6, 17–7, 6).</p>

<p> From this perspective, Avicenna is not Aristotelian: metaphysics
must explain the transition from non-being to being, an atemporal
transition which does not exclude eternity from what is caused to
be. His idea is entirely consistent with Greco-Arabic Neo-Platonism:
both the <em>pseudo-Theology of Aristotle</em> (a re-elaboration
of <em>Enneads</em> IV-VI) and the <em>Book of the pure Good</em> (a
reworking of Proclus' <em>Elements of Theology</em>) insist on an
originated being. At the same time, Avicenna includes in his system
the Aristotelian conception of a world eternally in movement: hence
the notions of matter, form, potency and act are elaborated so as to
answer the question of the origin of the world's eternal existence. In
keeping with Proclus (and against John
Philoponus's position: Davidison 1987; Chase 2012; McGinnis 2012, 2013),
Avicenna considers the world to be “instaured” or
absolutely created (<em>mubdaʿ</em>) and at the same time
establishes that it is eternal and eternally in motion, as Aristotle's
physics and metaphysics teach. He therefore posits a Principle of the
world's existence (<em>wuǧūd</em>) that does not correspond
to the prime unmoved mover (cf.  <em>Commentaire Lambda</em>:
7–12; <em>Taʿlīqāt</em>, 62, 14–19;
Janssens 2003). Indeed, according to Avicenna, in metaphysics the
efficient cause is a cause of existence (<em>Ilāhiyyāt</em>,
VI, 1, 257, 13–16). It is only in this sense that metaphysicians
conceive the Principle as an agent.  At the same time, since It is
first and perfect (<em>Ilāhiyyāt</em>, VIII, 4, 343,
12–15; VIII, 7, 368, 2–3; 369, 4–5; in some passages
Avicenna even accepts the Neo-Platonic idea of the Principle above
perfection: <em>fawqa
al-tamām</em>: <em>Ilāhiyyāt</em>, IV, 3, 186, 15; 188,
5–15; VIII, 6, 355, 9–10), the Principle must also be a
final cause (Wisnovsky 2003a: 180–195). The idea of aim must
then be (aporetically) shifted from the level of movement to that of
being: the final cause is not a cause of movement but the same
efficient cause that makes things exist
(<em>mūǧid</em>). The First Principle is therefore a cause
in every respect (<em>Ilāhiyyāt</em>, I, 1, 4, 14–17;
VIII, 3). The prime unmoved mover—which is, in fact, the first
caused Intelligence—justifies the movement of the world, but
refers in its turn to the Principle, which is absolutely First
(McGinnis 2010a: 151; cf. <em>Physics of “The
Healing”</em> IV, 15).</p>

<h3><a id="UniBeiOntDis">2.4 Univocacy of Being and Ontological Distinction</a></h3>

<p>The dual definition (and notion) of both being and metaphysics
reveals the nuanced univocacy or univocity that rules both Avicenna's
ontology and his theology. If the uncaused Principle is
itself <em>part</em> of being, then It is the principle of
only <em>part</em> of being: of being insofar as it is caused, and not
of all being or of being as such. Indeed, if the Principle were the
principle of all being, it would, paradoxically, be Its own principle
(while the “First” can be defined only as the being that
Itself has no principle at all; the whole as such has no principle: <em>Ilāhiyyāt</em>, I, 2, 14,
1–16,20). Insofar as It is existent, the Principle is thus
existent just as the world is. Hence the ontological distinction
between the uncaused Principle and Its effect does not lie in
existence as such, but in one of its modes: the uncaused Principle
is <em>necessary as regards existence</em>, while everything else is
always <em>possible as regards existence</em>: i.e., it exists insofar
as it is necessitated and therefore necessary by virtue of something
other. As a consequence, the existence of things that are in
themselves possible is always conceived as <em>related to</em> a
(possible) <em>essence</em>, while the being of the Principle is
purely and necessarily existence: despite a certain unavoidable
ambiguity in Avicenna's language (see
e.g., <em>Ilāhiyyāt</em>, VIII, 7, 363,
1–2; <em>Ilāhiyyāt</em>, VIII, 5, 349, 11: “the
reality of the First”), the Necessarily Existent has no essence
or no quiddity that differs from existence
(<em>anniyya</em>: <em>Ilāhiyyāt</em>, VIII, 4, 344,
10–11; 346, 8–12; cf.  Macierowski 1988) and is therefore
beyond essence. The first attribute of the Principle is “that It
is and that It is existent” (<em>inn
wa-mawǧūd</em>; <em>Ilāhiyyāt</em>, VIII, 7, 367,
12–13): existence is not what It “has”: It simply
is.</p>

<p> This nuanced univocacy of being has been variously determined:
scholars have adopted locutions like <em>per prius</em> and <em>per
posterius</em> (Menn 2013: 163–167 on <em>Categories</em>, I,
2), “ambiguity of being's univocity” (Druart 2014),
“modulated univocity” (Treiger 2012) and gradual
predication or predication according to an arrangement:
“<em>gradueller oder ordnungsbezogener
Prädikationsmodus</em>” (Koutzarova 2009:
211–258). Certainly Avicenna attributes existence both to the
Principle and to things; he ascribes to existence differences in worth
(<em>Categories</em> 10–11; Bertolacci 2011:
43–44)—there is in fact an evident hierarchy governing
necessity and possibility (see <a href="#KinStaExi">Section 4.4</a>);
he modulates existence according to the absolute or relative necessity
it expresses, clearly excludes the possibility that existence is a
genus or that it is predicated equally
(<em>bi-l-tasāwī</em>) of what is beneath it, openly speaks
about its anteriority and posteriority within the same pattern of
reference to be found in Aristotle
(health: <em>Ilāhiyyāt</em>, I, 5, 34, 15–35, 2; other
passages suggest a different analogy; Menn 2013) and clearly
establishes the starting-point of theology in the analysis of the
existent.</p>

<h2><a id="EssExi">3. Essence and Existence</a></h2>

<h3><a id="ExiPri">3.1 The Existent as Primary</a></h3>

<p> The first step in the analysis of the existent
(<em>al-mawǧūd</em>)<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-6" id="ref-6">6</a>]</sup>
 is to acknowledge its absolute priority: the
existent as such is indefinable (<em>Ilāhiyyāt</em>, I, 5,
29, 5–31,9; cf. I, 2, 13, 8–13): everything implies the
notion of the existent and cannot exist outside of it. In fact,
whereas a definition serves to answer the question about the quiddity
(<em>māhiyya</em>: what is it: <em>mā huwa?</em>) of a
thing, the existent as such cannot have a quiddity (one cannot
investigate its <em>māhiyya</em>: <em>Ilāhiyyāt</em>,
I, 2,13, 8–13).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-7" id="ref-7">7</a>]</sup> In order to ask what a thing is, one cannot
avoid referring to being, which is exactly what allows us to conceive
all things, whether they are sensible, imaginary or intelligible, as
existent. According to Avicenna's formula, which had a great impact on
Thomas Aquinas (and on medieval Western philosophy in general), the
existent is—together with the thing, the necessary and the
one—one of the “intentions”
(<em>maʿānī; intentiones</em>) that are
“imprinted in the soul in a primary way”
(<em>Ilāhiyyāt</em>, I, 5, 29, 5–6; 30,
3–4).</p>

<p> The primacy of being (everything that is conceived of
“is”) leads to an often unseen consequence: everything
that is conceived of or simply mentally represented <em>exists</em>
and hence has <em>at least</em> a mental existence (which means either
intellectual or imaginary or estimative). Indeed, the existent as such
is immaterial and only non-existence in the absolute sense does
(obviously) not exist, since it cannot be either conceived or
discussed (<em>Ilāhiyyāt</em>, I, 5, 32,
6–16). Non-existent things are only relatively non-existent:
resurrection, e.g., and possible and imaginary entities exist at least
in the mind (<em>Ilāhiyyāt</em>, I, 5, 33, 12–34, 9;
cf. Arist., <em>Metaph.</em>, 1006b10). Impossible things seem to be
non-existent insofar as they are not properly conceived (intellectual
existence is distinct from imaginative existence: Michot 1987; Black
1997, 1999).</p>

<p> Together with the distinction between mental and external
existence (or existence in concrete individuals: <em>fī
l-ʿayān</em>) Avicenna posits a distinction between
the <em>being of the thing</em> and its <em>existence</em>. Clearly,
then, the fundamental and primary character of being does not imply
simplicity: to <em>exist</em> means <em>to be a given entity</em> in
the world or—as Avicenna also uses it—a
“thing” (<em>Ilāhiyyāt</em>, I, 5). The
existence of something must thus be distinguished from its being what
it is.</p>

<p> In <em>Ilāhiyyāt</em>, I, 5 Avicenna summarizes the
meanings of the term <em>mawǧūd</em>
(“existent”) and of the locutions that are related to it:
“thing”
(<em>šayʾ</em>),<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-8" id="ref-8">8</a>]</sup>
 but also “what”
(<em>mā</em>), “that” (<em>allaḏī</em>),
“what is given” or “realized”
(<em>al-muḥaṣṣal</em>) and “what is
affirmed” or “established”
(<em>al-muṯbat</em>). On the one hand, there are the existent
and the thing as first notions: both indicate being as what cannot be
known through anything other than itself, so that knowledge is built
on it.  On the other, there is what the word “thing” may
also indicate in every language: “the reality whereby every
thing (<em>amr</em>) is what it is”
(<em>Ilāhiyyāt</em>, I, 5, 31, 5–6; cf. VI, 5, 292,
1–5). </p>

<h3><a id="DisBetEssExi">3.2 The Distinction Between Essence and Existence</a></h3>

<p>So the analysis of being reveals two meanings of existence: the
first affirms or establishes the <em>existence of</em> something; the
second expresses, without affirming its existence,
the <em>reality</em> by virtue of which <em>something is what it
is</em>, namely, its essence. The first is what Avicenna calls
“the existence related to the fact that [something] is
established” (<em>al-wuǧūd
al-iṯbātī</em>), the second identifies the particular
or “proper existence” of the thing (<em>al-wuǧūd
al-ḫāṣṣ</em>). As regards the latter, one is
either not required to know whether the thing is or is not existent or
else one ignores the whole question. In the first sense, then, the
“existent” (or “existing”) thing stands for
“what is established” (<em>al-muṯbat</em>) or
“realized” (<em>al-muḥaṣṣal</em>) and
affirms that something <em>exists</em>; in the second sense, which is
expressed by “proper existence”, what is referred to is
the “reality” (<em>al-ḥaqīqa</em>),
“nature” (<em>al-ṭabīʿa</em>),
“essence” (<em>al-ḏāt</em>) or—according
to Avicenna's technical terminology—“quiddity”
(<em>māhiyya</em>) or “thingness”
(<em>šay'iyya</em>) of the thing. Here no existential judgment
is implied; what is expressed is an intentional note, independent of
its existence, which necessarily accompanies it
(<em>Ilāhiyyāt</em>, I, 5, 31, 1–9).</p>

<p>The background of this distinction is Aristotelian. In a very broad
sense its origin can be discovered in Aristotle's <em>Posterior
Analytics</em> (II Β 92b10)—where the question that asks
“<em>if</em> a thing exists” is separate from the one that
asks <em>“what</em> a thing is”—in
the <em>Metaphysics</em> (Δ V.5, 1015a20–b15; 7,
1017a7–b10; but also Ε and Z)—where the various
meanings of “being” are differentiated and the question of
essence (<em>ousia, to ti en einai</em>) is posed—and in <em>De
interpretatione</em> 11 21a25–8; Lizzini 2003; Menn
2013). Moreover, although original in its development Avicenna's
distinction uses terms and concepts that can be found in both the
philosophical and the theological traditions of classical Islam: in
al-Fārābī's <em>Book of Letters</em> (<em>K.
al-Ḥurūf</em>; cf. Menn 2008) and also in the distinctions
of Muʿtazilite Kalām, in which a “thing” was
conceived of as separate from existence (Jolivet 1984; Wisnovsky
2003a).</p>

<h3><a id="ComEssExi">3.3 The Composition of Essence and Existence</a></h3>

<p>If distinguishing between two areas of being—i.e., existence,
which can be either mental or real, and the proper existence of the
thing, i.e., its essence, quiddity, thingness
(see <em>Ilāhiyyāt</em> I, 5 and VI, 2)—can be read as
logical, its value is ontological, since the composition which is
recognized in things concerns their being. Indeed, not only must the
conceptual constituents that define the being of something be
distinguished from the affirmation of its existence (as in
gnoseology), but also the very essence of something must be
metaphysically distinguished from its existence. Essence is not, so to
speak, “ontologically neutral”. The essence or thingness
of which Avicenna speaks is not simply the essence of the thing
considered as such, regardless of its existence, but the thingness and
hence the thing that, considered as such and regardless of its
existence, reveals exactly the character or modality that its own
existence has. If the analysis of a thing, i.e., of its quiddity or
proper existence, does not inform me of its existence (by knowing what
a thing is, I do not necessarily know <em>if</em> it is), this is
because a thing is in itself only possible: it can be either existent
or non-existent, and since it is <em>in itself</em> possibly existent,
it is <em>in itself</em> non-existent. On the contrary, if the
analysis of a thing—i.e., of its quiddity or proper
existence—were to inform me positively of its existence (by
knowing what a thing is, I also know <em>that</em> it is), this would
be because a thing is in itself necessarily existent and therefore in
itself existent (Lizzini 2003). Paradoxically, however, in the latter
case, the “thing” in question is only necessary existence,
it has no quiddity and is not, properly speaking, a
“thing” (Bertolacci 2012a): in this case, in fact, what is
revealed is the existence of the Necessary Principle, which is pure
existence <em>on condition of not</em> and is therefore beyond essence
and thingness.</p>

<p> The core of the distinction is that what is necessarily existent
is purely existence (but not undetermined common existence) and is
indeed the Necessarily Existent Principle. Conversely, everything that
does not exist necessarily and therefore has a possible relation to
existence is <em>something that is possible</em>, so that in order to
exist it always and necessarily refers to a cause that makes it exist:
a cause that justifies the fact that instead of being possible
(<em>mumkin</em>) and therefore not already assigned to existence, the
thing is qualified as existent. Non-determination to existence leads
to non-existence (<em>ʿadam, lays, laysa</em>) and this is in
fact what pertains to the thing in itself. Existence—or more
precisely a determination of its relation to existence—pertains
to the thing because of something else (the cause). In this respect,
non-determination coincides with possibility, whereas determination
coincides with necessity <em>per aliud</em>. In ontology, the logical
notions of the possible and the necessary become the duo of what is
“necessary in itself” and what is “necessary by
virtue of another” (<em>Naǧāt</em>: 547–549;
Lizzini 2011: 116–132).</p>

<p> The distinction between or composition of quiddity and existence
(and the modal concepts that connote it)—in short quiddity could
be said to refer to possibility, whereas existence would be
necessity—is a fundamental issue of Avicenna's
ontology. Although problematic (especially as regards mental
existence), it allows Avicenna to give an account of the so-called
“ontological difference” between the uncaused Principle
and the caused world: the First Principle is absolutely necessary and
simply coincides with, or more exactly, <em>is</em> Its own existence:
“that is” expresses a primary attribute of the Principle
(all others are relations, either positive or
negative: <em>Ilāhiyyāt</em>, VIII, 7, 367, 13–15;
cf. 4, 343, 13–344, 5; 5, 354, 12–14), whereas in
everything else there is a duality. In every <em>thing</em> the
distinction between <em>what the thing is</em> and <em>the fact that
it is</em> is inevitable. Existence can consequently be said to be
external to essence, so that an existing thing, whose essence or
quiddity is possible, can be said to be <em>composed</em> of essence
and existence.  Conversely, in that which is in itself necessary there
is no need for such a composition (there is no essence: no being
something, but only being). Necessity is an affirmation or more
precisely a confirmation of existence (<em>taʾakkud
al-wuǧūd</em>: <em>Ilāhiyyāt</em>, I, 5, 36,
4–5). The idea of a distinction/composition thus has a precise
theological function: not only does it distinguish everything from the
Necessary Principle (everything except the Principle
is <em>twofold</em>: <em>Ilāhiyyāt</em>, I, 7, 47,
18–19); it also reveals the divine creative act: everything
except the Principle <em>receives</em> (or <em>obtains</em>) existence
(<em>Ilāhiyyāt</em>, VIII, 3, 342,
10; <em>Taʿlīqāt</em>, 175, 10–176, 7). The
distinction also explains the derivation of celestial souls and bodies
from supernal intelligences: in this respect emanation is nothing but
the exposition of the dialectic between necessary existence and
possible essence, which together constitute the intelligences'
being. This same distinction between a possible essence and its
necessary existence can, finally, explain any causal relationship: a
cause is ultimately nothing but that which allows the transition from
the possible to the necessary, or that which makes possibility incline
towards necessity. Certainly, a cause may, in its turn, be possible
and so refer to a further cause, but every causal chain leads back to
the First Cause, which is in Itself necessary and one
(<em>Ilāhiyyāt</em>, VIII, 1–3).</p>

<h3><a id="QuiMenExi">3.4 Quiddity and Mental Existence</a></h3>

<p>Nevertheless, composition is not the result of an addition. Despite
the accusations of essentialism, the quiddity or essence of a thing is
not in its turn a “thing” with its own mental existence so
that, once added to (real) existence, it could become a real thing
(Lizzini 2014). This would not only lead to infinite division (in the
quiddity one would again distinguish quiddity from existence), but
also—as Avicenna notes—to Platonism
(<em>Ilāhiyyāt</em>, V, 1, 204, 4–5; cf. VII,
2–3; Marmura 2006; Porro 2002, 2011a). What Avicenna states by
distinguishing quiddity and existence is that quiddity does not
coincide with its existence: neither with its mental existence, which
is related but does not correspond to universality, nor with its
concrete existence <em>(fī l-ʿayān</em>), which implies
individuality. On this point there are two fundamental if problematic
sections of <em>Ilāhiyyāt</em> (V 1–2) where Avicenna
outlines the so-called theory of the “indifference of
essence”: in itself quiddity is only quiddity (equinity is only
equinity: <em>fa-l-farasiyya fī nafsi-hā farasiyya
faqaṭ</em> or, according to the celebrated Latin
formula, <em>equinitas ergo in se est equinitas tantum</em>). The same
logical consideration (<em>iʿtibār</em>) that Avicenna
applies to the existence of God and existence in general serves here
to explain the separation of quiddity from existence: the animal that
is <em>not on condition of</em> something other is the animal in its
reality or quiddity; it <em>can exist either in the mind or in the
concrete world</em> but only if it is accompanied by some fulfilled
conditions; the animal <em>on condition of not</em> (i.e., of not
being accompanied by any other), is the abstract form that results
from a mental consideration (<em>Ilāhiyyāt</em>, V, 1, 203,
15–204, 13). Indeed, when it exists (either <em>in
intellectu</em> or <em>in re</em>), quiddity is accompanied by
existence and by the quantitative determination that belongs to it: it
is then either universal or particular, although <em>in itself</em> it
is neither universal nor particular and is nothing but quiddity. When
it is considered with a quantitative determination, quiddity is thus
no longer considered as it is <em>in itself</em> (Alexander of
Aphrodisias' <em>Quaestiones</em> I.3 and I.11 have been indicated as
the source of this distinction: Menn 2013; cf. de Libera 1999). Every
intention (<em>maʿnā</em>), that of universality—which
is the inherent non-impossibility of a multiple predication
(<em>Ilāhiyyāt</em>, V, 1, 195, 4–196, 3)—and
those of particularity or unity, accompanies quiddity in existence
(mental or real); in Avicenna's technical terminology they are
attributes (<em>ṣifāt</em>) or necessary concomitants
(<em>lawāzim</em>) of the quiddity of the thing, not identical
with it. Quiddity (e.g., equinity) is not the universal (of horse):
</p>

<blockquote><p>the universal (<em>al-kullī</em>) insofar as
it is universal, is one thing, but insofar as it is something
accompanied by universality, it is another
thing. (<em>Ilāhiyyāt</em>, V, 1, 196, 6; Marmura 1992,
slightly modified; see also <em>The Metaphysics of the Healing</em>, 149)</p></blockquote>

<p>The indifference of quiddity to any kind of existence and
determination truly establishes the correspondence between reality and
knowledge: it is exactly because quiddity is in itself neither real
nor mental that it can be present both in reality and in the mind,
accompanied by the determinations of either individuality or
universality: in concrete reality there is x in its particular
existence, while in the mind there is x with its possible multiple
predication. In this respect, the <em>consideration</em> of quiddity
in itself—which corresponds to the thing in itself as expressed
by its definition—transcends both levels of existence (external
and mental) and in one passage is equated to the “divine
existence” (<em>wuǧūd ilāhī</em>) of
something that depends on God's providence. Scholars have recognized
here a reference to Yaḥyā ibn ʿAdī's discussion
of Alexander's essentialism (<em>Ilāhiyyāt</em>, V, 1, 204,
16–205, 4; Rashed 2004; Menn 2013; cf. Black 1999).</p>

<h3><a id="OntHenBeiOne">3.5 Ontology and Henology (Being and Oneness)</a></h3>

<p>Clearly then, not only Avicenna's ontology but also his henology
should be understood in the light of the distinction between being and
thing: the existent and the one are both primary indefinable concepts
(<em>Ilāhiyyāt</em>, I, 5, 30, 3–4) and necessary
concomitants of a thing (if a thing is, it is one), but being a thing
is different from existing and being one: <em>in itself</em> the
quiddity of a thing is neither existent nor one. Indeed, even unity is
an attribute or a concomitant added to quiddity as it exists
(<em>Ilāhiyyāt</em>, V, 1, 200, 13–201, 3; 201,
8–13). So, while for Aristotle “being” and
“one” are coextensive—being one is a <em>per se</em>
attribute of being—(they are not identical in meaning, although
Aristotle presents this possibility: <em>Metaph.</em> 1003b25),
for Avicenna being and one are a <em>per se</em> attributes of a
thing, so that being and one are coextensive, although not identical
in meaning, and this is so whenever we can speak of a
“thing” (Druart 2001; Wisnovsky 2003a, esp. 158–60)
i.e., always excepting the Principle.  Consequently there is the
difficulty of conceiving “one” as both univocal and
transcendental: being and being one coincide only because they are
both said of every category and do not indicate a substance
(<em>Ilāhiyyāt</em>, III, 2, 103,
7–9). Unity—which is an accident in the category of
quantity—is indivisibility; it is said in terms of priority and
posteriority—with a certain ambiguity
(<em>bi-l-taškīk</em>)—of several things
(<em>Ilāhiyyāt</em>, III, 2, 97, 4–5; 99, 13–14;
but cf. <em>Averroes on Aristotle's Metaphysics</em>, 39–42;
Menn 2013) and cannot coincide with being because otherwise
multiplicity could not <em>be</em> (unity and multiplicity—which
derives from unity—cannot be
opposite: <em>Ilāhiyyāt</em>, III, 3, 104, 6–7; 6,
129, 11–130, 7).</p>

<h2><a id="ModExi">4. Modality and Existence</a></h2>

<h3><a id="PosNec">4.1 Possibility and Necessity</a></h3>

<p> The so-called distinction between essence and existence reveals an
unavoidable modal characterization of being. The starting-point of
Avicenna's metaphysics is the existent, but the analysis Avicenna
applies to it (see <em>Ilāhiyyāt</em>, I, 6) does not
concern what exists insofar as it is existent (the existent is
indefinable: <em>Ilāhiyyāt</em>, I, 2, 13, 8–13), but
instead concerns the modality that explains the <em>relation</em> that
what exists has to its own existence: an existent can be either
necessary in itself
(<em>ḍarūrī</em>; <em>wāǧib</em>: it is then
also necessarily one) or possible (<em>mumkin</em>) in itself (this is
the case of every existent with the exception of the First
Principle: <em>Ilāhiyyāt</em>, I, 6, 37, 7–10). These
distinctions thus reveal the inner complex of relations that explain
existence: not only are the notions of existent and thing primary, but
so are those of unity, necessity and—to some
extent—possibility (<em>Ilāhiyyāt</em>, I, 5, 29, 5–6;
30, 3–4; 35, 3–4; 36, 4–5). If, on the one hand, the
primacy of these notions ultimately leads to positing the
transcendentals (de Libera 1994; Aertsen 2008; Bertolacci 2008a;
Koutzarova 2009), on the other hand they reveal that, in the world,
being is always <em>the being of something</em>, so that the notions
of existence (unity and necessity), although separate from that of the
thing, can never be isolated from the thing or from the relation that
it has to existence itself. A crucial point is that the division
between necessity and possibility regards <em>something that
exists</em>. Avicenna speaks, in fact, precisely of what is
“necessarily existent” or of what is “necessary as
far as existence is concerned” (<em>al-wāǧib
al-wuǧūd</em>), and of what is “possibly
existent” or “possible as far as existence is
concerned” (<em>al-mumkin al-wuǧūd</em>). What is
considered is the quiddity (<em>māhiyya</em>) or essence
(<em>ḏāt</em>) of what exists: the modality of existence
depends, in fact, not on existence (which would be impossible), but on
essence (although in the case of the Principle there is no essence
different from its own existence; see
 <a href="#UniBeiOntDis">Section 2.4</a>).</p>

<p> Necessity (by virtue of another or in itself) defines the ways in
which an <em>existent</em> exists: if an existent is necessary by
virtue of another and therefore in itself possible, it establishes a
relation 'of being caused' with something other than itself (its
cause): it is precisely this relation that explains its existence. If
an existent is necessary in itself, there is no causal relation at all
(no cause). In this respect, possibility and necessity in existence
are to be identified with the notion of need, dependence or link (the
former) and with its negation (the
latter; <em>Ilāhiyyāt</em> I, 6). Consequently, what is
possible is always and inevitably an effect and answers the question
why, while what exists necessarily does not refer to any cause and has
no “why” (<em>Ilāhiyyāt</em>, VIII, 4, 348,
5–6; cf.VIII, 1, 327, 12–329,4). The Necessary Existent
has no cause (cf. <em>Taʿlīqāt</em>, 80, 24–81,
2). It has relations in so far as it is existent
(<em>Ilāhiyyāt</em>, VIII, 3, 343, 16–344, 5).</p>

<h3><a id="ExiNecPri">4.2 The Existence of the Necessary Principle</a></h3>

<p> “Considered in themselves” (<em>iḏā
uʿtubira bi-ḏāti-hi</em>), the things that find place
in existence (<em>al-umūr allatī tadḫulu fī
l-wuǧūd</em>) are subject to “two divisions in the
intellect”: they are either “not necessarily
existent”, and therefore possible, or “necessarily
existent” (inherently impossible things do not exist and are
excluded from the analysis: <em>Ilāhiyyāt</em>, I, 6, 37,
6–10).</p>

<p> On this basis, Avicenna deduces the properties of what is in
itself necessarily existent. The first is being uncaused. It is in
fact “evident”
(<em>ẓāhir</em>: <em>Ilāhiyyāt</em>, I, 6, 38, 1)
that the necessary has no cause: to have a cause means to exist by
virtue of something else, and what exists by virtue of itself cannot
exist by virtue of another, nor can it exist by virtue of itself and
at the same time not exist by virtue of itself. The second property is
uniqueness: the necessary has no “homologue”: there is
nothing that—even if equivalent to it as regards its
definition—could exist together with it and thus occupy the same
rank of existence, without being either its cause or its effect. Two
necessary beings would in fact either both be caused (and therefore
both non-necessary), or refer to a cause that would make only one of
them exist; but in the latter case, they could no longer be defined as
equivalent or homologous (<em>mutakāfī
al-wuǧūd</em>): one would be possible and caused, while the
other—in the absence of another external cause—would be
its cause (<em>Ilāhiyyāt</em>, I, 6, 39, 17–42,
7). Indeed, as shown by the discussion of the relations between form
and matter (<em>Ilāhiyyāt</em> II, 4), and also soul and
body (see the psychological part of the <em>Book of the Healing</em>,
the <em>Kitāb al-nafs<em>; </em>Avicenna's De anima</em>, V, 4), the
co-existence of two things always implies the action of a cause that
makes them exist (Lizzini 2004).</p>

<p> Other properties (see <em>Ilāhiyyāt</em>, I, 7) are
attributable to a being necessary in itself: unity, simplicity and
then non-relativity, immutability, non-multiplicity and
non-association with anything other than itself (these properties,
among others, are discussed in terms of negative
attributes—<em>ṣifāt</em>—of the Principle
in <em>Ilāhiyyāt</em> VIII (4, 347, 10–348, 6; 5, 354,
9–14). The various and complex justifications Avicenna uses
in this respect are all reducible—as he himself observes
(<em>Ilāhiyyāt</em>, I, 7, 46, 4–5)—to a single
general line of argumentation, which shows that two supposed necessary
beings could not be distinguished one from the other: if they were to
be distinguished by virtue of an essential property, they would be
essentially different and therefore both not necessarily existent in
themselves; if they were to be distinguished by virtue of an
accidental property, they would imply the existence of an external
cause and would be equally—each of them—not necessary
(<em>Ilāhiyyāt</em>, I, 7, 43, 4–46, 5; 46, 6–47, 5.</p>

<p> The Necessarily Existent is therefore absolutely one, indivisible
and unique (<em>Ilāhiyyāt</em>, I, 7, 47, 6–9;
cf. VIII, 4, 5) and the properties of the possible are deducible as
opposite to these (<em>e contrario</em>) (<em>Ilāhiyyāt</em>,
I, 7, 47, 10–19): the possible is caused and twofold
(<em>Ilāhiyyāt</em>, I, 7, 47, 18–19); in itself it
does not exist and therefore always receives existence from something
else. The hypothesis of a possible existent thing, which can both
exist and not exist, leads necessarily to positing a cause that makes
it necessary (by virtue of another). If the possible were not rendered
necessary by its cause, but—given the cause and its relationship
to it—were still possible, it would be continuously in a state
in which it could exist and not exist. But since it exists (the
analysis concerns existing things), its relation to the cause must be
necessary. Analogously, if the cause were in its turn possible, it
would refer to a further cause that would explain the existence of
both the caused thing and its cause. If even this further cause were
possible, it would perforce have recourse to a third one, and so
on. One could not proceed <em>ad infinitum</em> (as an Aristotelian,
Avicenna accepts only a potentially infinite series of causes) and
could consequently not explain the actual existence of a thing: the
thing would still be possible and therefore non-existent.</p>

<p> The arguments of <em>Ilāhiyyāt</em> I,
6–7—which are in part both reminiscent of and influential
for those of the Kalām (Rudolph 1997; Alper 2004)—could be
interpreted as an ontological proof of God's existence (Hourani 1972;
Morewedge 1979; Marmura 1980; Davidson 1987), especially when seen in
relation to an earlier passage of <em>Ilāhiyyāt</em> I,
where Avicenna attributes to metaphysics the power to establish the
existence (<em>iṯbāt</em>) of God without recourse to sense
data (<em>Ilāhiyyāt</em> I, 3, 21). Undeniably, Avicenna
offers here a description of the status of necessary existence and a
deduction of its properties.</p>

<h3><a id="ResAna">4.3 The Results of the Analysis</a></h3>

<p> In sum, the analysis of the thinkability of existence demonstrates
that: </p>

<ol>
<li> existence and necessity are related or even coincident: every
existent is necessary, either <em>per se</em> or <em>per
aliud</em>; </li>

<li>by virtue of this correlation existents are divided into two
general categories: those that, considered in themselves require no
(causal) connection with anything other than themselves, and those that, as
they do need a (causal) link with something other, are not (in themselves)
necessary; </li>

<li> independence and dependence on some other correspond respectively
to the necessity and non-necessity of “being” or the existent; </li>

<li> everything that is not necessary in itself and is not made
necessary by something other, is possible as regards both existence
and non-existence: as such, without a necessitating cause it does not
exist; the possible is thus exactly what must establish a causal
relation as regards its own existence, which ultimately leads us back
to a necessary and absolute cause; </li>

<li>the ontological field of what is in itself necessary can
comprehend only one being, simple and absolutely one and unique: the
intellect can conceive of only one being whose existence is unrelated
to a cause, while it conceives of things as multiple only by virtue of
a relation or a connection to a
cause;<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-9" id="ref-9">9</a>]</sup> </li>

<li>the relationship between two things always implies a causal
relation (of two separate things, either one is the cause of the
other, or both are caused by a third entity), which clearly shows the
need of a vertical causality (from a superior to an inferior level of
being). </li>

</ol>

<p>This general law governs Avicenna's emanative theory: it is always
a third and superior cause that accounts for two apparently correlated
existing elements (<em>Ilāhiyyāt</em>, I, 7, 39,
16–42).</p>

<h3><a id="KinStaExi">4.4 The Kinds of Status of Existence</a></h3>

<p> The significance of these determinations becomes clear if one
considers the other kinds of status (<em>aḥkām:</em>
literally “judgments, statutes, precepts”) Avicenna assigns to existence in
addition to necessity and possibility (which
in <em>Ilāhiyyāt</em> I, 1, 7, 16–19 are said to be
among the proper accidents of being), namely <em>priority</em>
and <em>posteriority</em>, on the one hand, and <em>richness</em>
and <em>poverty</em> (or <em>indigence)</em>, on the other
(<em>Ilāhiyyāt</em>, VI, 3, 276, 13–277,
3).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-10" id="ref-10">10</a>]</sup> These
determinations explain the distinction between essence and existence
(or “proper” and “affirmative” existence) and
are, in turn, clarified by the notions of “nexus” and
“need”. Indeed, what is necessary in itself is
ontologically and axiologically <em>prior</em> to the possible
because it is independent, whereas the possible is <em>posterior</em>
precisely because it depends on a cause. Insofar as it is autonomous,
the necessary is also <em>rich</em>, while the possible, which is
posterior and secondary, is needy, poor or indigent.  The necessary
is “rich” because it is independent of any thing; the
possible is “poor” because it cannot exist without
something else (i.e., without the cause). From a theoretical point of
view, these determinations immediately refer to a causal relation
that is either negated (by what is prior, rich and necessary) or
affirmed (by what is posterior, poor and possible). In other words,
the determinations Avicenna calls the kinds of status of existence
serve to establish a clear distinction between a kind of existence
(i.e., one existent) that is necessarily uncaused and a kind of
existence (i.e., of existent things) that is necessarily
caused.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-11" id="ref-11">11</a>]</sup>
It is in fact in the light of the relationship between the absolute
Principle and the world that they reveal their true
significance. They have an absolute or a relative meaning according
to the causal relation to which they refer. If the causal relation is
relative and consequently concerns secondary causes, these
determinations are relative, so that the cause is said to be
necessary, prior and rich only with respect to its effect, not in
itself. If the relation is absolute (if it refers to the First
Cause), they are absolute: in this case, the cause is necessary,
prior and rich in itself.</p>

<h2><a id="CauCos">5. Causality and Cosmology</a></h2>

<h3><a id="CauRel">5.1 The Causal Relationship</a></h3>

<p> The causal chain is the key idea of the argument by means of which
Avicenna, in <em>Ilāhiyyāt</em> VIII, 1–3, posits a
First Cause, in accordance with—at least partly—a
cosmological scheme.  Indeed, according to some scholars, this is the
only place to track down a demonstration of the existence of the
Principle in the <em>Metaphysics</em> of the <em>Book of the Healing</em>
(Bertolacci 2007).  As an Aristotelian, Avicenna establishes formal,
material, efficient and final causes. Consequently, in order to
demonstrate the existence of a First absolute Principle, he must show
not only that “for every causal order there is a first
principle” (<em>Ilāhiyyāt</em>, VIII, 1, 327, 9) but
also that causal chains are all based on the same First Principle. The
demonstration of the finiteness of the agent causes, from which every
other series derives is an exemplar and serves as a general proof. Avicenna
deduces the finiteness of all series (<em>Ilāhiyyāt</em>,
VIII, 1, 329, 5–9) from the finiteness of an unqualified causal
series: thus all series refer to a First Principle that is both an
agent (<em>ʿilla fāʿiliyya</em>) and a final or
completive (<em>ʿilla tamāmiyya</em>) cause
(<em>Ilāhiyyāt</em> VIII, 1–3; Wisnovsky 2003a).</p>

<p> This argument has a general premise: “the cause of the
existence of a thing exists along with it”
(<em>Ilāhiyyāt</em>, VI, 2, 1, 264–265, 5; VIII, 1, 327,
11); its structure is taken directly, and almost <em>verbatim</em>,
from Aristotle. The causal chain is composed—as
in <em>Metaph.</em>, α, 2, 994 a 1–19—of
three elements: the cause (<em>al-ʿilla</em>), and then the
effect (or what is caused: <em>al-maʿlūl</em>) and the
intermediary or medium (<em>al-mutawassiṭ</em>), which both have
a “relationship” to the cause “that consists in
being caused” (<em>nisba maʿlūlyya</em>; see
 <a href="#PosNec">section 4.1</a>). In a
nutshell, the argument is simple: the existence of an effect (which is
the cause of nothing) cannot be explained without evoking a First
Cause; a cause that is cause and effect at the same time and therefore
a medium, would in turn refer to a cause: therefore, no matter how
many intermediate terms it includes, the series must always imply an
absolutely First Cause: a cause that is a cause for each element of
the series and exists together with them.</p>

<p> Defining the series on the basis of three elements (each with its
own property<em>: ḫāṣṣiyya</em>), allows
Avicenna to include the possibility of a multiplicity of intermediate
terms (<em>Ilāhiyyāt</em>, VIII, 1, 327, 12–328,
3). In a series, in fact, the first term—the absolute
cause—has the property of being the cause of all that is other
than itself; however the middle term, which is a cause for one part of
the series and an effect for the other, may repeat this relation in a
multiplicity if not in an infinity of elements (in an eternal
succession of causal relations); the effect that is simply caused,
finally, has the property of being the cause of nothing. This proves
to be the pattern of a causal series as such; and this is so not only
because any series has its own first principle, but also because every
causal series and then every causal relation finally refers to a
Principle that provides its foundation by transcending it: every
causal series implies a First absolute cause by which each of its
elements is caused (<em>Ilāhiyyāt</em>, VIII, 1, 328,
4–329, 4). A causal chain without a <em>primum</em> is therefore
impossible; if it is posited, this occurs “only through
language” (<em>bi-l-lisān</em>; <em>lingua
tantum</em>). The true causal series (i.e., the causes that always
exist <em>along with</em> their effects) are themselves always finite
(on infinity, see McGinnis 2010b).</p>

<h3><a id="CauCha">5.2 The Causal Chain</a></h3>

<p> These ideas—the series, its vertical pattern, the
distinction between internal and external causes and a transcendent
principle of the series—are also elaborated in
the <em>Kitāb al-Išārāt</em> (see IV,
9–15; IV, 1–8 for its premises)— <em>Remarks and
Admonitions</em> or <em>Pointers</em>—as the title of the work
is known in English —, a work of extreme importance for the
Eastern philosophical tradition. The <em>Išārāt</em>
argument has been defined as <em>a priori</em> or ontological (Mayer
2001; cf. Marmura 1980). It originates from the general consideration
of “every existent”: once examined in their essence
(<em>min ḥayṯu dāti-hi</em>), or in isolation,
without anything other than themselves, all existents either
necessarily have or do not have existence in themselves: that which
exists in itself is real or true (<em>al-ḥaqq</em>), it
necessarily exists (<em>al-wāǧib al-wuǧūd</em>)
and always subsists (<em>al-qayyūm</em>: an Islamic theological
term); that which does not have existence in itself is always in need
of a connection to something other, namely a condition
(<em>šarṭ</em>) that will accompany it, both when it is
conceived as existent and when conceived as non-existent. Thus,
conceiving a causal chain means positing the existence of something
that is prior and external to it.  If the connection of the possible
with something other than itself were continuously repeated, <em>ad
infinitum</em>, each unit in the chain would be possible in itself,
and the collection (<em>ǧumla</em>) that the units constitute
would also, in itself, be unnecessary. In order to devise a collection
of things, possible in themselves but existing, one must conceive of a
collection rendered necessary by virtue of something external to
it. The propensity to exist, which is necessity, is ascribed to the
units of a collection, and hence to the collection itself, by
something that, transcending it, is necessary in itself.</p>

<p> Thus Avicenna arrives at the idea of an absolute cause which is
the cause of all things: the series, its units and the relations that
bind them to one another. One might posit the existence of something
that causes some units and not others, but this would certainly not be
the absolute cause, which is a cause that cannot be caused in any
way. It is an extreme (<em>ṭaraf</em>) and therefore neither an
intermediate element nor an effect. So, every chain (<em>silsila</em>)
needs a cause external to it: an extreme—the Necessary Existent
Principle—which is not caused and therefore gives a foundation
to the causal chain without being part of it. Indeed, in
the <em>Ilāhiyyāt</em> of <em>Kitāb al-Šifā</em>
Avicenna explicitly states that the flow of being is
“distinct” (<em>mubāyin</em>) from the Principle
(<em>Ilāhiyyāt</em>, IX, 4, 403, 13).</p>

<h3><a id="AbsCre">5.3 Absolute creation</a></h3>

<p> According to Avicenna the only way to conceive creation rationally
is to conceive it as an ontological derivation outside of time. Hence
the Aristotelian model of eternity must be elaborated: the world can
be both eternal and created. It can, in fact, be continuously
(<em>dāʾiman</em>) brought into existence, without any
interruption or temporal precedence (it is possible and made eternally
necessary <em>per aliud</em> by its cause). In this manner Avicenna
not only develops Proclus' idea of an eternal effect, but also
integrates the theological concern for an absolute creation: indeed,
he intends to ascribe to the divine action the same absoluteness that
the idea of creation out of nothing is thought to imply. Using a
terminology already applied by al-Kindī and distinctly
reminiscent of Neo-Platonic texts (Janssens 1997), Avicenna states
that the philosophers understand “creation”
(<em>ibdāʿ</em>) as an act of bringing into existence that
does not suppose a world preceded by non-existence (which would mean
that creation was placed in time), but nonetheless absolutely excludes
that same possibility of non-existence (Marmura 1984; Janssens 1987;
Lizzini 2011):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
This is the meaning that philosophers
(<em>al-ḥukamāʾ</em>) term “instauration”
(<em>ibdāʿ</em>): it is to make the thing be
(<em>taʾyīs al-šayʾ</em>) after an absolute
non-being (<em>baʿda lays muṭlaq</em>).  In fact, it
belongs to the effect in itself to be <em>non-being</em>
(<em>lays</em>), while because of its cause it belongs to it to be
“being” (<em>ays</em>). And what belongs to the thing in
itself is prior in the mind (<em>ḏihn</em>)—as regards
essence, not as regards time—to that which <em>is</em> because
of something other than itself. Here then each caused [thing]
“is” (<em>ays</em>) after “not being”
(<em>lays</em>), according to a posteriority in essence
(<em>Ilāhiyyāt</em>, VI, 2, 266,
12–15).</p></blockquote>

<p>It is precisely on the basis of the problematic identification of
possibility and non-existence (here <em>lays</em>
elsewhere also <em>ʿadam</em>: <em>Ilāhiyyāt</em>, VIII, 3,
342, 6–343, 6) that Avicenna shapes his idea of the divine flow in
opposition to the theological conception of creation in time: for him
non-existence is what the possible in itself deserves.  Reworking the
Aristotelian ideas of anteriority and agent causality, he ascribes to
the creation by the First Principle (with the consequent non-existence
of the effect) not a temporal but an essential anteriority (Marmura
1984). A non-existence that is prior in time would refute the
absoluteness of creation because it would, contradictorily, posit
non-existence. Moreover, this would explain a relative
creation—a “certain causing to be”
(<em>taʾyīs mā</em>)—but not an absolute
instauration. The principle according to which Avicenna excludes time
in the instaurative act of the First Principle is the same one that
leads him to exclude any mediation: in order to be truly and
absolutely that which makes things existent, the First Principle must
perform an act that is free of any mediation; as Avicenna states in
the <em>Kitāb al-Išārāt</em> (Dunyā, III vol., 95),
creation is not conceivable in terms of time because a time before the
creative act of God would end up being an intermediate between the
First Principle and the world:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Instauration (<em>ibdāʿ</em>) [signifies that] from the
thing [is derived] existence for [something] other than it, which 
depends on it alone, without an intermediary [such as] matter, or an
instrument or a time. On the contrary, what is preceded by a temporal
non-existence does not do without an intermediary. Instauration is of
a higher rank than generation (<em>takwīn</em>) and than bringing
[the thing] into being in time
(<em>iḥdāt</em>).</p></blockquote>

<p> The action of the First Cause must therefore be conceived as
exempt from any mediation.  Nothing (neither a matter, nor an act of
will, nor even time) can be inserted between the Principle and Its
effect (see also <em>Ḥudūd</em>: 42–43). An image
often occurs in Avicenna's writings: the causality of the First
Principle is similar to that of the hand that moves the key in the
lock of a door: the movement of the hand and that of the
key—respectively the cause and the effect—are
simultaneous, and yet one is prior to the other. Priority is
essential, not temporal (<em>Ilāhiyyāt</em>, IV, 1,
165).</p>

<h3><a id="EmaCelIntSouBod">5.4 Emanation: Celestial Intelligences, Souls and Bodies</a></h3>

<p> Avicenna explains the creation of the world with an idea he
adopted from Arabic Neo-Platonic writings: emanation, in
Arabic <em>fayḍ</em> (literally “flow”; cf. the
Latin <em>fluxus</em>; Hasnawi 1990), which, like the
Greek <em>aporrein</em> originally indicated the flow of water from a
source.  By virtue of an act of thought which is outside time and
totally auto-reflective—the First Principle is Itself
intelligence, as well as subject and object of
intellection: <em>ʿaql, ʿāqil</em>
and <em>maʿqūl</em> (<em>Ilāhiyyāt</em>, VIII, 6,
357, 3–12; cf. Arist., <em>Metaph</em>., XII (Λ) 7, 9)—a
thinking entity is derived from the First Principle: an intellect or
intelligence (<em>ʿaql</em>) which is both the objectification of
the intellection of the Principle and an active subject of thought. To
the extent that is possible for a caused entity (which is in itself
relative), this first emanated intelligence is “one”
(“from the one, insofar as it is one, comes only
one”: <em>ex uno non fit nisi
unum</em>; <em>Ilāhiyyāt</em>, IX, 4, 405, 13–14;
cf. IX, 5, 411, 1, 5–6; <em>Išārāt</em>, III,
ed. Dunyā, 95–102; cf. <em>Taʿlīqāt</em>,
97, 12–13). Nevertheless, unlike the Principle, which is
absolutely simple, this first caused intelligence is already a complex
existence. The reason for its existence lies in fact not only in
itself—as in the case of the First Principle—but in itself
(in its possibility) and in the First Principle's act of thinking,
which makes it necessary: this first created intelligence is therefore
twofold.</p>

<p> Indeed the intrinsic duality of the first caused intelligence
exhibits both the structure of the universe
(<em>Ilāhiyyāt</em>, I, 7, 47, 18–19) and, at the same
time, the reason the universe unfolds: if the First Principle's
thought can only be simple and auto-reflective, that of the first
caused intelligence is already a complex thought. This first caused
intelligence has not only two possible objects of thought (its
Principle and itself); it also has a thought of itself, which is in
turn complex: it reflects the duality of its own being, in which
essence and existence (and therefore possibility and necessity) are to be
distinguished. Hence the first caused intelligence thinks of the First
Principle and then proceeds in its auto-intellection according to a
descent which, as in a mirror, reflects (thus showing it in reverse),
the ontological order of causality: the intelligence thinks first of
all of its existence or actualization (its necessity <em>per
aliud</em>) and then recognizes its potential foundation (its essence
as possible). The effect of this articulation is consequently triple
(“from every intelligence three things
follow”: <em>Ilāhiyyāt</em>, IX, 4, 406
11–15): </p>

<ol>
<li>from the act by which the first caused intelligence thinks of the
First Principle and aims at it, a further intelligence originates;
from the act by which it thinks of itself and aims at itself, two
entities originate: </li>

<li>a soul, which is an intelligence bound to a body and which is, in
some texts, equated to the practical intellect
(<em>Ilāhiyyāt</em>, IX, 2, 387, 4–7); and </li>

<li>the celestial body to which this intelligence is bound.</li>

</ol>

<p> Clearly, the consequence of the immediacy of the divine act is the
necessity of the series: only one caused element can derive directly
from the absolutely unique Principle. Multiplicity is produced by
mediation and the product of divine causality is divided between what
is created directly (and is necessarily one) and what is created by
way of mediation. With his emanative doctrine, Avicenna thus maintains
the idea of the absolute causation of being and simultaneously
establishes two distinct kinds of effects: those that correspond to
the intermediate (<em>mutawassiṭ</em>), which is caused without
mediation, and those that are like the last caused thing
(<em>maʿlūl</em>), which is caused by virtue of the
intermediate and is only an effect. In Avicenna's emanative scheme,
the first effects correspond to the celestial entities (and, strictly
speaking, only to the first one, which is caused or
“instaured” or absolutely created<em>: al-mubdaʿ
al-awwal</em>); the following ones are, roughly speaking, all the
effects (and, strictly speaking, the sublunary effects).</p>

<p> This pattern also explains the relations among the different
causal series: as is the case in the Neo-Platonic tradition Avicenna
divides the four Aristotelian causes into internal and external as
regards the thing of which they are causes (Jolivet 1991; Bertolacci
2002; Wisnovsky 2003b); thus he inserts them in a hierarchy
(cause-intermediate-caused) that places the intermediate term above
the last effect, but below the absolute cause. In the sublunary world,
for example, the form is part of the cause of matter and is superior
to it, because it is an intermediate in the causal relation that binds
matter (the last caused thing) to the intelligence—the <em>dator
formarum—</em> from which both form and matter result
(<em>Ilāhiyyāt</em>, II, 4, 87, 13–89, 15; VI, 1, 259,
7–10). Moreover, the effects that are caused without mediation
are absolutely created (or “instaured”) and immaterial and
consequently defined only by the ontological composition of the
possibility of their essence and the necessity of their existence;
those that are caused by virtue of a mediation are defined by virtue
of their ontological composition (possibility and necessity; existence
distinct from essence), but also by virtue of the composition that is
consequent to the mediation: they are material entities, composed of
matter and form. In this sense the whole of the cosmos is explained:
the intelligences (<em>al-ʿuqūl</em>) that are caused
directly by the Necessarily Existent (properly speaking only the first
of them); the entities originated by virtue of the intellection of the
first intelligences: the souls (<em>al-nufūs</em>) and the
heavenly bodies (<em>al-aǧrām al-samāwiyya</em>). Both
of these have an influence on the sublunary world and—like the
celestial intelligences—are sometimes called
“angels” in religious terms (<em>Ilāhiyyāt</em>,
X, 1); they are followed by the world of simple effects: the beings of
the sublunary world. </p>

<p> Indeed the intellectual process is welded to cosmology (in which
the Ptolemaic system is painstakingly harmonized with
Aristotle's <em>Metaphysics</em>, Book Λ and <em>De
Caelo</em>). The whole of the heavens is explained in terms of
emanation or flow. In some texts, Avicenna mentions “ten
intelligences after the First” (<em>Ilāhiyyāt</em>,
IX, 3, 401, 9–12): the Heavens—the outermost orb, and the
orb of the fixed stars, and then Saturn, and so on, up to and
including, according to the traditional scheme, the animated spheres
of Jupiter, Mars, the Sun, Venus, Mercury and the Moon—are bound
to the intelligences. The earth is at the center. Theology,
metaphysics, cosmology and (celestial) noetic seem fused with one
another.</p>

<p> The noetic process also explains the multiplicity of
intelligibles: the Aristotelian idea of the First Principle
as <em>noesis noeseos</em> is interpreted by means of Themistius' idea
of Its knowing all things through Itself
(<em>Ilāhiyyāt</em>, VIII, 6, 359, 15–360,
10; <em>Commentaire Lambda</em>: 13; Pines 1987; Bertolacci 2006), but
in the Principle's thinking the multiple is intellected as a
“whole” and “at once” and appears to be
reduced to something unique (to <em>one</em> intelligible). Thus, its
order (<em>tartīb</em>), the syllogistic concatenation of
intellection that corresponds to reality, is a consequent of divine
intellection and is in a sense relocated from the thought of the First
Principle to that of its immediate effects
(<em>Ilāhiyyāt</em>, VIII, 7, 362, 17–366).
</p>

<h3><a id="CelMov">5.5 Celestial Movement</a></h3>

<p> The explanation of celestial movement elaborates and alters some
of Aristotle's (and al-Fārābī's) ideas. Intelligences
and souls together explain—as remote and proximate causes
respectively—the motion of the spheres, as they are at the root
of the influence (<em>taʾaṯṯur </em>) the spheres have on the
sublunary world. Metaphysics explains cosmology—to which it is
linked—but also adopts its data. Thus the circular movement of
the spheres is explained by Avicenna not directly by means of
nature—celestial bodies always leave the spot they have just
attained only to return to occupy it again later, whereas through
natural movement a body should come to rest in its <em>locus
naturalis</em>—but by means of a principle which is both
intellectual and psychic (<em>Ilāhiyyāt</em>, IX, 2, 382,
8–383, 13): the motion of the spheres is a reflection of the
love and desire (<em>ʿišq</em>
and <em>tašawwuq</em>; <em>Ilāhiyyāt</em>, IX, 2,
387, 1–392, 3), common to both intelligences and souls, to
resemble their principle (to realize their
assimilation—<em>tašabbuh</em>—to it). It is
because of this desired resemblance that celestial bodies actualize,
by occupying all their possible positions in turn, the only
potentiality they have (<em>Ilāhiyyāt</em>, IX, 2, 389,
13–390, 8; Hasnawi 1984; Janos 2011). In other words, celestial
souls continuously move the bodies to which they are bound in order to
realize this resemblance: each time they have before them the
representation of a point they must reach by virtue of which
imperfection will, however briefly, be eliminated; in a way that is in
part irrational, each time every soul chooses one point rather than
another (<em>Ilāhiyyāt</em>, IX, 2, 383, 10–11).</p>

<p> The movement of the spheres is thus explained by combining nature,
soul and intelligence.  Indeed, the soul follows nature
(<em>Ilāhiyyāt</em>, IX, 2, 383, 7–13; in a sense,
since it is not opposed to the potentiality of the body, celestial
motion could be defined as natural), but is also thought and
will. Only an intellectual discursive will, which is capable of a
particular intellection, can explain the celestial movement by which
the body is always located in a particularly determined position: the
soul conceives and therefore elects and desires a movement whose
status (to leave a point in order to return to it and then leave it
again as in a cycle) is rightly expressed by a paradox: celestial
movement is “persistence itself”
(<em>Ilāhiyyāt</em>, IX, 3, 398, 2–7). In fact,
intelligences guarantee the infinity of motion because their thought
is oriented towards the Principle; every intelligence moves because it
looks to the Principle as to its object of love and assimilation and
consequently receives from It an infinite light
(<em>Ilāhiyyāt</em>, IX, 2, 389, 10–13),
while—as we have observed
(see <a href="#TheVocMetFirPriAbsCau">Section 2.3</a>)—the First
Principle is not a direct but a transcendent principle of motion: it
is the ultimate horizon to which the intelligences look with their
desire for resemblance.</p>

<h2><a id="Con">6. Conclusion</a></h2>

<h3><a id="EthDim">6.1 The Ethical Dimension</a></h3>

<p>The attribution of intellection and hence awareness to the
Necessarily Existent (<em>Ilāhiyyāt</em>, VIII, 7, 368,
6; <em>Taʿlīqāt</em>, 50, 23–52) allows Avicenna
to connote the divine act in an ethical sense: according to Avicenna
the flow explains the procession of being from the
Principle—also called the Pure Good
(<em>Ilāhiyyāt</em>, IX, 3, 394, 4)—in different terms
from those used of natural necessity (which is explicitly rejected
together with its typical image of
light: <em>Ilāhiyyāt</em>, VIII, 7, 363,
10–13). The atemporal act “at one blow”
(<em>dufʿatan wāḥidatan</em>) of divine
intellection—according to the formula already present in the
<em>pseudo-Theology of Aristotle</em>—is interpreted as an act of
will (<em>irāda</em>) and love (ʿ<em>išq</em>). The
First Necessarily Existent “creates” the world, because,
having intellection of Itself, It comprehends, intends, wants and
loves Its own intellection and the consequences that this entails
(<em>Ilāhiyyāt</em>, VIII, 7, 363, 14–17; 366,
8–17; <em>Commentaire Lambda</em>: 15, 23–24). Will and
love—which Avicenna includes among the attributes of the
Principle (<em>Ilāhiyyāt</em>, VIII, 7, 366, 6–8; 370,
7)—explain the flow revealing its ethical dimension
(<em>Ilāhiyyāt</em>, VIII, 7, 367, 7–11). The flow is
the good (<em>ḫayr</em>) and generosity (<em>ǧūd</em>)
and gives the world, or lets it acquire the good: indeed, the flow is
good for the world, as it is generosity in itself (Lizzini 2005). Even
evil (defined as non-existence or privation) is an object of divine
will: it is willed accidentally, i.e., insofar as it is a necessary
consequent of the good (<em>Ilāhiyyāt</em>, IX, 6; Steel
2002). Will is also ascribed to the First Principle in terms of
logical possibility: the Principle always wills (there is no time
lag), but It could nevertheless have not willed to create
(<em>Ilāhiyyāt</em>, IV, 2, 172, 13–173, 12). The very
rejection of the temporal dimension which would allow an authentic
conception of <em>creatio ex nihilo</em>, is also the condition of a
true conception of the divine will, a will that coincides totally with
the being of the Principle and aims at a good inherent in It, from
which the good of the world follows as a consequence. The flow is
indeed a communication or donation of existence: it explains the
necessity <em>per aliud</em> of possible essences and, as a donation,
connotes, in an ethical sense, the divine act (Lizzini 2011). At the
same time, the definition of absolute good as the full realization of
possibility is the very basis on which Avicenna ascribes an ethical
dimension to the action of the First Principle; and this comes not
without difficulty: it entails the First Principle's having to create
the world, because the realization of possibilities would be good
(Lizzini 2014).</p>

<h3><a id="SubWorMatEvi">6.2 The Sublunary World: Matter and Evil</a></h3>

<p>Without Avicenna's attempting to provide a philosophical reason for
it (<em>Ilāhiyyāt</em>, IX, 4, 407,
4–8; <em>Išārāt</em>, ed. Dunyā, III,
228–230), the last intelligence does not lead to a further
intelligence but instead looks after the sublunary world and human
beings. Indeed, the last intelligence provides forms for the sublunary
world. Called—with an expression that was to be in great favor
in the Latin medieval world (which came to know it also through
al-Ghazālī) “bestower” or “giver of
forms” (<em>dator formarum</em>; Arabic: <em>wāhib
al-ṣuwar</em>; but, for Avicenna, this name can be applied to
all intelligences: <em>Ilāhiyyāt</em>, IX, 5, 411; 413), the
last Intelligence or Agent Intellect (<em>al-ʿaql
al-faʿʿāl</em>) represents the principle of the physical
constitution of the world as well as the founding principle of human
intellection (which at least in some texts Avicenna explains through
the idea of donation). In general terms, the sublunary world is
explained by means of the metaphysical structures used by Aristotle:
matter and form, potentiality and act.  These structures are
nevertheless sustained by the emanative pattern which explains the
world not only as regards its origin, but also as regards its
“life”: generations and natural transformations are
conceived as the result of a process by which matter becomes
specifically prepared to receive the gift of forms from above. So to
the active donation of forms by the Agent Intellect, Avicenna adds the
influence of the spheres, the mutual interactions of the sublunary
elements as preparatory causes and the reception of matter. The
dynamic ideas of potency and act are thus elaborated and complicated:
the idea of potency—<em>quwwa</em>—to which Avicenna adds
those of preparation (<em>istiʿdād</em>) and specific or
proper preparation (<em>istiʿdād 
ḫāṣṣ</em>)—is interpreted in the light of
emanation: the potency of matter is reception in time and is in fact
possibility in time. In the temporal dimension of the sublunary
world—where what becomes is something after not having been it,
possibility requires a substratum (matter) and becomes material
potency: it thus explains a non-eternal thing, which is brought into
existence “after being non-existent”
(<em>Ilāhiyyāt</em>, IV, 2, 181, 7–12).</p>

<h3><a id="ConRem">6.3 Concluding Remarks</a></h3>

<p> Hence, through the concept of emanation, Avicenna explains the
God-world relationship and, more generally, efficient causality. The
causality of motion (<em>taḥrīk</em>) and of influence
(<em>taʾaṯṯur</em>) are both added to and subsumed under the
causality of emanation, which is sustained by the ideas of both
donation and reception. With his metaphysics Avicenna provides a
foundation for every level of his theory: physics and then psychology,
gnoseology or epistemology, prophecy (<em>Ilāhiyyāt</em>, X,
2–3) and even eschatology (<em>Ilāhiyyāt</em>, IX, 7;
Michot 1986) find their ultimate explanation in the metaphysical
concept of the flow of forms. Consequently, if
the <em>Ilāhiyyāt</em> of
the <em>Kitāb al-Šifā'</em>  and the metaphysical parts of the
other <em>summae</em> (<em>Salvation, Remarks, Science</em>) together
with the <em>Kitāb  al-Taʿlīqāt</em> (<em>The Book of
Notes</em>) and other writings like the <em>Kitāb al-Mabdaʾ
wa-l-maʿād (The Book of Provenance and Destination)</em>,
are essential to the study of metaphysics, it is no exaggeration to
state that every work Avicenna devoted to philosophy can be relevant
to the understanding of his metaphysical ideas and that metaphysical
works clarify the other parts of Avicenna's system: metaphysics is
omni-comprehensive.</p>
