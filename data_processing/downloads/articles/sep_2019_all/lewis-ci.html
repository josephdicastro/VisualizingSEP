<p>
Clarence Irving (C.I.) Lewis was perhaps the most important American
academic philosopher active in the 1930s and 1940s. He made major
contributions in epistemology and logic, and, to a lesser degree,
ethics. Lewis was also a key figure in the rise of analytic philosophy
in the United States, both through the development and influence of
his own writings and through his influence, direct and indirect, on
graduate students at Harvard, including some of the leading analytic
philosophers of the last half of the 20<sup>th</sup> century.</p>

<h2><a name="BriBio">1. Brief Biography</a></h2>

<p>
C.I. Lewis was born on April 12, 1883 in Stoneham, Massachusetts and
died on February 2, 1964 in Menlo Park, California. He was an
undergraduate at Harvard from 1902–1906, where he was influenced
principally by the pragmatist, William James, and the idealist, Josiah
Royce. Royce also supervised Lewis's 1910 Harvard Ph.D. dissertation
“ The Place of Intuition in Knowledge”. While serving as
Royce's teaching assistant in logic, Lewis read Whitehead's and
Russell's <em>Principia Mathematica</em>, a book he both admired and
criticized. Later, while teaching at the University of California at
Berkeley from 1911–1920, his principal research interests
switched to logic. Lewis wrote a series of articles on symbolic logic
culminating in his 1918 monograph <em>A Survey of Symbolic Logic</em>
(SSL) (Lewis 1918) in which he both surveyed developments in logic up
to his day and concluded with his own modal system of strict
implication. However, in response to criticism of his account of
strict implication, Lewis deleted these sections from reprints of SSL
and revised his treatment of their topics for his co-authored 1932
book <em>Symbolic Logic</em> (SL) (Lewis and Langford 1932) —
“the first comprehensive treatment of systems of strict
implication (or indeed of systems of modal logic at all)”,
according to Hughes and Cresswell (1968, 216). </p>

<p>
Lewis returned to Harvard in 1920, where he taught until his
retirement in 1953, becoming Edgar Peirce Professor of Philosophy in
1948. At Harvard, Lewis' major research interest switched back to
epistemology. Starting with his much reprinted 1923 article, “A
Pragmatic Conception of the <em>A Priori</em>” (Lewis 1923), he
developed a distinctive position of his own which he labeled
“conceptual pragmatism” and which he presented in a
systematic way in his 1929 book <em>Mind and the World Order</em>
(MWO) (Lewis 1929). MWO established Lewis as a major figure on the
American philosophical scene. In the 1930s and 1940s, partly in
response to the challenge of positivism, the form and focus of Lewis'
views changed, and, arguably, in subtle ways, some of the substance.
In his 1946 book <em>Analysis of Knowledge and Valuation</em> (AKV),
based on his 1944 Carus lectures, Lewis (1946) provided a systematic
and carefully analytic presentation of his mature philosophical views.
The first two thirds of the book consist of a thorough refinement and
more precise presentation of his theory of meaning and of his
epistemological views, and the last third consists of a presentation
of his theory of value.</p>

<p>
After retirement from Harvard, Lewis taught and lectured at a number
of universities, including Princeton, Columbia, Indiana, Michigan
State, and Southern California, but principally at Stanford. His 1954
Woodbridge Lectures at Columbia and 1956 Mahlon Powell Lectures at
Indiana resulted in two last short books in ethics, <em>The Ground and
the Nature of the Right</em> (Lewis 1955) and <em>Our Social
Inheritance</em> (Lewis 1957). Lewis was the subject of a posthumously
published “Library of Living Philosophers” volume (Schilpp
1968), an honour that indicates his standing in and perceived
significance for American philosophy in the 1950s. </p>

<p>
In his over thirty years at Harvard, Lewis taught some of the most
eminent American philosophers of the last half of the twentieth
century as graduate students, including W.V. Quine, Nelson Goodman,
Roderick Chisholm, Roderick Firth, and Wilfrid Sellars. Although only
Chisholm and Firth of these five were supervised by Lewis, and Sellars
left Harvard without graduating, all five refer occasionally to Lewis
in their writings, usually critically, and their own views sometimes
developed in reaction to his. (Baldwin 2007 has an excellent
discussion of the influence of Lewis on Quine, and of Lewis's
philosophy generally.)</p>

<h2><a name="OveConPra">2. Overview of Conceptual Pragmatism</a></h2>

<p>
In MWO, Lewis (1929, Chp. 1) argued that the proper method of
philosophy isn't transcendental but rather reflective. Philosophy
seeks the criteria or principles of the real, the right, the
beautiful, and the logically valid that are implicit in human
experience and activity. </p>

<p>
Lewis (1929, 37–8) thought that, on reflection and analysis, we
can distinguish three elements in perceptual knowledge: (1) the given
or immediate data of sense, (2) the act of interpreting the given as
an experience of one sort of thing as opposed to another, and (3) the
concept by which we so interpret the given by relating it to other
possibilities of experience. Our experience of the real is not given
to us in experience but is constructed by us from the data of sense
through acts of interpretation. So when I know that I am looking at a
table and reflect on my experience, I realize, on analysis, that there
are certain highly specific sensuous qualities presented to me that I
am immediately aware of, and that, in the light of this and other
experiences I recall, I expect that I would likely have certain other
experiences, e.g., those of feeling something apparently hard, were I
to have the experience of performing certain acts, e.g., reaching out
with my hand. In doing so, it is the concept of seeing a table that I
am applying to my experience rather than that of seeing a horse or
that of hallucinating a table, either of which would have involved
different expectations of experience consequent upon action. Only an
active being can therefore have knowledge, and the principal function
of empirical knowledge “is that of an instrument enabling
transition from the actual present to a future which is desired and
which the present is believed to signalize” (Lewis (1946),
4).</p>

<p>
Statements expressing our beliefs about reality are translatable into,
and thus entail and are entailed by, an indefinitely large set of
counterfactual statements about what experiences we would have or
would be likely to have, were we to be presented with certain sensory
cues and were we to carry out further tests (Lewis 1929, 142; 1946,
180, 208). Objectively, what we actually experience may depend on the
physical circumstances of perception, e.g. lighting conditions, and
the bodily actions we perform, e.g. moving our eyes, as well, of
course, as the character of objects in our environment. However, what
matters ultimately for the meaning and confirmation of statements
about objective reality, as Lewis makes clear in AKV, are only the
“felt experience” of action and the directly presentable
sense experiences contained in sensory cues and forming the
experiential circumstances of action (Lewis 1946, 178-9, 245-6). The
idea of a reality neither confirmable nor disconfirmable in principle
by experience was thus for Lewis without meaning. What distinguished
his view, he thought, from the superficially similar verification
principle of meaning of the logical positivists was his emphasis on
the mediating role of agency (Lewis 1941a, in Lewis 1970, 94). </p>

<p>
Whether our objective beliefs are true depends on their verifiable or
confirmable implications for future possible experience. However, in
order to guide action effectively now while saving us from the hazards
of action without foresight, empirical belief and its expectations for
experience must be rationally credible (justified, warranted) now,
antecedent to future verification (Lewis 1946, 254-7). Justification,
as opposed to verification, is the focus of AKV much more so than MWO.
Nonetheless, throughout Lewis' career from MWO to the end, there are
common claims. First, empirical knowledge (rationally credible,
justified, or warranted belief) is probable knowledge or belief.
Second, probability is a logical or inferential relation between a
conclusion or a belief and its premises or grounds. Third, the
ultimate premises or grounds, as opposed to more immediate or
proximate ones, relative to which a conclusion or belief is probable
cannot themselves be probable but must be certain (Lewis 1929, 328-9,
340-1; Lewis 1946, 186-7; Lewis 1952a).</p>

<p>
The direct apprehension of immediately given sense presentations, and
statements expressing them, are incorrigible, indubitable, not in need
of verification, and not subject to error, and so, in these various
(and distinct) senses “certain”. (For a useful discussion
of senses of “certainty” in Lewis, see Firth 1964 and
Firth 1968 in Schilpp 1968.) However, with no possibility of error or
incorrectness to contrast with the immediate awareness of the given,
Lewis decides the normative label “knowledge” shouldn't
really be applied to it. Our objective interpretations of experience,
on the other hand, are not only fallible—given and recalled
experience doesn't guarantee the satisfaction of our expectations
about future experience--but are always subject to revision in the
light of action and further experience. Past experience and our
recollection of it play a key role in the credibility of these
interpretations. In MWO, Lewis (1929, 337) says that memory itself is
an interpretation of given present recollection, and, as such,
probable knowledge with testable or verifiable implications for future
experience. However, this doesn't explain what warrants the
interpretation and its expectations, a <em>lacuna</em> AKV
corrects. Knowing for Lewis occurs in a non-instananeous
“epistemological present” of sense presentation embedded
in a mass of recollections or sense of past experience (Lewis 1946,
331). What is given and indubitably certain in this present are these
sense presentations and these rememberings (Lewis 1946, 354, 362)),
but what we recall of past experience is <em>prima facie</em> and
non-inductively credible for us, just because so ostensibly remembered
or recalled (Lewis 1946, 334), and thus can serve to make our
expectations of future experience rationally credible as well. </p>

<p>
Despite their lack of theoretical certainty, the beliefs we form by
applying concepts to experience may count as knowledge so long as they
are true and sufficiently warranted or justified. The members of a set
of beliefs that already have some degree of confirmation or antecedent
probability in relation to present and past experience may become even
more credible if the antecedent probability of any one would be
increased by assuming the others as given (Lewis 1946, 187, 338, 349,
351, 352). The congruence of a mature system of beliefs which exhibits
this complex interlocking pattern of probability relations to each
other and to experience helps to explain how many of these beliefs can
rise to the standards for knowledge and be “practically
certain” enough to be counted on in action. </p>

<p>
Ordinary beliefs and interpretations, including perceptual beliefs,
are, for Lewis, typically the product of habit or association in which
we are guided by the elements of the given in the epistemological
present but rarely if ever attend to them. Nonetheless, the
justification of these beliefs as rationally credible requires that
there be an inferential or logical relationship of a belief or a
statement of it to grounds or reasons in experience that constitute
evidence, largely inductive, for it (Lewis 1946, 315, Lewis 1952a,
reprinted in Lewis 1970, 326). For Lewis, “the critical question
for the validity of empirical knowledge is not whether grounds
sufficient for the justification of the belief are actually contained
in the explicit psychological state of the believer, but whether the
knower's situation in empirical belief is such that sufficient grounds
could be elicited upon inquiry, or whether it is such that this is
even theoretically impossible” (Lewis 1946, 330). Restricting
the term “knowledge” to cases where grounds are explicit
would “be so rigoristic as to exclude most, if not all, of our
attempted cognitions and would obscure the important distinction of
practically valuable knowledge from ‘ignorance’ and from
‘error’” (Lewis 1946,330), just as restricting the term to
what we are certain of would. Nor should we think that the act of
reflecting on and eliciting what in the epistemological present
justifies our beliefs loses or takes us beyond the epistemological
present (Lewis 1946, 330-2), and thus is an impossible ideal. </p>

<p>
In MWO Lewis argues that probable empirical knowledge requires, on
pain of infinite regress, some <em>a priori</em> knowledge of analytic
principles explicating our concepts, the logical relationships among
them, and the criteria for applying them to experience and determining
what is real and what isn't real. Moreover, this knowledge must be
“more than probable” and “certain”, which
suggests that they have a degree of warrant greater than the degree of
probability empirical considerations could yield (Lewis 1929, 311-12,
317,321). In AKV, he also says that mathematical and logical
cognitions “may be certain” (Lewis, 1946, 29), at least in
certain cases, but he worries how they can refer to anything beyond
the cognition itself, and be classified as knowledge, if their truth
is simply the unthinkability of their falsity, given our concepts or
way of thinking. The answer is that we can be mistaken about what is
implicit in our concepts. We can fail to observe what is implicit in
our concepts and what their adoption consistently commits us to in our
thinking, and that contrast with error allows him to classify <em>a
priori</em> apprehension as knowledge. Nonetheless, any of these
mistakes is “intrinsically possible of correction merely by
taking thought of the matter” (Lewis 1946, 155) without
empirical investigation. The correctness of the principles governing
our concepts can be known <em>a priori</em>, independently of
confirmation in experience, in so far as they can be certified or
assured simply by analysis of meaning or reflection on the content of
our concepts and our explicative principles (Lewis 1946, 151,165). So,
quite apart from issues about certainty, the degree to which we are
warranted in our <em>a priori</em> apprehensions needn't correspond to
and isn't a function of their probability on the total set of
empirical considerations (cf.  Lewis 1926, reprinted in Lewis 1970,
243-4). </p>

<p>
What then is tested and confirmed or disconfirmed by experience is the
interpretation of experience in the light of our concepts, ordinary
empirical concepts like dog as well as more abstract categories like
causality or the concepts of logic. What isn't tested by experience is
the validity of the concepts themselves, or the logical relationships
amongst them, or the principles for applying them. Agents bring them
to experience and the only criteria they answer to are pragmatic ones
of utility or convenience (Lewis 1929, 271–2).That implies that
they are also revisable on pragmatic grounds, as Lewis himself
recognizes he is doing to some extent with the concept of knowledge
itself (Lewis 1946,27-29, 183) . </p>

<p>
Right at the heart of Lewis' philosophical system, then, are several
theses that weren't original to Lewis, but the critical discussion
(and sometimes rejection) of which, often in the form Lewis gave to
them, was central to much analytic philosophy in the last half of the
twentieth century. Among them are: (1) a sharp analytic/synthetic,
<em>a priori/ a posteriori</em> distinction, (2) reductionism
concerning the meaning of a physical object statement to the actual
and possible sense experiences that would confirm the statement, (3) a
foundation for all empirical knowledge in our direct apprehension or
immediate awareness of the given character of experience and our
recollections of it, and (4) the division of experience into its given
content or character, on the one hand, and the form we impose on it,
or the concepts in the light of which we interpret it, on the other.
(Quine (1953) famously called (1) and (2) the “two dogmas of
empiricism”; Sellars (1963) called (3) the “myth of the
given”; and Davidson (1984) called (4) the “third dogma of
empiricism”, although in Lewis' mind (4) may owe more to
Kant—on whom Lewis taught a course regularly at
Harvard—than to the empiricists.)</p>

<p>
At the same time, Lewis (1946, 9–11, 254–9) also laid down
a framework of assumptions, most explicitly in AKV, within which
analytic epistemology flourished in the last half of the
20<sup>th</sup> century: (1) knowledge is sufficiently justified
(warranted, rationally credible) true belief , (2) a belief may be
justified without being true and true without being justified, and (3)
epistemology seeks to elicit criteria or principles of justification
or rationally credibility. </p>

<h2><a name="LogLan">3. Logic and Language</a></h2>

<p>
Lewis was dissatisfied with the extensional truth functional logic of
<em>Principia Mathematica</em>, and with its understanding of
implication as material implication, according to which the truth of
the if-then conditional <em>p</em> ⊃ <em>q</em> expressing the
material implication of <em>q</em> by <em>p</em> is a function just of
the truth or falsity of <em>p</em> and <em>q</em>. <em>p</em> ⊃
<em>q</em> is equivalent to ~(<em>p</em> &amp; ~<em>q</em>) and is
true just in case it isn't the case both that <em>p</em> is true and
<em>q</em> is false. As a result, among the theses of <em>Principia
Mathematica</em> are <em>p</em> ⊃ (<em>q</em> ⊃ <em>p</em>)
and not-<em>p</em> ⊃ (<em>p</em> ⊃ <em>q</em>). In other
words, a true proposition, whatever it happens to be, is implied by
any proposition whatsoever, true or false, and a false proposition,
whatever it happens to be, implies any proposition whatsoever, true or
false. Lewis didn't deny these theses, properly understood relative to
the definition of material implication. However, he did think that
these so-called “paradoxes of material implication” meant
that material implication doesn't provide a proper understanding of
any ordinary notion of implication, according to which one proposition
implies another just in case the latter logically follows from and is
deducible from the former.</p>

<p>
To explicate this notion he defined strict implication, according to
which the if-then conditional <em>p</em>
<img src="fishhook.jpg" alt="strictly implies" />
<em>q</em> expressing the strict implication of <em>q</em> by
<em>p</em> is equivalent to ~◊(<em>p</em> &amp; ~<em>q</em>), and
is true just in case it is not possible that <em>p</em> is true and
<em>q</em> is false. Strict implication is an intensional notion, and
the logic of strict implication is a form of modal logic. The system
of strict implication developed in SSL (Lewis 1918) was distinguished
from earlier modal logics by its axiomatic presentation in the light
of the work of Whitehead and Russell. However, Lewis faced a number of
criticisms, including one by Emil Post that one of Lewis' postulates
led to the result that it was indeed impossible that <em>p</em> just
in case it was false that <em>p</em>, so that Lewis' SSL system
reduced to an extensional one. Lewis (Lewis and Langford 1932)
eliminated these problems in SL and provided distinct systems of
strict implication or modal logic, S1–S5, each stronger than its
predecessor (with S3 the system of SSL). S1 contained the following
axioms:</p>

<ul>

<li>(<em>p</em> &amp; <em>q</em>)
<img src="fishhook.jpg" alt="strictly implies" />
(<em>q</em> &amp; <em>p</em>)</li>

<li>(<em>p</em> &amp; <em>q</em>)
<img src="fishhook.jpg" alt="strictly implies" />
<em>p</em></li>

<li><em>p</em>
<img src="fishhook.jpg" alt="strictly implies" />
(<em>p</em> &amp; <em>p</em>)</li>

<li>((<em>p</em> &amp; <em>q</em>) &amp; <em>r</em>)
<img src="fishhook.jpg" alt="strictly implies" />
(<em>p</em> &amp; (<em>q</em> &amp; <em>r</em>))</li>

<li>((<em>p</em>
<img src="fishhook.jpg" alt="strictly implies" />
<em>q</em>) &amp; (<em>q</em>
<img src="fishhook.jpg" alt="strictly implies" />
<em>r</em>))
<img src="fishhook.jpg" alt="strictly implies" />
(<em>p</em>
<img src="fishhook.jpg" alt="strictly implies" />
<em>r</em>)</li>

<li>(<em>p</em> &amp; (<em>p</em>
<img src="fishhook.jpg" alt="strictly implies" />
<em>q</em>))
<img src="fishhook.jpg" alt="strictly implies" />
<em>q</em> </li>
</ul>

<p>
S2 adds to S1 the consistency postulate</p>

<blockquote>
◊(<em>p</em> &amp; <em>q</em>)
<img src="fishhook.jpg" alt="strictly implies" />
◊<em>p</em>,
</blockquote>

<p>
which allows one to show that if <em>p</em>
<img src="fishhook.jpg" alt="strictly implies" />
<em>q</em> is a theorem, then so is ~◊~<em>p</em>
<img src="fishhook.jpg" alt="strictly implies" />
~◊~<em>q</em>, i.e., □<em>p</em>
<img src="fishhook.jpg" alt="strictly implies" />
□<em>q</em>, expressing the strict implication of the necessity
of <em>q</em> by the necessity of <em>p</em>. S3 adds to S1 the
postulate</p>

<blockquote>
(<em>p</em>
<img src="fishhook.jpg" alt="strictly implies" />
<em>q</em>)
<img src="fishhook.jpg" alt="strictly implies" />
(~◊<em>q</em>
<img src="fishhook.jpg" alt="strictly implies" />
~◊<em>p</em>)
</blockquote>

<p>
S4 adds to S1 the iterative axiom:</p>

<blockquote>
~◊~<em>p</em>
<img src="fishhook.jpg" alt="strictly implies" />
~◊~~◊~<em>p</em>, i.e.,
<br />
□<em>p</em>
<img src="fishhook.jpg" alt="strictly implies" />
□□<em>p</em>
</blockquote>

<p>
S5 adds to S1 the iterative axiom:</p>

<blockquote>
◊<em>p</em>
<img src="fishhook.jpg" alt="strictly implies" />
~◊~◊<em>p</em>, i.e.,
<br />
◊<em>p</em>
<img src="fishhook.jpg" alt="strictly implies" />
□◊<em>p</em>
</blockquote>

<p>
Critics objected that strict implication posed its own alleged
paradoxes. Within Lewis' systems S2–S5, a necessarily true
proposition is strictly implied by any proposition whatsoever, and a
necessarily false proposition strictly implies any proposition
whatsoever. However, Lewis (Lewis and Langford 1932) replied in SL
that these alleged paradoxes are simply the result of entirely natural
assumptions about valid deductive inference and entailment quite apart
from the systems of strict implication, and thus are not a problem for
the claim that strict implication provides an explication of
deducibility and entailment. (The presentation in this and the
previous two paragraphs owes much to the excellent account and
discussion of Lewis' systems of strict implication in Hughes and
Cresswell 1968, Chapters 12–13).)</p>

<p>
Lewis thought that there are an unlimited number of possible systems
of logic. One example is the extensional propositional calculus of
<em>Principia</em> according to which there are two truth values, true
and false; other examples are the various systems of many valued logic
that Lewis surveyed in SL, and, of course, Lewis' own various modal
systems S1–S5. Lewis thought that that each of these systems is
valid so long as it is internally consistent. The principles of the
various alternatives simply define the meaning of the logical concepts
and operators such as negation, truth/falsity, disjunction,
implication, and thus they are all true (Lewis 1932, in Lewis 1970,
401). Bivalent systems simply have a different notion of truth and
falsity from non-bivalent ones. Nonetheless, some systems may accord
better than others with notions of truth or implication or deduction
that are implicit in our everyday reasoning. Logics can thus be
assessed pragmatically by their sufficiency for the guidance and
testing of our usual deductions, systematic simplicity and
convenience, and accord with our psychological limitations and mental
habits. However, Lewis denied that he was claiming that principles of
logic could be true without being necessarily true, or necessarily
true without being necessarily necessary. A logic in which
□<em>p</em>
<img src="fishhook.jpg" alt="strictly implies" />
□□<em>p</em> holds simply operates with a different notion
of necessity from one in which it doesn't.</p>

<p>
Lewis (1946, Chps. 3, 6) distinguished several modes of meaning in
AKV. The <em>denotation</em> of a term is the class of actual things
to which the term applies and is distinct from the comprehension
— the class of possible or consistently thinkable things to
which it applies. The <em>signification</em> of a term is the property
the presence of which in a thing makes the term applicable, and the
<em>intension</em> or connotation of a term is what is applicable to
any possible thing to which the term is applicable. Intension can be
linguistic intension or meaning, in which case it is the conjunction
of terms applicable to any possible thing to which the term is
applicable and thus substitutable for the term <em>salva veritate</em>, but since definitions must have criteria of application and these
must ultimately be non-circular, the more basic dimension of intension
is <em>sense meaning</em>. Sense meaning is the criterion in mind in
terms of sense experience for classifying objects and applying a term,
a schema or rule that speakers have in mind whereby a term applies to
an actual or thinkable thing or signifies some property, and which
would exist even if there were no linguistic expression for it.</p>

<p>
Since linguistic intension is implicitly holistic and verbal
definition eventually circular, Lewis (1929, 107) said in MWO that
logical analysis isn't reduction to primitive terms, but is a matter
of relating terms to each other. Concepts consist in relational
structures of meaning. They require criteria of application in
experience and the total meaning of a term for an individual consists
of the concept it expresses and the sensory criteria for its
application. Yet, the latter needn't be identical across individuals
for there to be common concepts, Lewis argued (1929, 115). Instead,
common concepts just require shared structures of linguistic
definition and common or congruent modes of behaviour, in particular
co-operative behaviour that is guided by these concepts, a social
achievement of a common world that Lewis thought our community of
needs and interests produces. One problem with this suggestion was
pointed out by Quine (1960) in <em>Word and Object</em> with his
indeterminacy of translation argument. From the standpoint of an
interpreter, there can be alternative translation manuals or schemes
that are consistent with the total set of a speaker's verbal and other
behavioural dispositions. This is a problem that Lewis (1946,
144–5, 164) may have been aware of in AKV. In any case, in AKV
he seems to draw back from the discussion of common concepts in MWO
and to rest content with pointing out that any attribution of
linguistic meaning or sense meaning to another is inductive and thus
only probable, and any attribution of linguistic or sense meaning
similar to ours is likewise inductive, fallible, and problematic.</p>

<p>
Lewis (1946, 84–5, 93–5) drew a sharp distinction between
analytic and synthetic truth. Analytic (or analytically true)
statements are true by virtue of the definition of the terms they
contained, and have zero intension (and universal comprehension). They
are necessarily true, true in all possible worlds, no matter what else
might be true of a world or thing, and yet are not equivalent in
meaning to each other only due to the distinct intensions of their
constituents. In MWO Lewis occasionally claimed that we create
necessary truth by adopting concepts and criterial principles; in AKV
he was more circumspect. It is a matter of convention or legislation
that a term has the meaning it does, including sense meaning, but
Lewis (1946, 155–7) denied that analytic truth was truth by
convention. “A dog is an animal” is analytically true by
virtue of the sense meaning of “dog” and
“animal”, in particular, the inclusion of the criterion
for applying the latter in the criterion for applying the former, and
that isn't a matter of convention. However, Lewis never tried to
define such inclusion further. Quine (1953) explicitly criticized
Lewis and the analytic/synthetic distinction in “Two Dogmas of
Empiricism”, and would have objected to the idea of resting the
analytic/synthetic distinction on an undefined notion of meaning
inclusion. Lewis (1946, 154), on the other hand, thought that meaning
inclusion is as unproblematic and recognizable a fact as the inclusion
of one plan in another, e.g., a plan to visit France in a plan to
visit Paris, and didn't need further explication. Nonetheless, taking
meaning inclusion to be a primitive fact also makes it more difficult
to distinguish Lewis' analytic necessity from the rationalists’
synthetic necessity, despite his (Lewis 1946, 157) vigorous rejection
of the latter. This is especially so since Lewis (1946, 129) denied
that analytic truth is usefully elucidated as one that is reducible to
logical truth with the substitution of definitions. For Lewis, the
adequacy of a definition itself is a matter of analytic truth and what
makes a truth a logical truth is that it is an analytic truth
concerning certain symbols.</p>

<h2><a name="PriAna">4. The <em>A Priori</em> and the Analytic</a></h2>

<p>
Lewis (1946, 29–31) thought that necessary truths are knowable
<em>a priori</em>, independently of experience. In applying concepts
like those of red or apple to current experience, and so interpreting
experience, we form expectations and make predictions about future
experience, conditional on actions we might perform. Our beliefs
constitute empirical knowledge in so far as past experience gives us
good reason (largely inductive) for making these predictions. However,
we aren't making predictions about future experience simply in stating
what these concepts are, and what their definitions are, and what
defining criteria they provide for applying them to experience. Such
statements are explicative, not predictive, and so neither falsifiable
by failed prediction nor verifiable by successful prediction nor
justified by inductive evidence. The <em>a priori</em> is what we are
not required to abandon, no matter what experience may bring, and in
that sense, true no matter what, and in that sense necessary (Lewis
1929, 267.) However, <em>a priori</em> principles are neither
principles that are universal nor ones that we have to accept. The
acceptance of a set of concepts is a matter of decision or legislation
or the adoption of an intention to employ certain criteria in the
interpretation of experience, something for which there are
alternatives, but for which the criteria are not empirical but
pragmatic. </p>

<p>
In MWO, Lewis (1929, 254) also thought that the <em>a priori</em>
extended to fundamental laws of nature defining basic concepts like
mass or energy or simultaneity, and thus included some of what are
typically regarded as the basic principles of a scientific theory.
Further, besides criteria like convenience and conformity to human
bent, pragmatic considerations mentioned in MWO (Lewis 1929, 267)
include factors like intellectual simplicity, economy,
comprehensiveness, and thus the overall achievement of intellectual
order. However, unlike Wilfrid Sellars and many others in the latter
half of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, Lewis never recognized such
factors as criteria of empirical justification. The reason seems to be
that Lewis (1936b, reprinted in Lewis 1970, 286) didn't think that
these factors make a hypothesis any more probable, in contrast,
presumably, to conformity to standard criteria of induction:
“What such simplicity and convenience determine is not truth or
even probability but merely simplicity and convenience, which have
their reasonable place in the choice of working hypotheses when no
more decisive criterion is presently at hand”. At the same time,
he thought that the acceptance and rejection of scientific theories
wasn't entirely empirical. The choice of a system of concepts and <em>
a priori</em> explicative principles to apply to experience and
interpret it in the light of is determined by pragmatic
considerations, not truth or probability. The simpler set of
scientific concepts and explicative principles is no more true or
likely to be true than the simpler logic is more true or valid.
Moreover, pragmatic considerations might lead us in the face of
experience to abandon our scientific concepts and <em>a priori</em>
principles explicating them without making the latter empirically
unwarranted or any less <em>a priori</em> warranted.</p>

<p>
Empirical belief and <em>a priori</em> belief aren't logically
separated but intertwined for Lewis. The empirical belief that there
are no unicorns presupposes the concepts of negation and unicorn, and
thus more general <em>a priori</em> principles governing negation
and explicating the concept of unicorn, e.g. unicorns are horse like
creatures with a horn in their nose. Repeatedly failing to apply the
concept of unicorn successfully to experience may make it extremely
likely that there are no unicorns and eventually lead us to drop the
concept altogether from our conceptual repertoire as useless clutter,
along with beliefs explicating the concept, but it doesn't do so by
disconfirming or making any less likely the belief that if anything is
a unicorn, it is a horned horse-like creature. More important cases
Lewis discusses are ones where we discover that there are no Euclidean
figures in our space and cease employing Euclidean geometry to
interpret experience, or ones where cruder categories for interpreting
experience are replaced by more fine grained ones that carve up
experience in novel ways that are more valuable for our purposes, or
ones where inventions open up the bounds of experience and lead us to
abandon an old theory that can accommodate such experience but in a
less simple way than a novel one. Categories for Lewis don't really
change or alter but are given up and replaced, and old truths (as
opposed to falsehoods) are replaced by new ones, not contradicted by
them (Lewis 1929, 267-8). </p>

<p>
The most radical challenge to Lewis came from Quine (1953) who argued
that the distinction between so called <em>a priori</em> truths and
<em>a posteriori</em> truths is just one of degree. The argument has
two steps. First, empirical hypotheses have implications for
experience only in conjunction with various empirical generalizatons
and other background assumptions, e.g., about the circumstances of
perception. Recalcitrant experience thus tells us only that some
belief or assumption in the total set that implies a contrary
experience is false, not which one, and thus any statement can be held
true, no matter what experience brings, so long as we make enough
adjustments to the rest of our beliefs and assumptions. Second,
empirical hypotheses can't logically imply anything about experience
except against a background of assumed laws of logic. Recalcitrant
experience can, in principle, then, lead us to revise an assumed
logical principle in our web of belief rather one of our other
beliefs. </p>

<p>
With respect to the second stage, some philosophers might object that
logic is part of the framework within which beliefs have logical
implications and can't be part of the same system of belief itself.
However, Lewis himself might have trouble with this suggestion, since
he recognized the possibility of alternative logics, and presumably,
any decision, even pragmatic, about the adoption or rejection of a
logic must operate on some logical assumptions. In any case, Lewis
himself recognizes that in principle experience could lead us to
abandon logical beliefs and replace them with others. What he will
deny is that it does so by making these principles empirically
improbable, and thus any less <em>a priori</em> warranted. Arguably,
he may be assuming an excessively narrow view of what makes for
probability. With respect to the first stage, Lewis (1946) in AKV will
deny Quine's assumption that objective statements never entail
conditionals about experience without supposing other objective
statements true and his assumption that the antecedents of these
conditionals are never themselves certain, as we shall see in the next
two sections. Moreover, systems of objective hypotheses, despite their
various interconnections, aren't tested as a “block”, but
have separable and distinct probabilistic connections to others (but
not thereby to all) and to experience establishing differing
antecedent probabilities and degrees of confidence, in the light of
which the relevance of tests for the various hypotheses needs to be
assessed differentially. (Lewis, 1936b, reprinted in Lewis 1970,
285-6, Lewis 1946, 349-52). However, even so, there may be room for
alternative ways of modifying systems of hypotheses and their degrees
of credibility in the light of experience, and different responses to
probabilities that are unsettled and may change with future testing.
So, in an unpublished lecture Lewis (1936b, 282-7) says we are left
with pragmatic factors like economy, convenience, simplicity, or
making the least alteration to beliefs, at least for the time being,
to choose “working hypotheses” even if they don't count as
empirical knowledge. Lewis (1946) omits this discussion from AKV.
Nonetheless it highlights the need for Lewis to provide a positive
account of non-empirical, non-inductive <em>a priori</em> knowledge
of principles explicating our concepts and how we have it, not just a
negative account that simply contrasts it with empirical knowledge.
</p>

<p>
In MWO, he says the <em>a priori</em> is knowable by the reflective
and critical formulation of our own principles of classification, a
least with respect to meaning connections explicitly before the mind
(Lewis 1929, 287-8) and in AKV that <em>a priori</em> truths are
certifiable by reference to meanings alone (and their relations like
inclusion), and tested simply by what we can think or imagine being
so. (Lewis 1946, 35, 151-3) However, the only explanation he gives of
why this should warrant us in thinking anything necessary or possible
is that “as what we intend at the moment at least, a meaning
seems to be as open to direct examination as anything we are likely to
discover” (Lewis 1946, 145). It is this that warrants us as
dismissing any apparent Euclidean triangle the sum of whose angles
isn't 180 degrees as either a mismeasurement or not a Euclidean
triangle rather than a counterexample to Euclidean geometry. Barring
certainty, there seems to be a half-acknowledged, non-inductive, basic
principle of <em>a priori</em> credibility assumed here, to the
effect that if on reflection on our concepts and meanings and
classificatory intentions, we think A includes B, then we are at least
<em>prima facie</em> warranted in thinking so. In the next section,
we shall see that Lewis isn't in principle averse to non-inductively
supported principles of <em>prima facie</em> warrant. </p>

<h2><a name="EmpKno">5. Empirical Knowledge</a></h2>

<p>
In AKV, Lewis distinguished three classes of empirical statements.
First, there are <em>expressive</em> statements formulating what is
presently given in experience and about the truth of which we can be
certain (Lewis 1946, 171-71, 183, 204, 327). Second, there are
<em>terminating</em> judgements and statements formulating and
predicting what we would experience were we to be presented with some
sensory cue and perform some action. The form of terminating
judgements is: </p>

<blockquote>
If (or given) <em>S</em>, then if <em>A</em>, it would be the case
that <em>E</em>, i.e. ((<em>S</em> &amp; <em>A</em>) →
<em>E</em>), ( Lewis 1946, 184, 205)
</blockquote>

<p>
where <em>S</em>, <em>A</em>, and <em>E</em> all are formulated in
expressive language and concern particular presentable experiences
about which we can be certain, and “→” is neither
logical entailment nor material implication but what Lewis called
“real connection” that gives rise to subjunctive or
counterfactual conditionals. Real connections (an example of which are
causal connections) are inductively established correlations by virtue
of which one observable item may indicate another. Terminating
judgements, as expressing a general claim about repeatable mode of
action and a sequent experience, Lewis (1946, 219) claimed, are not
decisively verifiable but are decisively falsifiable. Third, there are
<em>non-terminating</em> or <em>objective</em> judgments that are
confirmable and disconfirmable by experience, thanks to their sense
meaning, but are neither decisively verifiable nor decisively
falsifiable. </p>

<p>
Objective judgements include not only perceptual judgements like
“There is a white piece of paper before me” in which we
conceptualize and interpret a given experience by relating it to other
possible experiences, but also a vast number of other beliefs about
the material world supported by our perceptual beliefs, e.g.,
statements about the future outcome of space explorations, or
generalizations like “All men have noses”, or non-analytic
statements about theoretical entities. Objective judgements don't
strictly imply terminating judgements of the form (<em>S</em> &amp;
<em>A</em>) → <em>E</em> (Lewis 1946, 219). Instead, the sense
meaning of objective judgments consists of an indefinitely large set
of general conditional probability judgements of the form “If it
were the case that <em>S</em> &amp; <em>A</em>, then, in all
likelihood, <em>E</em>” (Lewis, 1946, 237). Any objective
perceptual judgement <em>P</em> thus analytically entails and is
entailed by, an indefinitely large set of hypothetical or conditional
judgements of the form,</p>

<blockquote>
(<em>S</em> &amp; <em>A</em>) → (<em>h</em>)<em>E</em>,
<br />
where (<em>h</em>)<em>E</em> means that, in all probability <em>E</em>
(Lewis 237-53),
</blockquote>

<p>
None of these conditional judgements are decisively verifiable or
falsifiable by experience. (Lewis (1946, 247) calls the statements
that constitute the empirical content of objective statements
terminating judgements nonetheless). However, as expressing real
connections, they are nonetheless confirmable and disconfirmable by
experience, as are the objective judgements whose sense meaning they
constitute. </p>

<p>
For example, to use Lewis's examples, suppose <em>P</em> is “a
sheet of paper lies before me”. Then, its analytic entailments
might include, “If <em>S</em><sub>1</sub> (I were to seem to see
a sheet of paper before me) and <em>A</em><sub>1</sub> (I were to seem
to move my eyes), then, probably, <em>E</em><sub>1</sub> (I would seem
to see the sheet of paper displaced)”, as well as “If
<em>S</em><sub>2</sub> (I were to seem to feel paper with my fingers),
and <em>A</em><sub>2</sub> (I were to seem to pick it up and tear it),
then, probably, <em>E</em><sub>2</sub> (I would seem to see or feel
torn paper)”, and so on. On the other hand, suppose <em>P</em>
is “There is a doorknob before me”. Its truth might then
entail the truth of a complex set of conditionals like “If I
were to seem to see a doorknob, and were to seem to reach out towards
it and grasp it, then, probably, I would seem to feel something hard
and round”, etc.</p>

<p>
In MWO, Lewis says in one place not only that appearances are
physically conditioned by objects and the physical circumstances of
one's body and perception, which is certainly a reason for wanting to
know such physical facts, but that these conditions enter into the
basic understanding or meaning of material object statements:
“It is such conditions which are expressed in the
‘if’ clause of those ‘If … then
…’ propositions in which the predictions implicit in an
interpretation may be made explicit” (Lewis 1929, 286). However,
in AKV he explicitly rejects this position: “Thus those
conditions which are directly pertinent to a confirmation and
genuinely ascertainable are not objective facts but must be included
amongst the given appearances. They must be items of direct
presentation; and we might think of them as already covered by
‘<i>S</i>’ in our paradigm: <i>S</i> being given,
if <i>A</i> then, with probability <i>M</i>, <i>E</i>” (Lewis
1946, 246). The result is that <em>S</em> in Lewis' paradigm strictly
speaking won't just include the visual presentation of a doorknob, for
example, but the appearance of daylight or the feeling of being clear
headed as part of the whole presentation. Arguably, that, together
with the probability qualifier, allows him to avoid Quine's worries
about circumstances of perception and the testable implications of
empirical beliefs (Lewis 1946, 242-6). However, it also means that
<em>S</em> will enter into the evidence for a great many objective
beliefs (Lewis 1946, 246) that won't, therefore, be entirely
probabilistically independent.</p>

<p>
No number of successful or failed tests will render the objective
judgement true or false with theoretical certainty. However, Lewis
thought the principle of inverse probabilities meant that the
judgement can be highly probable with a few positive confirmations,
even practically certain, in so far the probability of <em>P</em> when
<em>S</em> and <em>A</em> and <em>E</em> obtain may approach certainty
as the improbability of <em>E</em> approaches certainty when
<em>S</em> and <em>A</em> and not <em>P</em> obtain. The principle
also explains why further tests may increase our warranted assurance
in the judgement even more, though not as dramatically as earlier
tests increased our warrant (Lewis 1946, 190-92). Since confirming and
gaining assurance that <em>P</em> gives us assurance in all the
predictions that <em>P</em> entails about future experience (Lewis
1946, 239), the principle of inverse probabilities may explain how we
can act on these predictions with increasing confidence. Even though
experience of instances of <em>S</em> and <em>A</em> and <em>E
</em> can confirm and increase the probability of one sensory
conditional entailed by <em>P</em> independent of experiential
confirmation of the other sensory conditionals entailed by <em>P
</em>, experiential confirmation of one conditional increases the
probability of the others, and <em>vice versa</em> (Lewis 1946, 348,
footnote 6). </p>

<p>
Our empirical knowledge of objects and objective events and
properties, the generalizations they support concerning patterns of
objective events and properties, and the use we make of all this for
further inductions, has a complex “many-storied
character”. Nonetheless, the “whole edifice still rests at
bottom on these primitive generalizations which we make in terms of
direct experience” (Lewis 1946, 261). (Lewis (1929, 332; 1946,
361) contrasted these primitive generalizations that underlie our
objective beliefs with what he says we normally call empirical
generalizations that concern patterns of objective events and may
formulate natural laws supporting causal explanations.) However, the
empirical justification for these primitive generalizations and
ultimately for our objective beliefs can't rest on current sense
experience alone and requires evidence concerning the past. At the
same time, what is given to us isn't the past itself about which we
can never be certain, but just current sense presentation and current
recollection or sense of past experience. </p>

<p>
Lewis appreciated the problem memory posed for his epistemology much
more clearly in AKV than in MWO. In AKV, Lewis (1946, 334) argued that
whatever we ostensibly remember, whether as explicit recollection or
merely in our sense of the past, is <em>prima facie</em> credible just
because so remembered. So there are data of sense presentation and
also data of “seeming to remember” or “present
memory” (Lewis 1946, 353,354) that constitute our ultimate
evidence, and it is only through the latter and the principle of
memorial <em>prima facie</em> credibility that empirical
generalizations and the beliefs they support can be inductively
supported by premises about past experience as well as about directly
apprehended present experience. Further the credibility of our
recollections, together with the whole range of empirical beliefs more
or less dependent on them, can be solidified and increased through the
mutual support or congruence of the whole, or can be diminished
through incongruence. </p>

<p>
A set of beliefs is <em>congruent</em> for Lewis (1946, 338) when the
antecedent probability of each is increased by the assumption of the
truth of the rest. A physical object statement <em>P</em> and the
set of sensory conditionals that constitute its content form a
congruent set, as we have seen. Indeed, by virtue of exhausting the
empirical content of <em>P</em>, Lewis (1946, 348-9, footnote 6)
thinks the sensory conditionals constitute a congruent set by
themselves. In any case, the degree of warrant for the various
elements of a mature system of empirical belief, especially one that
counts as <em>knowledge</em> , depends on the inferential support
the elements provide each other and the total empirical and memorial
data present. However, there will be particular linkages of <em>a
priori</em> probability relationships that would confer some degree
of initial probability not just on what we recall but on simple
generalizations from past experience and the expectations of future
experiences and thus interpretations of experience these recollections
inductively support, even in the hypothetical absence of (other)
objective beliefs with which they are congruent or incongruent.
Moreover, the recollections that support them and form part of an
overall congruent system must have some degree of credibility
independent of each other and the rest. The improbability of
independently probable congruent recollections all being true were the
beliefs they inferentially support and that inferentially support them
not true makes it unlikely they are illusions of memory and increases
the antecedent probability of the recollections and what they support
(Lewis 1946, 352-3). Spelling out the antecedent and independent
probability constraints is tricky. </p>

<p>
The principle of the <em>prima facie</em> credibility of mnemic
presentation of past experience can't itself be justified inductively
for Lewis, on pain of circularity. Nor did he think it is simply a
postulate — something we have to assume for empirical knowledge
to be possible. Instead, he argued that it is constitutive of the
lived world of experience and something for which there is no
meaningful alternative. Sceptical alternatives designed to undermine
the principle are ones that are inaccessible to knowledge and thus
ones for which there is no criterion in experience. So it is an
“analytic statement” that the past is knowable, and a
similar claim was made for the relevance of past experience to the
future, and thus for the knowability of empirical reality. The
philosophical problem for Lewis (1946, 360-2) is to formulate
correctly the criteria that “delimit empirical reality and
explicate our sense of it”. </p>

<p>
In MWO, he defended induction in more detail by arguing that not every
prediction is compatible with an evidence base, and that successive
revision of one's predictions in the light of new experience can't
help but make for more successful predictions (Lewis 1929, 367, 386).
Nelson Goodman's well known “grue” example (Goodman 1955)
poses problems for the relevance of the first claim and the force of
the second. At other times, Lewis simply followed Hans Reichenbach in
claiming that we can be assured only that if any procedures will
achieve success in prediction, inductive ones will, without clearly
distinguishing that claim from any attempt at an analytic
justification of induction.</p>

<p>
Rationally credible or warranted or justified belief, Lewis thought,
is probable on the evidence, but the presentation of his views on
probability was underdeveloped in MWO, and complex, and sometimes
confusing in AKV. In AKV, Lewis defended an <em>a priori</em> account
of probability or what he sometimes called “expectation”.
However, he rejected the Principle of Indifference often associated
with <em>a priori</em> accounts, understood as the principle that in
the absence of any reason for thinking one <em>a priori</em>
possibility more likely than another, they are equiprobable (Lewis
1946, 306-314). The expectation or probability <em>a</em>/<em>b</em>
of a proposition <em>P</em> is always relative to some set of
empirical data or premises <em>D</em>. The expectation corresponds to
an <em>a priori</em> valid estimate of the frequency of some property
mentioned in <em>P</em> in some reference class mentioned in
<em>P</em> , which estimate is derived from data or premises <em>D
</em>, given the <em>a priori</em> valid principles of probabilistic
inference, including the principles of induction. Hypothetical or
conditional probability statements that are <em>a priori</em> valid
license valid probabilistic inferences from premises about evidence or
data to probabilistic conclusions. However, for Lewis, both
hypothetical and categorical probability are always relativized to an
evidence base, despite his occasional apparent talk of <em>a
priori</em> valid probability statements as licensing inferences from empirical evidence to a
(detachable) conclusion “Probably, P”.</p>

<p>
Lewis rejected the view that probabilities are empirically based
estimates of the limiting value of the frequency of instances of a
property in a population, and thus expressed in non-terminating
judgments. First, he thought that any attempt to define probabilities
as the ratio of instances of one property among instances of another
property as the latter approaches infinity would make probability
judgments empirically untestable. Second, he argued that, if
probability judgements were empirical frequency claims, then the
probability judgements would themselves only be probable, something
that can't be coherently accounted for. Nonetheless, Lewis recognized
the need to assure ourselves rationally that the frequency as validly
estimated from the data is closely in accord with the actual frequency
and that there is nothing in the case at hand affecting the occurrence
of the property which isn't taken into account in the specification of
the reference class. Lewis dubbed this the “ reliability”
of the determination of probability or expectation. He thought that
reliability is a function of the adequacy of data (e.g., size of
sample), the uniformity with which the frequency of some property in
the data as a whole also holds for subsets of the data, and the
proximateness or degree of resemblance between the data and the case
at hand in P, all of which he also thought are logical relations.</p>

<p>
So, in AKV, Lewis (1946, 305) claimed that the full statement of a
probability judgement should be of the form “That <em>c</em>,
having property <em>F</em>, will also have property <em>G</em>, is
credible on data <em>D</em>, with expectation <em>a</em>/<em>b</em>
and reliability <em>R</em>”, and is assertable in whatever sense
<em>D</em> is. The judgement is valid when, in accordance with the
<em>a priori</em> rules of probability and the correct rules of
judging reliability, <em>D</em> gives the estimate
<em>a</em>/<em>b</em> of the frequency of <em>F</em>s among
<em>G</em>s, and <em>D</em>'s adequacy, uniformity, and proximateness
to the case in point, yields reliability <em>R</em>. A valid
probability judgement is true when <em>D</em> is true, and is a
categorical rather than hypothetical judgement when <em>D</em> is
categorically asserted as true. Nonetheless, the assertion of the
empirical data <em>D</em> is the only empirical element in the
probability judgement, which otherwise has no testable implications
for experience. However, the belief <em>P</em>, that <em>c</em>
which has <em>F</em> is also <em>G</em>, is an empirical belief that
may be <em>rationally credible,</em> empirically justified and
warranted, in so far as <em>D</em> is given and the degree of
assurance or belief corresponds to an <em>a priori</em> degree of
probability (expectation) of <em>P</em> on <em>D</em> that is
sufficiently reliable. Further, acceptance of <em>P</em> counts as
empirical <em>knowledge</em> in so far as, firstly, <em>P</em> is
true, secondly, the degree of probability or expectation of <em>P</em>
on <em>D</em> is sufficiently high as to approach practical certainty,
and, thirdly, <em>D</em> consists of all relevant data (Lewis, 1946,
314–15).</p>

<p>
It is important to distinguish counterfactual statements of the form
(<em>S</em> &amp; <em>A</em>) → (<em>h</em>)<em>E</em> from <em>a
priori</em> probability statements of the form “ Prob
(<em>E</em>, on <em>S</em> and <em>A</em>) &gt; .5”. Both
express conditional probabilities. However, the former express
‘real’ connections knowable by induction from past
experience. They constitute the analytically entailed consequences of
an objective material objective statement <em>P</em>, but can't
themselves be analytic truths. The latter, on the other hand, if true,
are analytically true, knowable <em>a priori</em>, with zero
intension, and entailed by any statement whatsoever, and so can hardly
constitute the empirical meaning of contingently true material object
statements. Yet, apart from denying that “→” can be
understood either as material implication or strict implication, Lewis
had little to say in print about what the truth conditions of
subjunctive or counterfactual conditionals are. (Murphey (2005, 332)
quotes correspondence from Lewis complaining that Goodman and Chisholm
in their writings miss the obvious interpretation of “If
<em>A</em> were the case, then <em>B</em> would be the case”,
namely that <em>A</em> plus other premises of the (actual or
hypothetical) case inductively justify the conclusion <em>B</em>. The
problem is to interpret the remark so as to avoid turning
counterfactuals into analytic truths.) Nonetheless, Lewis emphasized
their importance, and the importance of the real connections they
express, for the possibility of realism about the material world and
the rejection of any sort of idealism or view that physical objects
are simply mind-dependent collections of experiences (Lewis 1955, in
Lewis 1970). The sensory conditionals (<em>S</em> &amp; <em>A</em>)
→ <em>E</em> and (<em>S</em> &amp; <em>A</em>) →
(<em>h</em>)<em>E</em> can be true, as can the material object
statement <em>P</em> that entails them, quite apart from the truth of
the expressive statements <em>S</em> and <em>A</em>, or indeed, the
presence of any empirical data warranting their assertion.</p>

<p>
Chisholm (1948) raised the most important challenge to Lewis’
claim that a physical object statement <em>P</em> can entail a set of
counterfactual statements expressing claims about what experiences one
would have were one to (seem to) carry out certain tests upon being
presented with certain sensory cues. If <em>P</em> entails <em>T</em>,
then for any <em>Q</em> consistent with <em>P</em>, <em>P</em> and
<em>Q</em> also entail <em>T</em>. However, Chisholm argued, for any
material object statement <em>P</em> and for any sensory conditional
(<em>S</em> &amp; <em>A</em>) → (<em>h</em>)<em>E</em>, there
will be some other material object statement <em>M</em> about the
circumstances of perception that is consistent with <em>P</em>, such
that <em>P</em> and <em>M</em> can both be true while (<em>S</em>
&amp; <em>A</em>) → (<em>h</em>)<em>E</em> is false. For example,
suppose <em>P</em> is “There is a doorknob before one” and
(<em>S</em> &amp; <em>A</em>) → (<em>h</em>)<em>E</em> is
“If one were to seem to see a doorknob and have the experience
of reaching out with one’s hand, then, in all likelihood, one
would seem to feel something hard and round”, and <em>M</em> is
“One's fingertips have been permanently
anaesthetized”. (Expanding the understanding of <em>S</em> to
include sensory correlates of circumstances of perception, as Lewis
(1946, 245-6) suggests, presumably just requires expanding the
understanding of <em>M</em> with a little imagination.) A material
object statement like <em>P</em>, therefore, doesn't entail sensory
conditionals like (<em>S</em> &amp; <em>A</em>) →
(<em>h</em>)<em>E</em> . Instead of Lewis' empiricism about the
meaning and justification of material object statements, Chisholm
proposed that our spontaneous perceptual beliefs about the world,
e.g., that one is seeing a doorknob, are <em>prima facie</em>
justified just by virtue of being such spontaneous perceptual beliefs,
quite apart from any inductive justification from present and past
experience that might be reconstructed. Lewis' own defence of the
<em>prima facie</em> credibility of memory, Chisholm thought, prepared
the way for his alternative. Quine (1969), on the other hand, thought
that Chisholm's problem just shows that what have consequences for
experience and are tested by experience are never individual material
object statements in isolation from each other but only sets of them
or theories. Quine saved empiricism by drawing a holistic moral from
the sort of problem Chisholm posed. </p>

<p>
In a rare reply to critics, Lewis (1948) responded that Chisholm had
misunderstood the implication of the probability qualifier. The
familiar rule “If <em>P</em> entails <em>T</em>, then for any
<em>Q</em>, <em>P</em> and <em>Q</em> entail <em>T</em>” doesn't
apply when <em>T</em> is any kind of probability statement. <em>E</em>
being improbable on <em>P</em> and <em>M</em> and <em>S</em> and
<em>A</em> is perfectly consistent with <em>E</em> being probable on
<em>P</em> and <em>S</em> and <em>A</em>, and so presumably doesn't
undermine the claim that (<em>S</em> &amp; <em>A</em>) →
(<em>h</em>)<em>E</em>. However, this leaves the character of Lewis'
empiricism puzzling. If the relative probability statements in
question are the subjunctive conditionals, “(<em>P</em> and
<em>S</em> and <em>A</em>) →(<em>h</em>)<em>E</em>” and
“it is false that ((<em>P</em> and <em>S</em> and <em>A</em> and
<em>M</em>) → (<em>h</em>)<em>E</em>)”, then the statements
in question are empirical propositions justified by induction. The
justification for them thus will presuppose prior knowledge of the
truth of material object statements like <em>P</em> and <em>M</em>,
perhaps in the way Chisholm suggests, rather than explain how we can
know such propositions solely on the basis of present and past
experience of the given. On the other hand, if the relative
probability statements are supposed to be <em>a priori</em> analytic
statements, then it is the total set of such statements that
constitutes the empirical meaning of <em>P</em>, statements like
“Prob (<em>E</em>, given <em>P</em> and <em>S</em> and
<em>A</em> and <em>M</em>) &lt; .5” as much as “Prob
(<em>E</em>, given <em>P</em> and <em>S</em> and <em>A</em>) &gt;
.5”. Even when the relativization to other background material
object statements isn't explicit, the probability statement would seem
to be implicitly relative to some background assumption of material
normality. In other words, Lewis would have to abandon his
reductionism and agree with Quine's holistic conclusion that
individual material object statements like <em>P</em> have “no
fund of experiential implications to call their own” (Quine
1969, 79).</p>

<p>
As noted earlier, Lewis (1929, 286) and Lewis (1936b) flirts with
Quine's alternative. However, in AKV and in his reply to Chisholm,
Lewis clearly repudiates it: if Chisholm were right that “no
statement of objective fact had consequences for direct experience
without further premises specifying objective conditions of
perception”, then, Lewis says, “the type of empiricism of
which my account is one variant—verification-theories and
confirmation-theories—will be altogether indefensible” (Lewis
1948, reprinted in Lewis 1970, 318). The result, he adds, would be a
fatally flawed “coherence theory of empirical truth” that
leaves us with “nothing..but skepticism”. </p>

<h2><a name="Giv">6. The Given</a></h2>

<p>
Lewis' views about the given are at once among his best known and
among his most criticized. The pre-analytic data for philosophical
reflection is our “thick” experience and knowledge of the
world around us, but reflection on this experience and knowledge
reveals two elements: the given or immediate data of experience and
the activity of thought whereby we conceptually interpret the given.
The given in sense experience consists of specific sensuous qualities
that we are immediately aware of when, for example, we take ourselves
to be seeing or hearing or tasting or smelling or touching something,
or even to be hallucinating or dreaming instead. These distinct
qualities or <em>qualia</em> (singular <em>quale</em>) are the
repeatable felt characters of experience, and include the felt
goodness or felt badness of particular experiences or stretches of
experience, as well as qualities of sight, sound, taste, smell, touch,
motion, and other familiar modes of experience. On the other hand, the
repeatability of these qualities, or the similarity of current
instances to past instances, isn't something that is given to us. When
we conceptually interpret the given, we form hypothetical expectations
and make predictions, in the light of past experience, concerning
experiences we would have were we to engage in specific actions, and
so, in applying concepts, as Kant suggests, we relate our experiences
to each other. However, usually, we do so automatically and without
conscious reflection, in ways that express habitual attitudes and
associations rather than engaging in (explicit) inference. The given,
unlike our conceptual interpretation of it, isn't alterable by our
will. It consists of what remains when we subtract from ordinary
perceptual cognition all that could conceivably be mistaken (Lewis
(1946), 182–3). Our apprehension of the given isn't, therefore,
subject to any error and isn't subject to correction or verification
or disconfirmation from further experience, and isn't, as a result, to
be classified as knowledge. Any comparative classification of
experience in terms of similarities and differences with other
experiences, on the other hand, relates experiences to each other and
and isn't certain. What we recall of past experience, even
immediately, isn't given to us or certain, but, as he makes clear in
AKV, our immediate recollection or sense of past experience as having
been so and so is. </p>

<p>
In MWO Lewis (1929, 401) says the given in experience never occurs in
the absence of interpretation and characterizes the
distinction as an “abstraction” of elements that are
synthesized in our judgment, but which we may realize are common to
quite different conceptualizations such as those of the adult and the
child (Lewis 1929, 49-50). AKV is more circumspect. Although the given
is what we are immediately aware of or directly apprehend as it guides
and corrects our interpretations, it isn't something we focus on or
attend to or are “clearly conscious”of in our automatic
interpretations (Lewis 1946, 153) any more than in riding a bicycle we
attend to or focus on the various sensory and motion and balance
sensations that are elements in and guide our activity, though we
could on reflection and perhaps did in learning (Lewis 1946, 10). In
perceptual cognition, what is given in sense experience serves as a
natural sign of future experience contingent on action in the light of
past experience, and prompts the anticipation of such experience. What
is given is of no interest to active beings apart from what it
signifies for future experience and anticipations it prompts for
action. (Lewis 1946, 10). </p>

<p>
Nonetheless, he says “the <em>validity</em> of this
interpretation is that and that only which could attach to it as an
inductive inference from the given visual presentation...the
incorrigible presentational element” (Lewis 1952a, reprinted in
Lewis 1970, 326). What matters for the credibility or warrant or
validity of the belief is that there is a logical, inferential
relation between the belief and grounds in experience that prompt it
in the light of past experience and that can be elicited on critical
reflection and the character of the relation made clear enough for our
theoretical purposes. However, the credibility or validity of the
belief isn't created by the reflective attempt to elicit sufficient
grounds (Lewis 1946, 186, 189, 262, 329-32) The given, thus, plays
both a causal role as the ultimate or remote ground responsible for
belief and an epistemic role as the ultimate justifying grounds of
empirical belief. (Lewis 1946, 262, 328-30). </p>

<p>
Probability, for Lewis, concerns a logical relation between a
conclusion and premises, and a statement is categorically assertable
with a degree of probability or credibility, or a belief warranted or
credible to that degree, as opposed to being merely hypothetically
probable <em>a priori</em> to that degree on premises, only to the
extent that the premises or data are sufficiently credible or
warranted or probable. (Lewis 1946, 315-27). Ultimately, the
conclusion must be warranted or credible or probable on premises or
data that are certain, not just true, and not just warranted or
credible only on other premises or data, though we may never reach
them ordinarily in showing probability or justification. Otherwise we
have “an indefinite regress of the merely probable...and the
probability will fail to be genuine” (Lewis 1946, 186). Here he
echoes MWO where he says that the validity of a probability judgement
is a relation between the judgement and “ultimate
premises” that (a) “may verbally be quite remote”,
unlike the “immediate premises” we might initially and
normally cite, that (b) must be a “certainty” rather than
merely probable on yet further premises, and that (c) must be
“actual given data for the individual” (Lewis 1929,
328-9). Lewis is defending a normative standard for empirical
knowledge that he thinks is implicit in cognition and revealed on
reflection but which is also psychologically and verbally remote from
everyday cognitive practices of justifying beliefs to ourselves or
others in the light of more proximate assumptions taken for granted in
he context of inquiry or discussion. Some pragmatists might feel there
is tension here. </p>

<p>
In MWO he also famously says that the given is “ineffable”
(Lewis 1929, 53). So how can what is ineffable even be true, and how can
what is neither true nor false, nor as a result, neither probably true
nor probably false, serve as the ultimate premises of <em>a priori
</em> valid logical probability relations licensing belief or
assertion with probability or credibility? And how can we anticipate
or predict future experience that isn't yet given, except in
conceptual or comparative terms that won't allow for decisive
falsification? Again, there may seem to be tension in Lewis' views of
the given and the epistemic role he assigns it. Lewis (1936a and
1936b, reprinted in Lewis 1970, 155-7, 292-3) clearly recognizes the
logical and epistemological problems, and he responds by introducing
categories of expressive statements and the expressive use of
language. This carries over into AKV. Expressive statements like
“It seems as though I am seeing a red round thing” serve
to convey or express or <em>denote</em> what we directly apprehend
in experience without conceptualizing and interpreting it. They are
true by virtue of the qualitative character of experience they express
and are verified by it, and false only when we knowingly lie about our
experience, and the ineffability of what they express just consists in
their not implying possibilities of further experience. Moreover,
their truth is something that we know, or, as he more carefully and
repeatedly says in AKV, something about which we are certain (Lewis
1946, 171-2, 183, 204, 327). The expressive use of language is to
convey or express what is not only directly apprehended but what may
be directly apprehensible in the future or, perhaps, was directly
apprehensible in the past. (Lewis 1946, 179). Nonetheless, Lewis notes
that the expressive use of language is needed only for the discussion
of knowledge, not for knowledge itself (Lewis 1946, 183; 1952a,
reprinted in Lewis 1970, 327). So perhaps it isn't surprising that
later he also talks of “immediately given facts of sense”
and “facts of our seeming to remember” (Lewis 1946, 327,
353) and “datum facts” and “logical relations of
facts” (Lewis 1952a, reprinted in Lewis 1970, 325). </p>

<p>
Sellars (1963, 132) thought the classical empiricist given was an
inconsistent triad of three claims: (1) being appeared to as if there
were something red entails non-inferentially knowing that one is
appeared redly to, (2) the ability to be appeared to is unacquired,
and (3) the ability to know facts of the form x is F is acquired.
Lewis clearly denied (1), but he recognized this was the result of a
choice about how to use “know” and that others,
“without fault”, might, choose to extend it to direct
apprehensions of sense because they are certain for us (Lewis 1946,
183). However, if Lewis followed suit and granted (1), it seems he
would deny (3) on the grounds that the ability to be certain of the
given wasn't acquired. Sellars might question whether such certainty,
or the expressive language in which it was couched, was sufficiently
rich in content to support other knowledge inferentially. In any case,
Lewis' defense of the certainty of the given rests on two claims.
First, it is just an undeniable fact, apparent to anyone who reflects
on experience, that there is a sensuous character of experience that
we are aware of and can't be mistaken about and that, until it fades
to memory, isn't subject to correction and isn't further confirmable.
As Lewis (1952a, reprinted in Lewis 1970, 329) put it in his symposium
on the given with Reichenbach (1952) and Goodman (1952), there is no
requirement of “inductive consistency” on protocols or
expressive statments. Second, the supposition that probability is
always relative to something else that is itself only probable means
that probabilities can never get off the ground. As Lewis famously
says, “if anything is to be probable, something must be
certain” (Lewis 1946, 186). Goodman (1952), in his symposium
contribution, argued that the premises relative to which other
statements are credible or probable just have to be initially credible
on their own to some degree, not certain, though subject to future
confirmation or disconfirmation in the light of further experience. So
long as they were initially credible on their own rather than because
something else was initially credible, Lewis' regress failed. This is
a view that attracted many epistemologists after Lewis in some form or
other. </p>

<p>
Lewis' response is instructive for his understanding of epistemology.
For Lewis (1952a, reprinted in Lewis 1970, 330), a principal task of
epistemology is with the “validity” of knowledge, that is
to say with the justification or warrant for cognition that
distinguishes empirically warranted belief from lucky or unlucky guess
or hazard of belief. If a class of beliefs in principle may be false,
we need some reason or grounds for thinking its members true or likely
to be true, especially if we plan to base other beliefs on them. That
requires present or past justifying grounds of belief, not just future
potential for verification or confirmation as he thinks Goodman
proposes. Otherwise, we confuse justification with verification, or
ignore the former for the latter. Nor can the grounds consist solely
in other beliefs that might be mistaken without grounds for thinking
them true or likely to be true, or in beliefs that stand in
conditional probabilistic relations to each other, as he thinks
Reichenbach proposes, without any antecedent probabilities deriving
from something else (Lewis 1952a, reprinted in Lewis 1970, 328). Lewis
acknowledges that his (somewhat traditional) concerns with validation
or justification, skepticism, and the need for given justifying
grounds, leads him to depart from or supplement traditional pragmatic
theories. </p>

<p>
Finally, we can't directly verify the existence of other subjects of
experience or what is given to them in their experience. Nonetheless,
Lewis (1934, 1941b) claimed that by empathy, in terms of our own
conscious experience, we can imagine or envisage the conscious
experience of others, rather than simply our own experience of others
and their bodies and our interactions with them. Moreover, the
supposition of another consciousness like ours, with a body like ours,
can be indirectly confirmed and supported by induction. However, Lewis
provided no details concerning this inductive support for our belief
in other minds. </p>

<h2><a name="ActGooRig">7. Action, the Good, and the Right</a></h2>

<p>
In contrast with those logical positivists who thought that statements
of value merely express attitudes, <em>pro</em> or <em>con</em>, to
objects, persons, or situations, but are neither true nor false, Lewis
(1946, 396–98) thought that statements of value were as true or
false as other empirical statements, and every bit as empirically
verifiable or falsifiable, confirmable or disconfirmable. True, felt
value <em>qualia</em>, felt goodness and badness, are given to us and
directly apprehended in experience or stretches of experience, and
“expressive” statements must be used to indicate or convey
them. However, such statements, like Lewis’ other
“expressive” statements, may be true or false (see
previous section), and simply convey the occurrence of given
<em>qualia</em> in experience and no more, instead of indicating the
existence of objects, situations, or persons, and expressing our
attitudes to them. Moreover, there are also for Lewis terminating
judgments of value concerning what the felt value of some experiences
indicates about the felt value of further experiences. Finally, there
are “objective” judgements of value: judgements
attributing value to persons, objects, and objective situations, in so
far as they have the potential, depending on circumstances, to produce
felt goodness or badness in us or others. These are non-terminating
judgements of value and are empirically confirmable or disconfirmable
by induction just like any other objective empirical judgement. Lewis
thus claims that his theory of value is thoroughly naturalistic and
humanistic, rather than transcendental, but still objectivist. </p>

<p>
The felt goodness of experience is what is intrinsically good or
valuable for its own sake. It is only experience in so far as it has
such value quality that is intrinsically good rather than merely
extrinsically valuable for its contribution to something else that is
intrinsically valuable. Value and disvalue are modes or aspects of
experience to which desire and aversion are “addressed”
(Lewis 1946, 403). Lewis denies that “pleasure” is
adequate to the wide variety of what is found directly good in
experience, and thus thinks it inadequate as a synonym for
“good”. However, as Frankena (1964) argues, for Lewis
directly found goodness still seems to be as natural a quality or
property of certain experiences as any other <em>qualia</em> directly
apprehended in experience. Nonetheless, the value of a stretch of
experience, indeed a whole life, isn't just the value (and disvalue)
of the parts, and in AKV, Lewis criticized Bentham’s attempt at
a calculus of values. For Lewis, the intrinsic value found in the
experience of a symphony isn't just the sum of the intrinsic value of
the movements taken individually, but reflects the character of the
symphony as a temporal <em>Gestalt</em>. What is <em>ultimately
good</em> for Lewis is the quality of a life found good in the living
of it. (Lewis 1952b in Lewis 1970, 179) The constituent experiences
thus might have value for their own sake, but also value for their
contribution to the value of the whole life of which they are
parts.</p>

<p>
However, Lewis thought that judgements about how a valued experience
contributes to the value of a life as a whole, unlike some terminating
judgements about how one valued experience will yield another valued
experience, are not decisively verifiable or falsifiable. First, any
attempt to apprehend a life as a whole and the value of it as
experienced goes beyond the specious present of experience and relies
on memory and expectation of past and future experience and their
values, and thereby leaves room for error. Second, any attempt to
simplify the problem by breaking a whole life into parts and
apprehending their value, and then calculating the probability of
their contributing to a good life as a whole, also leaves room for
error.</p>

<p>
The value of an object consists in its potentiality for conducing to
intrinsically valuable experiences, and is thus a real connection
between objects, persons, and the character of experience, which we
can be empirically warranted in accepting on the basis of the
empirical evidence and the probability on the evidence of such objects
yielding such intrinsically valuable experiences. For Lewis (1946,
432), therefore, no object has intrinsic value. Nonetheless, objects
can have <em>inherent</em> value in so far as the good which they
produce is disclosable in the presence or observation of the object
itself rather than some other object. Lewis (1946, Ch. 14) contrasted
aesthetic value with cognitive and moral value, not by virtue of
distinctive characters of their felt goods, but chiefly by distinctive
attitudes to experience. The aesthetic attitude is one of
disinterested interest in the presented, attentiveness to the given in
its own right, as opposed to the cognitive attitude's concern with
prediction and significance for future experience, and the concern on
the part of the attitude of action or morality with the pursuit of
absent but attainable goods. Thanks to these differences, aesthetic
values in experience tend to be of high degree and long lasting and
don't require exclusive possession, and aesthetic values in objects
are inherent ones.</p>

<p>
Lewis recognized that potentialities are in various ways relative to
particular circumstances and manners of observation. There is thus a
plurality of judgements of the value of objects, of the various ways
in which they can contribute and fail to contribute to intrinsically
valuable experiences, and an apparent contradictory nature to
incomplete verbal statements of them (e.g., “<em>X</em> is
good”, “<em>X</em> isn't good”). For Lewis (1946,
528), issues about the relativity or subjectivity of judgements of the
value of objects aren't issues about the empirical truth of
attributions of value to objects, but just issues about whether the
conditions under which an object produces directly apprehended value
are peculiar to the nature and capacities of a particular person and
thus not indicative of the possibility of similar value finding on the
part of other persons. Quine (1981) argued that variation within and
among individuals and societies, and the variable and open ended
character of what they find valuable, means that predicates like
“pleases” or “ feels good” don't support
inductive inferences from case to case in the way that
“green” or “conducts electricity” do.
Skepticism concerning the prospects for empirical content and
empirical truth of attributions of value to objects is thus in order.
Lewis (1946, 323), on the other hand, seems to have thought that this
contention implies that no one could ever act with empirical warrant
to improve his own lot in life or do any others good, an absurdity in
his view. Lewis argued at length for the possibility of empirically
warranted judgements of the social or impersonal value of objects. The
key is that “value to more than one person is to be assessed as
if their several experiences were to be included in that of a single
person” (Lewis (1946, 550). Rawls (1971, 188–90)
criticized Lewis for mistaking impersonality for impartiality, and
denied the relevance of Lewis' account of impersonal value for
questions of justice, at least, for which impartiality is key. </p>

<p>
An action, for Lewis (1955, 49), is subjectively right, and one we are
not to be blamed for doing, if we think it objectively right. An
action is objectively right if it is correctly judged on the evidence
that its consequences are such as it will be right to bring about.
That requires that their pursuit violates no <em>categorical</em>
rational imperative or principle.</p>

<p>
Lewis (1952b, 1952c, 1955, Chapter 5) outlines categorical rational
imperatives of doing and thinking, or versions of one rational
imperative, in various ways, formulations, and detail. The general
idea is laid out briefly in AKV (Lewis (1946, 480–82). To be
subject to imperatives is to find a constraint of action or thought in
what is not immediate. To be rational is to be capable of constraint
by prevision of some future good or ill, and subjection to imperatives
is simply a feature of living in human terms. Rationality turns on
consistency, and the logical is derivative from the rational. Indeed
consistency of thought is for the sake of and aimed at consistency in
action, which in turn derives from consistency in willing, i.e., of
purposing and setting a value on. Logical consistency turns on nowhere
repudiating that to which we anywhere commit ourselves to in our
thought, and consistency in general consists in not accepting now what
we are unwilling to commit to elsewhere or later. Consistency in what
we think and do requires and is required by conformity to
<em>principles.</em> </p>

<p>
So there is a <em>categorical</em> rational imperative of consistency,
“ Be consistent in valuation and in thought and action”
(Lewis 1946, 481) the basis of which is simply a datum of human
nature, and a broader imperative of cogency or basing one's beliefs on
cogent reasoning from evidence (Lewis 1952b, 1952c), an imperative of
prudence, “Be concerned about yourself in future and on the
whole”, and an imperative of justice, “No rule of action
is right except one which is right in all instances and therefore
right for everyone” (Lewis 1946, 481–2). These principles
are simply <em>a priori</em> explications of the rational or moral
sense possessed by most humans. Certainly, this might be challenged.
In any case, Lewis thinks that where that sense is lacking, argument
for the principles is pointless, and he concludes AKV by claiming that
“valuation is always a matter of empirical knowledge” but
“what is right and what is just can never be determined by
empirical facts alone” (Lewis 1946, 554).</p>

<p>
The problem remains of reconciling the imperatives of prudence and
(social) justice in practice, of reconciling the good for oneself with
the good for others in our self-directed, principled, thinking and
doing. What aids us is that, through language and civilization, humans
remember as a species and not merely as individuals. What we are
justified in thinking thereby is that human achievement and social
progress require autonomous, self-criticizing and self-governing
individuals, and that individual achievement and realization of
cherished goods requires membership in a social order of individuals
co-operating in the pursuit of values cherished in common. The
contrast between individual prudence and social justice seems
fundamental, Lewis concludes, perhaps rather optimistically, only by
forgetting this (Lewis 1952b).</p>
