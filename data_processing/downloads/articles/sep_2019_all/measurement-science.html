<h1>Measurement in Science</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Mon Jun 15, 2015</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>Measurement is an integral part of modern science as well as of
engineering, commerce, and daily life. Measurement is often
considered a hallmark of the scientific enterprise and a privileged
source of knowledge relative to qualitative modes of
inquiry.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#1" name="note-1">1</a>]</sup>
Despite its ubiquity and importance, there is little consensus among
philosophers as to how to define measurement, what sorts of things
are measurable, or which conditions make measurement possible. Most
(but not all) contemporary authors agree that measurement is an
activity that involves interaction with a concrete system with the
aim of representing aspects of that system in abstract terms (e.g.,
in terms of classes, numbers, vectors etc.) But this characterization
also fits various kinds of perceptual and linguistic activities that
are not usually considered measurements, and is therefore too broad
to count as a definition of measurement.  Moreover, if
“concrete” implies “real”, this
characterization is also too narrow, as measurement often involves
the representation of ideal systems such as the average household or
an electron at complete rest.</p>

<p>Philosophers have written on a variety of conceptual, metaphysical,
semantic and epistemological issues related to measurement. This entry
will survey the central philosophical standpoints on the nature of
measurement, the notion of measurable quantity and related
epistemological issues. It will refrain from elaborating on the many
discipline-specific problems associated with measurement and focus on
issues that have a general character.</p>

<h2><a id="Ove">1. Overview</a></h2>

<p>Modern philosophical discussions about measurement—spanning
from the late nineteenth century to the present day—may be
divided into several strands of scholarship. These strands reflect
different perspectives on the nature of measurement and the conditions
that make measurement possible and reliable. The main strands are
mathematical theories of measurement, operationalism, conventionalism,
realism, information-theoretic accounts and model-based
accounts. These strands of scholarship do not, for the most part,
constitute directly competing views. Instead, they are best understood
as highlighting different and complementary aspects of
measurement. The following is a very rough overview of these
perspectives:</p>

<ol start="1" type="1"> 

<li><strong>Mathematical theories</strong> <strong>of
measurement</strong> view measurement as the mapping of qualitative
empirical relations to relations among numbers (or other mathematical
entities).</li>

<li><strong>Operationalists and conventionalists</strong> view
measurement as a set of operations that shape the meaning and/or
regulate the use of a quantity-term.</li>

<li><strong>Realists</strong> view measurement as the estimation of
mind-independent properties and/or relations.</li>

<li><strong>Information-theoretic accounts</strong> view measurement
as the gathering and interpretation of information about a
system.</li>

<li><strong>Model-based accounts</strong> view measurement as the
coherent assignment of values to parameters in a theoretical and/or
statistical model of a process.</li> </ol>

<p>These perspectives are in principle consistent with each other.
While mathematical theories of measurement deal with the mathematical
foundations of measurement scales, operationalism and conventionalism
are primarily concerned with the semantics of quantity terms, realism
is concerned with the metaphysical status of measurable quantities,
and information-theoretic and model-based accounts are concerned with
the epistemological aspects of measuring. Nonetheless, the subject
domain is not as neatly divided as the list above suggests. Issues
concerning the metaphysics, epistemology, semantics and mathematical
foundations of measurement are interconnected and often bear on one
another. Hence, for example, operationalists and conventionalists have
often adopted anti-realist views, and proponents of model-based
accounts have argued against the prevailing empiricist interpretation
of mathematical theories of measurement. These subtleties will become
clear in the following discussion.</p>

<p>The list of strands of scholarship is neither exclusive nor
exhaustive. It reflects the historical trajectory of the philosophical
discussion thus far, rather than any principled distinction among
different levels of analysis of measurement. Some philosophical works
on measurement belong to more than one strand, while many other works
do not squarely fit either. This is especially the case since the
early 2000s, when measurement returned to the forefront of
philosophical discussion after several decades of relative
neglect. This recent body of scholarship is sometimes called
“the epistemology of measurement”, and includes a rich
array of works that cannot yet be classified into distinct schools of
thought. The last section of this entry will be dedicated to surveying
some of these developments.</p>

<h2><a id="QuaMagBriHis">2. Quantity and Magnitude: A Brief History</a></h2>

<p>Although the philosophy of measurement formed as a distinct area of
inquiry only during the second half of the nineteenth century,
fundamental concepts of measurement such as magnitude and quantity
have been discussed since antiquity. According to
Euclid’s <em>Elements</em>, a magnitude—such as a line, a
surface or a solid—measures another when the latter is a whole
multiple of the former (Book V, def. 1 &amp; 2). Two magnitudes have a
common measure when they are both whole multiples of some magnitude,
and are incommensurable otherwise (Book X, def. 1). The discovery of
incommensurable magnitudes allowed Euclid and his contemporaries to
develop the notion of a <em>ratio</em> of magnitudes. Ratios can be
either rational or irrational, and therefore the concept of ratio is
more general than that of measure (Michell 2003, 2004;
Grattan-Guinness 1996).</p>

<p>Aristotle distinguished between quantities and qualities. Examples
of quantities are numbers, lines, surfaces, bodies, time and place,
whereas examples of qualities are justice, health, hotness and
paleness (<em>Categories</em> §6 and §8). According to
Aristotle, quantities admit of equality and inequality but not of
degrees, as “one thing is not more four-foot than another”
(ibid.  6.6a19). Qualities, conversely, do not admit of equality or
inequality but do admit of degrees, “for one thing is called
more pale or less pale than another” (ibid. 8.10b26). Aristotle
did not clearly specify whether degrees of qualities such as paleness
correspond to distinct qualities, or whether the same quality,
paleness, was capable of different intensities. This topic was at the
center of an ongoing debate in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries
(Jung 2011). Duns Scotus supported the “addition theory”,
according to which a change in the degree of a quality can be
explained by the addition or subtraction of smaller degrees of that
quality (2011: 553). This theory was later refined by Nicole Oresme,
who used geometrical figures to represent changes in the intensity of
qualities such as velocity (Clagett 1968; Sylla
1971). Oresme’s geometrical representations established a
subset of qualities that were amenable to quantitative treatment,
thereby challenging the strict Aristotelian dichotomy between
quantities and qualities. These developments made possible the
formulation of quantitative laws of motion during the sixteenth and
seventeenth centuries (Grant 1996).</p>

<p>The concept of qualitative intensity was further developed by
Leibniz and Kant. Leibniz’s “principle of
continuity” stated that all natural change is produced by
degrees. Leibniz argued that this principle applies not only to
changes in extended magnitudes such as length and duration, but also
to intensities of representational states of consciousness, such as
sounds (Jorgensen 2009; Diehl 2012). Kant is thought to have relied on
Leibniz’s principle of continuity to formulate his distinction
between extensive and intensive magnitudes. According to Kant,
extensive magnitudes are those “in which the representation of
the parts makes possible the representation of the whole” (1787:
A162/B203). An example is length: a line can only be mentally
represented by a successive synthesis in which parts of the line join
to form the whole. For Kant, the possibility of such synthesis was
grounded in the forms of intuition, namely space and time. Intensive
magnitudes, like warmth or colors, also come in continuous degrees,
but their apprehension takes place in an instant rather than through a
successive synthesis of parts. The degrees of intensive magnitudes
“can only be represented through approximation to
negation” (1787: A 168/B210), that is, by imagining their
gradual diminution until their complete absence.</p>

<p>Scientific developments during the nineteenth century challenged
the distinction between extensive and intensive
magnitudes. Thermodynamics and wave optics showed that differences in
temperature and hue corresponded to differences in spatio-temporal
magnitudes such as velocity and wavelength. Electrical magnitudes such
as resistance and conductance were shown to be capable of addition and
division despite not being extensive in the Kantian sense, i.e., not
synthesized from spatial or temporal parts. Moreover, early
experiments in psychophysics suggested that intensities of sensation
such as brightness and loudness could be represented as sums of
“just noticeable differences” among stimuli, and could
therefore be thought of as composed of parts
(see <a href="#MeaSen">Section 3.3</a>). These findings, along with
advances in the axiomatization of branches of mathematics, motivated
some of the leading scientists of the late nineteenth century to
attempt to clarify the mathematical foundations of measurement
(Maxwell 1873; von Kries 1882; Helmholtz 1887; Mach 1896;
Poincaré 1898; Hölder 1901; for historical surveys see
Darrigol 2003; Michell 1993, 2003; Cantù and Schlaudt
2013). These works are viewed today as precursors to the body of
scholarship known as “measurement theory”.</p>

<h2><a id="MatTheMeaMeaThe">3. Mathematical Theories of Measurement (“Measurement Theory”)</a></h2>

<p>Mathematical theories of measurement (often referred to
collectively as “measurement theory”) concern the
conditions under which relations among numbers (and other
mathematical entities) can be used to express relations among
objects.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#2" name="note-2">2</a>]</sup> In
order to appreciate the need for mathematical theories of
measurement, consider the fact that relations exhibited by
numbers—such as equality, sum, difference and ratio—do
not always correspond to relations among the objects measured by
those numbers. For example, 60 is twice 30, but one would be mistaken
in thinking that an object measured at 60 degrees Celsius is twice as
hot as an object at 30 degrees Celsius. This is because the zero
point of the Celsius scale is arbitrary and does not correspond to an
absence of
 temperature.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#3" name="note-3">3</a>]</sup>
 Similarly, numerical intervals do not
always carry empirical information. When subjects are asked to rank
on a scale from 1 to 7 how strongly they agree with a given
statement, there is no <em>prima facie</em> reason to think that the
intervals between 5 and 6 and between 6 and 7 correspond to equal
increments of strength of opinion. To provide a third example,
equality among numbers is transitive [if (a=b &amp; b=c) then a=c]
but empirical comparisons among physical magnitudes reveal only
approximate equality, which is not a transitive relation. These
examples suggest that not all of the mathematical relations among
numbers used in measurement are empirically significant, and that
different kinds of measurement scale convey different kinds of
empirically significant information.</p>

<p>The study of measurement scales and the empirical information they
convey is the main concern of mathematical theories of measurement. In
his seminal 1887 essay, “Counting and Measuring”, Hermann
von Helmholtz phrased the key question of measurement theory as
follows:
</p><blockquote><p> [W]hat is the objective meaning of expressing
through denominate numbers the relations of real objects as
magnitudes, and under what conditions can we do this? (1887: 4)
</p></blockquote><p> Broadly speaking, measurement theory sets out to
(i) identify the assumptions underlying the use of various
mathematical structures for describing aspects of the empirical
world, and (ii) draw lessons about the adequacy and limits of using
these mathematical structures for describing aspects of the empirical
world. Following Otto Hölder (1901), measurement theorists often
tackle these goals through formal proofs, with the assumptions in (i)
serving as axioms and the lessons in (ii) following as theorems. A
key insight of measurement theory is that the empirically significant
aspects of a given mathematical structure are those that <em>mirror
relevant relations</em> among the objects being measured. For
example, the relation “bigger than” among numbers is
empirically significant for measuring length insofar as it mirrors
the relation “longer than” among objects. This mirroring,
or mapping, of relations between objects and mathematical entities
constitutes a measurement scale. As will be clarified below,
measurement scales are usually thought of as isomorphisms or
homomorphisms between objects and mathematical entities.</p>

<p>Other than these broad goals and claims, measurement theory is a
highly heterogeneous body of scholarship. It includes works that span
from the late nineteenth century to the present day and endorse a wide
array of views on the ontology, epistemology and semantics of
measurement. Two main differences among mathematical theories of
measurement are especially worth mentioning. The first concerns the
nature of the <em>relata</em>, or “objects”, whose
relations numbers are supposed to mirror. These <em>relata</em> may be
understood in at least four different ways: as concrete individual
objects, as qualitative observations of concrete individual objects,
as abstract representations of individual objects, or as universal
properties of objects. Which interpretation is adopted depends in
large part on the author’s metaphysical and epistemic
commitments. This issue will be especially relevant to the discussion
of realist accounts of measurement (<a href="#ReaAccMea">Section
5</a>). Second, different measurement theorists have taken different
stands on the kind of empirical evidence that is required to establish
mappings between objects and numbers. As a result, measurement
theorists have come to disagree about the necessary conditions for
establishing the measurability of attributes, and specifically about
whether psychological attributes are measurable.  Debates about
measurability have been highly fruitful for the development of
measurement theory, and the following subsections will introduce some
of these debates and the central concepts developed therein.</p>

<h3><a id="FunDerMea">3.1 Fundamental and derived measurement</a></h3>

<p>During the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries several
attempts were made to provide a universal definition of measurement.
Although accounts of measurement varied, the consensus was that
measurement is a method of <em>assigning numbers to magnitudes</em>.
For example, Helmholtz (1887: 17) defined measurement as the procedure
by which one finds the denominate number that expresses the value of a
magnitude, where a “denominate number” is a number
together with a unit, e.g., 5 meters, and a magnitude is a quality of
objects that is amenable to ordering from smaller to greater, e.g.,
length.  Bertrand Russell similarly stated that measurement is
</p><blockquote><p> any method by which a unique and reciprocal
correspondence is established between all or some of the magnitudes of
a kind and all or some of the numbers, integral, rational or
real. (1903: 176)
</p></blockquote><p> Norman Campbell defined measurement simply as
“the process of assigning numbers to represent
qualities”, where a quality is a property that admits of
non-arbitrary ordering (1920: 267).</p>

<p>Defining measurement as numerical assignment raises the question:
which assignments are adequate, and under what conditions? Early
measurement theorists like Helmholtz (1887), Hölder (1901) and
Campbell (1920) argued that numbers are adequate for expressing
magnitudes insofar as algebraic operations among numbers mirror
empirical relations among magnitudes. For example, the qualitative
relation “longer than” among rigid rods is (roughly)
transitive and asymmetrical, and in this regard shares structural
features with the relation “larger than” among numbers.
Moreover, the end-to-end concatenation of rigid rods shares structural
features—such as associativity and commutativity—with the
mathematical operation of addition. A similar situation holds for the
measurement of weight with an equal-arms balance. Here deflection of
the arms provides ordering among weights and the heaping of weights on
one pan constitutes concatenation.</p>

<p>Early measurement theorists formulated axioms that describe these
qualitative empirical structures, and used these axioms to prove
theorems about the adequacy of assigning numbers to magnitudes that
exhibit such structures. Specifically, they proved that ordering and
concatenation are together sufficient for the construction of
an <em>additive</em> numerical representation of the relevant
magnitudes.  An additive representation is one in which addition is
empirically meaningful, and hence also multiplication, division
etc. Campbell called measurement procedures that satisfy the
conditions of additivity “fundamental” because they do not
involve the measurement of any other magnitude (1920: 277). Kinds of
magnitudes for which a fundamental measurement procedure has been
found—such as length, area, volume, duration, weight and
electrical resistance—Campbell called “fundamental
magnitudes”. A hallmark of such magnitudes is that it is
possible to generate them by concatenating a standard sequence of
equal units, as in the example of a series of equally spaced marks on
a ruler.</p>

<p>Although they viewed additivity as the hallmark of measurement,
most early measurement theorists acknowledged that additivity is not
necessary for measuring. Other magnitudes exist that admit of ordering
from smaller to greater, but whose ratios and/or differences cannot
currently be determined except through their relations to other,
fundamentally measurable magnitudes. Examples are temperature, which
may be measured by determining the volume of a mercury column, and
density, which may be measured as the ratio of mass and volume. Such
indirect determination came to be called “derived”
measurement and the relevant magnitudes “derived
magnitudes” (Campbell 1920: 275–7).</p>

<p>At first glance, the distinction between fundamental and derived
measurement may seem reminiscent of the distinction between extensive
and intensive magnitudes, and indeed fundamental measurement is
sometimes called “extensive”. Nonetheless, it is important
to note that the two distinctions are based on significantly different
criteria of measurability. As discussed
in <a href="#QuaMagBriHis">Section 2</a>, the extensive-intensive
distinction focused on the intrinsic structure of the quantity in
question, i.e., whether or not it is composed of spatio-temporal
parts. The fundamental-derived distinction, by contrast, focuses on
the properties of measurement <em>operations</em>.  A fundamentally
measurable magnitude is one for which a fundamental measurement
operation has been found. Consequently, fundamentality is not an
intrinsic property of a magnitude: a derived magnitude can become
fundamental with the discovery of new operations for its
measurement. Moreover, in fundamental measurement the numerical
assignment need not mirror the structure of spatio-temporal parts.
Electrical resistance, for example, can be fundamentally measured by
connecting resistors in a series (Campbell 1920: 293). This is
considered a fundamental measurement operation because it has a shared
structure with numerical addition, even though objects with equal
resistance are not generally equal in size.</p>

<p>The distinction between fundamental and derived measurement was
revised by subsequent authors. Brian Ellis (1966: Ch. 5–8)
distinguished among three types of measurement: fundamental,
associative and derived. Fundamental measurement requires ordering
and concatenation operations satisfying the same conditions specified
by Campbell. Associative measurement procedures are based on a
correlation of two ordering relationships, e.g., the correlation
between the volume of a mercury column and its temperature. Derived
measurement procedures consist in the determination of the value of a
constant in a physical law. The constant may be local, as in the
determination of the specific density of water from mass and volume,
or universal, as in the determination of the Newtonian gravitational
constant from force, mass and distance. Henry Kyburg (1984:
Ch. 5–7) proposed a somewhat different threefold distinction
among direct, indirect and systematic measurement, which does not
completely overlap with that of
 Ellis.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#4" name="note-4">4</a>]</sup>
 A more radical revision of the distinction
between fundamental and derived measurement was offered by R. Duncan
Luce and John Tukey (1964) in their work on conjoint measurement,
which will be discussed in <a href="#RepTheMea">Section 3.4</a>.</p>

<h3><a id="ClaSca">3.2 The classification of scales</a></h3>

<p>The previous subsection discussed the axiomatization of empirical
structures, a line of inquiry that dates back to the early days of
measurement theory. A complementary line of inquiry within
measurement theory concerns the classification of measurement
scales. The psychophysicist S.S. Stevens (1946, 1951) distinguished
among four types of scales: nominal, ordinal, interval and
ratio. Nominal scales represent objects as belonging to classes that
have no particular order, e.g., male and female. Ordinal scales
represent order but no further algebraic structure. For example, the
Mohs scale of mineral hardness represents minerals with numbers
ranging from 1 (softest) to 10 (hardest), but there is no empirical
significance to equality among intervals or ratios of those
numbers.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#5" name="note-5">5</a>]</sup>
Celsius and Fahrenheit are examples of interval scales: they
represent equality or inequality among intervals of temperature, but
not ratios of temperature, because their zero points are
arbitrary. The Kelvin scale, by contrast, is a ratio scale, as are
the familiar scales representing mass in kilograms, length in meters
and duration in seconds. Stevens later refined this classification
and distinguished between linear and logarithmic interval scales
(1959: 31–34) and
between ratio scales with and without a natural unit (1959:
34). Ratio scales with a
natural unit, such as those used for counting discrete objects and
for representing probabilities, were named “absolute”
scales.</p>

<p>As Stevens notes, scale types are individuated by the families of
transformations they can undergo without loss of empirical
information.  Empirical relations represented on ratio scales, for
example, are invariant under multiplication by a positive number,
e.g., multiplication by 2.54 converts from inches to
centimeters. Linear interval scales allow both multiplication by a
positive number and a constant shift, e.g., the conversion from
Celsius to Fahrenheit in accordance with the formula °C ×
9/5 + 32 = °F. Ordinal scales admit of any transformation function
as long as it is monotonic and increasing, and nominal scales admit of
any one-to-one substitution. Absolute scales admit of no
transformation other than identity. Stevens’ classification of
scales was later generalized by Louis Narens (1981, 1985: Ch. 2) and
Luce et al. (1990: Ch. 20) in terms of the homogeneity and uniqueness
of the relevant transformation groups.</p>

<p>While Stevens’ classification of scales met with general
approval in scientific and philosophical circles, its wider
implications for measurement theory became the topic of considerable
debate. Two issues were especially contested. The first was whether
classification and ordering operations deserve to be called
“measurement” operations, and accordingly whether the
representation of magnitudes on nominal and ordinal scales should
count as measurement. Several physicists, including Campbell, argued
that classification and ordering operations did not provide a
sufficiently rich structure to warrant the use of numbers, and hence
should not count as measurement operations. The second contested issue
was whether a concatenation operation had to be found for a magnitude
before it could be fundamentally measured on a ratio scale. The debate
became especially heated when it re-ignited a longer controversy
surrounding the measurability of intensities of sensation. It is to
this debate we now turn.</p>

<h3><a id="MeaSen">3.3 The measurability of sensation</a></h3>

<p>One of the main catalysts for the development of mathematical
theories of measurement was an ongoing debate surrounding
measurability in psychology. The debate is often traced back to Gustav
Fechner’s (1860) <em>Elements of Psychophysics</em>, in which he
described a method of measuring intensities of sensation.
Fechner’s method was based on the recording of “just
noticeable differences” between sensations associated with pairs
of stimuli, e.g., two sounds of different intensity. These differences
were assumed to be equal increments of intensity of sensation. As
Fechner showed, under this assumption a stable linear relationship is
revealed between the intensity of sensation and the logarithm of the
intensity of the stimulus, a relation that came to be known as
“Fechner’s law” (Heidelberger 1993a: 203; Luce and
Suppes 2004: 11–2). This law in turn provides a method for
indirectly measuring the intensity of sensation by measuring the
intensity of the stimulus, and hence, Fechner argued, provides
justification for measuring intensities of sensation on the real
numbers.</p>

<p>Fechner’s claims concerning the measurability of sensation
became the subject of a series of debates that lasted nearly a century
and proved extremely fruitful for the philosophy of measurement,
involving key figures such as Mach, Helmholtz, Campbell and Stevens
(Heidelberger 1993a: Ch. 6 and 1993b; Michell 1999: Ch. 6). Those
objecting to the measurability of sensation, such as Campbell,
stressed the necessity of an empirical concatenation operation for
fundamental measurement. Since intensities of sensation cannot be
concatenated to each other in the manner afforded by lengths and
weights, there could be no fundamental measurement of sensation
intensity. Moreover, Campbell claimed that none of the psychophysical
regularities discovered thus far are sufficiently universal to count
as laws in the sense required for derived measurement (Campbell in
Ferguson et al.  1940: 347). All that psychophysicists have shown is
that intensities of sensation can be consistently ordered, but order
by itself does not yet warrant the use of numerical relations such as
sums and ratios to express empirical results.</p>

<p>The central opponent of Campbell in this debate was Stevens, whose
distinction between types of measurement scale was discussed above.
Stevens defined measurement as the “assignment of numerals to
objects or events according to rules” (1951: 1) and claimed that
any consistent and non-random assignment counts as measurement in the
broad sense (1975: 47). In useful cases of scientific inquiry, Stevens
claimed, measurement can be construed somewhat more narrowly as a
numerical assignment that is based on the results of <em>matching</em>
operations, such as the coupling of temperature to mercury volume or
the matching of sensations to each other. Stevens argued against the
view that relations among numbers need to mirror qualitative empirical
structures, claiming instead that measurement scales should be
regarded as arbitrary formal schemas and adopted in accordance with
their usefulness for describing empirical data. For example, adopting
a ratio scale for measuring the sensations of loudness, volume and
density of sounds leads to the formulation of a simple linear relation
among the reports of experimental subjects: loudness = volume ×
density (1975: 57–8). Such assignment of numbers to sensations
counts as measurement because it is consistent and non-random, because
it is based on the matching operations performed by experimental
subjects, and because it captures regularities in the experimental
results.  According to Stevens, these conditions are together
sufficient to justify the use of a ratio scale for measuring
sensations, despite the fact that “sensations cannot be
separated into component parts, or laid end to end like measuring
sticks” (1975: 38; see also Hempel 1952: 68–9).</p>

<h3><a id="RepTheMea">3.4 Representational Theory of Measurement</a></h3>

<p>In the mid-twentieth century the two main lines of inquiry in
measurement theory, the one dedicated to the empirical conditions of
quantification and the one concerning the classification of scales,
converged in the work of Patrick Suppes (1951; Scott and Suppes 1958;
for historical surveys see Savage and Ehrlich 1992; Diez 1997a,b).
Suppes’ work laid the basis for the Representational Theory of
Measurement (RTM), which remains the most influential mathematical
theory of measurement to date (Krantz et al. 1971; Suppes et
al. 1989; Luce et al. 1990). RTM defines measurement as the
construction of mappings from empirical relational structures into
numerical relational structures (Krantz et al. 1971: 9). An empirical
relational structure consists of a set of empirical objects (e.g.,
rigid rods) along with certain qualitative relations among them
(e.g., ordering, concatenation), while a numerical relational
structure consists of a set of numbers (e.g., real numbers) and
specific mathematical relations among them (e.g., “equal to or
bigger than”, addition).  Simply put, a measurement scale is a
many-to-one mapping—a homomorphism—from an empirical to a
numerical relational structure, and measurement is the construction
of scales.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#6" name="note-6">6</a>]</sup> RTM
goes into great detail in clarifying the assumptions underlying the
construction of different types of measurement scales. Each type of
scale is associated with a set of assumptions about the qualitative
relations obtaining among objects represented on that type of
scale. From these assumptions, or axioms, the authors of RTM derive
the representational adequacy of each scale type, as well as the
family of permissible transformations making that type of scale
unique. In this way RTM provides a conceptual link between the
empirical basis of measurement and the typology of
scales.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#7" name="note-7">7</a>]</sup></p>

<p>On the issue of measurability, the Representational Theory takes a
middle path between the liberal approach adopted by Stevens and the
strict emphasis on concatenation operations espoused by Campbell. Like
Campbell, RTM accepts that rules of quantification must be grounded in
known empirical structures and should not be chosen arbitrarily to fit
the data. However, RTM rejects the idea that additive scales are
adequate only when concatenation operations are available (Luce and
Suppes 2004: 15). Instead, RTM argues for the existence of fundamental
measurement operations that do not involve concatenation. The central
example of this type of operation is known as “additive conjoint
measurement” (Luce and Tukey 1964; Krantz et al. 1971:
17–21 and Ch. 6–7). Here, measurements of two or more
different types of attribute, such as the temperature and pressure of
a gas, are obtained by observing their joint effect, such as the
volume of the gas. Luce and Tukey showed that by establishing certain
qualitative relations among volumes under variations of temperature
and pressure, one can construct additive representations of
temperature and pressure, without invoking any antecedent method of
measuring volume. This sort of procedure is generalizable to any
suitably related triplet of attributes, such as the loudness,
intensity and frequency of pure tones, or the preference for a reward,
it size and the delay in receiving it (Luce and Suppes 2004: 17). The
discovery of additive conjoint measurement led the authors of RTM to
divide fundamental measurement into two kinds: traditional measurement
procedures based on concatenation operations, which they called
“extensive measurement”, and conjoint or
“nonextensive” fundamental measurement. Under this new
conception of fundamentality, all the traditional physical attributes
can be measured fundamentally, as well as many psychological
attributes (Krantz et al. 1971: 502–3).</p>

<h2><a id="OpeCon">4. Operationalism and Conventionalism</a></h2>

<p>Above we saw that mathematical theories of measurement are
primarily concerned with the mathematical properties of measurement
scales and the conditions of their application. A related but distinct
strand of scholarship concerns the meaning and use of quantity
terms. Scientific theories and models are commonly expressed in terms
of quantitative relations among parameters, bearing names such as
“length”, “unemployment rate” and
“introversion”. A realist about one of these terms would
argue that it refers to a set of properties or relations that exist
independently of being measured. An operationalist or conventionalist
would argue that the way such quantity-terms apply to concrete
particulars depends on nontrivial choices made by humans, and
specifically on choices that have to do with the way the relevant
quantity is measured. Note that under this broad construal, realism is
compatible with operationalism and conventionalism. That is, it is
conceivable that choices of measurement method regulate the use of a
quantity-term and that, given the <em>correct</em> choice, this term
succeeds in referring to a mind-independent property or
relation. Nonetheless, many operationalists and conventionalists
adopted stronger views, according to which there are no facts of the
matter as to which of several and nontrivially different operations is
correct for applying a given quantity-term. These stronger variants
are inconsistent with realism about measurement. This section will be
dedicated to operationalism and conventionalism, and the next to
realism about measurement.</p>

<p>Operationalism (or “operationism”) about measurement is
the view that the meaning of quantity-concepts is determined by the
set of operations used for their measurement. The strongest expression
of operationalism appears in the early work of Percy Bridgman (1927),
who argued that
</p><blockquote><p> we mean by any concept nothing more than a set of
operations; the concept is synonymous with the corresponding set of
operations. (1927: 5)
</p></blockquote><p> Length, for example, would be defined as the
result of the operation of concatenating rigid rods. According to
this extreme version of operationalism, different operations measure
different quantities. Length measured by using rulers and by timing
electromagnetic pulses should, strictly speaking, be distinguished
into two distinct quantity-concepts labeled “length-1”
and “length-2” respectively. This conclusion led Bridgman
to claim that currently accepted quantity concepts have
“joints” where different operations overlap in their
domain of application. He warned against dogmatic faith in the unity
of quantity concepts across these “joints”, urging
instead that unity be checked against experiments whenever the
application of a quantity-concept is to be extended into a new
domain. Nevertheless, Bridgman conceded that as long as the results
of different operations agree within experimental error it is
pragmatically justified to label the corresponding quantities with
the same name (1927: 
16).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#8" name="note-8">8</a>]</sup></p>

<p>Operationalism became influential in psychology, where it was
well-received by behaviorists like Edwin Boring (1945) and
B.F. Skinner (1945). Indeed, Skinner maintained that behaviorism is
“nothing more than a thoroughgoing operational analysis of
traditional mentalistic concepts” (1945: 271). Stevens, who was
Boring’s student, was a key promoter of operationalism in
psychology, and argued that psychological concepts have empirical
meaning only if they stand for definite and concrete operations
(1935: 517). The idea that concepts are defined by measurement
operations is consistent with Stevens’ liberal views on
measurability, which were discussed above (<a href="#MeaSen">Section
3.3</a>). As long as the assignment of numbers to objects is
performed in accordance with concrete and consistent rules, Stevens
maintained that such assignment has empirical meaning and does not
need to satisfy any additional constraints.  Nonetheless, Stevens
probably did not embrace an anti-realist view about psychological
attributes. Instead, there are good reasons to think that he
understood operationalism as a methodological attitude that was
valuable to the extent that it allowed psychologists to justify the
conclusions they drew from experiments (Feest 2005). For example,
Stevens did not treat operational definitions as <em>a priori</em>
but as amenable to improvement in light of empirical discoveries,
implying that he took psychological attributes to exist independently
of such definitions (Stevens 1935: 527). This suggests that
Stevens’ operationalism was of a more moderate variety than
that found in the early writings of
Bridgman.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#9" name="note-9">9</a>]</sup></p>

<p>Operationalism met with initial enthusiasm by logical positivists,
who viewed it as akin to verificationism. Nonetheless, it was soon
revealed that any attempt to base a theory of meaning on
operationalist principles was riddled with problems. Among such
problems were the automatic reliability operationalism conferred on
measurement operations, the ambiguities surrounding the notion of
operation, the overly restrictive operational criterion of
meaningfulness, and the fact that many useful theoretical concepts
lack clear operational definitions (Chang
2009).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#10" name="note-10">10</a>]</sup> In
particular, Carl Hempel (1956, 1966) criticized operationalists for
being unable to define dispositional terms such as “solubility
in water”, and for multiplying the number of scientific
concepts in a manner that runs against the need for systematic and
simple theories.  Accordingly, most writers on the semantics of
quantity-terms have avoided espousing an operational
analysis.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#11" name="note-11">11</a>]</sup></p>

<p>A more widely advocated approach admitted a conventional element to
the use of quantity-terms, while resisting attempts to reduce the
meaning of quantity terms to measurement operations. These accounts
are classified under the general heading
“conventionalism”, though they differ in the particular
aspects of measurement they deem conventional and in the degree of
arbitrariness they ascribe to such
conventions.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#12" name="note-12">12</a>]</sup>
 An early precursor of conventionalism
was Ernst Mach, who examined the notion of equality among temperature
intervals (1896: 52). Mach noted that different types of thermometric
fluid expand at different (and nonlinearly related) rates when
heated, raising the question: which fluid expands most uniformly with
temperature? According to Mach, there is no fact of the matter as to
which fluid expands more uniformly, since the very notion of equality
among temperature intervals has no determinate application prior to a
conventional choice of standard thermometric fluid. Mach coined the
term “principle of coordination” for this sort of
conventionally chosen principle for the application of a quantity
concept. The concepts of uniformity of time and space received
similar treatments by Henri Poincaré (1898, 1902: Part
2). Poincaré argued that procedures used to determine equality
among durations stem from scientists’ unconscious preference
for descriptive simplicity, rather than from any fact about
nature. Similarly, scientists’ choice to represent space with
either Euclidean or non-Euclidean geometries is not determined by
experience but by considerations of convenience.</p>

<p>Conventionalism with respect to measurement reached its most
sophisticated expression in logical positivism. Logical positivists
like Hans Reichenbach and Rudolf Carnap proposed “coordinative
definitions” or “correspondence rules” as the
semantic link between theoretical and observational
terms. These <em>a priori</em>, definition-like statements were
intended to regulate the use of theoretical terms by connecting them
with empirical procedures (Reichenbach 1927: 14–19; Carnap
1966: Ch. 24). An example of a coordinative definition is the
statement: “a measuring rod retains its length when
transported”. According to Reichenbach, this statement cannot
be empirically verified, because a universal and experimentally
undetectable force could exist that equally distorts every
object’s length when it is transported. In accordance with
verificationism, statements that are unverifiable are neither true
nor false. Instead, Reichenbach took this statement to expresses an
arbitrary rule for regulating the use of the concept of equality of
length, namely, for determining whether particular instances of
length are equal (Reichenbach 1927: 16). At the same time,
coordinative definitions were not seen as replacements, but rather as
necessary additions, to the familiar sort of theoretical definitions
of concepts in terms of other concepts (1927: 14). Under the
conventionalist viewpoint, then, the specification of measurement
operations did not exhaust the meaning of concepts such as length or
length-equality, thereby avoiding many of the problems associated
with operationalism.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#13" name="note-13">13</a>]</sup></p>

<h2><a id="ReaAccMea">5. Realist Accounts of Measurement</a></h2>

<p>Realists about measurement maintain that measurement is best
understood as the empirical estimation of an objective property or
relation. A few clarificatory remarks are in order with respect to
this characterization of measurement. First, the term
“objective” is not meant to exclude mental properties or
relations, which are the objects of psychological measurement. Rather,
measurable properties or relations are taken to be objective inasmuch
as they are independent of the beliefs and conventions of the humans
performing the measurement and of the methods used for measuring. For
example, a realist would argue that the ratio of the length of a given
solid rod to the standard meter has an objective value regardless of
whether and how it is measured. Second, the term
“estimation” is used by realists to highlight the fact
that measurement results are mere <em>approximations</em> of true
values (Trout 1998: 46). Third, according to realists, measurement is
aimed at obtaining knowledge about properties and relations, rather
than at assigning values directly to individual objects. This is
significant because observable objects (e.g., levers, chemical
solutions, humans) often instantiate measurable properties and
relations that are not directly observable (e.g., amount of mechanical
work, more acidic than, intelligence). Knowledge claims about such
properties and relations must presuppose some background theory. By
shifting the emphasis from objects to properties and relations,
realists highlight the theory-laden character of measurements.</p>

<p>Realism about measurement should not be confused with realism about
entities (e.g., electrons). Nor does realism about measurement
necessarily entail realism about properties (e.g., temperature), since
one could in principle accept only the reality of relations (e.g.,
ratios among quantities) without embracing the reality of underlying
properties. Nonetheless, most philosophers who have defended realism
about measurement have done so by arguing for some form of realism
about properties (Byerly and Lazara 1973; Swoyer 1987; Mundy 1987;
Trout 1998, 2000). These realists argue that at least some measurable
properties exist independently of the beliefs and conventions of the
humans who measure them, and that the existence and structure of these
properties provides the best explanation for key features of
measurement, including the usefulness of numbers in expressing
measurement results and the reliability of measuring instruments.</p>

<p>For example, a typical realist about length measurement would argue
that the empirical regularities displayed by individual objects’
lengths when they are ordered and concatenated are best explained by
assuming that length is an objective property that has an extensive
structure (Swoyer 1987: 271–4). That is, relations among lengths
such as “longer than” and “sum of” exist
independently of whether any objects happen to be ordered and
concatenated by humans, and indeed independently of whether objects of
some particular length happen to exist at all. The existence of an
extensive property structure means that lengths share much of their
structure with the positive real numbers, and this explains the
usefulness of the positive reals in representing lengths. Moreover, if
measurable properties are analyzed in dispositional terms, it becomes
easy to explain why some measuring instruments are reliable. For
example, if one assumes that a certain amount of electric current in a
wire entails a disposition to deflect an ammeter needle by a certain
angle, it follows that the ammeter’s indications
counterfactually depend on the amount of electric current in the wire,
and therefore that the ammeter is reliable (Trout 1998: 65).</p>

<p>A different argument for realism about measurement is due to Joel
Michell (1994, 2005), who proposes a realist theory of number based on
the Euclidean concept of ratio. According to Michell, numbers are
ratios between quantities, and therefore exist in space and time.
Specifically, <em>real</em> numbers are ratios between pairs of
infinite standard sequences, e.g., the sequence of lengths normally
denoted by “1 meter”, “2 meters” etc. and the
sequence of whole multiples of the length we are trying to measure.
Measurement is the discovery and estimation of such ratios. An
interesting consequence of this empirical realism about numbers is
that measurement is not a representational activity, but rather the
activity of approximating mind-independent numbers (Michell 1994:
400).</p>

<p>Realist accounts of measurement are largely formulated in
opposition to strong versions of operationalism and conventionalism,
which dominated philosophical discussions of measurement from the
1930s until the 1960s. In addition to the drawbacks of operationalism
already discussed in the previous section, realists point out that
anti-realism about measurable quantities fails to make sense of
scientific practice.  If quantities had no real values independently
of one’s choice of measurement procedure, it would be difficult
to explain what scientists mean by “measurement accuracy”
and “measurement error”, and why they try to increase
accuracy and diminish error.  By contrast, realists can easily make
sense of the notions of accuracy and error in terms of the distance
between real and measured values (Byerly and Lazara 1973: 17–8;
Swoyer 1987: 239; Trout 1998: 57). A closely related point is the
fact that newer measurement procedures tend to improve on the
accuracy of older ones. If choices of measurement procedure were
merely conventional it would be difficult to make sense of such
progress. In addition, realism provides an intuitive explanation for
why different measurement procedures often yield similar results,
namely, because they are sensitive to the same facts (Swoyer 1987:
239; Trout 1998: 56). Finally, realists note that the construction of
measurement apparatus and the analysis of measurement results are
guided by theoretical assumptions concerning causal relationships
among quantities. The ability of such causal assumptions to guide
measurement suggests that quantities are ontologically prior to the
procedures that measure 
them.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#14" name="note-14">14</a>]</sup></p>

<p>While their stance towards operationalism and conventionalism is
largely critical, realists are more charitable in their assessment of
mathematical theories of measurement. Brent Mundy (1987) and Chris
Swoyer (1987) both accept the axiomatic treatment of measurement
scales, but object to the empiricist interpretation given to the
axioms by prominent measurement theorists like Campbell (1920) and
Ernest Nagel (1931; Cohen and Nagel 1934: Ch. 15). Rather than
interpreting the axioms as pertaining to concrete objects or to
observable relations among such objects, Mundy and Swoyer reinterpret
the axioms as pertaining to universal magnitudes, e.g., to the
universal property of being 5 meter long rather than to the concrete
instantiations of that property. This construal preserves the
intuition that statements like “the size of <em>x</em> is twice
the size of <em>y</em>” are first and foremost about
two <em>sizes</em>, and only derivatively about the
objects <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> themselves (Mundy 1987:
34).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#15" name="note-15">15</a>]</sup> Mundy
and Swoyer argue that their interpretation is more general, because
it logically entails all the first-order consequences of the
empiricist interpretation along with additional, second-order claims
about universal magnitudes.  Moreover, under their interpretation
measurement theory becomes a genuine scientific theory, with
explanatory hypotheses and testable predictions. Despite these
virtues, the realist interpretation has been largely ignored in the
wider literature on measurement theory.</p>

<h2><a id="InfTheAccMea">6. Information-Theoretic Accounts of Measurement</a></h2>

<p>Information-theoretic accounts of measurement are based on an
analogy between measuring systems and communication systems. In a
simple communication system, a message (input) is encoded into a
signal at the transmitter’s end, sent to the receiver’s
end, and then decoded back (output). The accuracy of the transmission
depends on features of the communication system as well as on features
of the environment, i.e., the level of background noise. Similarly,
measuring instruments can be thought of as “information
machines” (Finkelstein 1977) that interact with an object in a
given state (input), encode that state into an internal signal, and
convert that signal into a reading (output). The accuracy of a
measurement similarly depends on the instrument as well as on the
level of noise in its environment. Conceived as a special sort of
information transmission, measurement becomes analyzable in terms of
the conceptual apparatus of information theory (Hartley 1928; Shannon
1948; Shannon and Weaver 1949). For example, the information that

alternative formulations see Brillouin
1962: Ch. 15;
Kirpatovskii 1974; and Mari 1999: 185).</p>

<p>Ludwik Finkelstein (1975, 1977) and Luca Mari (1999) suggested the
possibility of a synthesis between Shannon-Weaver information theory
and measurement theory. As they argue, both theories centrally appeal
to the idea of mapping: information theory concerns the mapping
between symbols in the input and output messages, while measurement
theory concerns the mapping between objects and numbers. If
measurement is taken to be analogous to symbol-manipulation, then
Shannon-Weaver theory could provide a formalization of the syntax of
measurement while measurement theory could provide a formalization of
its semantics.  Nonetheless, Mari (1999: 185) also warns that the
analogy between communication and measurement systems is
limited. Whereas a sender’s message can be known with arbitrary
precision independently of its transmission, the state of an object
cannot be known with arbitrary precision independently of its
measurement.</p>

<p>Information-theoretic accounts of measurement were originally
developed by metrologists with little involvement from philosophers.
Metrology, officially defined as the “science of measurement and
its application” (JCGM 2012: 2.2), is a field of study concerned
with the design, maintenance and improvement of measuring instruments
in the natural sciences and engineering. Metrologists typically work
at standardization bureaus or at specialized laboratories that are
responsible for the calibration of measurement equipment, the
comparison of standards and the evaluation of measurement
uncertainties, among other tasks. It is only recently that
philosophers have begun to engage with the rich conceptual issues
underlying metrological practice, and particularly with the inferences
involved in evaluating and improving the accuracy of measurement
standards (Chang 2004; Boumans 2005a: Chap. 5, 2005b, 2007a; Frigerio
et al. 2010; Tal forthcoming-a; Teller 2013a,b; Riordan 2014). Further
philosophical work is required to explore the assumptions and
consequences of information-theoretic accounts of measurement, their
implications for metrological practice, and their connections with
other accounts of measurement. </p>

<p>Independently of developments in metrology, Bas van Fraassen (2008:
141–185) has recently proposed a conception of measurement in
which information plays a key role. He views measurement as composed
of two levels: on the physical level, the measuring apparatus
interacts with an object and produces a reading, e.g., a pointer
position.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#16" name="note-16">16</a>]</sup>
On the abstract level, background theory represents the
object’s possible states on a parameter space. Measurement
locates an object on a sub-region of this abstract parameter space,
thereby reducing the range of possible states (2008: 164 and
172). This reduction of possibilities amounts to the collection of
information about the measured object. Van Fraassen’s analysis
of measurement differs from information-theoretic accounts developed
in metrology in its explicit appeal to background theory, and in the
fact that it does not invoke the symbolic conception of information
developed by Shannon and Weaver.</p>

<h2><a id="ModBasAccMea">7. Model-Based Accounts of Measurement</a></h2>

<p>Since the early 2000s a new wave of philosophical scholarship has
emerged that emphasizes the relationships between measurement and
theoretical and statistical modeling. According to model-based
accounts, measurement consists of two levels: (i) a concrete process
involving interactions between an object of interest, an instrument,
and the environment; and (ii) a theoretical and/or statistical model
of that process, where “model” denotes an abstract and
local representation constructed from simplifying assumptions. The
central goal of measurement according to this view is to assign values
to one or more parameters of interest in the model in a manner that
satisfies certain epistemic desiderata, in particular coherence and
consistency.</p>

<p>A central motivation for the development of model-based accounts is
the attempt to clarify the epistemological principles underlying
aspects of measurement practice. For example, metrologists employ a
variety of methods for the calibration of measuring instruments, the
standardization and tracing of units and the evaluation of
uncertainties (for a discussion of metrology, see the previous
section). Traditional philosophical accounts such as mathematical
theories of measurement do not elaborate on the assumptions, inference
patterns, evidential grounds or success criteria associated with such
methods. As Frigerio et al. (2010) argue, measurement theory is
ill-suited for clarifying these aspects of measurement because it
abstracts away from the process of measurement and focuses solely on
the mathematical properties of scales. By contrast, model-based
accounts take scale construction to be merely one of several tasks
involved in measurement, alongside the definition of measured
parameters, instrument design and calibration, object sampling and
preparation, error detection and uncertainty evaluation, among others
(2010: 145–7).</p>

<h3><a id="RolModMea">7.1 The roles of models in measurement</a></h3>

<p>According to model-based accounts, measurement involves interaction
between an object of interest (the “system under
measurement”), an instrument (the “measurement
system”) and an environment, which includes the measuring
subjects. Other, secondary interactions may also be relevant for the
determination of a measurement outcome, such as the interaction
between the measuring instrument and the reference standards used for
its calibration, and the chain of comparisons that trace the reference
standard back to primary measurement standards (Mari 2003: 25).
Measurement proceeds by representing these interactions with a set of
parameters, and assigning values to a subset of those parameters
(known as “measurands”) based on the results of the
interactions.  When measured parameters are numerical they are called
“quantities”. Although measurands need not be quantities,
a quantitative measurement scenario will be supposed in what
follows.</p>

<p>Two sorts of measurement outputs are distinguished by model-based
accounts [JCGM 2012: 2.9 &amp; 4.1; Giordani and Mari 2012: 2146; Tal
2013]:</p>

<ol start="1" type="1"> 

<li><strong>Instrument indications</strong> (or
“readings”): these are properties of the measuring
instrument in its final state after the measurement process is
complete. Examples are digits on a display, marks on a multiple-choice
questionnaire and bits stored in a device’s memory. Indications
may be represented by numbers, but such numbers describe states of the
instrument and should not be confused with measurement outcomes, which
concern states of the object being measured.</li>

<li><strong>Measurement outcomes</strong> (or “results”):
these are knowledge claims about the values of one or more quantities
attributed to the object being measured, and are typically accompanied
by a specification of the measurement unit and scale and an estimate
of measurement uncertainty. For example, a measurement outcome may be
expressed by the sentence “the mass of object <em>a</em> is
20±1 grams with a probability of 68%”.</li>
</ol>

<p>As proponents of model-based accounts stress, inferences from
instrument indications to measurement outcomes are nontrivial and
depend on a host of theoretical and statistical assumptions about the
object being measured, the instrument, the environment and the
calibration process. Measurement outcomes are often obtained through
statistical analysis of multiple indications, thereby involving
assumptions about the shape of the distribution of indications and the
randomness of environmental effects (Bogen and Woodward 1988:
307–310).  Measurement outcomes also incorporate corrections for
systematic effects, and such corrections are based on theoretical
assumptions concerning the workings of the instrument and its
interactions with the object and environment. For example, length
measurements need to be corrected for the change of the measuring
rod’s length with temperature, a correction which is derived
from a theoretical equation of thermal expansion. Systematic
corrections involve uncertainties of their own, for example in the
determination of the values of constants, and these uncertainties are
assessed through secondary experiments involving further theoretical
and statistical assumptions. Moreover, the uncertainty associated with
a measurement outcome depends on the methods employed for the
calibration of the instrument. Calibration involves additional
assumptions about the instrument, the calibrating apparatus, the
quantity being measured and the properties of measurement standards
(Rothbart and Slayden 1994; Franklin 1997; Baird 2004: Ch. 4; Soler et
al. 2011). Another component of uncertainty originates from vagueness
in the definition of the measurand, and is known as
“definitional uncertainty” (Mari and Giordani
2013). Finally, measurement involves background assumptions about the
scale type and unit system being used, and these assumptions are often
tied to broader theoretical and technological considerations relating
to the definition and realization of scales and units.</p>

<p>These various theoretical and statistical assumptions form the
basis for the construction of one or more models of the measurement
process.  Unlike mathematical theories of measurement, where the term
“model” denotes a set-theoretical structure that
interprets a formal language, here the term “model”
denotes an abstract and local representation of a target system that
is constructed from simplifying
assumptions.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#17" name="note-17">17</a>]</sup>
 The relevant target system in this case
is a measurement process, that is, a system composed of a measuring
instrument, objects or events to be measured, the environment
(including human operators), secondary instruments and reference
standards, the time-evolution of these components, and their various
interactions with each other. Measurement is viewed as a set of
procedures whose aim is to coherently assign values to model
parameters based on instrument indications. Models are therefore seen
as necessary preconditions for the possibility of inferring
measurement outcomes from instrument indications, and as crucial for
determining the content of measurement outcomes. As proponents of
model-based accounts emphasize, the same indications produced by the
same measurement process may be used to establish different
measurement outcomes depending on how the measurement process is
modeled, e.g., depending on which environmental influences are taken
into account, which statistical assumptions are used to analyze
noise, and which approximations are used in applying background
theory. As Luca Mari puts it,
</p><blockquote><p> any measurement result reports information that is
meaningful only in the context of a metrological model, such a model
being required to include a specification for all the entities that
explicitly or implicitly appear in the expression of the measurement
result. (2003: 25)
</p></blockquote><p> Similarly, models are said to provide the
necessary context for evaluating various aspects of the goodness of
measurement outcomes, including accuracy, precision, error and
uncertainty (Boumans 2006, 2007a, 2009, 2012b; Mari 2005b).</p>

<p>Model-based accounts diverge from empiricist interpretations of
measurement theory in that they do not require relations among
measurement outcomes to be isomorphic or homomorphic to observable
relations among the items being measured (Mari 2000). Indeed,
according to model-based accounts relations among measured objects
need not be observable at all prior to their measurement (Frigerio et
al. 2010: 125). Instead, the key normative requirement of model-based
accounts is that values be assigned to model parameters in a coherent
manner. The coherence criterion may be viewed as a conjunction of two
sub-criteria: (i) coherence of model assumptions with relevant
background theories or other substantive presuppositions about the
quantity being measured; and (ii) objectivity, i.e., the mutual
consistency of measurement outcomes across different measuring
instruments, environments and 
models<sup>[<a href="notes.html#18" name="note-18">18</a>]</sup>
 (Frigerio et al.  2010; Teller 2013b;
Tal forthcoming-b). The first sub-criterion is meant to ensure that
the <em>intended</em> quantity is being measured, while the second
sub-criterion is meant to ensure that measurement outcomes can be
reasonably attributed to the measured <em>object</em> rather than to
some artifact of the measuring instrument, environment or
model. Taken together, these two requirements ensure that measurement
outcomes remain valid independently of the specific assumptions
involved in their production, and hence that the context-dependence
of measurement outcomes does not threaten their general
applicability.</p>

<h3><a id="ModMeaEco">7.2 Models and measurement in economics</a></h3>

<p>Besides their applicability to physical measurement, model-based
analyses also shed light on measurement in economics. Like physical
quantities, values of economic variables often cannot be observed
directly and must be inferred from observations based on abstract and
idealized models. The nineteenth century economist William Jevons,
for example, measured changes in the value of gold by postulating
certain causal relationships between the value of gold, the supply of
gold and the general level of prices (Hoover and Dowell 2001:
155–159; Morgan 2001: 239). As Julian Reiss (2001) shows,
Jevons’ measurements were made possible by using two models: a
causal-theoretical model of the economy, which is based on the
assumption that the quantity of gold has the capacity to raise or
lower prices; and a statistical model of the data, which is based on
the assumption that local variations in prices are mutually
independent and therefore cancel each other out when averaged. Taken
together, these models allowed Jevons to infer the change in the
value of gold from data concerning the historical prices of various
goods.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#19" name="note-19">19</a>]</sup></p>

<p>The ways in which models function in economic measurement have led
some philosophers to view certain economic models as measuring
instruments in their own right, analogously to rulers and balances
(Boumans 1999, 2005c, 2006, 2007a, 2009, 2012a; Morgan 2001). Marcel
Boumans explains how macroeconomists are able to isolate a variable of
interest from external influences by tuning parameters in a model of
the macroeconomic system. This technique frees economists from the
impossible task of controlling the actual system. As Boumans argues,
macroeconomic models function as measuring instruments insofar as they
produce invariant relations between inputs (indications) and outputs
(outcomes), and insofar as this invariance can be tested by
calibration against known and stable facts.</p>

<h3><a id="PsyModConVal">7.3 Psychometric models and construct validity</a></h3>

<p>Another area where models play a central role in measurement is
psychology. The measurement of most psychological attributes, such as
intelligence, anxiety and depression, does not rely on homomorphic
mappings of the sort espoused by the Representational Theory of
Measurement (Wilson 2013: 3766). Instead, psychometric theory relies
predominantly on the development of abstract models that are meant to
predict subjects’ performance in certain tasks. These models are
constructed from substantive and statistical assumptions about the
psychological attribute being measured and its relation to each
measurement task. For example, Item Response Theory, a popular
approach to psychological measurement, employs a variety of models to
evaluate the validity of questionnaires. Consider a questionnaire that
is meant to assess English language comprehension (the
“ability”), by presenting subjects with a series of yes/no
questions (the “items”). One of the simplest models used
to validate such questionnaires is the Rasch model (Rasch
1960). This model
supposes a straightforward algebraic relation—known as the
“log of the odds”—between the probability that a
subject will answer a given item correctly, the difficulty of that
particular item, and the subject’s ability. New questionnaires
are calibrated by testing the fit between their indications and the
predictions of the Rasch model and assigning difficulty levels to each
item accordingly.  The model is then used in conjunction with the
questionnaire to infer levels of English language comprehension
(outcomes) from raw questionnaire scores (indications) (Wilson 2013;
Mari and Wilson 2014).</p>

<p>The sort of statistical calibration (or “scaling”)
provided by Rasch models yields repeatable results, but it is often
only a first step towards full-fledged psychological measurement.
Psychologists are typically interested in the results of a measure not
for its own sake, but for the sake of assessing some underlying and
latent psychological attribute. It is therefore desirable to be able
to test whether different measures, such as different questionnaires
or multiple controlled experiments, all measure the <em>same</em>
latent attribute. Such testing is known as “construct
validation”.  A construct is an abstract representation of the
latent attribute intended to be measured, and
</p><blockquote><p> reflects a hypothesis […] that a variety of
behaviors will correlate with one another in studies of individual
differences and/or will be similarly affected by experimental
manipulations. (Nunnally &amp; Bernstein 1994: 85)
</p></blockquote><p> Constructs are denoted by variables in a model
 that predicts which correlations would be observed among the
 indications of different measures if they are indeed measures of the
 same attribute. Such models involve substantive assumptions about
 the attribute, including its internal structure and its relations to
 other attributes, and statistical assumptions about the correlation
 among different measures (Campbell &amp; Fiske 1959; Nunnally &amp;
 Bernstein 1994: Ch. 3; Angner 2008).</p>

<p>Several scholars have pointed out similarities between the ways
models are used to standardize measurable quantities in the natural
and social sciences. For example, Mark Wilson (2013) argues that
psychometric models can be viewed as tools for constructing
measurement standards in the same sense of “measurement
standard” used by metrologists. Others have raised doubts about
the feasibility and desirability of adopting the example of the
natural sciences when standardizing constructs in the social
sciences. As Anna Alexandrova (2008) points out, ethical
considerations bear on questions about construct validity no less
than considerations of reproducibility. Such ethical considerations
are context sensitive, and can only be applied piecemeal. Nancy
Cartwright and Rosa Runhardt (2014) make a similar point about
“Ballung” concepts, a term they borrow from Otto Neurath
to denote concepts with a fuzzy and context-dependent scope. Examples
of Ballung concepts are race, poverty, social exclusion, and the
quality of PhD programs. Such concepts are too multifaceted to be
measured on a single metric without loss of meaning, and must be
represented either by a matrix of indices or by several different
measures depending on which goals and values are at play (see also
Cartwright and Bradburn 2010). In a similar vein, Leah McClimans
(2010) argues that uniformity is not always an appropriate goal for
designing questionnaires, as the open-endedness of questions is often
both unavoidable and desirable for obtaining relevant information
from subjects.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#20" name="note-20">20</a>]</sup>
 These insights highlight the
interdependence between epistemic, pragmatic and ethical
considerations characteristic of the standardization of constructs in
the social sciences.</p>

<h2><a id="EpiMea">8. The Epistemology of Measurement</a></h2>

<p>The development of model-based accounts discussed in the previous
section is part of a larger, “epistemic turn” in the
philosophy of measurement that occurred in the early 2000s. Rather
than emphasizing the mathematical foundations, metaphysics or
semantics of measurement, philosophical work in recent years tends to
focus on the presuppositions and inferential patterns involved in
concrete practices of measurement, and on the historical, social and
material dimensions of measuring. The philosophical study of these
topics has been referred to as the “epistemology of
measurement” (Mari 2003, 2005a; Leplège 2003; Tal
forthcoming-b). In the broadest sense, the epistemology of measurement
is the study of the relationships between measurement and
knowledge. Central topics that fall under the purview of the
epistemology of measurement include the conditions under which
measurement produces knowledge; the content, scope, justification and
limits of such knowledge; the reasons why particular methodologies of
measurement and standardization succeed or fail in supporting
particular knowledge claims, and the relationships between measurement
and other knowledge-producing activities such as observation,
theorizing, experimentation, modelling and calculation. In pursuing
these objectives, philosophers are drawing on the work of historians
and sociologists of science, who have been investigating measurement
practices for a longer period (Wise and Smith 1986; Latour 1987:
Ch. 6; Schaffer 1992; Porter 1995, 2007; Wise 1995; Alder 2002;
Galison 2003; Gooday 2004; Crease 2011), as well as on the history and
philosophy of scientific experimentation (Harré 1981; Hacking
1983; Franklin 1986; Cartwright 1999). The following subsections
survey some of the topics discussed in this burgeoning body of
literature.</p>

<h3><a id="StaSciPro">8.1 Standardization and scientific progress</a></h3>

<p>A topic that has attracted considerable philosophical attention in
recent years is the selection and improvement of measurement
standards.  Generally speaking, to standardize a quantity concept is
to prescribe a determinate way in which that concept is to be applied
to concrete 
particulars.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#21" name="note-21">21</a>]</sup>
 To standardize a measuring instrument is
to assess how well the outcomes of measuring with that instrument fit
the prescribed mode of application of the relevant concept.
<sup>[<a href="notes.html#22" name="note-22">22</a>]</sup> 
The term “measurement standard” accordingly has at least
two meanings: on the one hand, it is commonly used to refer to
abstract rules and definitions that regulate the use of quantity
concepts, such as the definition of the meter. On the other hand, the
term “measurement standard” is also commonly used to refer
to the concrete artifacts and procedures that are deemed exemplary of
the application of a quantity concept, such as the metallic bar that
served as the standard meter until 1960. This duality in meaning
reflects the dual nature of standardization, which involves both
abstract and concrete aspects.</p>

<p>In <a href="#OpeCon">Section 4</a> it was noted that
standardization involves choices among nontrivial alternatives, such
as the choice among different thermometric fluids or among different
ways of marking equal duration.  These choices are nontrivial in the
sense that they affect whether or not the same temperature (or time)
intervals are deemed equal, and hence affect whether or not statements
of natural law containing the term “temperature” (or
“time”) come out true.  Appealing to theory to decide
which standard is more accurate would be circular, since the theory
cannot be determinately applied to particulars prior to a choice of
measurement standard. This circularity has been variously called the
“problem of coordination” (van Fraassen 2008: Ch. 5) and
the “problem of nomic measurement” (Chang 2004: Ch. 2). As
already mentioned, conventionalists attempted to escape the
circularity by positing <em>a priori</em> statements, known as
“coordinative definitions”, which were supposed to link
quantity-terms with specific measurement operations. A drawback of
this solution is that it supposes that choices of measurement standard
are arbitrary and static, whereas in actual practice measurement
standards tend to be chosen based on empirical considerations and are
eventually improved or replaced with standards that are deemed more
accurate.</p>

<p>A new strand of writing on the problem of coordination has emerged
in recent years, consisting most notably of the works of Hasok Chang
(2001, 2004, 2007) and Bas van Fraassen (2008: Ch. 5; 2009, 2012).
These works take a historical and coherentist approach to the problem.
Rather than attempting to avoid the problem of circularity completely,
as their predecessors did, they set out to show that the circularity
is not vicious. Chang argues that constructing a quantity-concept and
standardizing its measurement are co-dependent and iterative tasks.
Each “epistemic iteration” in the history of
standardization respects existing traditions while at the same time
correcting them (Chang 2004: Ch. 5). The pre-scientific concept of
temperature, for example, was associated with crude and ambiguous
methods of ordering objects from hot to cold. Thermoscopes, and
eventually thermometers, helped modify the original concept and made
it more precise. With each such iteration the quantity concept was
re-coordinated to a more stable set of standards, which in turn
allowed theoretical predictions to be tested more precisely,
facilitating the subsequent development of theory and the construction
of more stable standards, and so on.</p>

<p>How this process avoids vicious circularity becomes clear when we
look at it either “from above”, i.e., in retrospect given
our current scientific knowledge, or “from within”, by
looking at historical developments in their original context (van
Fraassen 2008: 122). From either vantage point, coordination succeeds
because it increases coherence among elements of theory and
instrumentation. The questions “what counts as a measurement of
quantity <em>X</em>?” and “what is
quantity <em>X</em>?”, though unanswerable independently of each
other, are addressed together in a process of mutual refinement. It is
only when one adopts a foundationalist view and attempts to find a
starting point for coordination free of presupposition that this
historical process erroneously appears to lack epistemic justification
(2008: 137).</p>

<p>The new literature on coordination shifts the emphasis of the
discussion from the definitions of quantity-terms to
the <em>realizations</em> of those definitions. In metrological
jargon, a “realization” is a physical instrument or
procedure that approximately satisfies a given definition (cf. JCGM
2012: 5.1).  Examples of metrological realizations are the official
prototypes of the kilogram and the cesium fountain clocks used to
standardize the second. Recent studies suggest that the methods used
to design, maintain and compare realizations have a direct bearing on
the practical application of concepts of quantity, unit and scale, no
less than the definitions of those concepts (Tal
forthcoming-a; Riordan 2014).</p>

<h3><a id="TheLadMea">8.2 Theory-ladenness of measurement</a></h3>

<p>As already discussed above (Sections <a href="#ModBasAccMea">7</a>
and <a href="#StaSciPro">8.1</a>), theory and measurement are
interdependent both historically and conceptually. On the historical
side, the development of theory and measurement proceeds through
iterative and mutual refinements. On the conceptual side, the
specification of measurement procedures shapes the empirical content
of theoretical concepts, while theory provides a systematic
interpretation for the indications of measuring instruments. This
interdependence of measurement and theory may seem like a threat to
the evidential role that measurement is supposed to play in the
scientific enterprise.  After all, measurement outcomes are thought to
be able to test theoretical hypotheses, and this seems to require some
degree of independence of measurement from theory. This threat is
especially clear when the theoretical hypothesis being tested is
already presupposed as part of the model of the measuring
instrument. To cite an example from Franklin et al. (1989: 230):
</p><blockquote><p> There would seem to be, at first glance, a vicious
circularity if one were to use a mercury thermometer to measure the
temperature of objects as part of an experiment to test whether or not
objects expand as their temperature increases.
</p></blockquote><p> Nonetheless, Franklin et al. conclude that the
circularity is not vicious. The mercury thermometer could be
calibrated against another thermometer whose principle of operation
does not presuppose the law of thermal expansion, such as a
constant-volume gas thermometer, thereby establishing the reliability
of the mercury thermometer on independent grounds. To put the point
more generally, in the context of local hypothesis-testing the threat
of circularity can usually be avoided by appealing to other kinds of
instruments and other parts of theory.</p>

<p>A different sort of worry about the evidential function of
measurement arises on the global scale, when the testing of entire
theories is concerned. As Thomas Kuhn (1961) argues, scientific
theories are usually accepted long before quantitative methods for
testing them become available. The reliability of newly introduced
measurement methods is typically tested against the predictions of the
theory rather than the other way around. In Kuhn’s words,
“The road from scientific law to scientific measurement can
rarely be traveled in the reverse direction” (1961: 189). For
example, Dalton’s Law, which states that the weights of elements
in a chemical compound are related to each other in whole-number
proportions, initially conflicted with some of the best known
measurements of such proportions. It is only by assuming
Dalton’s Law that subsequent experimental chemists were able to
correct and improve their measurement techniques (1961: 173). Hence,
Kuhn argues, the function of measurement in the physical sciences is
not to test the theory but to apply it with increasing scope and
precision, and eventually to allow persistent anomalies to surface
that would precipitate the next crisis and scientific revolution. Note
that Kuhn is not claiming that measurement has no evidential role to
play in science. Instead, he argues that measurements cannot test a
theory in isolation, but only by comparison to some alternative theory
that is proposed in an attempt to account for the anomalies revealed
by increasingly precise measurements (for an illuminating discussion
of Kuhn’s thesis see Hacking 1983: 243–5).</p>

<p>Traditional discussions of theory-ladenness, like those of Kuhn,
were conducted against the background of the logical
positivists’ distinction between theoretical and observational
language. The theory-ladenness of measurement was correctly perceived
as a threat to the possibility of a clear demarcation between the two
languages.  Contemporary discussions, by contrast, no longer present
theory-ladenness as an epistemological threat but take for granted
that some level of theory-ladenness is a prerequisite for measurements
to have any evidential power. Without some minimal substantive
assumptions about the quantity being measured, such as its amenability
to manipulation and its relations to other quantities, it would be
impossible to interpret the indications of measuring instruments and
hence impossible to ascertain the evidential relevance of those
indications. This point was already made by Pierre Duhem (1906:
153–6; see also Carrier 1994: 9–19). Moreover,
contemporary authors emphasize that theoretical assumptions play
crucial roles in correcting for measurement errors and evaluating
measurement uncertainties. Indeed, physical measurement procedures
become <em>more</em> accurate when the model underlying them is
de-idealized, a process which involves increasing the theoretical
richness of the model (Tal 2011).</p>

<p>The acknowledgment that theory is crucial for guaranteeing the
evidential reliability of measurement draws attention to the
“problem of observational grounding”, which is an inverse
challenge to the traditional threat of theory-ladenness (Tal 2013:
1168). The challenge is to specify what role <em>observation</em>
plays in measurement, and particularly what sort of connection with
observation is necessary and/or sufficient to allow measurement to
play an evidential role in the sciences. This problem is especially
clear when one attempts to account for the increasing use of
computational methods for performing tasks that were traditionally
accomplished by measuring instruments. As Margaret Morrison (2009)
and Wendy Parker (forthcoming) argue, there are cases where reliable
quantitative information is gathered about a target system with the
aid of a computer simulation, but in a manner that satisfies some of
the central desiderata for measurement such as being empirically
grounded and backward-looking. Such information does not rely on
signals transmitted from the particular object of interest to the
instrument, but on the use of theoretical and statistical models to
process empirical data about related objects. For example, data
assimilation methods are customarily used to estimate past
atmospheric temperatures in regions where thermometer readings are
not available. Some methods do this by fitting a computational model
of the atmosphere’s behavior to a combination of available data
from nearby regions and a model-based forecast of conditions at the
time of observation (Parker forthcoming). These estimations are then
used in various ways, including as data for evaluating
forward-looking climate models.  Regardless of whether one calls
these estimations “measurements”, they challenge the idea
that producing reliable quantitative evidence about the state of an
object requires observing that object, however loosely one
understands the term
“observation”.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#23" name="note-23">23</a>]</sup></p>

<h3><a id="AccPre">8.3 Accuracy and precision</a></h3>

<p>Two key aspects of the reliability of measurement outcomes are
accuracy and precision. Consider a series of repeated weight
measurements performed on a particular object with an equal-arms
balance. From a realist, “error-based” perspective, the
outcomes of these measurements are <em>accurate</em> if they are close
to the true value of the quantity being measured—in our case,
the true ratio of the object’s weight to the chosen
unit—and <em>precise</em> if they are close to each other. An
analogy often cited to clarify the error-based distinction is that of
arrows shot at a target, with accuracy analogous to the closeness of
hits to the bull’s eye and precision analogous to the tightness
of spread of hits (cf. JCGM 2012: 2.13 &amp; 2.15, Teller 2013a:
192). Though intuitive, the error-based way of carving the distinction
raises an epistemological difficulty. It is commonly thought that the
exact true values of most quantities of interest to science are
unknowable, at least when those quantities are measured on continuous
scales. If this assumption is granted, the accuracy with which such
quantities are measured cannot be known with exactitude, but only
estimated by comparing inaccurate measurements to each other. And yet
it is unclear why convergence among inaccurate measurements should be
taken as an indication of truth. After all, the measurements could be
plagued by a common bias that prevents their individual inaccuracies
from cancelling each other out when averaged. In the absence of
cognitive access to true values, how is the evaluation of measurement
accuracy possible?</p>

<p>In answering this question, philosophers have benefited from
studying the various senses of the term “measurement
accuracy” as used by practicing scientists. At least five
different senses have been identified: metaphysical, epistemic,
operational, comparative and pragmatic (Tal 2011: 1084–5). In
particular, the epistemic or “uncertainty-based” sense of
the term is metaphysically neutral and does not presuppose the
existence of true values. Instead, the accuracy of a measurement
outcome is taken to be the closeness of agreement among values
reasonably attributed to a quantity given available empirical data and
background knowledge (cf. JCGM 2012: 2.13 Note 3; Giordani &amp; Mari
2012). Thus construed, measurement accuracy can be evaluated by
establishing robustness among the consequences of models representing
different measurement processes.</p>

<p>Under the uncertainty-based conception, imprecision is a special
type of inaccuracy. For example, the inaccuracy of weight measurements
is the breadth of spread of values that are reasonably attributed to
the object’s weight given the indications of the balance and
available background knowledge about the way the balance works and the
standard weights used. The imprecision of these measurements is the
component of inaccuracy arising from uncontrolled variations to the
indications of the balance over repeated trials. Other sources of
inaccuracy besides imprecision include imperfect corrections to
systematic errors, inaccurately known physical constants, and vague
measurand definitions, among others (see <a href="#RolModMea">Section
7.1</a>).</p>

<p>Paul Teller (2013b) raises a different objection to the error-based
conception of measurement accuracy. He argues against an assumption he
calls “measurement accuracy realism”, according to which
measurable quantities have definite values in reality. Teller argues
that this assumption is false insofar as it concerns the quantities
habitually measured in physics, because any specification of definite
values (or value ranges) for such quantities involves idealization and
hence cannot refer to anything in reality. For example, the concept
usually understood by the phrase “the velocity of sound in
air” involves a host of implicit idealizations concerning the
uniformity of the air’s chemical composition, temperature and
pressure as well as the stability of units of measurement. Removing
these idealizations completely would require adding infinite amount of
detail to each specification. As Teller argues, measurement accuracy
should itself be understood as a useful idealization, namely as a
concept that allows scientists to assess coherence and consistency
among measurement outcomes <em>as if</em> the linguistic expression of
these outcomes latched onto anything in the world. Precision is
similarly an idealized concept, which is based on an open-ended and
indefinite specification of what counts as repetition of measurement
under “the same” circumstances (Teller 2013a: 194).</p>
