<h1>Latin American Feminism</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Wed Dec 12, 2018</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
Latin American feminism, which in this entry includes Caribbean
feminism, is rooted in the social and political context defined by
colonialism, the enslavement of African peoples, and the
marginalization of Native peoples. Latin American feminism focuses on
the critical work that women have undertaken in reaction to the forces
that created this context. At present, the context is dominated by
neoliberal economic policies that, in the environment of
globalization, have disproportionally impacted the most vulnerable
segments of society. Against this political backdrop, Latin American
feminism is grounded in the material lives of people, often women, as
it explores the tensions engendered by the confluence of histories
that generate relationships among gender, citizenship, race/ethnicity,
sexuality, class, community, and religion.</p>

<p>
Latin American feminism broadly encompasses multiple positions, many
of which are in tension with each other. As a result, many refer to
Latin American ‘feminisms’ in the plural. The diversity of
feminisms is owed to the various regions and their histories which
demanded social, cultural, governmental, and organizational
transformations in their own capaticies. Hence, the present discussion
of the general concept of <em>Latin American feminism</em>
methodologically necessitates historical sensitivity to apprehend the
intimate relationship between the development of different ideas and
the heterogeneous political conditions that give rise to them.</p>

<p>
In the U.S., tracing the history of Latin American feminism and its
ideas is an urgent task. While growing interest in the broader Latin
American philosophy calls for increased textual representation and
access, the role that women have played in the evolution of Latin
American philosophical ideas has been largely neglected. Yet, there
exists a wealth of critical feminist ideas for theories of identity,
politics, and culture.</p>

<h2 id="HistGeneLatiAmerFemi">1. History: A Genealogy of Latin American Feminism</h2>

<h3 id="LatiAmerFemiOrigPre20thCent">1.1 Latin American Feminist Origins (Pre 20<sup>th</sup> Century)</h3>

<p> 
Most historical genealogies of Latin American feminism trace their
origins to the social movements beginning in the 1960s and 1970s
centered around women’s liberation. However, feminist ideas in
Latin America are much older than those which have been documented as
part of feminist political action. The origins of Latin American
feminist ideas can be found in reflections on conditions of otherness
that emerge as a result of colonialism and in critiques of norms that
render the category of man the entry point for humanity. By the 60s
and 70s, feminism in Latin America had a firmly rooted history
concerned with articulating difference and alterity from a
non-dominant perspective (Gargallo 2004: 80).</p>

<p>
There are lacunas in Latin American feminist genealogy as the writings
of non-white women from the 19<sup>th</sup> and early 20<sup>th</sup>
centuries (and earlier) are seldom found in written form given that
many of them were illiterate and their stories were not textually
documented. Their ideas and histories were orally transmitted, and
current local oral traditions account for them (Gargallo 2010:
12a). For instance, the colonial resistance of Baraúnda, wife
of Garifuna leader Satuyé, is legendary for her people; her
memory travels in songs sung by Garifuna women of Honduras and Belize.
Similarly, the story of Anacaona, Taino chief (<em>cacica</em>) of
Jaragua Hispañola, is one of colonial resistance; prior to her
execution she was offered clemency in return for becoming a concubine
for a Spaniard, and her refusal and subsequent death solidified her
legendary status which is immortalized in songs from Haiti, Dominican
Republic, and Puerto Rico. The stories of Indigenous women of these
times continue to be shared orally through myth, songs, and proverbs,
and contribute to the foundations of Latin American feminist thought
(Gargallo 2010: 14a).</p>

<p>
One of the earliest documented writers in the Latin American feminist
tradition comes from the 17<sup>th</sup> century. Arguing in favor of
the educational and intellectual rights of women, Juana Inés
María del Carmen Martínez de Zaragoza Gaxiola de Asbaje
y Ramírez de Santillana Odonojú recognized by many as
Juana Ines de la Cruz or Sor Juana of Mexico (1651–1695) was a
self-educated scholar of the Baroque period whose writings have
garnered quite a bit of philosophical attention as part of the Latin
American philosophical canon. She was well known during her lifetime
as evidenced by multiple publications of her work. However, by the
second half of the 18<sup>th</sup> century, her fame diminished as
attention to Baroque poetry declined. In 1951, her work recovered
attention with the publication of her complete works (Gargallo 2009:
419).</p>

<p> Juana Ines de la Cruz was one among many feminist writers who
advocated for social and cultural change, including the role of women.
Teresa Margarida da Silva e Orta of Brazil (1711–1793) was the
first woman in the Portuguese speaking world to publish a novel and
the first Brazilian-born person to edit a book in Europe. She
advocated for the autonomy of the Indigenous and the rights of women
in science (Gargallo 2004: 80). Flora Tristán of Perú
(1803 –1844) argued for women’s equality and its important
relationship to workers’ rights (Gargallo 2004: 80). Argentinian
abolitionist Juana Manso (1819–1875) detailed education and
philosophical instruction as a route to the moral and intellectual
emancipation of women. This position was taken up at the end of the
century by figures like Rita Cetina Gutiérrez of Mexico
(1846–1908) and Visitación Padilla of Honduras
(1882–1960) (Gargallo 2009: 418). Cetina Gutiérrez
founded La Siempreviva in Mérida, Mexico’s first secular
school for poor girls and an art college for young women. She is cited
as one of Mexico’s first feminists who promoted secular
education of women and fought for their self-determination. Padilla
founded the Sociedad Cultural Feminina, which promoted access to
education, especially for women.</p>

<p>
The existence of early Latin American feminist ideas was not attended
to until years after their inception. The impact of ideas centering on
women’s rights to intellectual and educational life, equality,
and workers’ rights were not immediate since they were not given
importance in their respective contexts. During the feminist movements
of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, many of these figures reemerge as part
of a Latin American feminist theoretical landscape (Gargallo 2004:
81). Early Latin American feminist ideas come to be evaluated through
historical memory that gives weight to the claim that Latin American
feminist ideas existed prior to the women’s movements of the
1960s and 1970s. </p>

<h3 id="LatiAmerFemiIdeaEarl20thCent">1.2 Latin American Feminist Ideas of the Early 20<sup>th</sup> Century </h3>

<p>
Feminist ideas from the early 20<sup>th</sup> century are
transnational. Ideas move with pushes for social change. Hence, a key
issue for contemporary Latin American feminist writers is the
importance of tracking the movement of ideas and reminding us that
ideas migrate and reconfigure depending on their contexts. The
intersection between women’s ideas about resistance and the
ideas that could lead to social transformation were not necessarily
understood as feminist in their times. More often than not,
women’s ideas in regards to justice, equality, and political
change converged with other political projects that focused on
improving the poor working class’s conditions and not specifically
women’s conditions. Their ideas for social change were molded into
general claims about access to education and transformation of
laboring material conditions. Ideas that are now coded as feminist are
identified as such in retrospect, but in order to do them justice,
they need to be accounted for in their historicity.</p>

<p> The Mexican Revolution (1910–1920) had a profound impact on
the development of feminist ideas (Gargallo 2004: 82). Most notably,
the revolution focused on education, and in this political landscape,
feminist ideas had the historical impact of influencing the thoughts
and actions of women in Mexican society (Gargallo 2004: 82). In 1915,
Salvador Alvarado became governor of the Yucatán and functioned
as a vehicle for social and political change until 1918 when he was
called to return to military duty. He supported a feminist movement in
the region initiated by Rita Cetina Gutiérrez in 1870, noted
earlier as one of Mexico’s earliest feminists and founder of the
Siempreviva. Moreover, his tenure in office gave room and support for
women’s political activism in the region. The first two feminist
congresses in the history of Mexico were held in Mérida in
January and November of 1916, giving floor to discussions on the right
to vote and political participation, abortion and contraception, as
well as education (Gargallo 2004: 83). By 1923, the socialist party of
the Yucatán had three women deputies and one alternate
(Gargallo 2004: 84).</p>

<p>
Given the impact of the Mexican Revolution, it is no surprise that
some of the first feminist ideas to reach historical identification
are found in its wake. Nevertheless, feminist ideas stretched beyond
Mexico and across Latin America and the Caribbean. In 1880, women
abolitionists in Brazil published a newspaper titled <em>A
familia</em> and argued for changes in dress norms. In 1910, Argentina
witnessed the first Feminist International Congress which fought for
peace, education, and social participation (Gargallo 2004: 85). In
1912, women in Columbia declared the defense of civil rights of
married women. In 1916, women in Panamá founded Club Ariel and
Centro de Cultural Feminina whose motto centered on virtue and
nationhood and supported intellectual and physical education as well
as the political life of women. In 1924, Visitación Padilla
denounced the presence of U.S. marine military infantry in Honduras
and Central America in the <em>Boletín de la Defensa
Nacional.</em> She founded the Círculo de Cultura Femenina
which supported the education of women and resisted North American
military intervention during the Second Honduran Civil War (1924). In
1928, women of Ecuador sued the state demanding the right to vote and
received it one year later (Gargallo 2004: 86).</p>

<p>

Luisa Capetillo (1879–1922) exemplifies the convergence between
feminist ideas and ideas concerning broader social
transformation. Born in Arecibo, Puerto Rico, Capetillo was
home-schooled and secured a job as a reader in cigar-making factories,
reading to workers and transferring ideas to workers as they rolled
cigars. Capetillo’s employment as a reader served as an
important locale from which workers developed a consciousness of trade
unions, socialism, anarchism, and women’s rights (Ruiz 2016:
6). Although readers were typically men, it was not uncommon to find
women in cigar factories as the cigar-making industry modernized and
became the second national industry in the first decades of the
20<sup>th</sup> century (Ramos 29). Hence, it is not accidental that
some of the first feminist ideas of Puerto Rico emerged in cigar
factories and in the proletariat presses significantly before the
suffrage movement later in the century (Ramos 1992: 30).
Capetillo’s feminist ideas are grounded in her class politics
that saw emancipation occurring at the nexus between labor empowerment
and gender equality (Ruiz 2016: 13). Although often heralded as the
first feminist writer of Puerto Rico and the first woman to ever
publish a book about women in Puerto Rico, Capetillo’s work most
importantly shows how early 20<sup>th</sup> century Latin American
feminist ideas and writers were very much grounded in the lived
material conditions of their times. In the case of Capetillo, her
feminist anarchism brewed at the core of her understandings of
worker’s emancipation as a woman who herself labored in the
trenches of modernity.</p>

<p>
Early 20<sup>th</sup> century Latin American feminist history
concludes with women’s suffrage. 1870–1947 is generally
considered the pivotal years of women’s suffrage (Gargallo 2004:
94). However, to view this slice of history as merely centered on
suffrage misrepresents the multiplicity of feminist ideas and
activities developed during the time. These years also witnessed the
push for social transformation oriented around ideas of equality and
justice that included, but were not limited to, the right to vote. The
push for equality framed women’s insistance on public access to
education, which impacted not just women but the impoverished as
well. The call for a more just social order framed how women were
thinking about their locale in resistance to military intervention as
well as labor movements. Hence, the ideas that emanate from this
period are multidimensional. The era is identified as closing out with
the accomplishment of suffrage. However, the right to vote emerged at
different times throughout the region owing to the diversity of local
politics. For instance, Ecuador was the first country in South America
to enfranchise women in 1929. That same year, Puerto Rico enfranchised
literate women and in 1935, gave the vote to all women. Uruguay
followed shortly after in 1932, Cuba in 1933, and El Salvador in 1939.
However, the suffrage movement stagnated in other countries: women
were enfranchised in Nicaragua and Perú in 1955, and only in
1961 did Paraguay give women the vote.</p>

<h3 id="YearSile1950">1.3 The Years of Silence (1950–1970)</h3>

<p> Coined by Julieta Kirkwood of Chile as the years of silence, the
years spanning from 1950–1970/1980s saw women (mostly middle
class) increasing their political presence by participating in popular
social movements and political parties (Kirkwood 1986: 70). However,
their social and political participation lacked explicit feminist
demands. Although not a strict set of dates, the years of silence
lasted well into the 1980s for some parts of Latin America (e.g.,
Chile); these years, the time of baby boom and populism, were
politically rife in post-World War II Latin America. It was also a time
characterized by McCarthyism which precipitated the U.S. intervention
in Guatemala and the Dominican Republic with intentions of warding off
communism (Gargallo 2004: 94). These years also witnessed the fall of
the Somoza dictatorship in Nicaragua in 1956 as well the rise of
conflict and military regimes in countries like Colombia, Argentina,
and Chile. Hence, political mobilization took place around the
changing landscape of Latin America, and middle-class women
participated, but their explicit role in these movements is
complicated by the fact that their presence and impact were not
readily documented (Ungo Montenegro 2000: 45). Notwithstanding, the
years of silence were not quiet on pages. Women during these years
were literarily active and produced texts that privileged their
position which was theoretically underappreciated because of their
literary style (Gargallo 2004: 95).</p>

<p>
The relationship between literature and philosophy has been explored
as part of the Latin American philosophical tradition. For instance,
one position holds that the Latin American literary tradition of essay
writing contains insights that can ameliorate the troubles of Latin
American philosophy at large (Pereda 2006: 196). Nevertheless, the
points of literary departure for many Latin American philosophers are
seldom women, although Latin American women in the middle of the
20<sup>th</sup> century wrote amply about their identities in
relationship to gender, race, ethnicity, and nationality (Gargallo
2004: 97). It is important to appreciate that not all women’s
writing during this time pushed for social change. Some narratives
played into patriarchy and machismo, forced marriage, and social
isolation. At the same time, some women presented narratives that
exposed doubts and resistances to the patriarchal ordering of the
world (Gargallo 2004: 97). Unfortunately, women writers of this time
are often folded into literary traditions hindering their recognition
as thinkers and theorists. One notable example is Rosario Castellano
of Mexico.</p>

<p>
In 1950, at the age of 25, Castellano defended her master’s
thesis in philosophy at Universidad Nacional Autónoma de Mexico
(UNAM). The project, titled <em>Sobre cultura feminina</em>, explored
women’s role in the production of culture (Gargallo 2004: 89). She was
a prolific writer. However, Castellano is largely remembered as a
literary figure and a poet. It was not until 1974 (after her death),
that the publication of her most famous work <em>El Eterno
Feminino</em> was recognized as theoretically rich speaking on themes
of gender, ethnicity, and nationhood. Today, she is recognized as a
leading voice in the feminist movement of Mexico, her work arguing for
the construction of a feminine subjectivity that defies the identity
imposed by patriarchal cultural norms. As a result, her work has aided
in establishing a different vision of political life for women in
Mexico (Gargallo 2004: 90).</p>

<p>
The 1950s–1970s was a fervent time of women’s writing
across Latin America. Antonia Palacios of Venezuela wrote <em>Ana
Isabel, una niña decente</em> (1949), Castellanos of Mexico
wrote <em>Balún-Canán</em> (1957), and Albalucía
Ángel of Colombia wrote <em>Estaba la pájara pinta
sentada un verde limón</em> (1975). Further notable examples
include the Mexican poet Enriqueta Ochoa whose published works span
1947–2008 and Marvel Moreno, one of the most influential female
writers of Columbia. In the 1980s, Moreno broke through the literary
mold of her times marked by the work of Gabriel García Marquez
with the publication of <em>Algo tan feo en la vida de una
señora bien</em> (1980). The protagonists of the book, who are
women, serve as vehicles for the exploration of life in a patriarchal
society. Moreno placed value on providing a genealogy of women as her
protagonists (e.g., the daughter, the mother, the grandmother)
reflecting the importance of transgenerational communication amongst
women. Thus, some argue her works provide a thematic thread of
rebellion that runs through the lives of women and unites them in
their histories of resistance to patriarchal social orders (Gargallo
2004: 106).</p>

<p>
While dubbed the “years of silence”, the work of women
writers during this period did find voice through literature and
poetry. Their theoretical reflections were subsequently appreciated
with the resurgence of feminism in the later decades.</p>

<h3 id="IdeaMoveLatiAmerFemiLate20th1970">1.4 Ideas of a Movement: Latin American Feminism of the late 20<sup>th</sup> (1970–1990)</h3>

<p> The years spanning 1970 to 1990 were marked with important social
and political transformation for women in Latin America amidst complex
political backdrops. Transitions from military regimes and processes
of democratization as well as peace negotiations provide the context
in which women’s mobilization emerges across Latin America. The
plurality of political conditions gave way to the development of
diverse feminist ideas. The feminism of this time, also commonly
referred to as neofeminism, was particularly attuned to the body
(Bartra 2001: 1). Grounded in the pre-1970 history of Latin American
feminism, neofeminism strove toward the validation of women’s
rights, but specifically centered on women’s freedom over their
bodies. The neofeminist perspective translated into mobilizing on
issues of abortion, motherhood, sexual autonomy, rape, and abuse
(Bartra 2001: 1).</p>

<p> Contemporary Latin American feminism surged during politically
somber times, especially under the presence of military regimes or
nominal democracies that repressed civil liberties often in the name
of national security (Saporta Sternbach et al. 1992: 397). Hence, as a
social movement, Latin American feminism was born with an
intrinsically oppositional and occasionally clandestine character
(Saporta Sternbach et al. 1992: 397). As international organizations
attempted to influence national health and population policies and
governments attempted to control women’s bodies, the foci of
Latin American feminisms have grown more complex (Saporta Sternbach,
Navarro-Aranguren, Chuchryk, Alvarez 1992: 403).</p>

<p>
One notable characteristic of feminism during this time is the
recognition of womanhood as a shared status. Women during these
decades found identity in their status of womanhood and their shared
condition that differentiated them from men (Gargallo 2004: 88). They
rejected “man” as the standard model around which their
political action organized. The push for social and political
transformation focused less on equality (e.g., the right to vote) and
more on a desire for liberty, denying notions of femininity as
subordinate to masculinist constructions of humanity (Gargallo 2004:
111). Latin American feminism of the late 20<sup>th</sup> century
encouraged encounters between women that recognized them as subjects,
with their own histories, and on their own terms (Gargallo 2004:
88). </p>

<h4 id="N197">1.4.1 The 1970s</h4>

<p> Amid military regimes, the 1970s were characterized by a
mobilization of women that took motherhood to be a political
category. In some countries, women resisted state repression as
mothers of those who had disappeared at the hands of the state
(Gargallo 2004: 113). The CoMadres (Comité de Madres) of El
Salvador formed in 1977 to investigate the disappearance of missing
relatives. They photographed the bodies of people found in the streets
of El Salvador in order to aid in identification. In the same year,
the Asociación Madres de Plaza Mayo in Argentina organized as
mothers to search for their disappeared children as a result of state
terrorism enacted by the military dictatorship that spanned the years
of 1976–1983. In Mexico, critical stances on motherhood were
initiated by the neofeminist group Mujeres en Acción Solidaria
(MAS) which protested the sanctifying myth of motherhood on the eve of
Mother’s Day at El Monumento a la Madre (a monument honoring
mothers) in Mexico City. They resisted the myth that a woman’s
role in society should be circumscribed to motherhood
(Gutiérrez 2012: 42). The protest continued in the years that
followed.</p>

<p> The push to disconnect motherhood from womanhood set the stage for
a separation between the reproductive capacities of women’s
bodies and their sexual health (Gargallo 2004: 114). Claims to the
decriminalization of abortion emerged under access to reproductive
rights that sought to give women control over their own bodies. Thus,
the right to abort was defended on the grounds of a woman’s
right to individual autonomy (Gargallo 2004: 114). In 1976, El
Movimiento Nacional de Mujeres, along with other autonomous feminist
groups, organized one of the first congresses on the decriminalization
of abortion that maintained the interruption of pregnancy as a
woman’s decision that should be made accessible through all
institutions of public health (Gargallo 2004: 114). In the years that
followed, feminists in Mexico used a variety of symbolic strategies in
their fight for the legalization of abortion. They dressed in black to
publicly mourn the women who had died as a result of clandestine
abortions (Garagallo 2004: 115). Today, abortion remains tiered in
access throughout Latin America. Countries such as Chile, Nicaragua,
Dominican Republic, and El Salvador prohibit abortion entirely, even
under conditions where it would save a woman’s life. In
countries like Mexico, Guatemala, Panamá, and Venezuela
abortion is legal only under conditions where it saves the life of the
woman. However, in countries like Argentina, Costa Rica, and Ecuador
abortion is legal to the extent that it preserves the physical health
of the woman. In some countries, conditions of rape are understood as
part of the preservation of physical health (e.g., Argentina) while in
others the extension is made to allow abortion to the extent that it
preserves the mental health of the woman (e.g., Colombia). Cuba,
Uruguay, and Puerto Rico are places that have legalized abortion
without restriction based on reason for access. Although the battle
for access to abortion began during the 1970s, it continues to be a
contested political issue especially in places where access is
entirely denied or burdened by other factors: physical health, mental
health, or life preservation. Moreover, in places like Puerto Rico,
the question of abortion is intricately bound up with histories of
forced sterilization making the issue more politically charged and
complex.</p>

<p> As a time characterized by state repression, the 1970s were also a
time of awakening for many women who demanded a need for social change
(Bartra 2001: 6). Latin American feminists not only challenged
patriarchy by defining themselves as distinct political subjects, but
also challenged male paradigms of domination expressed through the
militaristic and counterinsurgent state. The reality of state
repression made Latin American feminisms distinct in their ability to
unveil the patriarchal foundations of militarism and institutionalized
violence (Saporta Sternbach et al. 1992: 397). The intimate
relationship between patriarchy and military state repression is best
elucidated by the intersection between Chilean feminist activism and
the push for democratization in Julieta Kirkwood’s famous
phrase: “Democracia en el pais, en la casa y en la cama”,
which translates to: “Democracy in the nation, in the house, and
in the bed” (Kirkwood 1986: 14). Latin American feminism that
grew out of the 1970s was linked to activism that saw
the roots of authoritarian regimes in patriarchal oppression that
trickled into the “private” sphere. By the late 1970s,
opposition movements joined by women from all walks of life emerged
throughout Latin America, defying their historical exclusion from
political life (Saporta Sternbach et al. 1992: 398–399).</p>

<p> The heterogeneity of contemporary Latin American feminism can be
traced to the diverse political conditions from which its activism
emerged. Nevertheless, a theme can be found in the commitment to
change the social relations of production, including
reproduction. Throughout the region, women collectively participated
in movements to engender human rights by seeking better access to
education, healthcare, urban services as well as resistance to
military state repression (Saporta Sternbach et al. 1992: 401). Latin
America’s economic dependence and political repression during
these years set the stage for a distinct militant feminist activism
that would continue to spread into the decade of the 1980s.</p>

<h4 id="N198">1.4.2 The 1980s</h4>

<p> The 1980s was characterized by the expansion of feminist theory
and practice. Feminists started focusing on specialized activities
that deepened their vision of politics, culture, and society. The
number of feminist magazines, films, video collectives
increased. Furthermore, the number of centers for rape victims and
abused women as well as feminist health collectives, lesbian groups,
and other specifically gendered projects grew during this time
(Saporta Sternbach et al. 1992: 404). As feminists increased their
activities in feminist projects, they began creating more civil
society organizations or NGO’s (non-government organizations)
(Millán 2014: 154).</p>

<p> One of the most important events to mark the 1980s was the first
Encuentro Feminista Latinoamericano y del Caribe held in
Bogotá, Colombia. The Encuentros (Encounters), as they came to
be called in short, served as regional critical forums for debates
about feminist politics and the movement’s overall relationship
to social justice in Latin America and the Caribbean. The attendees of
the first Encuentro came together on the heels of geographic and
political isolation with a desire to carve out a path for autonomous
politics. Over the years, the Encuentros extended the map of feminist
politics (Saporta Sternbach et al. 1992: 405). </p>

<p>
The first Encuentro convened in Bogotá, Coloumbia, over a
course of four days in July 1981; more than two hundred women from
over fifty organizations attended. The region-wide gathering brought
together many strands of feminism, creating a heterogeneous movement
with considerable tensions and conflicts. For instance, during the
planning stages of the meeting, heated discussions emerged between
independent/autonomous feminists often identified as
<em>autónomas</em> or <em>feministas</em>, and militant
political feminists affiliated with political parties (e.g.,
socialist) often referred to as <em>militantes.</em> Independent
feminists expressed concern over the possibility that feminists
aligned with political parties might try to impose sectarian agendas
diverting attention from issues central to feminist organizing (e.g.,
reproductive rights) (Saporta Sternbach et al. 1992: 407).</p>

<p>
The most widely attended session of the 1981 Encuentro,“Feminism
and Political Struggle”, focused on the autonomy of the feminist
movement, double militancy (concurrent participation in a political
party and the feminist movement), and feminism and imperialism
(Saporta Sternbach et al. 1992: 408). The response to the session
exemplified the diversity of ideas involved in the feminist struggle.
All of the participants agreed that women suffer a specific oppression
by virtue of their womanhood, which is exacerbated by class.  Their
agreement translated into particular demands: equal pay, end of the
double work day, the right to safe abortion as well as the right to
choose motherhood (Saporta Sternbach et al. 1992: 408). Furthermore,
it was clear that the political parties of the time across the region
were not centering these demands in their claims for social
change. Two notable positions were developed in response to the
session. The first position maintained that neither capitalism nor
socialism on their own could end women’s
oppression. Women’s liberation needed to be articulated outside
the networks of party affiliated activism that could make demands for
complete social transformation to alter oppressive relations. They
held that severing the <em>militantes</em> and the <em>feminista</em>
was to misunderstand feminist politics, which is a comprehensive
political praxis. The focus of feminist political activism should be
in targeted feminist organizations since the revolutionary Left tended
to place men in the center (Saporta Sternbach et al. 1992: 409). The
second position held that feminism on its own could not be
revolutionary because of its inherent commitment to socialism. They
thought feminism should be an organic outgrowth of socialist struggles
that could not be separated from the struggles against class
oppression. Double militancy, on this view, was a practical
difficulty, but one that could be overcome (Saporta Sternbach et
al. 1992: 409).</p>

<p>
The 1981 Encuentro reflected the larger social and political
conditions out of which Latin American feminisms were evolving. The
conflict between the <em>feministas</em> and the <em>militantes</em>
exemplified the divergences in Latin American feminisms during the
1980s. However, it also reflected the genesis of Latin American
feminist ideas in women’s political activism. So, although mired
in conflict, the Encuentros signaled the intimate ties between ideas
regarding gender struggle and the political conditions that give rise
to those ideas.</p>

<p> The Second Encuentro, held in Lima, Perú in July 1983,
thematically focused on patriarchy, a controversial topic given its
association with imperialist American and European feminisms. The
Encuentro reflected a shift in feminist claims identifying that sexism
was not just an outcome of capitalism, but rather shaped by a
patriarchal sex-gender system that functioned autonomously (Saporta
Sternbach et al. 1992: 412). Moreover, the Second Encuentro
experienced a public response to the visibility of lesbian identity
within Latin American feminisms forcing many heterosexual women to
confront their homophobia (Saporta Sternbach et al. 1992: 412). The
meeting also pushed the topic of racism, which resurfaced in
subsequent years both in the Encuentros and the larger landscape of
Latin American feminist ideas that launched staunch critiques on the
omission of race and racism from dominant feminist conversations.</p>

<p> The growth of the Encuentros testified to the growth of feminisms
throughout the region. The Fourth Encuentro held in Taxco, Mexico
(1987) brought together 1,500 women. Nearing the end of the decade,
the Fourth Encuentro reflected increased complexity in Latin American
feminist politics, which was made palpable by the recurrence of the
question: “Who is a feminist?” (Saporta Sternbach et
al. 1992: 421). The discussion reflected divergences in what
constituted feminist politics and whether general community organizing
was sufficient to characterize feminist organizing, particularly where
community groups were controlled by the church or local political
parties (Saporta Sternbach et al.  1992: 421). Nevertheless, a key
point remains that when the Encuentros began in 1981, feminism was
still a “dirty word”, but by 1987, feminism had gained
legitimacy and was validated in Leftist political circles, notably in
the Nicaraguan revolution (Saporta Sternbach et al. 1992: 421). The
Encuentros continued to demonstrate the diverse growth of Latin
American feminisms as a thriving and expansive map of ideas grounded
in different strands of political activism. Although they continue to
meet to the present day, the Encuentros of the 1980s were significant
developments which reflected an evolving social movement with tense
but important relationships among revolutionary struggles, feminist
goals, and claims for social justice.</p>

<p> At the end of the 1980s, as the HIV/AIDS epidemic peaked, sexual
politics became increasingly conservative. Sex, once viewed as a
political act that could blur the private-public divide and subvert
traditional gender roles, became fraught with difficulty. Young
feminists came of age at a time when sexual education shifted toward
narratives of the risks of sex and not its disruptive political
potential (Gargallo 2004: 123–4). Furthermore, the closing of
the decade saw the continued linking between feminism and NGO’s
that would be characteristic of the institutionalization of feminism
in the 1990s. For some, institutionalization entailed
de-radicalization of feminist politics in Latin America and the
Caribbean (Gargallo 2004: 125).</p>

<h4 id="N199">1.4.3 The 1990s</h4>

<p>
Latin American feminisms during the 1990s are characterized by a focus
on gender equality and non-discrimination within the confines of
institutions governed by neo-liberal policies (Coba &amp; Herrera
2013: 18). As a result, it is referred to as a liberal feminism not
grounded in resistance, but rather in its adaptation to a neoliberal
infrastructure that was ushered in throughout the region.
Neoliberalism had a distinct impact on women’s activism and the
development of feminist ideas. Women were one of the most affected
groups with the shifts in economic policies, and the phrase
“feminization of poverty” accurately captured the
detrimental impact on women’s lives. Many women joined the
menial labor force (e.g., <em>maquilas</em>, agricultural labor)
without any labor rights or access to fair wages (Gargallo 2004:
117).</p>

<p> At the same time, feminist activists started coupling their
efforts with organizations that targeted policy change in favor of
women and operated with a distinct language about violence, health,
and human rights in tune with liberal politics (Gargallo 2004:
125). The concept of the autonomous individual reigned as the
explanatory framework for development. Under the umbrella of
individuality, people are responsible for their own survival and
development which are dependent on their initiative in a market
economy (Coba &amp; Herrera 2013: 18). In this context, the activist
politics that had once characterized feminist organizing shifted to
less radicalized organizational institutions. A substantial portion of
the feminist movement that transitioned to institutions did so without
critiquing economic policies and neoliberalism (Bastian Duarte 2012:
157). Institutionalized feminists started working alongside
governments and agencies, which prioritized change in public policy
but did not seek to investigate the roots of inequality that justified
the need for policy change. Moreover, conditions emerged where
NGO’s were able to offer specialized resources for women. In
doing so, they promoted far-reaching gender discourse that was
standardized with the universalizing criteria of the United
Nations. With their hands tied with donors, these organizations were
not necessarily mindful of the priorities of local organizations or
their populations (Bastian Duarte 2012: 157). As a result, the
infrastructure of institutionalization exacerbated existing power
imbalances across ethnic and class lines.</p>

<p> Among the institutions participating in the institutionalization
of feminisms was the academy. From the late 1980s well into the 1990s,
Women’s Studies Programs started organizing throughout
universities. Moreover, the study of feminist philosophy more broadly
started finding its way into curricula as the activism of earlier
decades pressured universities to support women and gender studies
(Schutte &amp; Femenías 2010: 400). The decade marked the
professionalization of feminism. Feminism, which had once been an
orienting force of activism, became employable and profitable (Bartra
2001: 11). However, this is not to discredit the tremendous effort
that the development of university programs required. As university
programs became institutional fixtures, they also served as counter
hegemonic spaces where resistance could be facilitated.</p>

<p>
The 1990s also saw the initiation of journals and formal publications.
In 1990, <em>Debate Feminista</em> was launched by Marta Lamas and
remains one of the most impactful journal publications on intellectual
feminisms. In 1991, <em>La Correa Feminista</em> was created to bring
together the thoughts of autonomous and radical feminists. It ran
until 1998 when the editors self-assessed the journal’s goals
and decided to launch <em>Creatividad Feminista</em>, an online
publication which ran until 2008 when its daughter site,
<em>MamaMetal</em>, was created. Finally, <em>La Doble Jornada</em>
sprang as a feminist supplement to <em>La Jornada</em>, Mexico’s
leading leftist newspaper, and ran from 1986–1998 (Millán
2014: 156).</p>

<p> During this time, Latin American feminisms began to privilege the
use of the category “gender” or the “gender
perspective” over patriarchy as the conceptual framework from
which to talk about the situation of women. The shift to use language
of gender is largely owed to the importation of North American
feminist ideas. In the Latin American context, Gayle Rubin’s
work received substantial attention as evidenced by numerous
translations as well as by extensive commentary on its complex
understanding of the sex-gender system (Gargallo 2004: 21). However,
it is important to note that the term was already being deployed by
scholars and carried with it a variety of connotations (Schutte 1998b:
88).</p>

<p>
Gender was translated to Spanish as <em>género</em>, which to
many was a poor translation. <em>Género</em>, which translates
to English as species or kind, traveled to the Latin American context
via academic publishing and sparked debate on its aptness to map onto
the feminist conditions of the region. The gender perspective, which
employs the paradigm of radical individualism characteristic of the
decade, comes to stand alongside the concept of empowerment as one
that can specifically target women’s needs. The language of
gender and empowerment were used by the United Nations as part of
their universalizing goals for women during the 1995 World Conference
on Women held in Beijing, a moment which marked mounted tensions
around the de-politicization of Latin American feminisms (Bastian
Duarte 2012: 157).</p>

<p>
The use of the themes of gender and empowerment was further deployed
by newly democratized states. Feminist activists found themselves in a
different relationship to the state as it adopted the language of
gender. Once a vehicle of repression, especially under military rule,
Latin American feminists now had to contend with a drastically
different engagement with the role of the state, one that had co-opted
the very terms of a movement that was initiated in opposition to its
repression. Newly formed liberal democracies understood women as
potential markets for modernizing and development, thus deploying the
language of gender and empowerment (Alvarez 1998: 271). However, the
way in which the state managed poverty as part of its modernizing
mission was mired in individualism with little focus on
communities.</p>

<p>
The political and economic transitions influenced the development of
feminist ideas. Activism became institutionalized and the feminist
movement grew in various directions. As the 90s came to a close, what
started out as a spontaneous social movement with radical ideas about
patriarchy, militarism, and democratization found its way into the
halls of institutions and organizations that stifled feminist
activism. The institutionalization of feminism was so profound that
its political promise seemed lost. However, as the opening of the
21<sup>st</sup> century demonstrates, this was not the case.
Institutionalization was not without critique, and the early 2000s
marked the emergence of new voices that took liberal dominant
feminisms to task by focusing on anti-neoliberal and de-colonial
critique which began to call out the hegemonic practices of Latin
American feminisms.</p>

<h3 id="DissVoicLatiAmerFemiIdea21stCent">1.5 Dissident Voices: Latin American Feminist Ideas of the 21<sup>st</sup> Century</h3>

<p>
The institutionalization of feminism came under scrutiny in the 2000s.
Autonomous feminists argued that as feminist practices continued to
normalize, they failed to account for the inequities among women. As
the century came to a close, critiquing (marginal) voices emerged,
arguing that liberal feminisism tends to overlook difference,
inequity, and exclusion amongst women located in vastly different
social and cultural locations (Coba &amp; Herrera 2013: 18). The
Eighth Encuentro (November 1999) held in Juan Dolio, Dominican
Republic, reflected the presence of these emerging voices as dominant
feminisms “Others”: Indigenous women, Afro-descended
women, and lesbians whose position relative to the Encuentros had been
marginal. The claims of inclusivity and diversity of the Encuentros
were brought under critical scrutiny as they argued that their
identities had been obscured under liberal feminism, which took gender
to be characteristic of a foundational unity for the encounters. These
dis-encounters (<em>desencuentros</em>) formed the basis of new social
and political critique that characterized the emerging voices.</p>

<p>
In response to the neoliberal shifts of the 80s and the 90s, the early
21<sup>st</sup> century brought with it an anti-neoliberal discourse
to Latin American feminisms that was further fed by de-colonial and
anti-patriarchal stances. Amongst these were positions that argued for
the decolonization of universal feminism by taking account of the axis
of race, ethnicity, and sexuality in the articulations of identity.
The 2000s were also marked by an attempt to dry out the
institutionalization of gender. At the same time, there has not been
an impetus to reconfigure a social movement in the wake of neoliberal
shifts (Coba &amp; Herrera 2013: 19).</p>

<p> We are currently witnessing an emergence of ideas that are
starting to reshape how we think about Latin American
feminisms. However, the project of reconfiguration is still very much
in process. In this context, critical ideas about race and the history
of racism have entered mainstream concerns predominantly voiced from
Afro-descended standpoints (Curiel 2007). Further, lesbian feminists
have brought forth criticisms of liberal feminism for not only paying
less attention to race and racism, but also for centering
heteronormativity as part of the feminist agenda. One notable position
holds that there is an inextricable link between lesbianism and
feminism insofar as the adoption of a self-conscious feminism entails
shifting engagement with dominant masculinity on all levels and this
includes the realm of desire (Espinosa Miñoso 2011:
403). Indigenous feminists have also unfolded critical insights in the
relationships among community, the state, and political
belonging. Their ideas about the balance between ethnic belonging and
critiques of sexism are a call to dominant liberal feminism to rethink
its concept of culture and community that would otherwise risk
reducing Indigenous women to targets of development (Bastian Duarte
2012: 164). The emergence of these critical ideas takes liberal
feminism to task by calling out the dominance of middle class,
white/mestiza, heteronormative model for feminist projects as not only
exclusionary, but also profoundly harmful. Notably, most of these
positions take decolonization as an orienting project and maintain
that the roots of racism and heterosexism are rooted in colonialism whose impact continues to plague Latin America and the Caribbean.</p>

<p>
In 2007, GLEFAS: Grupo Latinoamericano de Estudio, Formacíon y
Acción Feminista was founded with the intention of creating a
space for dialogue within the lesbian and feminist movement in Latin
America and the Caribbean as well as with other social and land
struggle movements in the region. They self-describe as seeking to
produce political analysis from an anti-racist, anti-military,
anti-colonial, anti-capitalist lesbian feminist perspective. In line
with their philosophical vision, they published <em>Tejiendo de otro
mundo: Feminismo, epistemología y apuestas decoloniales en Abya
Yala</em> (2014) as an outgrowth of a colloquium held in Chapel Hill,
North Carolina in 2012. The book brings together a diverse group of
contemporary voices that intervene on hegemonic understandings of
feminism in the region in order to make room for a collective that
appreciates the diversity of knowledges. Speaking from the margins,
the book takes as its central claim that decolonization is concomitant
with de-patriarchalization. Hence, it reflects a shift in contemporary
Latin American feminist writings that are paving the way for critical
considerations of capitalism, imperialism, democracy, and identity.
These new voices of dissent are changing the landscape of Latin
American feminisms with unique ideas that call for rethinking what it
means to be a feminist today.</p>

<h2 id="KeyIssuDeba">2. Key Issues and Debates</h2>

<h3 id="LatiAmerFemiAuto">2.1 Latin American Feminist Autonomy</h3>

<p> Autonomy is a foundational, albeit contested, concept in Latin
American feminisms. It is a foundational concept to the extent that
feminist identity has hinged on the conceptualization of autonomy.
However, how autonomy is defined has been widely debated as the term
has been deployed in varying capacities. Autonomy has been used
conceptually to forge alliances between women’s groups in the
region that seek to eradicate gender-based oppression. It has also
been used to avoid co-option by actors like political parties,
NGO’s, the state, and funding agencies. The result is a tension
between the retention of ideological and financial autonomy and the
widening of feminisms’ scope and impact. Thus, the varying use of
autonomy calls into question how it is being defined (Alvarez et al.
2003: 542).</p>

<p>
The history of feminist autonomy in Latin American feminism is rooted
in the activism of 1970s and 1980s where it was invoked in opposition
to militant feminists (<em>militante)</em> involved with the political
parties of the Left. Autonomy, in this context, was defined as
independence from any organization that understood the fight for
women’s liberation as a secondary goal. On the other side stood
those who took the fight for revolutionary social change as concurrent
with feminist involvement and advocated for double participation
(Alvarez et al. 2003: 543). The rise of the political Left in many
Latin American countries involved resistance to political regimes, and
the question of where dedication was rooted reflected the relationship
between feminism and the possibilities for social change. Feminist
activism revealed the way in which the negotiation of autonomy was and
continues to be an evolving concept. As the 1980s progressed with its
shifting political landscape, the idea of autonomous feminism came to
be redundant. Hence, an understanding of engaged autonomy emerged,
which maintained the importance of retaining a feminist stance while
negotiating or participating in social practice (Alvarez et al. 2003:
543). </p>

<p> The concept of autonomy surfaced throughout the Encuentros that
spanned the 1970s–1990s and further illuminated the question of
inclusion. If being autonomous entailed commitments to women’s
liberation, being autonomous also signals participation in a feminist
project. However, what the criteria of inclusion under the label of
feminisism is is contestable. As Latin American feminisms underwent
institutionalization, two logics characterized the problem of
inclusion.</p>

<p> The policy-advocacy logic argued for promoting feminist influenced
gender policy through governmental or non-governmental organizations.
On the other hand, the identity-solidarity logic distanced away from
formal institutions and remained centered on women’s movement
through the development of feminist ideas in community and politics
(Alvarez et al.  2003: 548). However, neither one of these necessarily
entailed the inclusion of all women as is demonstrated by contemporary
critiques of the hegemonic practices of Latin American feminisms that
failed to pay attention to the importance of race, class, ethnicity,
and sexuality in shaping subordination (Alvarez et al. 2003:
565). Cutting across these logics is the way in which inclusion in
feminism is contingent upon practice. How autonomy is understood
hinges upon an understanding of feminist practice, and those practices
are shaped by dynamics of inclusion and exclusion. Eventually,
autonomy would be re-defined through individual and collective
commitment to the transformation of women’s lives and society as
a whole (Alvarez et al. 2003: 557). At present, there is not a settled
definition of feminist autonomy, but rather a pluralism of
understanding that tracks a variety of proposals for understanding
feminist engagement and practices.</p>

<h3 id="PoliTranLoca">2.2 The Politics of Translation and Location</h3>

<p> Attention to North-South hemispheric relations has been one key
theoretical issue of Latin American feminism reflected in the ample
scholarship on the migration of ideas. Latin American feminisms, much
like Latin American philosophy, has shown concern over the
authenticity of ideas that have traveled from epistemic centers (e.g.,
U.S. and Europe). However, unlike Latin American philosophy, Latin
American feminisms have responded to this concern by developing
theories that attend to dynamics by which ideas travel and the way in
which ideas are re-negotiated and re-signified as they move across
locations. Generally, the claims about the ways in which ideas are
re-configured as they enter new contexts emerge over concerns about
the travel of ideas in a North-South direction, which not only remains
non-reciprocal, but further signals the centrality of North America
and Europe as the centers of knowledge production. Latin American
feminisms have critically argued against the general understanding
that ideas are formed in the “North” and travel to the
“South” (Connell 2014). In order to defend this position,
it is argued that the act of translating is itself a materially
situated political task that re-signifies ideas as they migrate into
varying contexts. The ideas that emerge in the Latin American context
are themselves unique to the circumstances that generate their
conditions of articulation. However, circumstance is not sufficient to
create uniqueness; rather, the processes of translation involved in
the movement of ideas across hemispheres shift meaning.</p>

<p> Translation can be understood as any act of description,
interpretation, or dissemination. It is always caught up in power
relations that are configured by the asymmetries between people,
languages, and region (Lima Costa 2014a: 20). In the context of the
Americas, the movement of ideas occurs across asymmetrical power
relations. Ideas encounter roadblocks and migratory checkpoints as
they attempt to cross borders (Lima Costa 2014a: 21). As a result,
dialogue across hemispheres mirrors the asymmetries of power and has
led to the mistaken notion that nothing originates from the Global
South, but rather is only imported into the region from the Global
North. Translation is made further complex by “theory
brokers” (e.g., academics, donors, feminist NGO’s) that
mediate the movement of ideas (Lima Costa 2014a: 25). As ideas move,
their meanings shift, and their transformation is contingent on the
culture or discipline that receives them (Lima Costa 2014a:
29). Hence, discursive migration is not neutral, and in the process,
location comes to frame how to understand the reconfiguration of
ideas. Thinking about translation through the matrix of discursive
migration illuminates the way in which difference and power play a
crucial role in how knowledge becomes legitimated across
difference.</p>

<p>
Placing translation at the center of feminist practices recognizes
that translation is both politically and theoretically indispensable
for feminist, antiracist, decolonial, and anti-imperial alliances
(Alvarez 2014: 1). Translation is framed as a translocal phenomenon
insofar as it does not involve a fixed location, but further links
geographies of power (e.g., national, local) with subject positions
(e.g., gender/sexual, ethnoracial) (Alvarez 2014: 2). In this
conceptual space, Latin America and the Caribbean are configured with
a heterogeneity of Latinidades within the United States and within
Latin America and the Caribbean that exist and move across multiple
border spaces (Alvarez 2014: 2). Identities are formed in the nexus
between borders, the spaces of intense confluence that characterize
the transmigrations across the region.</p>

<p>
Subjectivity is both place-based and mis- or dis-placed with the
movement of ideas. In this context, difference emerges as a rich
terrain from which to engage others. For some, the difference that
mediates speaking positions is always characterized by degrees of
incommensurability as we can never be fully transparent with each
other across conditions of alterity. However, the condition of
incommensurability is not sufficient to abandon translation, but
rather an imperative to hear others in and across their difference
(Schutte 1998a: 61).</p>

<p>
One method of navigating the conditions of incommensurability is
recognizing the complexity and diversity of speaking positions with
which we engage. The term <i>transloca</i> has been argued to aid in
elucidating such complexities of difference. Embodying both the
processes of translation (trans) and the material effects of location
(loca), the <i>transloca</i> highlights multiple dimensions that shape
conditions of difference (Alvarez 2014: 4). Following the claims about
translocation, <i>transloca</i> as a subject position attends to the
movement of bodies, text, capital, and theory along the North-South
axis as they produce new epistemologies for apprehending the
globalizing Americas (Alvarez 2014: 4). <i>Translocas</i> are world
traveling translators, cultural and political mediators, and hence
also agents of transculturation (Alvarez 2014: 8). The term is
intended to illuminate the way in which subjectivity is forged in and
through movement across hemispheres mediated by location and
translation. Attending to the dimensions of hemispheric movement
elucidates the conditions of alterity that generate
incommensurability, but also puts into focus the way translation
mediates the processes of identity formation. </p>

<p> The arguments in regard to discursive migration, translation, and
<i>translocas</i> further capture the links among Latin America, the
Caribbean, and the United States as part of an intertwined diaspora
(Alvarez 2014: 7). The intertwining is one that stretches in many
hemispheric directions and as a result, makes Latin/a America a
heterogeneous epistemic horizon. From Latinas in the United States to
Afro-Latinas in Latin America, the ideas produced at the borders and
nexus between, in, and through hemispheres are best understood by
appreciating practices of translation. Hence, to think through Latin/a
America as an epistemic locale, in its multidimensionality, requires a
politics of translation that can foster coalition building across
hemispheres in spite of alterity. If taken seriously, feminist
theories of translation demonstrate that ideas are products of
hemispheric locations, incommensurable with their predecessors (local
or imported). The discourses produced in Latin America and the
Caribbean are not only alternative re-configurations of ideas, but
also ruptures in political epistemic practices. They call into
question the notion that knowledge production is a naturalized feature
of particular places (Femenías 2007: 14). Thus, the traffic of
ideas generates new and diverse spaces from which to think about
locations of difference (Femenías 2007: 15).</p>

<h3 id="GendHemiCont">2.3 <em>Gender</em> in Hemispheric Context</h3>

<p>
Another key debate that has emerged as a part of the broader Latin
American feminist conversation on the politics of translation has been
over the use of the term <em>gender</em>, which, as previously noted,
entered the hemispheric frame with the translation of Gayle
Rubin’s scholarship into Spanish. Translated into Spanish as
<em>género</em>, whose direct translation is more akin to genre
or species, Latin American feminists have contested the legitimacy of
<em>gender</em> as a category of feminist analysis (Schutte &amp;
Femenías 2010: 403).</p>

<p>
Prior to the introduction of the term <em>gender</em>, feminists most
readily used the concept of <em>patriarchy</em> because it offered a
framework grounded in ideological and socioeconomic conditions that
allowed for articulating the cause of women’s oppression
(Schutte &amp; Femenías 2010: 403). In many ways,
<em>patriarchy</em> served as a glue of consciousness-raising in late
20<sup>th</sup> century women’s movements of Latin America,
helping connect women by identifying their shared subordinate status
under conditions of patriarchy.</p>

<p>
During the Second Encuentro in 1982 (Lima, Perú)
<em>patriarchy</em> was declared the foundational category from which
Latin American feminists sought to understand their realities. It was
deployed as an explanation for the subordination of women, but also
extended as an explanation for the conditions of compulsory
heterosexuality, repression, violence against women and children, the
prohibition of abortion, and varying forms of social injustice
(Gargallo 2004: 92). It was further linked into frameworks that sought
to identify the role of militarization and capitalism in the
oppression of women. Hence, it provided a methodological frame from
which to articulate claims about power, oppression, and domination
that united women on many fronts. <em>Patriarchy</em> was a conceptual
stronghold of Latin American feminism akin to what imperialism was to
national liberation struggles (Gargallo 2004: 92). It was
explanatorily powerful because it could account for complex realities
while also providing an explanation for the shared experiences of
women. Unfortunately, the explanatory power of the term was so
expansive that it rendered historical specificities opaque since
nothing could exist at its margins (Gargallo 2004: 92).</p>

<p>
Replacing the focus on patriarchy, the gender perspective
(<em>perspectiva de género)</em> or gender focus (<em>enfoque
de género)</em>, became the methodological framework from which
to talk to about women and women’s issues across Latin America.
Using <em>gender</em> as its foundational category instead of woman,
<em>gender</em> became a blanket term so user-friendly that anyone
could use it as a referent to women’s issues (Schutte &amp;
Femenías 2010: 404). The ease with which it was used entailed
the softening of radical militant critiques of patriarchy that had
characterized feminist theorization in earlier decades.
<em>Gender</em> was incorporated into public policy and social
programs by state and inter-governmental organizations reflecting the
way in which it could be taken up as part of the lexicon for even
policies not feminist-inspired (Lima Costa 2014a: 26). On the flip
side, the Vatican during its preparation for the 1995 Conference on
Women feared using the word <em>gender</em> as it might entail the
acceptance of homosexuality, the destruction of the patriarchal
family, and the dissemination of feminism (Lima Costa 2014a: 28).</p>

<p>
Although the movement of <em>gender</em> across hemispheres is far
from complete, it is important to recognize the way in which the
traffic of <em>gender</em> took place in and through material
conditions. One notable method of translating and migrating concepts
is through academic journals, and the debates on the uses of
<em>gender</em> have signaled broader reflections on how concepts come
to carry epistemic weight. The transnational citational market is one
key dimension in this process as who gets cited, where, and by whom
exposes the routes through which theories have traveled in global
contexts (Lima Costa 2014b: 142). In light of the conceptual travel
and use of <em>gender</em>, Latin American feminisms ask to consider
the way in which the global privileging of English as the linguistic
medium impacts what knowledge is allowed to circulate (Lima Costa
2014b: 142). Moreover, these reflections bring to the fore the fact
that English cannot be viewed as a transparent medium as its
privileged status sets the stage for what gets taken up as worth
translating in the first place. It should then be no surprise that
<em>gender</em> has traveled so far. Its traffic is a marker of the
imperative to create conditions of productive mis-translations that
create spaces for heterogeneous conceptual development (Lima Costa
2014b: 144). </p>

<h3 id="NegoCompIden">2.4 Negotiating Complex Identities</h3>

<p> Although gender has been a key focus of analysis, Latin American
feminist thought has also concentrated on the importance of accounting
for the complexity of identity. Conceptually, gender on its own is
insufficient to account for the complexities of identity. Notably,
Latin American feminisms have paid attention to the ways in which
class, race/ethnicity, and sexuality are necessary components for
understanding the lived experience of identity, which is never
conceptualized as pure nor one-dimensional (Feménias 2007:
16).</p>

<p>
The idea that class is a key dimension of women’s lives is one
that is rooted in Latin American feminist activisms of the late
19<sup>th</sup> and early 20<sup>th</sup> century. As formerly noted
in the history of Latin American feminism, women’s fights for
equality of this time were framed in terms of equitable access to
social goods (e.g., education). The impact of this push was the
transformation of the material lives of people living in poverty more
generally. Considerations for the importance of class conditions in
understanding the plight of women and the poor have been long rooted
in Latin American feminist ideas. Feminist projects concerned with the
advancement of women in civil society converged with labor movements
and anti-imperial resistance (e.g., Luisa Capetillo). This trend
re-emerged during resistance movements of the 1970s that aligned
feminist projects with revolutionary parties of the Left across Latin
America. As a result, attention to class dimensions has long been part
of the feminist methodology. However, this attention has not been
without fault. Contemporary theories from the work of Afro-descended
women have argued that the overwhelming attention paid to class has
come at the expense of analyzing the role that racism has played in
the marginalization and exclusion of African descended and Indigenous
populations (Curiel 2007).</p>

<p> The reflections on race/ethnicity of Latin American feminist
methodology are diverse as they demonstrate the racial heterogeneity
generated by the colonial condition. Colonialism not only initiated
contemporary understandings of race/ethnicity but generated the
conditions of racial formation under systems of exploitation and
subordination. Specifically, the colonial history of Latin America
entailed the subordination of Indigenous and Afro-descendant peoples
(Schutte &amp; Femenías 2010: 407). Economically, colonialism
entailed the enslavement and exploitation of these populations.
Culturally, colonialism ensured the imposition of a socio-symbolic
order that entrenched whiteness as a norm and cultural authority
(Schutte &amp; Femenías 2010: 407). Concurrently, norms of
gender and class emerge through the production of race, whose economic
impact is reflected through the linking between whiteness and class
ascension. Subsequently, nation building projects in Latin America and
the Caribbean were forged by political elites with patriarchal
ideologies mired in racism and classism. The impact of these
ideologies has entailed a racialized social stratification that
reflects the privilege of whiteness and leaves women disproportionally
affected (Curiel 2007: 98).</p>

<p>
Against this backdrop, feminist reflections on race/ethnicity have
sought to undermine the racism of national ideologies that have led to
their subordination and marginalization. One such ideology is that of
mestizaje which emerged as part of nation building projects throughout
Latin America and the Caribbean. Mestizaje favored the formation of a
racially mixed people, but came saturated with Eurocentrism and
privileged the whitening of the Americas. Mestizaje ensured structural
inequalities as it racialized class differences while maintaining
racism a myth. On the heels of these conditions, notable contributions
to the discussion on race/ethnicity in Latin America and the Caribbean
have come from Afro-descended and Indigenous women who have been
systemically marginalized in these social processes. They argue that
mestizaje functions as a sequel to colonialism that continues to
entail subordination and marginalization in social life (Curiel 2007:
98).</p>

<p>
Racialized women in Latin America and the Caribbean have also pointed
to the racism of dominant feminist methodology that took womanhood to
be a shared categorical status but dismissed the importance of the
specificities determined by race/ethnicity and class identity. In so
doing, the voices of racialized women have opened up new avenues for
contemporary critical feminist investigation. For instance,
Afro-descended women have shown how the methodologies of studying
women during colonial times detrimentally read the lives of enslaved
women one-dimensionally as solely victims of slavery, overlooking the
ways in which many participated in acts of resistance. Acts like the
waste of household goods or self-induced abortions to avoid the
enslavement of children are best understood as acts of domestic
marronage and need to be read as part of the history of Afro-descended
women in the Americas (Albert 2003). In this context, the call for a
more multidimensional analysis of racialized women also entails
demonstrating that for racialized women, the public and the private
spheres are not separate entities as hegemonic feminism purported
(Curiel 2016: 49). Hence, a call for the blackening of feminism has
emerged as a way of elucidating the relationship between racism and
sexism in order to better understand the histories of women throughout
the Americas (Carneiro 2005).</p>

<p>
Further, racialized women of Latin America and the Caribbean have
provided new constructive frameworks for conceptualizing racialized
and ethnic identities. One such attempt can be found in the
development of <em>Amefricanidad</em> a term coined by Afro-Brazilian
scholar Léila Gonsalez, that resists the use of
<em>Latinidad</em> because of its Eurocentric underpinnings much like
how mestizaje downplays the Indigenous and African dimension of Latin
America and the Caribbean (Curiel 2007: 99). Building on the use of
<em>Amefricanidad</em> or <em>Amefricanicity</em>, others have argued
for the use of the term as a privileged epistemology that enhances the
visibility of Afro-descended feminism in the region (Alvarez &amp;
Caldwell 2016: v). <em>Amefricanidad</em> tracks the importance of
African and Indigenous roots of identity, but also seeks to think from
within those identities as it pursues an intersectional approach to
racism, colonialism, and imperialism (Alvarez &amp; Caldwell 2016: v).
<em>Amefricanidad</em> tracks racialized identity, but at the same
time signals plurality in its capacity to capture the multiple
inheritances of Latin America and the Caribbean.</p>

<p>
By keeping the impact of the colonial condition at the center of
theory, contemporary Latin American and Caribbean feminists have also
critically evaluated norms of sexuality, a topic which dominant
liberal feminism long maintained at the margins. The lesbian movement
of Latin America and the Caribbean stems from mixed gender homosexual
organizations that were in dialogue with the feminist movement of the
late 20<sup>th</sup> century (Bastian Duarte 2012: 165). However, for
much of this time, discussions on sexual preference were set aside
within the liberal feminist agenda. Lesbian feminism, much like the
larger panorama of Latin American feminism, is heterogeneous.
Nevertheless, there is one common theoretical denominator: the
imperative to transform ideas and practices related to
heteronormativity, lesbianism, and gender relations (Bastian Duarte
2012: 169). At stake in the analysis of lesbian feminism is the way in
which heteronormativity permeates all aspects of lived experience,
including the intersections among sexuality, race/ethnicity, class,
and gender. For instance, Afro-descended lesbian feminists have linked
racism and sexism to heteronormativity by arguing that the obligatory
dimensions of heterosexuality are intimately bound up with the
reproduction of racist and sexist practices (Curiel 2016: 50).  Others
have argued that there is an intimate relationship between lesbianism
and feminism that hinges on the recognition that liberation for women
is founded in decentering patriarchy, which often involves
renegotiating relationships with men and masculinity on all levels
(Espinosa Miñoso 2011: 404).</p>

<p> Implicit in discussions of the complexity of identity is the
relationship between the individual and the collective. The
relationship between structural collective conditions and the
formation of individual identity attends to the ways in which human
beings are not isolated meaning makers. However, when the conditions
of meaning making reflect the heirlooms of colonialism, oppression,
patriarchy, or obligatory heterosexuality, the negotiations between
the individual and the collectives require tense
negotiations. Indigenous feminists have negotiated the political and
personal value of ethnic belonging with individual feminist claims
(Bastian Duarte 2012: 164). The liberal neofeminist movement has long
emphasized the importance of sexual and reproductive rights of women,
but while these issues may represent core aspects of women’s
lives, they do not represent core issues in Indigenous women’s
struggles.</p>

<p>
For instance, the topic of violence is one at the center of feminist
concerns of many political persuasions. However, from the perspective
of Indigenous feminism, violence is not just constructed in terms of
gendered violence but is also generated by those who have seized and
destroyed Indigenous lands (Bastian Duarte 2012: 163). Hence, an
understanding that projects violence solely centered on individuality
will not be sufficient to generate conditions of equality for
Indigenous feminists whose collective identities serve as the primary
method to preserve their cultural systems (Bastian Duarte 2012: 164).
The meaning of equality and justice for Indigenous feminists of Latin
America and the Caribbean follows the specificity of their politics,
which takes the role of the community as central to identity and hence
calls for new ways of thinking about the relationship between
individual feminist demands and collective transformation (Bastian
Duarte 2012: 165). Although not all Indigenous peoples of Latin
America and the Caribbean reside in their own communities as many have
migrated to more urban areas, it is important to appreciate the ways
in which community in a multifaceted sense operates as an important
feature of transformative projects.</p>

<h2 id="LatiAmerFemiPhil">3. Latin American Feminist Philosophy</h2>

<p>
Latin American Feminist Philosophy emerges at the nexus between theory
and practice. The social activism of the 20<sup>th</sup> century
fueled the production of theories that form the tradition of Latin
American feminist philosophy as well as its place in the academy.
However, the study of Latin American feminist philosophy remains
scarce and derelict (Gargallo 2015, Other Internet Resources). The
existence of Latin American feminist philosophers has been largely
denied, and the specificities of their theoretical contributions have
been erased under the sexist Eurocentric orientation of
philosophy. Recognition of their existence is a political act that
contests the dominant architecture of the history of
philosophy. Taking account of Latin American feminist philosophy
requires a historical and philosophical reconstruction that
understands the fact that women from Latin America and the Caribbean
have long been thinkers. The philosophical work that remains to be
done requires engagement with their ideas.</p>

<p>
Latin American feminist philosophy is political (Gargallo 2004: 41).
The ideas that pushed social transformation in the 20<sup>th</sup>
century movements are grounded in politics that recognized the
imperative for social change. The political dimension of Latin
American feminist philosophy is reflected in the fact that many Latin
American feminist philosophers were/are activists, and the span of
their thought often reflects their participation in resistance
movements. Resistance can mean many types of political projects, and
in the context of Latin American feminist philosophy, the act of
citing is understood as political because it works toward building a
philosophical canon that legitimizes the voices of women long excluded
from philosophical practice.</p>

<p>
Tracing a philosophical history of Latin American feminist thinkers is
a task that merits scholarly attention, and to date there is a lacuna
of resources. One major obstacle is linguistic as a lot of textual
sources have not been translated. Furthermore, the resources
themselves are not ample although some notable publications have been
made. The <em>Antología del pensamiento feminista
nuestroamericano: tomo 1 del anhelo a la emancipación</em>
(2010) and <em>Antología del pensamiento feminista
nuestroamericano: tomo 2 movimiento de liberación de las
mujeres</em> (2010) coordinated by Francesca Gargallo are some of the
first large-scale publications to anthologize Latin American and
Carribean feminist philosophical writings. It is a non-exhaustive
resource that testifies to the theoretical, argumentative, and
methodological contributions of Latin American and Caribbean feminist
writers spanning from the the 15<sup>th</sup> to 20<sup>th</sup>
century. As the anthology rescues writers often lost to the pages of
history, it also centers Latin America and the Caribbean as
<em>nuestra</em> or “our” America as the point of
theoretical departure. Thus, it enables a collective recognition of a
history of feminist thought that does not depend on North America or
Europe for its identity. The anthology further demonstrates that Latin
American feminist philosophical thought is hardly new. It is grounded
in a history of resistance to social and political conditions that
impeded the recognition of women as knowledge producers (Gargallo
2009: 418). It has been argued that early feminist philosophies are
some of the first systems of thought to account for the politics of
legitimacy whereby social conditions grant privilege to the epistemic
productions of one group in order to exclude and delegitimize the
voices of others (Gargallo 2009: 420). The critique of legitimacy is
one that follows Latin American feminist philosophy well into the
20<sup>th</sup> and 21<sup>st</sup> century.</p>

<p> For instance, Juana Inés de la Cruz (1651–1695), one
of the most cited writers of this tradition, advocated for the
intellectual life of women, which entailed denouncing norms of
hegemonic masculinity. Her image as a protofeminist writer has been
associated with lesbianism as she led a monastic life and in so doing,
resisted the dominance of masculinity (Gargallo 2009: 419). Her
existence as an intellectual defied the authority of her times and her
resistance is reflected in her writing.</p>

<p> A further example can be found in the thought of Luisa Capetillo
(1879–1922), which is rooted in her participation in labor
movements in Puerto Rico and the United States during her lifetime. As
a cigar factory reader, she was employed by the workers and functioned
as an intellectual and cultural intermediary by reading workers
everything from news to political theory. Capetillo became a reader at
a time when forty percent of the tobacco workers and eighty-seven
percent of the agricultural work force of Puerto Rico were illiterate
(Ramos 1992: 14). However, the presence of readers, like Capetillo,
made the tobacco labor force one of the most socially conscious (Ramos
1992: 21). Her activism drew intellectual support from European
anarchist philosophy that traveled to Puerto Rico through translations
of authors like Tolstoy, Dostoevsky, Diderot, Bakunin, Kropotkin,
Marx, and Nietzsche (Ramos 1992: 27). Capetillo made a mark on the
Puerto Rican labor movement, but she became a transnational migrant as
she was driven out of Puerto Rico by a government crackdown on
anarchists (Ruiz 2016: 3). In her short life of 42 years she would
come to reside in New York City, Ybor City, and La Habana as she
continued her activism by organizing labor strikes, arguing against
the institution of marriage, engaging in stylized resistance by
wearing men’s clothing, and publishing four books (Ramos 1992:
66). Capetillo’s most important contribution was producing ideas
rooted in a workers’ rights movement that moves across nations
and is itself inspired by the travel of ideas.</p>

<p> Philosophy as a field of study in Latin America and the Caribbean
is institutionalized and professionalized in the years spanning
1940–1960. Hence, it is no surprise that subsequently women gain
formal university education in philosophy. Matilde Carranza
(1892–1981) born in San Jose, Costa Rica was Costa Rica’s
first woman to receive a Ph.D. in philosophy. She attended the
University of Wisconsin and is also noted as one of the first women to
receive a doctoral degree from the university. Her philosophical
thought centered on the importance of education for social
transformation, which aligned with her anti-despotic and egalitarian
politics. However, her most notable impact was shattering the myth
that women were not apt for philosophy, thus paving the way for women
of other generations (Prada Ortiz 2013: 32–33). Ana Isabel
Alfaro (1944–1990) born in Alajuela, Costa Rica, studied
philosophy at the University of Costa Rica. Her philosophical
commitments centered on the role of education in national development
as she took education to be socially transformative. As a result,
Alfaro saw the role of the university as an integral part of social
change. Her commitments to the transformative powers of education were
methodologically rooted in interdisciplinarity and cultural
diversity. Notably, Alfaro placed importance on the creative power of
women within her philosophy of education, arguing for their creative
potential and reflecting this commitment in her political alliances
with poor women (Prada Ortiz 2013: 55).</p>

<p>
Following suit, Monelissa Lina Pérez Marchand, Victoria Junco
Posadas, Olga Victoria Quiroz Martínez, Rosa Krauze, Elsa
Cecilia Frost, Vera Yamuni, and María del Carmen Rovira Gaspar
entered academic philosophy in Mexico in the middle of the
20<sup>th</sup> century through the seminars of José
Gaós (Gargallo 2015, Other Internet Resources). Notable among
these is Vera Yamuni (1917–2003) and Maria del Carmen Rovira,
who recognized the importance of doing philosophy from a Latin
American perspective with a keen eye toward the specificities of
women. Rovira would apply this methodology to historicism and Yamuni
to humanism (Gargallo 2009: 423). Yamuni is particularly important as
her work and place in the academy influenced many generations of
feminist philosophers. She was a transnational thinker born of
Lebanese parents in Costa Rica although she did most of her studying,
teaching, and writing in Mexico. Yamuni studied under Gáos and
would dedicate a part of her intellectual career to engaging with the
work of Gaós, notably critiquing his misogyny. She further
dedicated time to translate texts from English and Arabic to Spanish.
reflecting her commitment to create conditions of philosophical access
(Prada Ortiz 2013: 71). However, she is notably remembered as a
feminist thinker through her work on Safo, Virginia Woolf, and Simone
de Beauvoir, as well as her feminist analysis of the role of women in
the history of philosophy. Her writing conceptually explored sameness
and difference long before it became a hotbed of feminist
philosophical analysis in the 1990s (Prada Ortiz 2013: 87). Her
influence as a feminist philosopher is profound as she has been cited
as the first to introduce feminist philosophy in Mexico by her student
Graciela Hierro, who became an iconic figure of Latin American
feminist philosophy in the 1980s and 1990s (Prada Ortiz 2013: 83).</p>

<p> The social transformation of the 1970s and 1980s reverberated into
the field of philosophy. As women increasingly began to establish
themselves in the academy, their ideas developed. On the shoulders of
symbolic mothers and the politics of the times, Latin American
feminist philosophy began to proliferate as a diverse system of
thought that took feminist theorizing to be a form of politics.
However, the points of departure for analysis varied. Graciela Hierro,
student of Yamuni, developed a feminist ethics informed by
utilitarianism that explored the intimate relationship between ethics
and politics focused on liberation and pleasure. For Hierro,
women’s politics is one centered on making claims about the role
of women in a society where the condition of womanhood is understood
as a variant characteristic of human life (Hierro 1990). Hierro, much
like Yamuni and the women that came before them, functioned as a
symbolic philosophical mother to many as she heavily influenced a
generation of feminist scholars. Eli Bartra, a student of
Hierro’s, maintained that feminism is a theoretical current
dedicated to uncovering what it means to be a woman. For her, the
feminist project is political because feminism is a political
philosophy (Bartra 2001: 12). Diana Helena Maffía of Argentina,
influenced by Bartra, further maintains that feminism is both a
political position and a critical theory that lends itself toward the
revision of political ideals (Rietti &amp; Maffía 2005). Maria
Luisa Femenías, also writing from Argentina, maintains a link
between feminism and politics but takes Latin American feminism to be
characterized by its unique appreciation of the intersections among
gender, class, race/ethnicity, and religion as they collectively
forged conditions of existence (Femenías 2007). Urania Ungo
Montenegro of Panamá defines feminism as a political theory of
women that reflects the relationship between women and politics (Ungo
Montenegro 2000).</p>

<p> Although they diverge in their characterizations of the
relationship between feminism and politics, all of these positions
share a general understanding that to philosophically discuss Latin
American feminism is to engage in political theory in a way that
elucidates the diverse and complex relationships among women, gender,
and politics. This list is by no means exhaustive, and further figures
like Rosario Castellanos of Mexico and Celia Amorós of Spain
should not be forgotten as they influenced the positions developed by
these thinkers. Furthermore, philosophers like Ofelia Schutte, Cuban
born writing in the United States, have made notable contributions to
the landscape of Latin American feminist philosophy reminding readers
that the feminist tradition occupies a part of a wider tradition of
political liberation and theory of Latin America. All of these women
dared to be thinkers at times when being a Latin American woman in
philosophy was unheard of, and they have come to form the foundation
of a canon of thinkers that paved the way for new and emerging
voices.</p>

<p> Dissident voices of the early 2000s waged a decolonial critique
that came to characterize contemporary Latin American feminist
philosophical scholarship. Influenced by the pivotal contributions of
Maria Lugones (2007, 2008), contemporary decolonial Latin American
feminist scholarships has tackled eurocentrism, colonial
underpinnings, and omissions of identity in feminist philosophy.
Lugones was an integral voice in the formation of a decolonial
feminist tradition as she was the first scholar to articulate the
concept of the coloniality of gender. In conversation with the
scholarship of Peruvian Aníbal Quijano (2000), she maintained
that the modern sex/gender system is rooted in the colonial project
that imposes a dimorphic sex/gender system framed through
heteronormativity. Complementing Quijano, she maintains that the
colonial/modern gender system required the categorization of the human
and non-human and the invention of racial divisions of the human.
However, she critically adds that gender played an important role in
these relationships, a point Quijano overlooks. As a result, the
status of white women, existing along colonizing white men, operated
on a different nexus committed to the reproduction of their racialized
humanity. The peoples of the colonized world did not participate in
the modern gender system prior to its imposition. The import of this
argument is that gender and sexuality are co-constitutive of race and
are formed in and through the colonial project that sought to
subordinate colonized peoples. Hence, to theorize about gender entails
a look at the heirlooms of colonialism that built the possibilities of
the modern world through the categorization of people into racialized
gendered humanity. This critique problematizes any idea of shared
gender in womanhood because it fails to account for the racial and
class differences that cut across the formations of identities in the
Americas.</p>

<p>
One of the most notable and comprehensive texts that bring Latin
American decolonial voices together is <em>Tejiendo de otro modo:
feminism, espistemología y apuestas descoloniales en Abya
Yala</em> (2014b) edited by Yuderkys Espinosa Miñoso, Diana
Gómez Correal, and Karina Ochoa Muñoz. The book provides
a critical intervention in contemporary Latin American feminisms from
the diverse positions and experiences of women (Escobar 2014:
11). Rooted in de-colonial epistemic practices, the book reconceives
Latin America as <em>Abya Yala</em>, the Kuna (Indigenous people of
Panamá and Colombia) term for what colonizers termed
“America”.  <em>Abya Yala</em> translates as “land
of full maturity” or “land of vital blood” and is
taken as a methodological starting point for theorizing ways of
knowing through a de-colonial lens. The contributors adhere to the
claim that decolonization cannot occur without
de-patriarchialization. In other words, resistance to capitalism,
racism, homophobia, and all forms of domination related to our modern
social order has to incorporate strategies of de-patriarchialization
(Escobar 2014: 11). As such, the text brings to the fore the
importance of intersecting Latin American feminisms with decolonial
thought and exemplifies new emerging critical voices that contribute
to growth and proliferation.</p>

<p> The scholarship notably produces a Latin American feminist
genealogy committed to prioritizing the voices of those systematically
marginalized or ignored and decenters dominant white upper-middle
class feminisms that have failed to account for difference (Espinosa
Miñoso, Gómez Correal, &amp; Ochoa Muñoz, 2014a:
14). The sholarship is a further testament to the fact that no one
dominant category will solve the problem of unification (Espinosa
Miñoso et al. 2014a: 20). The project of decolonial feminisms
is not framed by privileging one category of analysis over another
(e.g., race over gender); rather, it proposes a systemic critique
focused on the conceptual framework of dominant Latin American
feminisms, calling attention to the ways it has reified classism,
sexism, racism, and heteronormativity. The project of decolonial
feminisms is a movement in process, but its core seeks to bring
together the productions of thinkers, intellectuals, feminist
activists, lesbian feminists, afro-descended, Indigenous, poor
mestiza, and allies committed to the historical recuperation of
anti-racist theory and practice from the epistemic position of Abya
Yala (Espinosa Miñoso et al. 2014a: 32).</p>

<p>
The Latin American decolonial feminist tradition has found influential
allies in the Latina feminist tradition of the United States. Latina/x
feminisms took shape during the 1960s and 1970s as part of a wide
range of political struggles seeking gender and social justice that
come to form a wide landscape of theories. The term <em>Latina/x</em>
is broad, but far from monolithic as it can capture a range of
identities (e.g., Afro-Latina, Afro-Caribbean, Nuyorican, Xicana). It
symbolically encapsulates identity conditions of migration,
immigration, and diaspora to the United States from countries in Latin
America and the Caribbean. Although Latina feminisms are a
wide-ranging field, they generally adhere to a system of thought that
attempts to unravel interlocking systems of oppression reflecting on
the conditions of borderlands, race/ethnicity, gender, sexuality,
immigration, and religion in unique ways. Most importantly, Latina
feminist theory pays close attention to lived experience and made
notable contributions to theories of identity that extend beyond the
borders of the United States. Here, figures like Gloria
Anzaldúa, Cherrie Moraga, Emma Perez, Juanita Ramos, Norma
Alarcón, Chela Sandoval, Mariana Ortega, Ofelia Schutte and
Maria Lugones have been of significance. Notably, the work of
Anzaldúa influenced Lugones’ conceptualization of the
coloniality of gender, which is at the centerfold of decolonial
feminist theory in both Latin America and the United States. Although
theories are always tied to their locations, they also travel in ways
that require attending to the processes of re-signification undergone
through their traffic. It is for this reason that some decolonial
feminist thinkers have called for closer attention to the
specificities of alterity that might set the limits on the theoretical
application of ideas (Mendoza 2014: 101). Notwithstanding, the Latina
feminist tradition has been influential on its own merits and
continues to pave coalitional roads with Latin American and Caribbean
thinkers both within and outside the United States.</p>

<h2 id="Conc">4. Conclusion</h2>

<p>
The history of Latin American and Caribbean feminist ideas is
extensive. However, it is one that remains underappreciated in North
American and European academic spaces. The omission of Latin American
feminisms is further compounded by the fact that most of its primary
resources remain untranslated from Spanish, making the travel of ideas
difficult. For some, the linguistic inaccessibility might not be
problematic as it signals the need for epistemic centers to
accommodate across difference, and for others, it merely highlights
the ample amount of work that remains to be done. Either way, the
Latin American feminist tradition is one that methodologically reminds
its readers that theory is always grounded in practice. Thus, placing
the ideas of women and their push for social transformation at the
centerfold of philosophical and theoretical activity demands
contextualization. For philosophical practices more specifically,
Latin American feminisms remind us that women have been thinking much
longer than they have been credited for and philosophers need to
merely start asking: What were they thinking about?</p>
