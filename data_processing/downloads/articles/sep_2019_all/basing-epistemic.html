<h1>The Epistemic Basing Relation</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Thu Oct 31, 2002; substantive revision Tue Aug 13, 2019</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>

The epistemic basing relation is the relation which holds between a
reason and a belief if and only if the reason is a reason for which
the belief is held. It is generally thought to be a necessary, but
not sufficient, condition for a belief’s being justified that
the belief be based on a reason. The basing relation is what
distinguishes good reasons which a person possesses that contribute
to the personal justification of a given belief from good reasons
which the person possesses but that do not contribute to the personal
justification of the belief.
</p>

<p>
 Basing relations may be involved in both inferential and
non-inferential justification. For example, one may hold that sensory
states count as reasons, and thus require that a sensory belief be
based on a reason if it is to be justified by that reason. In
addition, one might understand at least some self-evident beliefs to
be based on the meanings of the various terms of the sentence
expressing the proposition believed.  For example, one’s belief
that all bachelors are unmarried men may be understood to be based on
the meanings of ‘all’, ‘bachelors’,
‘are’, etc.</p>

<p>
 The basing relation is most frequently analyzed in terms of a
reason’s causing a
 belief.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-1" id="ref-1">1</a>]</sup>
 In such analyses, the reason and the belief are understood to be
mental states of a person. The cause may be a contributing cause or a
sufficient cause. However, the basing relation has also been analyzed
as an appropriate counterfactual cause of a belief and also as
depending on an appropriate meta-belief to the effect that a reason
is a good reason to hold the belief.</p>

<p>

Analysis of the basing relation is relevant to a variety of
fundamental epistemological issues. It is relevant to the nature of
epistemic rationalization and to questions regarding the
internalism/externalism debate. In addition, it has been argued that
reliabilist theories of justification are incompatible with the
correct analysis of the basing relation.</p>

<h2><a name="CauTheBasRel">1. Causal Theories of the Basing Relation</a></h2>

<p>

Causal theories of the basing relation hold that for a belief to be
based on a reason, the reason must cause the belief in an appropriate
way. Causal theories of the basing relation must not be confused with
causal theories of knowledge or justification. One might take a
causal theory of the basing relation to explain how one has taken
into account the reasons one possesses when forming or evaluating a
belief, regardless of whether the reason actually contributes
to the justification of the belief. Also, one might hold that a
belief’s being justified requires not only being based on a good
reason, but also requires, e.g., the fulfillment of various epistemic
duties, coherence within an appropriate cognitive system, etc.</p>

<p>
 Paul Moser offers the following example of a causal theory of the basing
relation for propositional reasons (Moser, 1989, p. 157):</p>

<blockquote>
 <em>S</em>’s believing or assenting to <em>P</em> is based on his
justifying propositional reason <em>Q</em> =<sub>df</sub> <em>S</em>’s
believing or assenting to <em>P</em> is causally sustained in a
nondeviant manner by his believing or assenting to <em>Q</em>, and by
his associating <em>P</em> and <em>Q</em>.
 </blockquote>

<p>
 Moser limits this account of the basing relation to instances of
inferential knowledge, unlike the more general characterization of the
basing relation given above.</p>

<p>
 A belief is causally sustained by a reason when the reason maintains
the belief, much like a rope might sustain the height and position of
a hanging plant. On Moser’s account, the belief must be causally
sustained in a nondeviant manner by both the believing of or
assenting to <em>Q</em> and by the association of <em>P</em> and
<em>Q</em>.</p>

<p>
 Moser defines the appropriate occurrent association relation as follows
(Moser 1989, pp. 141–142):</p>

<blockquote> 
 <em>S</em> occurrently satisfies an association relation between
<em>E</em> and <em>P</em> =<sub>df</sub> (i) <em>S</em> has a <em>de
re</em> awareness of <em>E</em>’s supporting <em>P</em>, and
(ii) as a nondeviant result of this awareness, <em>S</em> is in a
dispositional state whereby if he were to focus his attention only on
his evidence for <em>P</em> (while all else remained the same), he
would focus his attention on <em>E</em>.
 </blockquote>

<p>
 The association relation may also be non-occurrent and the belief
still justified by the reason in question. In this case, condition
(i) will have been satisfied in the past and the dispositional state
described in condition (ii) will still be present. The “<em>de re</em>
awareness” is a non-propositional, direct awareness of
<em>E</em>’s supporting <em>P</em>.  This is the sort of awareness
one might have of being thirsty or cold before thinking “I’m
thirsty” or “I’m cold”. This awareness is non-propositional in
that you need not put it into words in order to have it, and it is
direct in the sense that no sensation state (mental image, sense
datum) need come between being thirsty and being aware of one’s
thirst. By contrast, some have held that, for example, our awareness
that there is a table in the room is indirect in that it is mediated
by a sensation state (mental image, sense-datum) which represents the
table.</p>

<p>
 In addition to Moser’s theory, there are a variety of other
possible causal theories of the basing relation which might be
proposed. For example, one might eliminate the association condition,
requiring only that the reason cause the belief in some appropriate
way. One motivation for such a theory might be the view that one need
not be aware of a reason for it to be the basis of a belief, as in
the case of subliminal reasons. One issue here would be whether such
subconscious states can be justifying reasons. Alternatively, one
might hold that the reason need not sustain the belief, but only have
caused the belief to come into existence. One motivation for such a
view might be that one may justifiably believe things on the basis of
reasons one has forgotten (Goldman 2001, pp. 214–216). For example,
most people cannot remember on what basis they came to believe that
tigers are native to Asia, but it seems obvious that such people are
still justified in believing this. In such cases, the reason no
longer sustains the belief—in fact, the reason is no longer
possessed. Nonetheless, it might be argued, one’s belief that
tigers are native to Asia is still based on the reason which
originally caused it. On the other hand, one consideration against
this view is the intuition that a belief cannot be justified if one
possesses no reason for it. In addition, it may be argued that there
are other ways of accounting for how a belief may be justified even
if the original reason for it has been forgotten. For instance, one
might reason as follows: “I can’t recall where I first learned
this, but I feel sure it is true, and such feelings have proved to be
reliable in the past. Hence, my belief that tigers are native to Asia
is probably true.”</p>

<p>
 A variety of objections have been raised against causal theories of
the basing relation
 generally.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-2" id="ref-2">2</a>]</sup> 
 The most common of these is the problem of deviant causal chains, a
problem which plagues causal analyses in general. With regard to the
basing relation, the problem is that not every instance of a reason’s
causing a belief will establish a basing relation.  Alvin Plantinga
illustrates the problem well (Plantinga 1993, p. 69, n.8):</p>

<blockquote>
 Suddenly seeing Sylvia, I form the belief that I see her; as a
result, I become rattled and drop my cup of tea, scalding my leg. I
then form the belief that my leg hurts; but though the former belief
is a (part) cause of the latter, it is not the case that I accept the
latter on the evidential basis of the
 former.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-3" id="ref-3">3</a>]</sup>
</blockquote>

<p>
 What makes the problem so difficult is that there are a variety of
ways the causal chain of events can go wrong and thereby fail to
establish a basing relation. For example, glitches in the brain,
wandering thoughts, wishful thinking, strong emotions, etc., may all
be implicated in deviant causal chains. It is quite difficult to
clearly explain what non-deviant causation amounts to, yet without
such an explanation causal theories are ultimately unsatisfactory.</p>

<p>
An interesting possible solution to the problem is provided by Kevin
McCain (McCain 2012). McCain proposes an interventionist account of
causation according to which (roughly) <i>X</i> causes <i>Y</i> if and
only if were a change in <i>X</i> to occur, <i>Y</i> would change in a
regular way (setting aside any other redundant causes
of <i>Y</i>). Moreover, <i>X</i> is a direct cause of <i>Y</i> if and
only if, setting aside all other causally relevant events, a possible
intervention on <i>X</i> (e.g., to eliminate its causal power) would
change <i>Y</i> (e.g., <i>Y</i> would not occur). The basing relation
then gets defined as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

A person <i>S</i>’s belief that <i>p</i> at time <em>t</em> is based
on her reasons <em>R</em> if and only if at <em>t</em>:
<ol>
<li>each <em>r<sub>i</sub></em> ∈ <em>R</em> is a direct cause
of <i>S</i>’s believing that <i>p</i>, and</li>
<li>each <em>r<sub>i</sub></em> ∈ <em>R</em> is an actual cause
of <i>S</i>’s believing that <i>p</i>, and</li>
<li>It is not the case that intervening to set the values of all
direct causes of <i>S</i>’s believing that <i>p</i>, other than the
members of <em>R</em>, to zero will result in <i>S</i>’s not believing
that <i>p</i> when every <em>r<sub>i</sub></em> ∈ <em>R</em> is
held fixed at its actual value.</li>
</ol>
(McCain 2012, p. 364)
</blockquote>

<p>
To set the value of a direct cause to zero is merely to stipulate that
it is not a cause. Thus, condition (3) ensures that the members
of <em>R</em> are collectively sufficient to cause S’s belief that
<i>p</i>.</p>

<p>
McCain’s theory offers a quick solution to the problem of deviant
causal chains. In Plantinga’s example of Sylvia, for instance, the
person’s belief that their leg hurts is based only on the pain felt in
their leg for, on McCain’s theory, neither the becoming rattled nor
the belief that the person sees Sylvia are a direct cause of the
belief that their leg hurts. This is because neither the belief nor
the becoming rattled are direct causes of the belief that their leg
hurts. (McCain 2012, p. 372) The requirement that a cause be direct in
order to be the basis of a belief seems to limit, in cases like these,
causes that establish basing relations to the immediately previous
link in the causal chain of events. To oversimplify the point to a
slogan, McCain eliminates the problem of deviant causal chains by
eliminating the causal chains (from counting as bases).</p>

<p>
McCain discusses the potential problem that it might be implausible to
require that basing relations be direct (McCain 2012, p. 368–369). To
use McCain’s example, suppose that Sally believes that <i>p</i> and
that <i>p</i> ⊃ <i>q</i> (“<i>p</i>
implies <i>q</i>”), and validly infers, and thereby comes to
believe, that <i>q</i>. She also believes <i>q</i> ⊃ <i>t</i>, and
validly infers <i>t</i> from her beliefs that <i>q</i> and <i>q</i>
⊃ <i>t</i>. On McCain’s theory of the basing relation, since
Sally’s beliefs that <i>p</i> and <i>p</i> ⊃ <i>q</i> are not
direct causes of her belief that <i>t</i>, her belief that <i>t</i> is
not based on those beliefs. In other words, on McCain’s theory, the
basing relation is not transitive. This raises questions about whether
McCain’s theory adequately accounts for our pre-theoretical account of
the basing relation. In particular, does McCain’s theory correctly
identify one’s reasons for one’s beliefs?  McCain replies that, given
his theory, we can still claim that, e.g., Sally’s belief
that <i>t</i> is dependent on her beliefs that <i>p</i> and
that <i>p</i> ⊃ <i>q</i>, even if not based on them.</p>

<p>
 A second line of objection to causal theories of the basing relation
involves what I will call Gypsy-Lawyer style counterexamples, after
the first such example, formulated by Keith Lehrer (Lehrer
 1971).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-4" id="ref-4">4</a>]</sup>
 Lehrer’s example goes like this: suppose a series of eight
grisly murders has been committed, all the available evidence
indicates that the lawyer’s client committed the first seven of
those murders, and everyone believes that he committed the eighth
murder as well. However, the lawyer, being a practicing member of the
gypsy religion, has absolute faith in the cards.  The cards indicate
that his client is innocent of the eighth murder, and the lawyer
comes to believe this on the basis of his faith in the cards.  The
lawyer then re-examines the evidence and finds a very complicated
line of reasoning showing that his client is innocent of the eighth
murder.  The lawyer recognizes that the complicated line of reasoning
shows that his client is innocent. However, due to the grisly nature
of the case, the lawyer (and everyone else) strongly desires to
believe that the murderer of all eight victims has been found. Thus,
the lawyer’s belief that the complicated line of reasoning is
correct lacks the overwhelming emotional conviction needed to
overcome the lawyer’s desire, and thus cannot cause the lawyer
to believe that his client is innocent of the eighth murder.  It is
only his unshakable faith in the cards that is sufficient to cause
the lawyer to believe that his client is innocent. Nonetheless, since
the lawyer takes the line of reasoning seriously, it seems reasonable
to believe that the complicated line of reasoning could give the
lawyer knowledge that his client is innocent.</p>

<p>
 The idea behind Lehrer’s example is to conjoin the intuition
that the lawyer is justified in believing that his client is innocent
with the view that being justified in holding a belief requires that
the belief be based on a good reason in order to arrive at the
conclusion that the lawyer’s belief that his client is innocent
is based on the complicated line of reasoning.</p>

<p>
 The case of the gypsy lawyer is very complicated and Lehrer’s
argument has frequently been criticized. Alvin Goldman, for example,
has claimed that “…I find this example unconvincing. To the extent
that I clearly imagine that the lawyer fixes his belief solely as a
result of the cards, it seems intuitively wrong to say that he
<em>knows</em>—or has a <em>justified belief</em>—that his client is
innocent.” (Goldman 1979, p. 22, n.
 8)<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-5" id="ref-5">5</a>]</sup>
 Goldman does not elaborate on this objection, but the concern is
that the lawyer has not taken his good reason into proper account
when forming his belief that his client is innocent. One way of
responding to this concern is presented below in the discussion of
the causal-doxastic theory of the basing relation.</p>

<h2><a name="CouTheBasRel">2. Counterfactual Theories of the Basing Relation</a></h2>

<p>

Among the most widely discussed theories of the basing relation is
that presented by Marshall Swain (1979, 1981, and 1985). Concerned
about Gypsy-Lawyer style counterexamples, Swain suggests that a
counterfactual analysis of causation may avoid them without doing
violence to the intuitions underlying causal theories of the basing
relation. A counterfactual statement is a statement of the form “If
<em>A</em> were to occur, then <em>B</em> would occur”, where
‘<em>A</em>’ and ‘<em>B</em>’ denote
events. Roughly, the idea is that a belief is based on a reason if the
reason either non-deviantly causes or would have caused (in the
appropriate circumstances) the belief in question.  Very roughly,
where the reason would have caused the belief (in the appropriate
circumstances), the reason is, in Swain’s terminology, a
pseudo-overdeterminant of the belief, and hence the belief is based on
it. Swain argues that the complicated line of reasoning is a
pseudo-overdeterminant of the lawyer’s belief that his client is
innocent, and hence that there is a kind of causal connection between
the complicated line of reasoning and the lawyer’s belief by virtue of
which the lawyer’s belief is based on the reasoning. Swain more
precisely defines pseudo-overdeterminants as follows (1981,
p. 70):</p>

<blockquote>
 (DPO) Where <em>c</em> and <em>e</em> are occurrent events, <em>c</em> is
a pseudo-overdeterminant of <em>e</em> if and only if:

<ol> 
<li><em>c</em> is not a cause of <em>e</em>(that is, there is no causal
chain from <em>c</em> to <em>e</em> and <em>c</em> is not a genuine
overdeterminant of <em>e</em>);  and</li>

<li>there is some set of occurrent events, <em>D</em> =
{<em>d</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>d</em><sub>2</sub>,…,
<em>d<sub>n</sub></em>} (possibly having only one member), such
that

  <ol type="a">
  <li>each <em>d<sub>i</sub></em> in <em>D</em> is a cause of
<em>e</em>; and</li>
  <li>if no member of <em>D</em> had occurred, but <em>c</em> and
<em>e</em> had occurred anyway, then there would have been a causal
chain from <em>c</em> to <em>e</em>, and <em>c</em> would have been
causally prior to <em>e</em>.</li>
  </ol>
  </li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>

 Here ‘<em>c</em>’ stands for a cause and
‘<em>e</em>’ for an effect. If we restrict the application
of (DPO) to reasons and beliefs, <em>c</em> will be the reason and
<em>e</em> will be the belief caused by the reason. The
“<em>d<sub>i</sub></em>” will stand for the actual
reason(s) for the belief. So, (DPO) in effect states that if the
actual reason(s)
<em>d<sub>i</sub></em> for the belief had not occurred, then if another
reason <em>c</em> and the belief had occurred anyway, and only the
minimum necessary changes in the person’s epistemic situation
(e.g., the person’s other beliefs, reasons, etc.) are made, then
reason <em>c</em> would have caused the belief and is therefore a
pseudo-overdeterminant of the belief.</p>

<p>
 It’s important to note that a potential reason will not
pseudo-overdetermine a belief simply because there is some possible
world in which the actual reason does not cause the belief yet the
potential reason does.  This is much too broad, for it would allow
beliefs to be based on reasons when it seems obvious that they are
not so based in the actual world. Rather, the various stipulations in
(DPO) are intended to limit the relevant domain of possible worlds to
those as close as possible to the actual world.</p>

<p>
 Swain’s theory of the basing relation counts
pseudo-overdeterminants of a belief as reasons upon which a belief is
based, as we can see from the definition of the basing relation Swain
offers (Swain 1981, p. 74 and
 pp. 86–87)<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-6" id="ref-6">6</a>]</sup>:</p>

</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>

Genuine causal overdeterminants occur when two or more causes both
occur and each is sufficient to generate a particular effect. For
example, perhaps a table has five legs, four at the corners and one
at the center. It may be the case that the four legs at the corners
are sufficient to cause the table to remain upright, but if the four
legs at the corners were removed, the center leg would also be
sufficient to keep the table upright. Here, the effect of the
table’s remaining upright is overdetermined by the center leg,
on the one hand, and the four legs at the corners, on the
other. Similarly, perhaps a person has two good reasons for holding a
belief, and either one alone would be sufficient to cause the
belief. In this case, the two reasons would be said to overdetermine
the belief. Assuming that the causal relations were not deviant, the
belief would be based on both of the reasons.  The
‘<em>r<sub>i</sub></em>’ and ‘<em>r<sub>j</sub></em>’
in (DB) are simply reasons on which the belief is based. Condition
(ii) allows that a reason <em>r<sub>j</sub></em>, which is in turn a
reason for <em>r<sub>i</sub></em>, which in turn is a reason for the
belief that <em>h</em>, is also a reason on which the belief that
<em>h</em> is based, and the “or …, etc.” clause is intended to
include each of the reasons in a long chain of reasoning leading 
to the belief to count as reasons upon which the belief is based. </p>

<p>
 One advantage of Swain’s theory (which could be easily
incorporated into many other theories of the basing relation) is that
reasons are not limited to beliefs. Things like perceptual states
(such as seeing something) or what Swain calls sensation states (such
as experiencing hunger, thirst, pain, or other things which we sense
but not necessarily through the five senses) are counted (by
stipulation) as non-propositional reasons for the purposes of his
theory. Thus, a unified account of belief basing is provided.</p>

<p>
 As already noted, Swain’s theory is intended to avoid
Lehrer’s objection regarding Gypsy-Lawyer style
counterexamples. The complicated line of reasoning is not a cause or
causal overdeterminant of the lawyer’s belief that his client is
innocent because the lawyer’s strong desire to believe that his
client is guilty of the eighth murder prevents the complicated line
of reasoning from causing the belief that his client is innocent. The
degree of conviction the lawyer has in the complicated line of
reasoning is sufficient for the lawyer to believe the complicated
line of reasoning (once his strong desire to believe that his client
is guilty is overridden by his strong faith (or rational belief, as
the case may be) in the cards), but alone is not sufficient to
override his strong desire to believe that his client is
innocent. Swain argues that (DB) avoids Lehrer’s objection
because the complicated line of reasoning pseudo-overdetermines the
lawyer’s belief that his client is innocent (Swain 1981, p. 74
and pp. 86–87). We can see how this is to work by examining condition
(2)(b) of (DPO). Suppose that the actual cause of his belief that his
client is innocent (<em>d<sub>i</sub></em>) (namely, the lawyer’s
belief about the result of the card reading) had not occurred, and
that both the complicated line of reasoning (<em>c</em>) and the belief
that his client is innocent (<em>e</em>) had occurred anyway. On this
supposition, the lawyer’s strong desire to believe that his
client is guilty of all eight crimes could not have occurred, because
if it had it would have prevented the lawyer from believing that his
client is innocent. Since the lawyer’s strong desire is the only
thing that prevents the complicated line of reasoning from causing
the lawyer’s belief that his client is innocent, the complicated
line of reasoning would then have caused the lawyer to believe that
his client is innocent. Thus, the complicated line of reasoning
pseudo-overdetermines the lawyer’s belief that his client is
innocent, and hence, on (DB), the lawyer’s belief is based on
the complicated line of reasoning in Lehrer’s original
example. So on Swain’s theory, the lawyer’s belief is based
on the complicated line of reasoning, in accordance with
Lehrer’s intuitions about the case. Contrary to Lehrer, however,
Swain argues that there is a counterfactual causal connection between
the reasoning and the lawyer’s belief that his client is
innocent, thus providing a theory of the basing relation consistent
with the intuition that the basing relation is best analyzed in terms
of a reason’s causing a belief.</p>

<p>
 A variety of objections to Swain’s theory have been proposed in the
 literature.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-7" id="ref-7">7</a>]</sup>
 Perhaps the best of these is that presented by Joseph Tolliver
(1982, pp. 151–155). Tolliver’s counterexample, which he calls
the pendulum case, goes like this: suppose a physics student has
learned that from the period of a pendulum (i.e., the time it takes
to complete a swing) one can calculate its length and vice
versa.  The student measures a particular pendulum and discovers
that it has a length <em>L</em>, and calculates that it must have
period <em>P</em>. The student also has two general beliefs about
pendulums, namely (1) that if <em>x</em> is a pendulum of period
<em>P</em>, then <em>x</em> is a pendulum of length <em>L</em>, and (2)
that if <em>x</em> is a pendulum of length <em>L</em>, then <em>x</em> is a
pendulum of period <em>P</em>. We may suppose that it is clear in this
case that the student’s belief about the period is based (at
least in part) on her belief about its length, but her belief about
its length is not based on her belief about the period. But, Tolliver
claims, the student’s belief about the period
pseudo-overdetermines her belief about the length of the pendulum,
and hence gets counted, on Swain’s theory, as the basis of her
belief about the length of the pendulum. This is so because,
according to Tolliver, if the actual cause of the student’s
belief about the length had not occurred, and if the student still
had both her belief about the period and her belief about the length,
then her belief about the period would have caused her belief about
the length.</p>

<p>
 One natural line of reply to this sort of counterexample to
Swain’s theory would be to further specify the sorts of changes
in one’s epistemic situation that are consistent with
pseudo-overdetermination. For example, perhaps the student in the
above example would have to engage in further reasoning, inferring
the length of the pendulum from her two general beliefs about
pendulums and her belief about the period of the pendulum. If such
additional inferences could be ruled out as being unwarranted changes
in the student’s epistemic situation, then the student’s
belief about the period would not pseudo-overdetermine her belief
about the length of the pendulum.</p>

<h2><a name="DoxTheBasRel">3. Doxastic Theories of the Basing Relation</a></h2>

<p>

Doxastic theories of the basing relation hold that having an
appropriate meta-belief to the effect that a reason is a good reason
to hold a belief is sufficient for the belief’s being based on the
reason. Such a theory appears to be a natural fit for certain kinds of
epistemic internalism. For such an account, see Leite (2008). Some
theories of the basing relation, such as those of Helen Longino and
Robert Audi, state that such a meta-belief is a necessary but not
sufficient condition for a belief’s being based on a reason (Longino
1978; Audi 1986). Such theories hold that if a belief is to be based
on a reason, the reason must non-deviantly cause the belief, and an
appropriate meta-belief must be present. Such theories tend to be
vulnerable to the objections to causal theories of the basing relation
as well as the objections—to be discussed shortly—to
doxastic theories of the basing relation.</p>

<p>
 Here, we will examine Joseph Tolliver’s account of the basing
relation.  Roughly, Tolliver’s view is that a belief is based on
a reason for a person <em>S</em> if and only if <em>S</em> believes that
the reason provides evidence for the belief, and also believes that
it is likely that the probability that the belief is true increased at
the time the reason was accepted.  Tolliver’s aim is to avoid
the pendulum objection to Swain’s theory while affirming Swain
and Lehrer’s intuition in the case of the gypsy lawyer that the
lawyer’s belief that his client is innocent is based on the
complicated line of reasoning. Tolliver’s account is as follows
(Tolliver 1982, p.
 159):<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-8" id="ref-8">8</a>]</sup></p>

 <blockquote>
 (B) <em>S</em> bases his or her belief that <em>b</em> on reason
<em>r</em> at a time <em>t</em> if and only if

 <blockquote>
 <p>
 (1) <em>S</em> believes that <em>b</em> at <em>t</em> and <em>S</em>
believes that <em>r</em> at <em>t</em>, and</p>

 <p>
 (2) <em>S</em> believes that the truth of <em>r</em> is evidence for the
truth of <em>b</em> at <em>t</em>, and</p>
 
 <p>
 (3) Where <em>S</em>’s estimate of the likelihood of <em>b</em>
equals <em>h</em> at <em>t</em> (<em>h</em> being greater than 0 and less
than or equal to 1), if it were the case that <em>S</em> came to
believe <em>r</em> for the first time at <em>t</em>, then <em>S</em>’s
estimate of the likelihood of the proposition “the likelihood of
<em>b</em> is greater than or equal to <em>h</em>” would be greater at
<em>t</em> then it was prior to <em>t</em>.</p>
 </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>
Condition (3) is intended to handle the pendulum case
discussed above. In the pendulum case, the student measures the
length of a pendulum and thereby comes to believe that it has length
<em>L</em>. On the basis of this measurement and other truths she
knows about pendulums, the student is able to calculate the period of
the pendulum. Thus, the student’s belief about the length serves as
a reason for her belief about the period. The apparent problem for
Swain’s view was that the students belief about the period also
seemed to be counted as a reason on which her belief about the length
was based, when in fact the basing relation went in the reverse
direction. Tolliver’s theory attempts to handle this problem by
means of condition (3), which is intended to specify the direction of
the evidential support relation. Once the student measures the length
and makes the inference about the period, the student’s estimate of
the likelihood that the pendulum has period <em>P</em> would
increase. However, the student’s belief about the period of the
pendulum would not, according to Tolliver, increase the estimate of
the likelihood that the pendulum has length <em>L</em> because
the student’s belief about the length is needed to calculate the
period.</p>

<p>
 One common line of objection to doxastic theories of the basing
relation has to do with individuals who do not possess the epistemic
concepts needed to form the meta-belief (that a reason is a good
reason to hold a belief) required by doxastic theories, but who
nonetheless seem to base beliefs on reasons. For example, young or
uneducated persons may seem perfectly capable having reasons for
beliefs even if they lack the appropriate concepts of epistemic
evidence required by condition (2) of Tolliver’s theory. One
possible line of reply to this sort of objection would be to
stipulate that one may have either an appropriate meta-belief or some
appropriate form of awareness that need not involve any particular
fully developed epistemic concept. For example, one might allow, as
does Moser’s theory discussed in the foregoing, that one merely
have a <em>de re</em> awareness of the evidential relation holding
between the reason and the belief.</p>

<p>
 Another common line of objection to doxastic theories concerns the
possibility of meta-beliefs (to the effect that a reason is a good
reason to hold a belief) which do not establish basing relations.
For example, suppose Ezekiel belongs to a religious cult and
slavishly believes whatever the cult leader, Exidor, tells him. One
day Exidor tells Ezekiel that his belief in God is a good reason to
believe everything else Ezekiel believes, and Ezekiel slavishly comes
to believe this. Nonetheless, it would seem highly counter-intuitive
to accept that, now, everything else Ezekiel believes is in fact
based on his belief in God. Perhaps one way to avoid this sort of
objection is to add additional conditions as to which meta-beliefs
are capable of establishing basing relations. One such solution is
discussed below, in the section regarding causal-doxastic theories of
the basing relation.</p>

<p>

 A third common line of objection to doxastic theories is that we may
sometimes base beliefs on reasons of which we are unaware. For
example, perhaps beliefs can be based on subconscious reasons. If
so,then beliefs may be based on reasons even though an appropriate
meta-belief (that the reason is a good reason to hold the belief)
cannot be formed because the person remains unaware of the reason.</p>

<h2><a name="CauDoxTheBasRel">4. Causal-Doxastic Theories of the Basing Relation</a></h2>

<p>

The basic idea of causal-doxastic theories is that a belief may be
based on a reason if either an appropriate meta-belief is present (as
in doxastic theories of the basing relation) or the reason causes the
belief in an appropriate way (as in causal theories of the basing
relation). One motive for such a view is to avoid Gypsy-Lawyer style
counterexamples while preserving the intuition that a reason’s
causing a belief can sometimes establish a basing relation. A second,
more fundamental motive begins with the observation that a belief is
based on a reason when one has, with regard to the belief, taken
proper account of the evidential import of the reason. It would be
odd if, e.g., the conscious evaluation and acceptance of the
evidential import of a potential reason for a belief was, in
principle, completely irrelevant to whether the belief was based on
the reason. Intuitively, it seems that taking proper account of a
reason may merely involve thinking about the evidential import of the
reason in the appropriate way, and whether, in addition, the reason
non-deviantly causes (or, causally sustains) the belief is merely a
contingent, empirical matter.</p>

<p>
 Keith Allen Korcz’s version of a causal-doxastic theory,
somewhat simplified, is as follows (Korcz 2000):</p>

<blockquote>
 (CD) A person <em>S</em>’s belief that <em>p</em> is based on a
reason <em>r</em> possessed by <em>S</em> at time <em>t</em> if and only if
  <ol>
  <li><em>S</em> believes that <em>p</em> at <em>t</em>, and</li>
  <li>Either

    <ol type="a">
    <li>the following two conditions are met:

       <ol type="i">
       <li><em>r</em> is an (or contributes to the) internal cause,
internal causal overdeterminant or internal causal sustainer, at or
prior to <em>t</em>, of <em>S</em>’s belief that <em>p</em>, and</li>
       <li><em>r</em> is not rejected at <em>t</em>,</li>
       </ol> 

    <p>

or</p>
    </li>

    <li>the following four conditions are met:

       <ol type="i">
       <li><em>S</em> at <em>t</em> has a meta-belief or <em>de re</em>
awareness to the effect that <em>r</em> is a good reason to believe
<em>p</em>, and</li>

       <li>the causal explanation of <em>S</em>’s having this
meta-belief or state of awareness involves both <em>S</em>’s
belief that <em>p</em> and <em>r</em>, and</li>
       <li><em>r</em>, the belief that <em>p</em>, and any other reason
the meta-belief or state of awareness is causally based on meets
all the requirements of condition (2)(a), and</li>

       <li><em>S</em> has no other meta-belief or state of awareness
contrary to the meta-belief described in condition (b)(i).</li>
       </ol>
    </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>

Note that (CD) makes no allowance for a belief’s being based on a
reason when the reason is no longer possessed. There are no such
basing relations, given (CD).</p>

<p> 

An internal cause is a causal chain of events such that each link in
the chain is either a belief, a reason (construed to include
perceptual and sensation states, as well as beliefs), or an
inference. One’s beliefs, reasons, and inferences collectively
constitute what Korcz calls one’s cognitive structure. The various
sorts of causes mentioned in (a)(i) are required to be internal to
<em>S</em>’s cognitive structure so as to avoid problems with deviant
causal chains. Deviant causal chains seem to occur when the chain of
causal events from a putative reason to a belief veers outside the
persons cognitive structure. For instance, in Plantinga’s example of
Sylvia discussed above, the causal chain of events includes the event
of dropping a cup of tea, and this event is not one which occurs
within the person’s cognitive structure. However, Korcz acknowledges
that this is not a fully satisfactory solution to the problem of
deviant causal chains, given the difficulties of specifying exactly
which events are internal to one’s cognitive system in the appropriate
way.</p>

<p>
 Condition (a)(ii) (and, in effect, condition (b)(iv)) requires that
the reason a belief is based on not be rejected. A reason for a
belief is rejected when the following two conditions are met:</p>

<ol type="I">

<li><em>S</em> has a meta-belief to the effect that the reason is no
longer a good reason to hold the belief, and</li>

<li>one has no meta-beliefs which contradict the meta-belief
described in (I).</li> 

</ol>

<p>

By virtue of condition (I), this account of rejecting a reason for a
belief allows for a belief to cease to be based on a reason even when
the reason is still retained (not, e.g., forgotten). For example,
suppose I believe that Pablo Neruda was a great poet because all
great poets are revolutionaries and Neruda was a
revolutionary. Later, I come to believe that this inference is
invalid, yet also come to believe that all Nobel Prize winners in
literature are great poets and that Neruda won the Nobel prize in
literature. Thus, I never lose my belief that Neruda is a great poet
and I never lose (at least some of) my original reasons for believing
that Neruda was a great poet (I still believe that all great poets
are revolutionaries and that Neruda was a revolutionary). Instead,
the reasons for which I believe that Neruda was a great poet have
shifted, in part by virtue of the fact that I have come to believe
that my original reasons did not support my belief.</p>

<p>
 Condition (II) of this account of rejecting reasons excludes
contradictory meta-beliefs in order to account for some cases in
which it is unclear whether the reasons for a belief have been
rejected. Were a person to have contradictory meta-beliefs (perhaps
not recognizing they are contradictory as the result of thinking in
different terms which in fact have the same referent), it would be
unclear whether the reasons were still the basis of the belief.</p>

<p>
 Condition (b)(i) of (CD), by allowing that the meta-belief (or state
of awareness) merely be to the effect that the reason is a good
reason to hold the belief, is intended to allow the meta-belief to
contain any appropriate epistemic concept the individual may
possess. Conditions (b)(ii) and (b)(iii) are intended to exclude
cases of meta-beliefs which do not establish basing relations, as in
the example of Ezekiel discussed above. Ezekiel has the meta-belief
that his belief in God is a good reason to believe everything else he
believes. According to (CD), the reason this meta-belief does not
establish a basing relation is that it is not non-deviantly caused by
both his belief in God and every other belief he has. Instead, it is
based on his cult leader, Exidor, telling him that his belief in God
is a good reason to believe everything else he believes. For the
meta-belief to establish a basing relation, it must be based on
(i.e., non-deviantly caused by) the belief and reason(s) it is
about. This helps to ensure that the person has taken appropriate
account of the evidential import of the reason for the belief, much
as it does in causal theories of the basing relation.</p>

<p>
 One line of objection to Korcz’s causal-doxastic theory is that
simply combining causal and doxastic theories is <em>ad hoc</em>, i.e.,
lacks appropriate theoretical support. In turn, this would appear to
prevent the theory from helping us to understand the basing
relation. The basing relation is presumably a unified epistemic
concept calling for a unified analysis, not a haphazard
conglomeration of different conditions, as a disjunctive analysis of
the basing relation as either causes or meta-beliefs would
suggest. While the analysis may be unified in the sense that it is a
causal analysis through and through, one would not expect the kinds
of causes to be so different. This objection gains further support if
it is mistakenly thought that the primary motive for the theory is
merely to avoid Gypsy-Lawyer style counter-examples.</p>

<p>
 One possible line of response to this sort of objection is to note
that an important motive for the theory is a fundamental fact about
human thinking, and not merely the desire to avoid Gypsy-Lawyer
style counter-examples.  Intuitively, a belief’s being based on
a reason involves taking into account the epistemic import of the
reason, and such a mental operation may be of two sorts: either
directly causal (where a reason non-deviantly causes a belief) or
intentional (where one has a meta-belief to the effect that a reason
is a good reason to hold a belief). The ability to reflect on our
beliefs and thereby evaluate them is often thought to be an ability
which distinguishes human cognition from that of many other non-human
animals. And to properly evaluate a belief is simply to take into
proper account its evidential import. Thus, it would be highly
implausible if such reflective evaluations were absent from an
account of a belief’s being based on a reason. Yet on causal
theories of the basing relation, such reflective evaluations are
superfluous. On the other hand, such reflective evaluations do not
appear necessary for a belief to be based on a reason, as previously
argued. There seem to be situations in which non-deviant causes are
sufficient to establish basing relations, again as previously
argued. Therefore, the disjunctive analysis of (CD) appears to be
essential if we are to do justice to the various ways the human mind
may take into account the evidential import of reasons.</p>

<h2><a name="BasRelEpi">5. The Basing Relation and Epistemology</a></h2>

<p>

Given that a necessary condition of a belief’s being justified
is that it be based on an appropriate reason, which theory of the
basing relation one adopts may have significant implications for
one’s theory of epistemic justification. For example, accepting
a doxastic or a causal-doxastic theory of the basing relation would
appear to be at odds with the fundamental intuition behind causal
theories of justification (e.g., reliabilism), which assert that a belief
is justified merely by being caused in an appropriate way. On a
doxastic or causal-doxastic theory, a belief may be based on a good
reason (and thus, we may suppose, be justified) even if the belief
were not caused in the appropriate way or even if the belief were,
somehow, not caused at all.</p>

<p>
 Accepting some doxastic theories of the basing relation will commit
one to a strong form of access internalism. Strong access internalism
is the view that one must be aware of one’s reasons for a belief
in order for the belief to be justified in light of those
reasons. Plausible doxastic theories of the basing relation will
likely have built in this requirement of access to one’s reasons
by virtue of requiring that, for a belief to be based on a reason,
one must believe or be aware that the reason is a good reason to hold
the belief. Plausible doxastic theories will likely stipulate that
one cannot have an appropriate meta-belief or state of awareness
without being directly aware of the reason in question, in order to
avoid counting meta-beliefs such as that of Ezekiel’s, in the
example discussed above, as sufficient to establish basing relations.</p>

<p>
Finally, novel arguments for various forms of skepticism about
justification can be developed that focus on improperly based beliefs,
though such arguments remain largely unexplored. One exception is in
Jonathan Schaffer’s discussion of the debasing demon (Schaffer
2010). Unlike the Cartesian Demon, the debasing demon may leave one’s
beliefs true and reasons adequate, yet “cross the wires” so that
beliefs are only based on reasons that fail to justify them. Such
demonic efforts may include mistaken beliefs about what belief is
based on what reason. Schaffer argues that the debasing demon even
leaves us without the foundation of Descartes’ <em>cogito</em>, since
one might be misled as to what reason one’s belief in one’s own
existence is based. </p>
