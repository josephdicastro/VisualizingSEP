<h1>Henri Bergson</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Tue May 18, 2004; substantive revision Wed May 27, 2020</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>

Henri Bergson (1859–1941) was one of the most famous and influential
French philosophers of the late 19th century-early 20th century.
Although his international fame reached cult-like heights during his
lifetime, his influence decreased notably after the second World War.
While such French thinkers as Merleau-Ponty, Sartre, and
Lévinas explicitly acknowledged his influence on their thought,
it is generally agreed that it was Gilles Deleuze’s
1966 <em>Bergsonism</em> that marked the reawakening of interest in
Bergson’s work. Deleuze realized that Bergson’s most enduring
contribution to philosophical thinking is his concept of
multiplicity. Bergson’s concept of multiplicity attempts to unify in a
consistent way two contradictory features: heterogeneity and
continuity. Many philosophers today think that this concept of
multiplicity, despite its difficulty, is revolutionary. It is
revolutionary because it opens the way to a reconception of community.

<h2 id="LifeWork">1. Life and works</h2>

<p>

Bergson was born in Paris on October 18, 1859; he was the second of
seven children of a Polish Father and English mother; both of his
parents were Jewish. Bergson was a notably exceptional pupil throughout
his childhood. Like his German contemporary, Edmund Husserl, Bergson’s
original training was in mathematics. Bergson won the first prize in
mathematics for the prestigious “Concours
Général,” which led to the publication of his
solution to a problem by Pascal in 1877. Bergson nevertheless chose to
prepare for the École Normale in the letters and humanities
section. His math teacher, disappointed, famously claimed, “you
could have been a mathematician; you will be a mere philosopher”
(quoted in Soulez &amp; Worms 2002, p. 35).</p>

<p>

In 1878, Bergson became a French citizen, although he could have
chosen English citizenship. He was accepted at the École Normale
along with Jean Jaurès and Émile Durkheim. He discovered
Herbert Spencer with enthusiasm, and studied under Félix
Ravaisson and Jules Lachelier. Bergson graduated from the École
Normale in 1881. He was the second best at the highly selective
Agrégation de Philosophie, thanks to a lecture entitled
“What is the value of contemporary psychology?” He began a
teaching post in Angers at the high school (the lycée), and then
moved to Clermont-Ferrand. There he taught both at the Lycée and
the University for the next five years.</p>

<p>

His first scholarly publication was in 1886, in the Revue
Philosophique; “On Unconscious Simulation in States of
Hypnosis” concerns the results of his observations at sessions of
hypnosis. Notice that Freud and Breuer’s <em>Studies on Hysteria</em>
did not appear until 1896. This foreshadowed Bergson’s growing interest
in the role of unconscious memories within recognition—an
interest that culminates in his being elected president of the London
based Society for Psychical Research in 1913. In 1888, Bergson
submitted two doctoral theses in Paris: Essai sur les données
immédiates de la conscience, published as a book (<em>Time and
Free Will</em>) in 1889; and the then required Latin thesis, Quid
Aristoteles de loco senserit (<em>Aristotle’s Conception of
Place</em>). In 1927, in a footnote to <em>Being and Time</em>,
Heidegger cited this second thesis, claiming that Bergson’s view of
time remains within the horizon of Greek metaphysics.</p>

<p>

Bergson’s second book, <em>Matter and Memory</em>, appeared in 1896.
This book led to Bergson’s election to the Collège de
France. In his second attempt, Bergson succeeded at obtaining a post,
and teaches at the École Normale for two years starting in 1898
(Soulez et Worms, 2002, pp. 80–81). The Dreyfus Affair was raging, but
Bergson (a Jew by birth) refused to take part in the public debate.
Bergson published <em>Laughter: an Essay on the Meaning of the
Comic</em> in 1900. He was appointed Chair of Ancient Philosophy at the
prestigious Collège de France. This marked the beginning of his
growing fame. In 1903, Bergson published, in the prestigious Revue de
métaphysique et de morale, an article entitled
“Introduction to Metaphysics” (later reproduced as the
centerpiece of <em>The Creative Mind</em> [<em>La Pensée et le
mouvant</em>] in 1934). The first of Bergson’s works to be translated
in many languages, this article not only became a crucial reading guide
for Bergson’s philosophy as a whole, but it also marked the beginning
of “Bergsonism” and of its influence on Cubism and
literature. Through Williams James’s enthusiastic reading of this
essay, Bergsonism acquired a far-reaching influence on American
Pragmatism. Moreover, his imprint on American literature (in
particular, Wallace Stevens and Willa Cather, who created a character
called “Alexandra Bergson”) is undeniable.</p>

<p>

<em>Creative Evolution</em> appeared in 1907 and was not only the
source of the “Bergson legend,” as well as of numerous,
lively academic and public controversies centering on his philosophy
and his role as an intellectual. The beginning of the next decade is
the apex of the “Bergsonian cult” (“le Bergson
boom”).
<em>Creative Evolution</em> was translated into English. Bertrand
Russell (who publishes an article entitled “The Philosophy in
Bergson” in <em>The Monist</em> in 1912) objected that Bergson
wants to turn us into bees with the notion of intuition. Russell also
noted that any attempt at classifying Bergson would fail, as his
philosophy cuts across all divisions, whether empiricist, realist or
idealist (Soulez et Worms 2002, p. 124). Bergson’s lectures at
the Collège de France were filled to capacity, not only with
society ladies and their suitors, but also with a whole generation of
philosophy students (Étienne Gilson and Jean Wahl among others)
and poets such as T.S. Eliot.</p>

<p>

In January 1913, Bergson visited the United States for the first time
(Soulez et Worms 2002, p. 134). The week before he delivered his first
lecture at Columbia University (entitled “Spirituality and
Liberty”), The New York Times published a long article on him.
The enthusiasm this article generated may explain the traffic jam that
occurred before Bergson’s lecture, the first traffic jam in the history
of Broadway. In the same year, Bergson gave the Presidential Address,
entitled “Phantasms of the Living and Psychical Research,”
to the Society for Psychical Research in London, England. The next year
Bergson was elected a member of the Académie Française;
he was the first Jewish member in its history. He also presented
courses at the Collège de France on Modern Philosophy and
Spinoza. His international fame continued to grow through the delivery
of the Gifford Lecture at Edinburgh University in Scotland in May and
June; the lectures were called “The Problem of
Personality.” Finally, in the same year, the Roman Catholic
Church, in opposition to evolutionary theory, condemned Bergson’s
philosophy.</p>

<p>

Of course, in the middle of this decade, war broke out, and Bergson
entered his political career, which took him first to Spain in 1917
(Soulez et Worms 2002, p.150). But more importantly, the French
government sent him to the United-States as a diplomatic emissary to
meet President Wilson (Soulez et Worms 2002, p. 154; see also Soulez
1989). After his first visit to the United States in 1913, he had
thought that peace would come only from Washington, D.C. (Soulez et
Worms 2002, p. 139). After his visit to Washington, Bergson said,
“I have just lived unforgettable hours. Humanity appeared to me
transfigured. […] France was saved. It was the greatest joy of
my life.” At this time, Bergson was also working with Wilson’s
government to form a “league of nations,” a body that would
include representatives of all nations and that would aim at
establishing and maintaining peace. The League of Nations remained in
existence until 1946, when it was replaced by the United Nations. 
Increasingly Bergson became more famous for his political actions than
for his philosophy.</p>

<p>

1919 saw the publication of Bergson’s <em>Mind Energy</em>, a
collection of essays concerned with metaphysical and psychological
problems. During the same year he retired from his teaching duties.
However, in 1922, Bergson was appointed president of the International
Commission for Intellectual Cooperation — the precursor to
UNESCO. There, Bergson participated in a debate with Einstein, which,
according to Merleau-Ponty, seems to testify to a “crisis of
reason.”  Bergson published his reflections on Einstein as
<em>Duration and Simultaneity</em> (see <em>Mélanges</em>,
1972). There is some controversy surrounding this book. Bergson
allowed the book to be reprinted up to the sixth edition in
1931. However Édouard Le Roy claims in a letter from 1953 (well
after Bergson’s death) that he often spoke with Bergson about
relativity. Le Roy says, “[Bergson] added with insistence that
the defective state of his knowledge of mathematics did not allow him
to follow the development of generalized relativity in the detail such
a development required. Consequently [Bergson] thought it wiser to let
the question drop. This is why he refused to let <em>Duration and
Simultaneity</em> be reprinted” (Avertissement pour la
septième edition, <em>Durée et
simultanéité</em>, p. 5, [Lawlor translation]). However,
in Bergson’s will, he does not mention <em>Duration and
Simultaneity</em> as a text not to be republished. Thus, the editors
of the seventh edition in 1968 (Jean Wahl, Henri Gouhier, Jean Gutton,
Vladimir Jankélévitch) saw fit to reprint this book. In
a letter from November 1924, after complaining that in general his
writings on relativity had been badly understood by the
“relativist physicists.” Bergson clarifies that his
writings on relativity should not be seen as dismissive of relativity
theory. He says, “For my part, I think that the theory of relativity
represents a very great advance, not only from the viewpoint of
physics, but also from the viewpoint of philosophy”
(Bergson, <em>Correspondences</em>, p. 1122 [Lawlor translation]). If
Deleuze’s interpretation is correct, the confrontation
that <em>Duration and Simultaneity</em> develops is not one between
Bergson and Einstein but a confrontation between Bergson’s
interpretation of multiplicities and Riemann’s interpretation of
multiplicity, Riemann’s interpretation being, according to Deleuze,
the basis of Einstein’s theory (Deleuze, 1991, pp. 39–40, and
also see below, “The Concept of Multiplicity”).</p>

<p>

During the second half of the Twenties, Bergson suffered from severe
arthritis, which eventually forced him to retire from public life. In
1928, he was awarded the Nobel Prize for literature. Finally, in 1932,
he surprised everyone with the publication of his last major book,
<em>The Two Sources of Morality and Religion</em>, which gave rise to
renewed debates and misunderstandings about his philosophy and his
religious orientation. The final collection of his essays, <em>The
Creative Mind</em>, appeared in 1934.</p>

<p>

Bergson died on January 3, 1941 at the age of 81. World War II had of
course already begun, and Germany, occupying France, had established
the Vichy government. There is a rumor that he had converted to
Catholicism near the end of his life, but there is no document to
support this rumor. In fact, in a letter to Emmanuel Mounier, Madame
Bergson quotes her husband saying “I would have converted [to
Catholicism], if I had not seen over many years the great wave of
anti-semitism preparing itself to expand over the world.” Madame
Bergson continues in the letter to say that her husband had resolved
not to be baptized (Béguin and Thévenaz 1941, pp. 11–12;
also Soulez and Worms, p. 277). Because of his fame, the Vichy
Government offered Bergson exemptions from anti-Semitic regulations,
but he refused. It is also rumored that he contracted the cold that
killed him while waiting in line to register as a Jew. Apparently, in
the same will which his wife mentions in the letter to Mounier
(Béguin and Thévenaz 1941, p. 12), Bergson had
instructed that all of his papers be destroyed.  The story goes that
his wife obeyed this order, throwing all of her husband’s papers into
the fireplace. There is a rumor that she destroyed a half-written
manuscript. The result of this destruction is that the Bergson
Archives in Paris (stored at Librairie Jacques Doucet on the Place de
Panthéon in Paris) contain only Bergson’s personal library. So,
the situation is very different for Bergson than for many other
important French and German philosophers of the 20th Century who have
massive archives (Husserl, Heidegger, and Merleau-Ponty). The lack of
archival material is one reason why Bergson went out of favor during
the second half of the Twentieth Century. We shall return to this
problem of Bergson’s temporary disappearance from the philosophical
scene.</p>

<h2 id="ConcMult">2. The concept of multiplicity</h2>

<p>

The concept of multiplicity has two fates in the Twentieth Century:
Bergsonism and phenomenology (Deleuze, 1991, pp. 115–118). In
phenomenology, the multiplicity of phenomena is always related to a
unified consciousness. In Bergsonism, “the immediate
data of consciousness” (les données immédiates de
la conscience) are a multiplicity. Here, two prepositions,
“to” and “of,” indicate perhaps the most basic
difference between Bergsonism and phenomenology. Of course, this phrase
is the title of Bergson’s first work, <em>Essai sur les données
immédiates de la conscience</em>. The standard English title of
this work is <em>Time and Free Will: An Essay on the Immediate Data of
Consciousness</em>. It is the text that Sartre claimed attracted him to
philosophy. </p>

<p>

<em>Time and Free Will</em> has to be seen as an attack on Kant, for
whom freedom belongs to a realm outside of space and time. Bergson
thinks that Kant has confused space and time in a mixture, with the
result that we must conceive human action as determined by natural
causality. Bergson offers a twofold response. On the one hand, in
order to define consciousness and therefore freedom, Bergson proposes
to differentiate between time and space, “to un-mix” them,
we might say. On the other hand, through the differentiation, he
defines the immediate data of consciousness as being temporal, in
other words, as the duration (<em>la durée</em>). In the
duration, there is no juxtaposition of events; therefore there is no
mechanistic causality. It is in the duration that we can speak of the
experience of freedom.</p>

<p>

For Bergson, we must understand the duration as a qualitative
multiplicity — as opposed to a quantitative multiplicity. As the
name suggests, a quantitative multiplicity enumerates things or states
of consciousness by means of externalizing one from another in a
homogeneous space. In contrast, a qualitative multiplicity consists in
a temporal heterogeneity, in which “several conscious states are
organized into a whole, permeate one another, [and] gradually gain a
richer content” (<em>Time and Free Will</em>, p. 122). Bergson
even insists that the word ‘several’ is inappropriate to
qualitative multiplicity because it suggests numbering. In <em>Time
and Free Will</em>, Bergson provides examples of a quantitative
multiplicity; the example of a flock of sheep is perhaps the easiest
to grasp (<em>Time and Free Will</em>, pp. 76–77). When we look
at a flock of sheep, what we notice is that they all look alike. We
sense no qualitative change as we move from one to another. We also
notice that we can enumerate the sheep. We are able to enumerate them
because each sheep is spatially separated from or juxtaposed to the
others; in other words, each occupies a discernable spatial
location. Therefore, quantitative multiplicities, as Bergson says, are
homogeneous and spatial. Moreover, because a quantitative multiplicity
is homogeneous, we can represent it with a symbol, for instance, a
sum: ‘25’.</p>

<p>The idea of qualitative multiplicities is difficult to understand,
although it is the heart of Bergson’s thinking. Normally, we would
think that if there is heterogeneity, there has to be
juxtaposition. But, in qualitative multiplicities, there is
heterogeneity and no juxtaposition. Qualitative multiplicities are
temporal; qualitative multiplicity defines the duration. As with
quantitative multiplicities, Bergson gives us many examples; but
perhaps the easiest example to grasp is the feeling of sympathy, a
moral feeling (<em>Time and Free Will</em>, pp. 18–19). Sympathy
is not only the easiest to grasp, it is also significant, as we shall
see. Our experience of sympathy begins, according to Bergson, with our
putting ourselves in the place of others, feeling their pain. But, if
this were all, the feeling would inspire in us abhorrence of others,
and we would want to avoid them, not help them. Bergson concedes that
the feeling of horror may be at the root of sympathy. But then, we
realize that if we do not help this poor wretch, it is going to turn
out that, when we need help, no one will come to our aide. There is a
“need” to help the suffering. For Bergson, these two
phases are “inferior forms of pity.”</p>

<p>True pity, therefore, involves not so much fearing pain as
desiring it. It is as if “nature” has committed a great
injustice and what we want is to be seen as not complicit with it. As
Bergson says, “The essence of pity is thus a need for
self-abasement, an aspiration downward” into pain. But, this
painful aspiration develops into a sense of being superior. We realize
that we can do without certain sensuous goods; we are superior to them
since we have managed to dissociate ourselves from them. In the end,
one feels humility, humble since we are now stripped of these sensuous
goods. Now, Bergson calls this feeling “a qualitative
progress.” It consists in a “transition from repugnance to
fear, from fear to sympathy, and from sympathy itself to
humility.”  The genius of Bergson’s description is that
there is a heterogeneity of feelings here, and yet no one would be
able to juxtapose them or say that one negates the other. There is no
negation in the duration. We shall return to this important point
concerning negation when discussing “Creative
Evolution.”  In any case, the feelings are continuous with
one another; they interpenetrate one another, and there is even an
opposition between inferior needs and superior needs. A qualitative
multiplicity is therefore heterogeneous (or singularized), continuous
(or interpenetrating), oppositional (or dualistic) at the extremes,
and progressive (or temporal, an irreversible flow, which is not given
all at once). Because a qualitative multiplicity is heterogeneous and
yet interpenetrating, it cannot be adequately represented by a symbol;
indeed, for Bergson, a qualitative multiplicity is inexpressible.
Bergson also calls the last characteristic of temporal progress
mobility. For Bergson — and perhaps this is his greatest insight
— freedom is mobility. Because Bergson connects duration with
mobility, in the second half of the Twentieth Century (in Deleuze and
Foucault, in particular), the Bergsonian concept of qualitative
multiplicity will be dissociated from time and associated with space
(Deleuze 1986).</p>

<p>

In his “Introduction to Metaphysics,” Bergson gives us
three images to help us think about the duration and therefore
qualitative multiplicities (The Creative Mind, pp. 164–65). The first
is that of two spools, with a tape running between them, one spool
unwinding the tape, the other winding it up. (During his discussion of
Bergson, Heidegger focuses on this image in his 1928 <em>The
Metaphysical Foundations of Logic</em>.) Duration resembles this image,
according to Bergson, because, as we grow older, our future grows
smaller and our past larger. The benefit of this image is that it
presents a continuity of experiences without juxtaposition. Yet, there
is a drawback: because a tape moves between the two spools, the image
presents the duration as being homogeneous, as if one could fold the
tape back over its other parts, as if the tape were super-posable,
implying that two moments in consciousness might be identical. Yet, as
Bergson says, “no two moments are identical in a conscious
being” (<em>The Creative Mind</em>, p. 164). Duration, for
Bergson, is continuity of progress and heterogeneity; moreover, thanks
to this image, we can also see that duration implies a conservation of
the past. Indeed, for Bergson and this is the center of his truly novel
idea of memory, memory conserves the past and this conservation does
not imply that one experiences the same (re-cognition), but difference.
One moment is added onto the old ones, and thus, when the next moment
occurs, it is added onto all the other old ones plus the one that came
immediately before. In comparison, therefore to the past collection of
moments, it cannot be the same as the one immediately before, because
the past is “larger” for the current moment than it was for
the previous moment. Although Bergson does not say this, one might say
that Tuesday is different from Monday because Monday only includes
itself and Sunday, while Tuesday includes itself, Monday, and Sunday.
This first image, therefore, implies that duration is memory: the
prolongation of the past into the present. We shall return to the
question of memory below.</p>

<p>

The second image of qualitative multiplicity is the color spectrum.
We saw in the first image of the spools that there is constant
difference or heterogeneity. The color spectrum helps us understand
this, since a color spectrum has a multiplicity of different shades or
nuances of color. Here we have heterogeneity, but there is a drawback
to this image as well. We lose the characteristic of continuity or
unity since the spectrum has colors juxtaposed. As Bergson says,
“pure duration excludes all idea of juxtaposition, reciprocal
exteriority and extension” (<em>The Creative Mind</em>, p.
164).</p>

<p>

Bergson’s third image is an elastic band being stretched. Bergson
tells us first to contract the band to a mathematical point, which
represents “the now” of our experience. Then, draw it out
to make a line growing progressively longer. He warns us not to focus
on the line but on the action which traces it. If we can focus on the
action of tracing, then we can see that the movement — which is
duration — is not only continuous and differentiating or
heterogeneous, but also indivisible. We can always insert breaks into
the spatial line that represents the motion, but the motion itself is
indivisible. For Bergson, there is always a priority of movement over
the things that move; the thing that moves is an abstraction from the
movement. Now, the elastic band being stretched is a more exact image
of duration. But, the image of the elastic is still, according to
Bergson, incomplete. Why ? Because, for him, no image can represent
duration. An image is immobile, while duration is “pure
mobility” (<em>The Creative Mind</em>, p. 165). Later, in
<em>Creative Evolution</em>, Bergson will criticize the new art of
cinema for presenting immobile images of movement. As Deleuze will show
in his cinema books, however, Bergson does not recognize the novelty of
this artform. Cinema does provide moving images. In any case, in
“Introduction to Metaphysics,” Bergson compares all three
images: “the unrolling of our duration [the spool] in certain
aspects resembles the unity of a movement which progresses [the
elastic], in others, a multiplicity of states spreading out [the
color-spectrum].” Now we can see that duration really consists in
two characteristics:  unity and multiplicity. This double
characteristic brings us to Bergson’s method of intuition.</p>

<h2 id="MethIntu">3. The method of intuition</h2>

<p>

As we already noted, Bergson’s thought must be seen as an attempt to
overcome Kant. In Bergson’s eyes, Kant’s philosophy is scandalous,
since it eliminates the possibility of absolute knowledge and mires
metaphysics in antinomies. Bergson’s own method of intuition is
supposed to restore the possibility of absolute knowledge – here
one should see a kinship between Bergsonian intuition and what Kant
calls intellectual intuition – and metaphysics. To do this,
intuition in Bergson’s sense must place us above the divisions of the
different schools of philosophy like rationalism and empiricism or
idealism and realism. Philosophy, for Bergson, does not consist in
choosing between concepts and in taking sides (<em>The Creative
Mind</em>, p. 175–76). These antinomies of concepts and positions,
according to him, result from the normal or habitual way our
intelligence works. Here we find Bergson’s connection to American
pragmatism. The normal way our intelligence works is guided by needs
and thus the knowledge it gathers is not disinterested; it is relative
knowledge. And how it gathers knowledge is through what Bergson calls
“analysis,” that is, the dividing of things according to
perspectives taken. Comprehensive analytic knowledge then consists in
reconstruction or re-composition of a thing by means of synthesizing
the perspectives. This synthesis, while helping us satisfy needs, never
gives us the thing itself; it only gives us a general concept of
things. Thus, intuition reverses the normal working of intelligence,
which is interested and analytic (synthesis being only a development of
analysis). In the fourth chapter to <em>Matter and Memory</em>, Bergson
calls this reversal of habitual intelligence “the turn of
experience” where experience becomes concerned with utility,
where it becomes human experience (Matter and Memory, pp.184–85). This
placement of oneself up above the turn is not easy; above all else,
Bergson appreciates effort. </p>

<p>

Intuition therefore is a kind of experience, and indeed Bergson
himself calls his thought “the true empiricism” (The
Creative Mind, p. 175). What sort of experience? In the opening pages
of “Introduction to Metaphysics,” he calls intuition
sympathy (The Creative Mind, p. 159). As we have seen from our
discussion of multiplicity in <em>Time and Free Will</em>, sympathy
consists in putting ourselves in the place of others. Bergsonian
intuition then consists in entering into the thing, rather than going
around it from the outside. This “entering into,” for
Bergson, gives us absolute knowledge. In a moment, we are going to have
to qualify this “absoluteness.” In any case, for Bergson,
intuition is entering into ourselves – he says we seize ourselves
from within – but this self-sympathy develops heterogeneously
into others. In other words, when one sympathizes with oneself, one
installs oneself within duration and then feels a “certain well
defined tension, whose very determinateness seems like a choice between
an infinity of possible durations” (The Creative Mind, p. 185).
In order to help us understand intuition, which is always an intuition
of duration, let us return to the color spectrum image. Bergson says
that we should suppose that perhaps there is no other color than
orange. Yet, if we could enter into orange, that is, if we could
sympathize with it, we would “sense ourselves caught,” as
Bergson says, “between red and yellow.” This means that if
we make an effort when we perceive orange, we sense a variety of
shades. If we make more of an effort, we sense that the darkest shade
of orange is a different color, red, while the lightest is also a
different color, yellow. Thus, we would have a sense, beneath orange,
of the whole color spectrum. So, likewise, I may introspect and
sympathize with my own duration; my duration may be the only one. But,
if I make an effort, I sense in my duration a variety of shades. In
other words, the intuition of duration puts me in contact with a whole
continuity of durations, which I could, with effort, try to follow
upwardly or downwardly, upward to spirit or downward to inert matter
(<em>The Creative Mind</em>, p. 187). Thus Bergsonian intuition is
always an intuition of what is other. Here we see that Bergson has not
only tried to break with Kant, but also with Parmenides’s philosophy of
the same.</p>

<p>

Before, we leave this discussion, it is important to realize that
intuition, understood as my self-sympathy, like the one color orange,
is what Bergson calls a “component part” (The Creative
Mind, pp. 170–72). Just as the color orange is a real part of the color
spectrum — the mathematical equation which defines the light
waves of orange, on the contrary, being not a component part, for
Bergson, but a “partial expression” – my own duration
is a real part of <em>the duration itself</em>. From this part, I can,
as Bergson would say, “dilate” or “enlarge” and
move into other durations. But this starting point in a part implies
– and Bergson himself never seems to realize this– that
intuition never gives us absolute knowledge of <em>the whole of the
duration, all the component parts of the duration</em>. The whole is
never given in an intuition; only a contracted part is given.
Nevertheless, this experience is an integral one, in the sense of
integrating an infinity of durations. And thus, even though we cannot
know all durations, every single one that comes into existence must be
related, as a part, to the others. <em>The</em> duration is that to
which everything is related and in this sense it is absolute.</p>

<p>

Because intuition in Bergson is “integral experience”
(<em>The Creative Mind</em>, p. 200), it is made up of an indefinite
series of acts, which correspond to the degrees of duration. This
series of acts is why Bergson calls intuition a method. The first act
is a kind of leap, and the idea of a leap is opposed to the idea of a
re-constitution after analysis. One should make the effort to reverse
the habitual mode of intelligence and set oneself up immediately in the
duration. But then, second, one should make the effort to dilate one’s
duration into a continuous heterogeneity. Third, one should make the
effort to differentiate (as with the color orange) the extremes of this
heterogeneity. With the second and third steps, one can see a
similarity to Plato’s idea of dialectic understood as collection and
division. The method resembles that of the good butcher who knows how
to cut at the articulations or the good tailor who knows how to sew
pieces of cloth together into clothes that fit. On the basis of the
division into extremes or into a duality, one can then confront our
everyday “mixtures” of the two extremes. Within the
mixture, one makes a division or “cut” into differences in
kind: into matter and spirit, for instance. Then one shows how the
duality is actually a monism, how the two extremes are
“sewn” together, through memory, in the continuous
heterogeneity of duration. Indeed, for Bergson, intuition is memory; it
is not perception.</p>

<h2 id="PercMemo">4. Perception and memory</h2>

<p>

Since its publication in 1896, <em>Matter and Memory</em> has attracted
considerable attention (see, for example, Deleuze 1956). In the Preface
that he wrote in 1910, Bergson says that <em>Matter and Memory</em> “is
frankly dualistic,” since it “affirms both the reality of
matter and the reality of spirit” (Matter and Memory, p. 9). However, he
is quick to warn us that the aim of the book is really “to
overcome the theoretical difficulties which have always beset
dualism” (ibid.). In the history of philosophy, these theoretical
difficulties have generally arisen from a view of external perception,
which always seems to result in an opposition between representation
and matter. Thus, Bergson’s theory of “pure perception,”
laid out in the first chapter of Matter and Memory aims to show that
— beyond both realism and idealism — our knowledge of
things, in its pure state, takes place within the things it
represents.</p>

<p>

But, in order to show this, Bergson starts with a hypothesis that all
we sense are images. Now we can see the basis of Bergson’s use of
images in his method of intuition. He is re-stating the problem of
perception in terms of images because it seems to be an intermediate
position between realism and idealism (Matter and Memory, p. 26).
Bergson is employing the concept of image to dispel the false belief
— central to realism and materialism — that matter is a
thing that possesses a hidden power able to produce representations in
us. There is no hidden power in matter; matter is only
images. Bergson, however, not only criticizes materialism (its theory
of hidden powers), but also idealism insofar as idealism attempts to
reduce matter to the representation we have of it. For Bergson, image
differs from representation, but it does not differ in nature from
representation since Bergson’s criticism of materialism consists in
showing that matter does not differ in nature from representation. For
Bergson, the image is less than a thing but more than a
representation. The “more” and the “less”
indicates that representation differs from the image by degree. It
also indicates that perception is continuous with images of
matter. Through the hypothesis of the image, Bergson is re-attaching
perception to the real.</p>

<p>

In perception — Bergson demonstrates this point through his
theory of pure perception — the image of a material thing becomes
a representation. A representation is always in the image virtually. We
shall return to this concept of virtuality below. In any case, in
perception, there is a transition from the image as being in itself to
its being for me. But, perception adds nothing new to the image; in
fact, it subtracts from it. Representation is a diminution of the
image; the transition from image to pure perception is
“discernment in the etymological sense of the word,” a
“slicing up” or a “selection” (Matter and
Memory, p. 38). According to Bergson, selection occurs because of
necessities or utility based in our bodies. In other words, conscious
representation results from the suppression of what has no interest for
bodily functions and the conservation only of what does interest bodily
functions. The conscious perception of a living being therefore
exhibits a “necessary poverty” ( Matter and
Memory, p. 38).</p>

<p>

If we can circle back for a moment, although Bergson shows that we
perceive things in the things, the necessary poverty of perception
means that it cannot define intuition. Turning back from the habitual
use of intelligence for needs, intuition, as we can see now, places us
above or below representations. Intuition is fundamentally
un-representative. In this regard, the following passage from the third
chapter of <em>Matter and Memory</em> becomes very important:</p>

<blockquote>If you abolish my consciousness … matter resolves
itself into numberless vibrations, all linked together in uninterrupted
continuity, all bound up with each other, and traveling in every
direction like shivers. In short, try first to connect together the
discontinuous objects of daily experience; then, resolve the motionless
continuity of these qualities into vibrations, which are moving in
place; finally, attach yourself to these movements, by freeing yourself
from the divisible space that underlies them in order to consider only
their mobility – this undivided act that your consciousness
grasps in the movement that you yourself execute. You will obtain a
vision of matter that is perhaps fatiguing for your imagination, but
pure and stripped of what the requirements of life make you add to it
in external perception. Reestablish now my consciousness, and with it,
the requirements of life: farther and farther, and by crossing over
each time enormous periods of the internal history of things,
quasi-instantaneous views are going to be taken, views this time
pictorial, of which the most vivid colors condense an infinity of
repetitions and elementary changes. In just the same way the thousands
of successive positions of a runner are contracted into one sole
symbolic attitude, which our eye perceives, which art reproduces, and
which becomes for everyone the image of a man who runs (<em>Matter and
Memory</em>, pp.208–209).</blockquote>

<p>

Like the descriptions of intuition, this passage describes how we
can resolve the images of matter into mobile vibrations. In this way,
we overcome the inadequacy of all images of duration. We would have to
call the experience described here not a perception of matter, but a
memory of matter because of its richness. As we have already suggested,
Bergsonian intuition is memory. So, we turn now to memory.</p>

<p>

As we saw in the discussion of method above, Bergson always makes a
differentiation within a mixture. Therefore, he sees that our word
“memory” mixes together two different kinds of memories. On
the one hand, there is habit-memory, which consists in obtaining
certain automatic behavior by means of repetition; in other words, it
coincides with the acquisition of sensori-motor mechanisms. On the
other hand, there is true or “pure” memory; it is the
survival of personal memories, a survival that, for Bergson, is
unconscious. In other words, we have habit-memory actually aligned with
bodily perception. Pure memory is something else, and here we encounter
Bergson’s famous (or infamous) image of the memory cone.</p>

<p>

The image of the inverted cone occurs twice in the third chapter of
<em>Matter and Memory</em> (pp. 152 and 162). The image of the cone is
constructed with a plane and an inverted cone whose summit is inserted
into the plane. The plane, “plane P,” as Bergson calls it,
is the “plane of my actual representation of the
universe.”  The cone “SAB,” of course, is
supposed to symbolize memory, specifically, the true memory or
regressive memory. At the cone’s base, “AB,” we have
unconscious memories, the oldest surviving memories, which come
forward spontaneously, for example, in dreams. As we descend, we have
an indefinite number of different regions of the past ordered by their
distance or nearness to the present. The second cone image represents
these different regions with horizontal lines trisecting the cone. At
the summit of the cone, “S,” we have the image of my body
which is concentrated into a point, into the present perception. The
summit is inserted into the plane and thus the image of my body
“participates in the plane” of my actual representation of
the universe.</p>

<p>

The inverted cone image is no exception to Bergson’s belief that all
images are inadequate to duration. The inverted cone is really supposed
to symbolize a dynamic process, mobility. Memories are descending down
the cone from the past to the present perception and action. The idea
that memories are descending means that true memory in Bergson is
progressive. This progressive movement of memory as a whole takes
place, according to Bergson, between the extremes of the base of
“pure memory,” which is immobile and which Bergson calls
“contemplation” (Matter and Memory, p. 163), and the plane
where action takes place. Whenever Bergson in any of his works mentions
contemplation, he is thinking of Plotinus, on whom he lectured many
times. But, in contrast to Plotinus, for Bergson, thinking is not mere
contemplation; it is the entire or integral movement of memory between
contemplation and action. Thinking, for Bergson, occurs when pure
memory moves forward into singular images. This forward movement occurs
by means of two movements which the inverted cone symbolizes. On the
one hand, the cone is supposed to rotate. Bergson compares the
experience of true memory to a telescope, which allows us to understand
the rotating movement. What we are supposed to visualize with the cone
is a telescope that we are pointing up at the night sky. Thus, when I
am trying to remember something, I at first see nothing all. What will
help us understand this image is the idea of my character. When I
try to remember how my character came about, at first, I might not
remember anything; no image might at first come to mind. Pure memory
for Bergson precedes images; it is unconscious. But, I try to focus, as
if I were rotating the rings that control the lenses in the
“telescope”; then some singular images come into view.
Rotation is really the key to Bergson’s concept of virtuality. Always,
we start with something like the Milky Way, a cloud of
interpenetration; but then the cloud starts to condense into singular
drops, into singular stars. This movement from interpenetration to
fragmentation, from unity to multiplicity, (and even from multiplicity
to juxtaposition) is always potential or virtual. But the reverse
process is also virtual. Therefore the cone has a second movement,
“contraction” (<em>Matter and Memory</em>, p. 168). If we
remain with the telescope image, we can see that the images of the
constellation must be narrowed, brought down the tube so that they will
fit into my eye. Here we have a movement from singular images to
generalities, on which action can be based. The movement of memory
always results in action. But also, for Bergson, this twofold movement
of rotation and contraction can be repeated in language. Even though
Bergson never devotes much reflection to language – we shall
return to this point below– he is well aware that literary
creation resembles natural creation. Here we should consult his early
essay on laughter. But, with this creative movement, which is memory,
we can turn to creative evolution.</p>

<h2 id="CreaEvol">5. Creative evolution</h2>

<p>

For Bergson, the notion of life mixes together two opposite senses,
which must be differentiated and then led into a genuine unity. On the
one hand, it is clear from Bergson’s earlier works that life is the
absolute temporal movement informed by duration and retained in memory.
But, on the other hand, he has shown that life also consists in the
practical necessities imposed on our body and accounting for our
habitual mode of knowing in spatial terms. More specifically then,
Bergson’s project in <em>Creative Evolution</em> is to offer a
philosophy capable of accounting both for the continuity of all living
beings—as creatures—and for the discontinuity implied in
the evolutionary quality of this creation. Bergson starts out by
showing that the only way in which the two senses of life may be
reconciled (without being collapsed) is to examine real life, the real
evolution of the species, that is, the phenomenon of change and its
profound causes. His argument consists of four main steps. First, he
shows that there must be an original common impulse which explains the
creation of all living species; this is his famous vital impulse
(élan vital). Second, the diversity resulting from evolution
must be accounted for as well. If the original impulse is common to all
life, then there must also be a principle of divergence and
differentiation that explains evolution; this is Bergson’s tendency
theory. Third, the two main diverging tendencies that account for
evolution can ultimately be identified as instinct on the one hand and
intelligence on the other. Human knowledge results from the form and
the structure of intelligence. We learned from “The Introduction
to Metaphysics” that intelligence consists precisely in an
analytic, external, hence essentially practical and spatialized
approach to the world. Unlike instinct, human intelligence is therefore
unable to attain to the essence of life in its duration. The
paradoxical situation of humanity (the only species that wants to know
life is also the only one that cannot do so) must therefore be
overcome. So, fourth, the effort of intuition what allows us to place
ourselves back within the original creative impulse so as to overcome
the numerous obstacles that stand in the way of true knowledge (which
are instantiated in the history of metaphysics). We are going to look
at each of these four steps. </p>

<p>

First, we are going to look at the concept of vital impulse. In
<em>Creative Evolution</em>, Bergson starts out by criticizing
mechanism as it applies to the concepts of life and evolution. The
mechanistic approach would preclude the possibility of any real change
or creativity, as each development would be potentially contained in
the preceding ones. However, Bergson continues, the teleological
approach of traditional finalism equally makes genuine creation of the
new impossible, since it entails, just as mechanism, that the
“whole is given.” Therefore, neither mechanism nor strict
finalism can give a satisfying account of the phenomenon of change that
characterizes life. Nevertheless, Bergson argues, there is a certain
form of finalism that would adequately account for the creation of life
while allowing for the diversity resulting from creation. It is the
idea of an original vital principle. If there is a telos to life, then,
it must be situated at the origin and not at the end (contra
traditional finalism), and it must embrace the whole of life in one
single indivisible embrace (contra mechanism). But, this hypothesis
does not yet account for evolution in the diversity of its products,
nor does it explain the principle of the nature of life.</p>

<p>

Second, we turn to Bergson’s account of the
“complexification” of life, that is, the phenomenon of its
evolution from the simple original vital impulse into different
species, individuals, and organs. The successive series of bifurcations
and differentiations that life undergoes organize itself into two great
opposite tendencies, namely, instinct and intelligence. Bergson arrives
at this fundamental distinction by considering the different modes
through which creatures act in and know the external world. Animals are
distinguished from plants on the basis of their mobility, necessitated
by their need to find food,whereas plants survive and grow through
photosynthesis, which does not require locomotion. While the
relationship between consciousness and matter instantiated in the
instinct of animals is sufficient and well adapted to their survival
(from the point of view of the species), humans are not adequately
equipped in this respect; hence the necessity of something like
intelligence, defined by the ability to make tools. Humanity is
essentially <em>homo faber</em>. Once again, from the point of view of
real, concrete life that Bergson is here embracing, intelligence is
essentially defined by its pragmatic orientation (and not speculation,
as a dogmatic intellectualist approach would assume). From this,
Bergson deduces not only the cognitive structure and the scientific
history of intelligence (which he examines in detail), but also its
limitations. This essentially pragmatic, hence analytic and
quantitative orientation of intelligence precludes its immediate access
to the essentially qualitative nature of life. Notice that the
distinction between the two tendencies relies on the original
distinction between the qualitative and the quantitative
multiplicities. In any case, in order that human intelligence may
attain true knowledge of the essence of the vital impulse, it will have
to proceed by means of a mode of knowing that lies at the opposite end
of intelligence, namely, instinct.</p>

<p>

Throughout <em>Creative Evolution</em>, Bergson’s crucial point is
that life must be equated with creation, as creativity alone can
adequately account for both the continuity of life and the
discontinuity of the products of evolution. But now the question is: if
humans only possess analytic intelligence, then how are we ever to know
the essence of life? Bergson’s answer — his third step — is
that, because at the periphery of intelligence a fringe of instinct
survives, we are able fundamentally to rejoin the essence of life. For,
as the tendency and the multiplicity theories made clear, instinct and
intelligence are not simply self-contained and mutually exclusive
states. They must be called tendencies precisely because they are both
rooted in, hence inseparable from, the duration that informs all life,
all change, all becoming. There is, therefore, a little bit of instinct
surviving within each intelligent being, making it immediately —
if only partially — coincide with the original vital impulse.
This partial coincidence, as we described above, is what founds
intuition.</p>

<p>

Finally, we can return to the question of intuition. Thanks to
intuition, humanity can turn intelligence against itself so as to seize
life itself. By a very different route than the one we saw before,
Bergson shows, once again, that our habitual way of knowing, based in
needs, is the only obstacle to knowledge of the absolute. Here he
argues that this obstacle consists in the idea of disorder. All
theories of knowledge have in one way or another attempted to explain
meaning and consistency by assuming the contingency of order. The
traditional question, “why is there order rather than
disorder?” necessarily assumes that the human mind is able to
create order mysteriously out of chaos. But, for Bergson, the real
question is: “order is certainly contingent, but in relation to
what” (Creative Evolution, p. 232)? His answer consists
in showing that it is not a matter of order versus disorder, but rather
of one order in relation to another. According to Bergson, it is the
same reasoning that underlies the ideas of chance (as opposed to
necessity), and of nothingness (as opposed to existence). In a word,
the real is essentially positive. The real obeys a certain kind of
organization, namely, that of the qualitative multiplicity. Structured
around its needs and interests, our intelligence fails to recognize
this ultimate reality.</p>

<p>

However, a fringe of intuition remains, dormant most of the time yet
capable of awakening when certain vital interests are at stake. The
role of the philosopher is to seize those rare and discontinuous
intuitions in order to support them, then dilate them and connect them
to one another. In this process, philosophy realizes that intuition
coincides with spirit, and eventually with life itself. Intuition and
intelligence thus each correspond to tendencies within the human
<em>psyche</em>, which, as whole, thereby coincides immediately —
if only partially — with the vital impulse. It is only by leaping
into intuition that the ultimate unity of mental life appears, for,
just as Bergson showed against Zeno, that mobility cannot be
reconstructed out of immobility. Here he explains that while one can go
from intuition to intelligence by way of diminution, the analytic
nature of intelligence precludes the opposite process. Thus Bergson
concludes, “philosophy introduces us into spiritual life. And at
the same time, it shows us the relation of the life of spirit to the
life of the body” (Creative Evolution, p. 268). In a
word, it is life in its creativity which unifies the simplicity of
spirit with the diversity of matter. And it is a certain kind of
philosophy, insofar as it is able to place itself back within the
creative impulse, which is capable of realizing the necessary
“complementarity” of the diverse, partial views
instantiated in the different branches of scientific knowledge and
metaphysical thought — so as to reestablish the absoluteness of
knowledge, defined by its coincidence with absolute becoming.</p>

<h2 id="TwoSourMoraReli">6. The two sources of morality and religion</h2>

<p>

Bergson himself says that his final book, <em>The Two Sources of
Morality and Religion</em>, develops ideas from <em>Creative
Evolution</em>. It attempts to show that there are two sources from
which two kinds of morality and religion evolve. As always with
Bergson, Kant is at issue, in this case his moral philosophy. And as
usual, Bergson starts by differentiating within a mixture. Under the
word “morality” or under the phrase “moral
obligation,” there is a mixture of two kinds of morality.</p>

<p>

There is the closed morality, whose religion is static, and there is
the open morality, whose religion is dynamic. Closed morality and
static religion are concerned with social cohesion. Nature has made
certain species evolve in such a way that the individuals in these
species cannot exist on their own. They are fragile and require the
support of a community. One quickly thinks of bees, and Bergson, of
course, refers to them. We can see again that there are bodily needs
which must be satisfied. The force of these needs is the source of the
closed morality. Because of these needs, there is a rigidity to the
rules of closed moralities. Kant’s moral philosophy has its
source in such needs. The survival of the community requires that there
be strict obedience: the categorical imperative. Yet, although Kant’s
categorical imperative is supposed to be universal, it is not,
according to Bergson. It is limited and particular. Closed morality
really concerns the survival of a society, my society. Therefore, it
always excludes other societies. Indeed, for Bergson, closed morality
is always concerned with war. And static religion, the religion of
closed morality, is based on what Bergson calls the “fabulation
function.” The fabulation function is a particular function of
the imagination that creates “voluntary hallucinations.”
The fabulation function takes our sense that there is a presence
watching over us and invents images of gods. These images then insure
strict obedience to the closed morality. In short, they insure social
cohesion.</p>

<p>

But, there is another kind of morality and religion, according to
Bergson. The open morality and dynamic religion are concerned with
creativity and progress. They are not concerned with social cohesion,
and thus Bergson calls this morality “open” because it
includes everyone. The open morality is genuinely universal and it
aims at peace. It aims at an “open society.” The source of the open
morality is what Bergson calls “creative emotions.” The
difference between creative emotions and normal emotions consists in
this: in normal emotions, we first have a representation which causes
the feeling (I see my friend and then I feel happy); in creative
emotion, we first have the emotion which then creates
representations. So, Bergson gives us the example of the joy of a
musician who, on the basis of emotion, creates a symphony, and who then
produces representations of the music in the score. We can see here
that Bergson has also finally explained how the leap of an intuition
happens. The creative emotion makes one unstable and throws one out of
the habitual mode of intelligence, which is directed at needs. Indeed,
in <em>The Two Sources</em>, Bergson compares creative emotions to
unstable mental states as those found in the mad. But what he really
has in mind is mystical experience. For Bergson, however, mystical
experience is not simply a disequilibrium. Genuine mystical experience
must result in action; it cannot remain simple contemplation of
God. This association of creative emotions with mystical experience
means that, for Bergson, dynamic religion is mystical. Indeed, dynamic
religion, because it is always creative, cannot be associated with any
particular organized set of doctrines. A religion with organized
– and rigid — doctrines is always static.</p>

<p>

The phrase with which we began, “moral obligation,”
makes one think of Kantian duty. We have alluded to Kant on several
occasions, but, let us conclude by examining Bergson’s explicit
criticism of Kant’s moral philosophy. This criticism will demonstrate
the strength of Bergson’s moral philosophy and of his thought as a
whole. According to Bergson, Kant’s theory has made a
“psychological error.” In any given society, there are many
different, particular obligations. The individual in society may at
some time desire to deviate from one particular obligation. When this
illicit desire arises, there will be resistance from society but also
from his habits. If the individual resists these resistances, a
psychological state of tension or contraction occurs. The individual,
in other words, experiences the rigidity of the obligation. Now,
according to Bergson, when philosophers such as Kant attribute a severe
aspect to duty, they have externalized this experience of obligation’s
inflexibility. In fact, for Bergson, if we ignore the multiplicity of
particular obligations in any given society, and if instead we look at
what he calls “the whole of obligation” (<em>The Two
Sources</em>, p. 25), then we see that obedience to obligation is
almost natural. According to Bergson, obligations, that is, customs,
arise because of the natural need an individual has for the stability
that a society can give. As a result of this natural need, society
inculcates habits of obedience in the individual. Habituation means
that obedience to the whole of obligation is, in fact, for the
individual, effortless.</p>

<p>

The psychological error then consists in externalizing an
exceptional experience – which Bergson calls “resistance to
the resistances” – into a moral theory. Duty becomes severe
and inflexible. But there is more to this error. Kant believes
that he can resolve obligation into rational elements. In the
experience of resistance to the resistances, the individual has an
illicit desire. And, since the individual is intelligent, the
individual uses intelligence, a rational method, to act on itself.
According to Bergson, what is happening here is that the rational
method is merely restoring the force of the original tendency to obey
the whole of obligation that society has inculcated in the individual.
But as Bergson notes, the tendency is one thing; the rational method is
another. The success of the rational method, however, gives us the
illusion that the force with which an individual obeys any particular
obligation comes from reason, that is, from the idea or representation,
or better still, from the formula of the obligation.</p>

<p>

But, there is another force. The second force is what Bergson calls
“the impetus of love” (<em>The Two Sources</em>, p. 96).
The impetus of love, like joy but also like sympathy, is a creative
emotion. The emotion must be explicated into actions and
representations. But, this process of explication can be extended. The
representations that the mystic explicates can be further explicated
into formulas, for example, the formula of each person being deserving
of respect and dignity. These formulas, which are the expression of
creation and love, are now able to be mixed with the formulas that aim
solely to insure the stability of any given society. Since we are now
speaking only of formulas, creation and cohesion, the two forces, are
mixed together in reason. As before, whereas the rational method used
in the experience of resistance to the resistances comes to explain the
force of obedience, here in the mystical experience of the impetus of
love the formulas come to explain the force of creation. A reversal has
taken place. The very forces that have generated the formulas are
instead now being explained by those very formulas. Indeed, this is the
problem. How could some representation of intelligence have the power
to train the will?  How could an idea categorically demand its own
realization?  As Bergson says, “Re-establish the duality [of
forces], the difficulties vanish” (<em>The Two Sources</em>, p.
96). The two forces are, however, but two complementary manifestations
of life.</p>

<h2 id="ReviBerg">7. The revitalization of Bergsonism</h2>

<p>

There are numerous reasons for Bergson’s disappearance from the
philosophical scene after World War II. First, at least in France, a
new generation of philosophers was arising, in particular, Sartre and
Merleau-Ponty. Like any new generation, this one had to differentiate
itself from the tradition it was inheriting; in many respects,
Bergson’s thought dominated this tradition. But more important was the
fact that Sartre and Merleau-Ponty became interested in Husserlian
phenomenology, and then in Heidegger’s thought. The influence of German
philosophy on post-World War II French thought is well known. It
contributed to the eclipse of Bergson. But, there are some aspects of
Bergson’s thought itself which contributed to this eclipse. On the one
hand, there is Bergson’s constant suspicion of language; for Bergson,
as we noted in the discussion of intuition, language is equivalent to
symbols. And, symbols divide the continuity of the duration, leading us
into illusions. Bergson’s criticisms of language, moreover, must have
struck the generation of French philosophers who came of age in the
1960s as strange. Philosophers such as Derrida had so thoroughly
embraced Heidegger that they believed that “language is the house
of being.” On the other hand, there is the mysticism of <em>The
Two Sources</em>. The striking religious tone of this book did not
harmonize well with Husserl’s phenomenology, which aimed to be a
rigorous science. </p>

<p>

Yet, we can speak of a recent revitalization of Bergsonism. 
This revitalization is due almost entirely to Deleuze. As we have come
to understand Deleuze’s own thought better, we can see the overwhelming
influence of Bergson. In particular, two aspects of Bergson’s thought
attracted Deleuze. We have already mentioned one of them: the concept
of multiplicity. This concept is at the very heart of Deleuze’s
thought, and duration is the model for all of Deleuze’s
“becomings.”  The other aspect that attracted Deleuze,
which is indeed connected to the first, is Bergson’s criticism of the
concept of negation in <em>Creative Evolution</em>. We must recall that the
linguistic turn in France during the 1960s was accompanied by an
“anti-Hegelianism.” Thus Bergson became a resource in the
criticism of the Hegelian dialectic, the negative. Moreover, at the end
of his life, Merleau-Ponty was also coming to realize that Bergson’s
criticism of negation is philosophically important; for Merleau-Ponty,
the criticism seemed to function like Husserl’s “phenomenological
reduction,” and perhaps re-opened what Heidegger would call the
question of being. But, overall, we must see that a revitalization of
Bergsonism became possible because of Deleuze’s insistence that
Bergsonism is an alternative to the domination of phenomenological
thought, including that of Heidegger. The revitalization of Bergsonism
leads to a revitalization of the question of life itself, and not to
the retrieval of the question of being.</p>

<p>

If Deleuze indeed presents a penetrating criticism of Heidegger, it
lies in the claim that being (<em>Sein</em>) is a unity and not a
multiplicity (and in this regard Deleuze’s criticism of Heidegger
resembles a great deal that of Derrida who always targets Heidegger’s
idea of gathering [<em>Versammlung</em>]). For Deleuze (and perhaps
for Derrida as well), the lack of an idea of multiplicity affects
Heidegger’s conception of a people. Even if the people in Heidegger
are still coming, they will have a proper name that indicates their
community will be unified and perhaps closed. In contrast. the people
to come in Deleuze (and the democracy to come in Derrida) remain in
need of a name which indicates that this people is a genuine
multiplicity. Perhaps in these ideas of an always still to be named
coming community, we find the enduring influence of Bergson’s
“open society.” The most recent moment of the Bergson
revitalization follows on the idea of a people. Andrea J. Pitts and Mark William Westmoreland published a volume called: <em>Beyond Bergson: Exploring Race, Gender,
and Colonialism through the Writings of Henri Bergson (SUNY 2019)</em>.

</p><p>

Apart from Deleuze, and more recently, Frederic Worms has led the way
toward Bergson’s revitalization in France. Worms founded the Societe
des amis de Bergson in 2006. In 2019, several members of the Societe
des amis de Bergson founded the Global Bergson Research Project whose
purpose lies in rediscovering Bergson’s influence all over the globe.
