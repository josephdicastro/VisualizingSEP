<h1>The Literal-Nonliteral Distinction in Classical Indian Philosophy</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Sat Nov 26, 2016; substantive revision Thu Dec 3, 2020</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
Indian thinkers distinguish between literal and non-literal meaning
early in their history. They do so within different intellectual
disciplines (<em>śāstra</em>-s), each broadly philosophical,
but with varying emphases. Within the grammatical discipline,
Yāska’s <em>Semantic Explanation</em> (<em>Nirukta</em>),
an early (perhaps 6<sup>th</sup> century to 3<sup>rd</sup> century
BCE) etymological treatise recognizes the difference between ordinary
(<em>laukika</em>) and metaphorical language (<em>upamā</em>).
This text, possibly pre-dating the renowned Sanskrit grammarian
Pāṇini (ca 4<sup>th</sup> century BCE), employs
etymological analysis in order to ascertain the meanings of unfamiliar
terms used in the Vedas, a collection of texts including religious
hymns, poetry, and rituals. In portions of the Vedas called
Upaniṣads, widely recognized as proto-philosophical, the limits
of language are made explicit: ordinary speech cannot characterize
ultimate reality, though figurative language can hint at it. These
early texts focus on topics which would give rise to three
intellectual disciplines: Grammar, Philosophy, and Aesthetics.
(Capital letters distinguish the schools of thought from their subject
matter.)</p>

<p>
Two of the three disciplines, Grammar and Philosophy, are identifiable
by their relationship to early “root” texts which form the
basis of later commentarial reflection. Within Grammar, the
aforementioned Yāska, as well as Pāṇini,
Patañjali (ca 2<sup>nd</sup> century CE), and Bhartṛhari
(ca 5<sup>th</sup> century CE), are a few of the most crucial thinkers
whose reflections—on the structure of Sanskrit in particular,
and by way of Sanskrit, language in general—informed
philosophical reflection on meaning. For instance,
Pāṇini’s analysis of the morphology, syntax, and
semantics of Sanskrit, in his <em>Eight Chapters</em>
(<em>Aṣṭādhyāyī</em>) continues to be cited
by philosophers a thousand years later. The literal/non-literal
distinction is a topic as well for the various philosophical schools,
each one known as a <em>darśana</em>, roughly a
“viewpoint.” Both those who accept the Vedas as
authoritative and those who do not address the distinction in the
context of testimony and theories of reference. Among the former Vedic
thinkers, this article primarily treats the Nyāya and
Mīmāṃsā philosophical traditions, and of the
Veda-denying, the Buddhists and the Jainas. Finally, the tradition
here called Aesthetics (<em>alaṃkāra</em>) is primarily
focused on the aesthetics of poetry and drama—especially the
courtly poetry known as <em>kāvya</em>. It encompasses topics
studied in rhetoric, poetics, and aesthetics.
<em>Alaṃkāra</em>, despite meaning
“embellishment” or “ornamentation,” (in
reference to figures of speech), studies the psychology of utterances,
their ensuing emotional states in audiences, and their logical or
semantic structures. Until the highly influential <em>Light on
Suggestion</em> (<em>Dhvanyāloka</em>) of Ānandavardhana (ca
9<sup>th</sup> century CE), aesthetic theory was primarily, though not
exclusively, focused on taxonomies of figuration, but after
Ānandavardhana, it drew on philosophical work, in particular
Mīmāṃsā, to theorize about meaning itself.</p>

<p>
What follows focuses on the conceptual space for Indian theorizing
about literal and non-literal meaning in each of these three textual
traditions. Since the article’s structure is topical rather than
historical, a chronology of major figures is appended to help orient
readers. The focus of the article is the period demarcated roughly
from 200 CE to 1300 CE, often characterized as the Classical Period of
Indian philosophy.</p>

<h2 id="ConcLangIndiPhil">1. Conceptions of language in Indian philosophy</h2>

<p>
Before delving into the various disputes in Indian philosophy over
what is commonly termed “literal meaning,” let us first
identify the cluster of concepts and corresponding terms Indian
philosophers use in their analysis of meaning. The Sanskrit term for
“meaning,” <em>artha</em>, has a semantic range that
includes also “object,” “wealth,” and
“goal.” It can be used both for external referents of
words as well as meanings “in the head,” although the term
for occurrent mental states is frequently <em>jñāna</em>,
usually translated as “cognition” or
“awareness.” Both words and sentences are said to have
meanings, although in what manner they have them, and how word- and
sentence-meanings interrelate are subjects of debate.</p>

<h3 id="IdenLingCapa">1.1 Identifying Linguistic Capacities</h3>

<p>
Whether in the form of words or sentences, language has
capacities—it can refer to things, cause mental cognitions,
impel action, prompt emotional states, and so on. That such an ability
exists is accepted by everyone, although thinkers enumerate the
linguistic capacities differently, and also identify different results
for them. In terms of outcomes, the meaning which results from the
most fundamental linguistic capacity of the word is said to be
“principal” (<em>mukhya</em>) or “denoted”
(<em>abhidhā</em>). This meaning is sometimes defined in terms of
its being understood immediately after speech, by hearers. (The extent
to which the phenomenology of language comprehension guides
distinctions about meaning is addressed further below.) For some
philosophers, from the cognition that this meaning causes, another
linguistic capacity can subsequently operate, given certain
conditions, to generate a new, “secondary” meaning. This
further meaning is sometimes carved into two varieties: indication
(<em>lakṣaṇā</em>) and qualitative expression
(<em>gauṇavṛtti</em>), something like metonymy and
metaphor respectively, although this is to generalize over
distinctions important especially in Aesthetics. Two other capacities
are sometimes adduced: purport (<em>tātparya</em>) and suggestion
(<em>dhvani</em>), which we will examine more closely below.
Initially, let us characterize the first as something like
speaker’s intention and the second as encompassing phenomena
such as connotations and implicatures which the other capacities
putatively cannot explain. In English scholarship, the first two of
these four capacities are referred to as “primary” and
“secondary,” and this article will follow this
convention.</p>

<p>
Whatever the number of capacities, they can be characterized
functionally; in fact, the term function (<em>vyāpāra</em>)
or operation (<em>vṛtti</em>) is often used in place of the word
for capacity more generally. In attempts to enumerate the capacities,
philosophers consider questions such as what the basis of a linguistic
function might be, and whether they are one-to-one or one-to-many
functions (Ganeri 2006). Discussion of
linguistic functions is important for understanding epistemology, a
topic of interest primarily to Philosophy in contrast to Grammar and
Aesthetics (see the entry on
 <a href="../epistemology-india/">epistemology in classical Indian philosophy</a>).
 These thinkers focus on how testimonial uses of language are
authoritative ways of knowing (<em>pramāṇa</em>), whether
in ordinary discourse or religious discourse such as the Vedas or the
Buddha’s speech. For one example, consider Nyāya
(“Reasoning”). In the Nyāya root text,
<em>Nyāyasūtra</em> (NS), attributed to
Akṣapāda Gautama (ca 200 CE), speech is defined as the
assertion of an authoritative person (NS 1.1.17). Since the cognitions
resulting from testimony are an important basis for acting, Nyāya
philosophers are concerned with what hearers understand from speech,
in particular, from nouns (NS 2.2.56). It is in this context that they
take up the relationship between primary and secondary meaning, and
the basis for figurative language use. Specifically, they are
concerned with whether the principal referent of a noun is—a
generic property, a particular thing, or some combination (their
preferred view).</p>

<p>
Aesthetic thinkers, especially beginning with Ānandavardhana (ca
9<sup>th</sup> century CE), focus on distinctions between the
capacities of language. Ānandavardhana himself is primarily
concerned to defend the existence of a new linguistic capacity,
suggestion (on which see
 <a href="#SuggMeanSpeaInte">section 3</a>
 below). With illustrations drawn from poetry, drama, and the epic
Mahābhārata, he argues that phonemes, words, sentences, and
entire discourse units can suggest subtle meanings, associated with an
aestheticized emotion or “flavor” (<em>rasa</em>). It is
up to later philosophers of aesthetics to explain the status of
suggestion with regard to the ordinary categories of linguistic
capacities. Some, like Mukula Bhaṭṭa (ca 9<sup>th</sup> to
10<sup>th</sup> century CE) give a reductionist account on which it is
equivalent to indication, whereas others, like Bhaṭṭa
Nāyaka (ca 900 CE) deny that it is a linguistic capacity at all,
but argue, rather, that it is psychological. Aesthetic arguments for
and against the various linguistic capacities draw on Nyāya as
well as Mīmāṃsā philosophical texts.</p>

<h3 id="AppePhen">1.2 Appeals to Phenomenology</h3>

<p>
Definitions of meaning often appeal to phenomenology, the way in which
a cognition seems to arise from hearing a word or sentence. This focus
on the psychology of language use is found in all three disciplines.
For example, the Mīmāṃsā
(“Hermeneutics”) philosopher Kumārila
Bhaṭṭa (ca 7<sup>th</sup> century CE, see entry on
 <a href="../kumaarila/">Kumārila</a>)
 writes in his <em>Exposition on Ritual Practice</em>
(<em>Tantravārttika</em>, hereafter TV) that, like a face, the
primary meaning is perceived first, before anything else, such as
secondary meaning (<em>TV</em> 3.2.1). (The Sanskrit word for a face
is <em>mukha</em>, etymologically related to <em>mukhya</em>, the term
for primary meaning.) The Grammarian Bhartṛhari argues in his
<em>Treatise on Sentences and Words</em>
(<em>Vākyapadīya</em>) that division of sentences into words
and phonemes is artificial. This is in part based his observation that
hearers experience meaning as a unified whole. He claims that what
conveys meaning is a <em>sphoṭa</em>, or “burst,”
which is partless and different from the sequence of sounds composing
a sentence (see
 <a href="#PraaMiim">section 4.3</a>
 and Matilal (1990: 84ff) for discussion
about how precisely to characterize <em>sphoṭa</em> in
relationship to meaning.) </p>

<p>
Aesthetic theorists focus on the psychology of the poet and the
hearer, in part to understand the relationship between ordinary
language and poetic language, but also to distinguish among the
varieties of poetic utterances. Among the psychological principles
widely accepted by Indian thinkers is that ordinary conventional
meanings are stronger than analytically-determined ones (Raja
1969). So the term
<em>paṅka-ja</em> has constituent parts which together mean
“mud-born” but conventionally it refers to the lotus, and
the latter meaning would come to a hearer’s mind first.
Aesthetic philosopher Mukula Bhaṭṭa argues in his
<em>Fundamentals of the Communicative Function</em>
(<em>Abhidhāvṛttamātṛkā</em>) that some
words become so conventionalized that their status as secondary
meaning is unavailable to the speaker, who takes herself to be
speaking literally (McCrea 2008, Keating
2019).</p>

<p>
However, there is a limit to the role that reflection on psychology
plays in the analysis of meaning. For early
Mīmāṃsā philosophers, only Sanskrit terms have
genuine expressive capacities.This conclusion is not due to an
investigation of the psychology of non-Sanskrit speakers, but the
principle of parsimony. It is explanatorily better to posit a
fundamental language, where word and meaning are fixed in one-to-one
correspondence, which has been corrupted by mispronunciation over time
(see <em>TV</em> 1.3.24ff). So, hearing a foreign word like
<em>gavi</em>, people understand its meaning, “cow,”
through its similarity with the correct Sanskrit word
(<em>gauḥ</em>), whether or not they are aware of the process.
This view is challenged by other philosophers, such as
Dharmakīrti in his <em>Vādanyāya</em> (<em>Norms of
Debate</em>).</p>

<h3 id="RoleSansLang">1.3 Role of Sanskrit Language</h3>

<p>
Reflection on language in Indian philosophy, for the Brahminical,
Veda-accepting traditions at least, begins and ends with the Sanskrit
language, in what has been termed “the Sanskrit
cosmopolis” (Pollock 2006). It is
not merely that Sanskrit is the vehicle for reflection on language,
but the Sanskrit language itself is a target of inquiry.
Patañjali explains the reasons for this in his <em>Great
Commentary</em> (<em>Mahābhāṣya</em>), a commentary on
Kātyāyana’s 3<sup>rd</sup> century CE commentary on
Pāṇini’s <em>Eight Chapters</em>. These reasons are
largely centered on the preservation and correct performance of Vedic
rituals. Along with these pragmatic aims, there comes the belief in a
special metaphysical and epistemic status for Sanskrit—it has
natural (<em>autpattika</em>, without beginning) connections to its
referents, which other languages lack; thus, at least in the context
of the Vedas, it can give us infallible knowledge about the world,
without the corruption of fallible human intermediaries. This
conception is not shared by all orthoprax thinkers, however, as
Nyāya philosophers argue for the conventionality of language
(NS 2.1.55).</p>

<p>
Traditions which reject Vedic authority also reject the primacy of
Sanskrit, largely preferring to write in Pāli. At a certain
point, however, and for unknown reasons, Buddhist thinkers such as
Nāgārjuna begin to write in Sanskrit (Kelly
1996). Regardless of which language they
employ, Buddhists reject the notion of an inherent connection between
the Sanskrit language and reality—indeed, they argue that no
language has such a connection—arguing as early on as the famous
<em>The Questions of King Milinda</em>
(<em>Milindapañhā</em>) that language is conventional.
Still, the fact that Naiyāyikas and Buddhists agree on the
conventional nature of language shows that the religious prominence of
Sanskrit does not necessarily entail specific philosophical
commitments about its referential capacities. However, those who take
on the assumption of an innate connection between Sanskrit word and
referent then had explanatory burdens, such as how to explain
linguistic innovation within Sanskrit and the referential capacities
of non-Sanskrit languages.</p>

<h2 id="PrimSecoMean">2. Primary and Secondary Meaning</h2>

<p>
One of the most central distinctions in Indian philosophy of language
is that between primary and secondary meaning. While this could be
characterized as the distinction between “literal” and
“non-literal” meaning, for some philosophers, word
meanings that seem intuitively literal are classified as being
secondary. For instance, the word “cow” in the sentence
“A cow is to be led out to pasture” would, according to
Mīmāṃsā philosophers following Kumārila, be
taken as an instance of secondary meaning, for reasons discussed
below. Further, since the literal/non-literal distinction in Western
philosophy of language is vexed (see the distinction
“literal/non-literal” in the entry on
 <a href="../pragmatics/#Glos">pragmatics</a>),
 this entry henceforth avoids such terminology.</p>

<h3 id="LexiMean">2.1 Lexical Meaning</h3>

<p>
Most classical Indian thinkers (some Buddhists being an important

 <a href="#Budd">section 4.1</a>)
 understand word meaning, or <em>padārtha</em>, to refer to
objects in the world, and to do so directly. For these
thinkers—Nyāya and Vaiśeṣika,
Mīmāṃsā—the referential function is
primary. However, despite broad agreement about the basic referential
function of words, they disagree about what its objects are. One such
dispute, which has implications for the primary/secondary distinction,
is over the relationship between words and universals. Kumārila
argues that the primary referent of words is a universal.
Kumārila’s reasoning is that, without words denoting the
universal property belonging to, for example, all cows, there would
not be a permanent (<em>nitya</em>) relationship between word and
referent. For if “cow” means a specific cow, Bessie, when
Bessie goes out of existence, the word lacks denotation (<em>ŚV</em>).
Further, the Vedic
injunction, “A cow is to be tied up,” can be followed in
numerous rituals—but if a specific cow were intended, it could
be followed only once. (This argument is found in early Grammatical
thought as well, see below.) Still, despite the fact that all
Mīmāṃsakas accept the requirement of fixity of word
and referent, they do not all accept the universal-denotation view.
Some agree with another philosopher, roughly contemporaneous with
Kumārila, Prabhākara (his followers are known as
“Prābhākaras,” with the first long
“ā” equivalent to the English “-an” as in
“Fregean”). They reject the universal-denotation view in
connection with their view of sentence meaning (see
 <a href="#SentMean">sections 4.3 and 5.1</a>).</p>
 

<p>
In contrast, in the NS and its commentaries, Nyāya philosophers
argue that words refer to universals, forms, and individual things.
They point out that universals are never instantiated without
particular things, and so the universal alone cannot be the referent.
But likewise, since universals are identified by form (a cow is
recognized as having cowhood by its particular structure), we must
also take it into account. Replying to Mīmāṃsā
philosophers who defend and refine the universals-denotation view,
along with other opponents who defend individual- and form-only views,
Nyāya philosophers defend and refine the context-dependent view.
Vātsyāyana, for example, in the <em>Commentary on
Nyāya</em> (<em>Nyāyabhāṣya</em>, hereafter NBh),
argues for an epistemic point, that “It is not known which among
these is the object or meaning of the word, or whether all of them
might be meant” (NBh 2.2.59; Dasti and
Phillips 2017). He takes on arguments from interlocutors who
argue that only the individual or the universal is meant by words.
Vātsyāyana observes that, to take the example of
“cow” again, one never encounters a bare particular
(individual). Rather, the individual cow is always found to be
qualified by the universal. <em>Ceteris paribis</em> for universals,
which do not exist apart from individuals. So it is possible that both
universal and particular are meant together, along with form or shape
(<em>ākṛti</em>), though in a structured relationship where
one is predominant and the others are subsidiary, the particular
structure depending on context. See Dasti
2020 for a summary of early Nyāya arguments.</p>

<p>
Grammarians also consider the question of word reference.
Pāṇini takes at least a partial position on the question,
claiming that if words only refer to particulars, then someone who
ties up one cow for a sacrifice, in response to a Vedic command, would
be in error if they, in a later ritual, tie up another cow, as the
command could only refer to a single specific animal (<em>Eight
Chapters</em> 1.2.64). After him, Patañjali, in the <em>Great
Commentary</em>, refers to two earlier grammarians (whose work is not
independently available), Vyāḍi and Vājapyāyana,
who differ on this topic. Vyāḍi argues that words primarily
refer to particulars and Vājapyāyana claims they refer to
universals. Patañjali splits the difference, claiming that both
aspects are part of word-meaning, but which one is primary may vary
(see Deshpande 2003; VM;
and Matilal 1971.) Matilal illustrates
the moves in the debate with the example of a compound, “a
brave-man” (Sanskrit:
<em>vīra-puruṣaḥ</em>). Vājapyāyana would
argue that if “brave” refers to the attribute of
braveness, and “man” to the attribute of manhood, then
these two referents can be related together in an underlying, unifying
substratum (<em>sāmānādhikaraṇa</em>). But if his
opponent, Vyāḍi, were correct, there would be no way to
make sense of the compound, since both terms would refer to the same
individual, and thus there would be repetition. However, by making use
of the distinction between expressed meaning and the implied ground
for the meaning, Vyāḍi could reply: yes,
“brave” strictly refers to a brave man, but this word is
used because of the man’s braveness, whereas the other word is
used because of the man’s being a man.</p>

<p>
Whether the primary word-function results in a particular or
universal, philosophers understand its resultant cognition as a basis
for unhesitating action. Word meaning is treated in the context of
epistemology and the topic of verbal testimony. The two sets of
philosophers above, Mīmāṃsakas and Naiyāyikas,
both agree that verbal testimony is a way of knowing. However, for
Nyāya philosophers, testimony is authoritative because of the
speaker’s characteristics while Mīmāṃsakas
emphasize the innately authoritative nature of statements, regardless
of speaker, at at least when it comes to Vedic sentences. While they
believe that sentences (<em>vākya</em>) are truth-bearers, and
not individual words, since sentences are composed of words,
Nyāya and Mīmāṃsā philosophers focus on the
invariable contributions of words to sentences—their primary
meanings. This emphasis, we will see, is not shared by everyone, as
the grammarian Bhartṛhari rejects any ultimate metaphysical
distinction between words and sentences, arguing that such divisions
are provisional and arbitrary, even if useful in some contexts.</p>

<h3 id="VariSecoMean">2.2 Varieties of Secondary Meaning</h3>

<p>
In what follows, we will classify any kind of derivative meaning,
whether it be metaphor, metonymy, irony, hyperbole, punning, etc., as
“secondary.” Again, we are in the realm of word-meanings,
although there is discussion of sentence-level secondary meaning,
primarily in Mīmāṃsā, Vedānta, and
Alaṁkāra. While the task of precisely carving up varieties
of secondary meaning was frequently left to philosophers working on
aesthetics, other philosophers also took an interest in this question.
Many stock examples of secondary meaning are shared among the textual
traditions, although it is not until much later, in the seventeenth
century, that Indian linguistic analysis becomes robustly
interdisciplinary, in the work of Navya-Nyāya (see Bronner
2002). There are various ways to
classify secondary meaning: it may be based on the logical
relationship between primary and secondary meaning, on the semantic
distance between them, or on the role of speaker intention.</p>

<p>
For instance, Mukula Bhaṭṭa, the aforementioned
philosopher of aesthetics, distinguishes between secondary meaning
that is qualitative and secondary meaning that is free from qualities.
The qualitative includes metaphorical cases such as “The person
is an ox,” where the stubbornness of the person and the ox are
understood to be shared qualities. In contrast, cases like “The
village is on the Ganges” are typical of those that are free
from qualities. Here, the word “bank” is understood so as
to avoid the interpretation that the village is floating on the river
itself—but there are no properties shared between the village
and the Ganges (or the bank). In point of fact, Mukula argues that a
speaker may intend different secondary meanings with the same
utterance type, since another reason someone might utter the sentence
is to communicate that the village and the Ganges do share
qualities—the holiness of the Ganges river could be attributed
to the village due to proximity. In this way, the Ganges sentence
could exemplify a different utterance, one where there is
“semantic imbuing” of the qualities of the river to the
bank (Keating 2019:55, 117–126). Thus whether a speaker intends
or does not intend a secondary meaning becomes relevant to its
characterization. Finally, both the qualitative and quality-free
varieties may differ in terms of how closely related the primary and
secondary meanings are. Mukula describes highly conventional language
use as cases of “absorption”—for instance, using the
term “ruler” for to someone who is not from the ruling
class (so not strictly a ruler), but who performs the functions a
ruler does (such as protecting of people). In contrast, metaphors such
as “The person is an ox” are not absorption, but
superimposition, since some difference is understood. (See Keating
2019, Cuneo 2020, and McCrea 2008 for further discussion of Mukula and
Ānandavardhana on these topics.)</p>

<p>
All of these varieties of secondary meaning require three conditions.
First, there must be an obstacle in the primary meaning of the words.
Second, there must some relationship—of which kind, more
below—between the primary and secondary meaning. Third, there
must be a warrant for the secondary meaning, such as a motivation on
the speaker’s part or some accepted conventional sense. To take
a stock example, “Feed the sticks,” which means
“Feed the brahmins holding the sticks,” word
“sticks” refers to something which is inanimate and which
cannot be fed. Thus, the first condition is met—an obstacle to
what is called “semantic fit” (<em>yogyatā</em>)
which is necessary for a unified sentence. Second, there is a
relationship of association between brāhmin priests and
sticks—they carry walking sticks. Association is not the only
possible relationship between primary and secondary meaning, but it is
one, and it fulfills the second condition. Finally, a speaker using
this phrase would be trading on a conventionalized use, and thus meets
the third condition, of warrant.</p>

<p>
While this three-fold set of conditions is commonly accepted, given
different analyses of primary word-meaning, the boundary between
primary and secondary meaning will be drawn differently. For instance,
Bhāṭṭa Mīmāṃsakas, who take the
primary word-meaning to be a universal, find cases of secondary
meaning more pervasive than Nyāya philosophers, for whom
word-meaning in the primary sense is more flexible. Given the command,
“A cow is to be tied up,” the correct thing to do is to
find some single cow to fasten to a post. However,
Mīmāṃsakas such as Kumārila argue that the
primary meaning of “cow” in the command is <span class="sc">cowhood</span>,
which cannot be fastened to a post. Thus
there is an obstacle to the semantic fit of the sentence. To resolve
this difficulty, Kumārila invokes the secondary meaning function
known as indication (<em>lakṣaṇā</em>), on which see
McCrea 2020. In TV 1.3.10, he argues
that indication causes hearers to understand that an individual cow is
meant. Hearers understand this from the knowledge that
“cow” means <span class="sc">cowhood</span>, that
individual cows are qualified by <span class="sc">cowhood</span>, and
yet that the sentence is uttered for the purpose of fulfilling
sacrificial aims. Thus the relationship between the primary and
secondary meanings here is inherence (a universal inheres in an
individual), and the speaker aims to pick out a particular cow.</p>

<p>
One of the central categories of secondary meaning is those meanings
which have similarities with the primary meaning. For instance,
Kumārila takes qualitative expression
(<em>gauṇavṛtti</em>), figures based on similarities, to
be one of the two major types of secondary meaning, where indication
(<em>lakṣaṇā</em>) is a catch-all category for
figures based on any other kind of relationship. The figure of speech
which rhetorical traditions tracing back to ancient Greece call
“metaphor” would fall under qualitative expression,
although Indian thinkers generally focus on the logical structure
underlying figures rather than a syntactic structure by which metaphor
is often characterized (Gerow 1971).
Kumārila discusses the common example “Devadatta is a
lion,” saying that when people hear the utterance, they find the
word “lion” to be inexplicable as referring to Devadatta,
and therefore conclude that the term must be used figuratively.
However, while some thinkers would describe metaphors as involving a
superimposition of lion on Devadatta, Kumārila explicitly rejects
this analysis, saying that all that is meant is that there are similar
properties that the two have, such as bravery. Otherwise,
superimposition would mean there is confusion about the genuine
difference between people and lions.</p>

<p>
One might object that the three examples just given: “Feed the
sticks,” “A cow is to be tied up,” and
“Devadatta is a lion” do not all have the same kind of
obstacle. Philosophers, in the Aesthetic discipline and elsewhere,
work to make the nature of this obstacle precise. While initially the
emphasis is on the semantic connection within the sentence itself, for
Nyāya and Mīmāṃsā both, by the time of
Maṇḍana Miśra (ca seventh century CE) and
Vācaspati Miśra (ca tenth century CE), the failure is taken
to be wider, including problems with the larger context. In the ninth
century work of Mukula Bhaṭṭa, such a widening is apparent
as he distinguishes between multiple features of context which may
require a word to be taken in a secondary sense: a speaker, sentence,
time, place, and circumstance. Sometimes there is a clash between a
speaker and a sentence meaning, as in the case taken from courtly love
poetry—a common source of linguistic examples—where a
young woman utters words, “I go alone to the forest along the
riverbank” to a neighbor. She is to be understood as conveying
the opposite (she is not going alone) to her neighbor, but intending
her husband to overhear and to believe she is telling the truth. Since
we know facts (through the poetic context or genre) about the
woman’s personal life, Mukula argues that the sentence cannot be
taken to mean the literal truth.</p>

<h3 id="BitePoly">2.3 Bitextuality and Polysemy</h3>

<p>
An important phenomenon in Indian poetry, double meaning
(<em>śleṣa</em>), garnered the attention of philosophers of
aesthetics and, to a lesser extent, philosophers and grammarians. At
its most basic level, the figure involves using a single word in two
or more different senses. It is akin to “punning” but
without the connotation of triviality that often accompanies puns,
hence the term “bitextuality” (Bronner
2010). In fact, according to
Rudraṭa, in his <em>Ornaments of Poetry</em>
(<em>Kāvyālaṅkāra</em>, ca 855 CE), bitextuality
is the perfect figure of speech (Gerow
1977). The phenomenon in Sanskrit was not limited to a word or
two, here and there, but entire compositions were written which admit
of two different meanings. One of the most prominent examples is of
poems which, read one way tell the story of the
<em>Rāmāyaṇa</em>, and read another way, narrate the
<em>Mahābhārata</em>. Examples are difficult to translate
into English, since they rely on particularities of Sanskrit: word
breaks which are frequently joined together, the ubiquity of
compounds, and the fact of phonemic transformation at phonetic
boundaries (<em>saṃdhi</em>) which can be reconstructed in
multiple ways. For instance, <em>dāsyasītyuktvā</em>
can be disambiguated as <em>dāsy asīty uktvā</em>
(saying, “you are my slave”) or <em>dāsyasīty
uktvā</em> (saying [to myself] “you will give!”)
(Bronner 2010: xvii).</p>

<p>
This particular linguistic device is not merely a figurative ornament,
but is at the center of a major intellectual and literary movement.
Poetic lexicons exist which contain stipulated meanings for syllables.
These assist poets in creating bitextual compositions. Poetic
commentaries tease out the multiplicities inherent in poems, whether
or not they are intended by the author. Bronner
(2010) identifies several ways in which the existence of
bitextuality was a sticking point for theorists trying to give an
account of word-meaning and the relationship between meaning and
aesthetics. First, there is the difficulty of identifying a particular
logical structure underpinning bitextuality. Second, there is the
question of whether bitextuality’s effects are due to
word-meaning or to the sounds of words. Finally, there is the problem
of the psychology of bitextuality.</p>

<p>
One reason that bitextuality resists explanation is that the multiple
“registers” (ways of reading the text), such as the story
of the <em>Rāmāyaṇa</em> and the
<em>Mahābhārata</em> mentioned above, are not merely two
distinct sets of unrelated meanings. Rather, similes or metaphors
frequently connect the readings. For instance,
Dhanañjaya’s “Poem of Two Targets,” through
setting the <em>Rāmāyaṇa</em> and the
<em>Mahābhārata</em> “side-by-side” allows the
reader to contrast the protagonists of the two epics (Bronner
2010: 110). Further, even where such
relationships are not obvious, given the important principle that
non-literal utterances must be supported by some warrant, whether
conventional or due to speaker aims, most Sanskrit thinkers argued
that no one would utter a sentence with two meanings that are
unrelated. Mahima Bhaṭṭa (11<sup>th</sup> century CE), in
his <em>Analysis of “Manifestation”</em>
(<em>Vyaktiviveka</em>), argues that paranomasia, as a kind of
meaning, must be coherent in the sense of having semantic fit, even
if, as a kind of secondary meaning, there are cues which lead the
reader to go beyond the strictly literal sense. However, unlike cases
of metaphor, where there is an obstacle to semantic fit, as in
“Devadatta is a lion,” bitextuality requires that there be
(at least) two sets of coherent meanings which have semantic fit and
also that there be a way to bring both meanings together. Further,
since the trigger for bitextuality cannot be a failure of semantic
fit, there must be some cue other than just the mere possibility of
reading a sentence in two ways (McCrea
2008). Ānandavardhana, however, who comes two centuries
before Mahima Bhaṭṭa, argues that there may be bitextual
poems in which two sets of meanings do not cause a further metaphor or
simile (Bronner 2010: 204; McCrea
2008: 434).</p>

<h2 id="SuggMeanSpeaInte">3. Suggested Meaning and Speaker’s Intention</h2>

<p>
Ānandavardhana argues for a new linguistic capacity, suggestion
(<em>dhvani</em> or <em>vyañjanā</em>), which he believes
accounts for important phenomena not included within existing theories
of secondary meaning. His commentator, Abhinavagupta, elaborates on
this theory, though in a way which goes beyond
Ānandavardhana’s original text, and he also writes his own
independent treatise on the topic. As a result of these two thinkers
(authoring the <em>Light on Suggestion</em> and <em>The Eye</em>,
respectively), a new debate opens. It centers on whether existing
theories of language can account for the subtleties of meaning found
in literature, such as courtly poetry, drama, and great epics. Those
who agree that suggestion must be accepted discuss what kinds of
suggested meaning ought to be adduced; those who reject suggestion
generally try to show that for each putative category of suggested
meaning, an equivalent explanation can be given, through
already-accepted processes such as indication or inferential
reasoning. This discussion is not much taken up in philosophical
circles in the Classical period. For instance, the Nyāya
philosopher Jayanta Bhaṭṭa (ca ninth century CE) has a
stray remark disparaging suggestion in his <em>Flower Garland of
Logic</em> (<em>Nyāyamañjarī</em>) but does not
engage substantively with arguments for it.</p>

<h3 id="InsuExisCapa">3.1 Insufficiency of Existing Capacities</h3>

<p>
Ānandavardhana proceeds by citing passages which are generally
accepted to have various kinds of poetic effects, and then analyzing
how these effects are attained by suggestion. He divides the content
of what is suggested into implied meanings, implied figures, and
aesthetic moods (<em>rasa</em>). He also distinguishes among varieties
of suggested meaning according to other criteria such as the
speaker’s intention, how rapidly the hearer recovers the
suggested content, and whether expressions or phonemes are the basis
for what is suggested. When suggestion is a way of conveying the
<em>rasa</em>, the dominant aesthetic mood described or intimated
within a poem, it is called <em>rasa-dhvani</em>. Ānandavardhana
tries to give an account of when it is that suggestion causes poetic
beauty, and argues that <em>rasa</em> is the proper aim of all poetry.
It is important to mark that, for Ānandavardhana, <em>rasa</em>
is found within the text, and not the reader. The reader simply comes
to have a cognition of the text’s <em>rasa</em>. Thus it is
easily understood as meaning, and not a reader’s emotional
state. After Abhinavagupta’s commentary on Ānandavardhana,
the emphasis shifts onto the reader’s emotive experience, and
how to understand <em>rasa</em> in relation to other kinds of meaning
becomes more difficult. Even though many things may be suggested
(figures of speech, facts), the ultimate aim of <em>dhvani</em> or
suggestion in the poetic context is to suggest <em>rasa</em>.</p>

<p>
Take the case of “The village is on the Ganges.” Here,
Ānandavardhana argues that suggestion operates after both primary
and secondary meaning. What is suggested is the purity of the village
which is on the bank of the holy Ganges river. Note, though, that he
does not think that both primary and secondary meaning are always
necessary for suggestion. For instance, the word “Ganges”
itself could suggest purity without being in a metaphorical or
otherwise figurative context (here, it is metonymical for the bank).
Ānandavardhana also contrasts the function of suggestion with the
primary meaning function. As for the latter, he says the relationship
between the composition of words in a sentence and its primary meaning
is a “natural relation.” The sense in which the
word–referent relation is “natural” is that it is
fixed. A word’s primary meaning is that meaning which is
cognized in every single instance the word is employed. Suggestion, in
contrast, is an “artificial relation” since it is a
meaning that is not given by its natural word, and the relationship
between suggested meaning and a suggestive word is not
one–to–one.</p>

<p>
On Ānandavardhana’s view, the suggested meaning is a
further step beyond the secondary meaning, but is not always
understood through what is secondarily meant. For example, what is
suggested in this case is understood through the primary meaning of
“Ganges,” since it is the river and not the bank which is
associated with suggested properties (specified as its purity and
coolness, according to later thinkers). The crucial aspect of
Ānandavardhana’s view is that while secondary meaning
requires a failure of semantic fit, suggestion does not. A
hearer’s understanding of “on the Ganges” as meaning
“on the bank of the Ganges” is necessary in order for the
sentence not to cause a cognition of a village as floating upon the
Ganges. In contrast, the suggested sense does not rectify any apparent
semantic incompatibility in the literal meaning of the sentence.</p>

<h3 id="VariSuggMean">3.2 Varieties of Suggested Meaning</h3>

<p>
While one can present a definitive number of types of suggestion
(Abhinavagupta says there are thirty-five), Ānandavardhana
himself says there are an endless number of combinations if we take
into account all of the facts involved in creating suggested meaning.
Whether this should be taken literally or as a rhetorical flourish,
the point is that Ānandavardhana does not view his analysis as a
complete taxonomy of suggested meaning. In keeping with this spirit,
only a few of the important divisions are discussed below.</p>

<p>
Ānandavardhana subdivides suggestion in two ways based on two
kinds of intentions a speaker has with regard to the expression she
utters. This is consistent with his view that underlying all cases of
suggestion there is a purpose (<em>prayojana</em>) the speaker has in
choosing a particular expression. In particular, these intentions are
defined in terms of the speaker’s attitude towards the primary
meaning of an expression. First, a speaker may intend to convey the
primary meaning plus some suggested meaning. Second, she may not
intend to convey the primary meaning, but only have an intention to
convey a suggested meaning.</p>

<p>
As an example of the first type, Ānandavardhana cites love poetry
written by the Buddhist philosopher Dharmakīrti (ca
6<sup>th</sup> to 7<sup>th</sup> century CE, see the entry on
 <a href="../dharmakiirti/">Dharmakīrti</a>).
 The poem describes images of birds and fruit which are meant to be
taken literally. However, these images are juxtaposed in a way which
suggests an additional sense consistent with the romantic tone of the
poem. There is no explicit comparison between the images, but the
comparison is suggested. This kind of suggestion is something like the
phenomenon in Ezra Pound’s famous imagist poem, “In a
Station of a Metro”</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The apparition of these faces in the crowd;
<br />
Petals on a wet, black bough. (Pound
1913)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
There is no linguistic <em>metaphor</em> in the sense of an explicit
predication between two things, such as faces and petals. However, the
reader understands an implicit comparisons between the two images.
Thus there is both primary and suggested meaning. Other times,
Ānandavardhana says, the speaker intends only to convey a
suggested meaning, so the primary meaning may be entirely replaced or
set aside in some manner. For example, in this passage from the
<em>Rāmāyaṇa</em>, the phrase “blinded” is
not being used in a primary sense, but in a suggestive manner:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The sun has stolen our affection for the moon,
<br />
whose circle is now dull with frost
<br />
and like a mirror blinded by breath,
<br />
shines no more. (DL: 209)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Since a mirror cannot, strictly speaking, be made blind—breath
merely fogs it—this is a case where the speaker intends what is
suggested to replace the primary meaning.</p>

<p>
While the previous categories are distinguished by the speaker’s
aims, the two other categories are distinguished by the hearer’s
experience. Ānandavardhana says that when hearers come to
understand the suggested meaning of a poem, they can do so either
instantaneously or else after a “reverberation”—some
experienced temporal gap between recovering the literal meaning and
recovering the suggested meaning. The suggested content characterized
by reverberation may be similar to what contemporary philosophers talk
about in terms of the metaphorical “felt gap” between
literal and metaphorical meanings in particular (e.g., Camp
&amp; Reimer 2008). However, it also
includes the idea of a temporal gap between understanding the literal
and suggested meaning. The phenomenological observation can, and
should, be distinguished from a claim about content recovery.
Ānandavardhana does not appeal to the phenomenology of suggested
meanings as evidence that they are recovered in a certain way, though
such a move was certainly available to him, as we have seen in
 <a href="#AppePhen">section 1.2</a>.</p>
 
<p>
Ānandavardhana categorizes a case of bitextuality
(<em>śleṣa</em>) as involving reverberation, as both
meanings do not occur to the reader simultaneously. Further he
describes this as a case where the sentence (rather than individual
words) suggests a second meaning, which comes like a
“reverberation” or some time after the first. This
supports the idea that reverberation is about processing time, rather
than (or in addition to) a felt tension. Elsewhere,
Ānandavardhana points out that for many kinds of suggestion,
hearers do not have a “reverberation” or awareness of a
gap between the primary meaning and what is suggested. Abhinavagupta
gives an analogy to explain cases where there is no such
reverberation. He says that when someone has taken to heart the
relationship between smoke and fire, she will be able to reason
inferentially to the existence of fire simply on the perceptual basis
of smoke. There need not be any awareness of inferential processes on
the part of the thinker.</p>

<p>
Ānandavardhana distinguishes in a number of other ways between
varieties of suggestion. He identifies the basis of suggestion: word
meanings, sentence meanings, discourse unit meanings, and even the
sounds of individual phonemes can all give rise to suggested meaning.
A poem’s entire “meaning,” that is, a comparison
which may not be explicit in the poem, but is suggested throughout,
can itself be the basis for a suggested <em>rasa</em>, such as love or
heroism. At a more local level, individual phonemes within a poem may
also suggest an aesthetic mood, through being sonorous or harsh, etc.
These distinctions within suggested meaning underscore the need for
caution in drawing equivalence between suggestion and analytic
philosophical concepts, such as implicature (see the entry on
 <a href="../implicature/">implicature</a>)
 which is roughly analogous to, but not co-extensive with,
Ānandavardhana’s <em>dhvani</em>, since Ānandavardhana
denies that suggestion arises through inferential reasoning.</p>

<h3 id="ObjeSuggMean">3.3 Objections to Suggested Meaning</h3>

<p>
Although Ānandavardhana’s theory of suggested meaning was
influential for many philosophers of aesthetics in the years following
his <em>Light on Suggestion</em>, not everyone accepted the new model.
There were two ways of rejecting suggestion: reducing it to a
non-linguistic capacity or reducing it to an already-existing
linguistic capacity—primary or secondary meaning. The first
strategy is followed, in different ways, by Bhaṭṭa
Nāyaka and Mahima Bhaṭṭa, whereas the second is
followed by Mukula Bhaṭṭa and members of the
Prābhākara school of Mīmāṃsā.</p>

<p>
In his <em>Mirror of the Heart</em>, Bhaṭṭa Nāyaka
(ca. 900 CE) argues that Ānandavardhana is mistaken to think of
<em>rasa</em> as something like linguistic meaning, and instead
focuses on the emotional response of the reader (Pollock
2016, Ollett
2020). His argument is that <em>rasa</em> cannot be the kind of
thing which is the meaning of a sentence—it is an experiential
event which is caused by sentences. Drawing on
Mīmāṃsā hermeneutics, which emphasizes how Vedic
language causes hearers to follow injunctions, Bhaṭṭa
Nāyaka proposes a multi-part process in which the primary meaning
function operates in a normal manner, but subsequently there is what
Pollock calls an “aesthetic text-event” that unifies the
disparate parts of a poem through a generalizing power
(<em>bhāvakatva</em>, De 1960 and
Pollock 2016). The audience has the
ability to enjoy (Pollock: “experientialize”) the result
through a particular aesthetic capability (<em>bhojakatva</em>), and
the result is a transcendent, rapturous experience of <em>rasa</em>.
Though understanding Nāyaka’s account is difficult, given
some textual problems, Ollett 2020
argues that his idea of “actualizing” multiple parts of a
text has a parallel with the process by which we understand a unified
sentence meaning from the parts of a sentence. While <em>rasa</em> is
not a linguistic meaning the way that a sentence meaning is, on this
understanding, it, like sentence meaning, is something unified
understood in dependence on multiple constituent parts.</p>

<p>
Mahima Bhaṭṭa (ca. 1025 CE) does not consider
<em>rasa</em> anything more than an emotion which has been stabilized
into the object of a particular kind of aesthetic enjoyment. His
<em>Analysis of “Manifestation”</em> argues that, since
the characters in a poem are unreal, the emotions they are
experiencing are also unreal, and must be inferred or imputed to them.
All of the talk of “manifesting” <em>rasa</em> is itself a
figure of speech, on Mahima Bhaṭṭa’s view. In
addition, he argues that any putative “secondary meaning”
such as indication (<em>lakṣaṇā</em>) is also
inferred. Primary meaning plays an evidentiary role in inference based
on rules of pervasion (<em>vyāpti</em>) between the primary
meaning and secondary or suggested meaning. This position is
criticized by later thinkers, since the relationship between primary
meaning and these other meanings does not easily admit of
universalizable regularities, and suggested meanings are often
defeasible (see the entry on
 <a href="../logic-india/">logic in classical Indian philosophy</a>
 for discussion of inference).</p>

<p>
Like Bhaṭṭa Nāyaka and Mahima Bhaṭṭa,
Mukula Bhaṭṭa agrees with Ānandavardhana that there
are poetic phenomena that require explanation. He argues that these
meanings arise from the existing category of secondary meaning,
indication (<em>lakṣaṇā</em>), rather than the third
linguistic capacity of suggested meaning. His <em>Fundamentals of the
Communicative Function</em>, through analysis of many of the stock
examples of suggestion in the <em>Light on Suggestion</em>, identifies
the necessary features which trigger indication: an obstacle in the
primary meaning, a relationship between the primary and indicated
meaning, and a motive or conventional basis for the indicated meaning.
Mukula argues that it is possible to have cases of indicated meaning
which do not completely replace the primary meaning. Mukula’s
work comes to be widely influential through its incorporation into the
<em>Illumination of Poetry</em> (<em>Kāvyaprakāśa</em>)
written by later philosopher of aesthetics Mammaṭa, who excerpts
parts of it verbatim (McCrea 2008).</p>

<p>
Rather than explain suggested meaning as part of secondary meaning,
the Prābhākara school of Mīmāṃsā
prefers to incorporate it into primary meaning. Their position, which
is discussed in more detail below, criticizes the
Bhāṭṭa distinction between primary and secondary
meaning. On their view, word meanings do not—as per the
Bhāṭṭa Mīmāṃsā view—have a
fixed primary meaning regardless of sentence context. Instead, the
meaning of a word will vary depending on its relationship with other
words in a given sentence. Thus a word can carry a putatively
“suggested” meaning simply through force of context.
Ānandavardhana himself implicitly criticizes this position,
arguing that suggested meaning function has a different object, since
it does not result directly from the word, but from the primary
meaning of the word. For instance, the well-known case of “A
village is on the Ganges” suggests the purity of the
village—but this cannot be the primary meaning of the word
“Ganges” even contextually. It is an additional meaning,
conveyed subsequent to the ordinary meaning of “Ganges”
(DL).</p>

<h2 id="CritDist">4. Criticizing the Distinction</h2>

<p>
Not all thinkers accept that there is a genuine difference between
primary and secondary meaning. The rejection of this distinction
happens in several different ways. First, and most radically, one
might flatten the distinction to the point at which all language is
equally “non-literal,” and reject the idea that there is a
foundational stratus of meaning. This is the view of some Buddhists,
although just how to cash out this idea is a significant question.
Second, one might argue that while there is a pragmatic reason to
distinguish between primary and secondary meaning, this distinction
does not map onto any genuine facts about language or its relationship
with the world. Loosely, this is the view of Grammarian
Bhartṛhari, whose <em>sphoṭa</em> or “burst”
theory is that words are simply useful heuristics, but not real in any
robust sense. Finally, one might argue that word-meanings are highly
context-dependent to the extent that it is not useful to think of a
single “primary” meaning for a word. This is the position
of Prābhākara Mīmāṃsakas who do, however,
make room for secondary meaning in a sense.</p>

<h3 id="Budd">4.1 Buddhism</h3>

<p>
Buddhism and Jainism, two so-called “heteroprax”
(Veda-rejecting) traditions in India, put forward analyses of language
which challenge the notion of a distinction between primary and
secondary meaning, at least as drawn in the orthoprax schools.
Significant textual work—as well as secondary
scholarship—remains to be done in the area of how both of these
traditions (especially Jainism) understand language, but there are
some clear themes.</p>

<p>
Buddhist thinkers are broadly committed to error theories about
ordinary language use. As noted already, early Buddhists, in texts
such as <em>The Questions of King Milinda</em>
(<em>Milindapañhā</em>), argue for a kind of
conventionalism: language which seems to refer to persistent whole
objects, such as chariots and persons, does not, as such objects are
taken to lack true existence. Later philosophical reflection, such as
in the <em>Commentary on the Treasury of Dharma</em>
(<em>Abhidharmakośabhāṣya</em>) of Vasubandhu (ca
fourth to fifth century CE, see the entry on
 <a href="../vasubandhu/">Vasubandhu</a>),
 presents a kind of local
 <a href="../fictionalism/">fictionalism</a>
 or reductionism, as the only truly existing things are atomic simples
which exist momentarily. Thus, all language is, save for claims about
ultimately real constituent parts, loose speech. Buddhist philosophy
of language is famous for its “two truths” doctrine (see
the entry on
 <a href="../twotruths-india/">the theory of two truths in India</a>),
 the notion that there is conventional truth and ultimate
truth—but this gets cashed out variously among the later schools
such as Yogacāra and Madhyamaka (see Siderits 2003 and Garfield
2006).</p>

<p>
A commitment to the ubiquitous nature of non-literal speech is seen
explicitly in Buddhist texts which pick up on the existing categories
in Grammarian and Aesthetic thought, such as cognitive superimposition
or metaphor (<em>upacāra</em>), and employ them to undermine the
orthoprax theories of language which were realist and referential in
nature (Gold 2007 and Tzohar 2018). For instance, the Yogacāra
Buddhist Sthiramati, in his <em>Commentary on the Thirty Verses</em>
(<em>Triṃśikābhāṣya</em>) (ca sixth century
CE), cites a common Grammarian definition of <em>upacāra</em>,
noting that use of the term “self” and
“things” is an instance of such figurative talk (Tzohar
2018). Not only is the self, when talked about in apparently ordinary
ways, really being talked about indirectly, but this is so for all
words which, on Sthiramati’s Yogācāra view, refer to
an individual’s conscious experience of qualities, and not
things in themselves. For Sthiramati, at least, there is a sense in
which all language is “metaphorical,” though grounded in
the conscious arising and perishing of experiential events, rather
than a (putatively) objective external reality.</p>

<p>
Another way in which this conventionalism plays out is in the
development of the <em>apoha</em> theory of concepts, which has
important implications for how language functions. The term
<em>apoha</em> means “exclusion.” This theory first
presented in the work of fifth to sixth century CE philosopher
Diṅnāga (see the entry on
 <a href="../dharmakiirti/#AboTheApo">Dharmakīrti</a>,
 and the discussion of the theory of <em>apoha</em>). The theory of
exclusion is meant to explain how we can have conceptual connections
(linguistic or otherwise) with the world even though, on this Buddhist
view, reality is ultimately a series of unique, momentarily-existing,
ineffable particulars. Without universals or qualities, the Buddhists
have a difficulty explaining how talk of a “blue lotus,”
for instance, is possible. Their ingenious solution, much debated
after Diṅnāga, is to propose that we carve up the world
conceptually by negation. Blueness is not a universal, but the
exclusion of all non-blue particular things—it is to be
“not non-blue.” How this theory works in detail is the
subject of Dharmakīrti’s work (ca sixth to seventh century
CE) and a whole host of later thinkers, such as Ratnakīrti (ca
eleventh century CE). The philosopher of aesthetics Bhāmaha (ca
sixth to seventh century CE) criticizes <em>apoha</em> in his
<em>Ornaments of Poetry</em>
(<em>Kāvyālaṅkāra</em>), but not with regard to
any distinction between primary and secondary meaning. Rather, he
argues that the sense of a word is positive, and that on
<em>apoha</em>, Buddhists are assigning two capacities to
words—exclusion and positive designation—when there is
only one (KB).
Mīmāṃsā and Nyāya philosophers likewise
criticize <em>apoha</em> extensively on these and similar grounds.</p>

<p>
Buddhist thought also takes up the distinction between kinds of
meaning in its approach to hermeneutics, with regard to the
interpretation of <em>sūtra</em> passages, not unlike the way in
which Vedic hermeneutics both informs and is informed by
Mīmāṃsā philosophical reflection on language.
Buddhist hermeneutics, despite its being positioned
“outside” of the orthopraxy, employs lists of figures
which pre-date the rise of the textual tradition of Sanskrit poetics,
in a way which demonstrates that there were links between the
Grammarian, Nyāya, Mīmāṃsā, and Buddhist
theories of meaning (Tzohar 2018). A
crucial concept in Buddhist hermeneutics, which approaches a
distinction between literal and non-literal, is that of
<em>upāya</em> or “skillful means.” With the
assumption that the Buddha speaks both truthfully and with an eye
towards the abilities of his particular audience, the notion of
“skillful means” allows Buddhist hermeneuticists to
explain apparently contradictory elements within Buddhist texts. As
with Bhāṭṭa Mīmāṃsā use of
secondary meaning for Vedic interpretation, recourse to secondary
meaning in the face of apparent contradiction, skillful means allowed
for truth-preservation while constraining the interpretive
process.</p>

<h3 id="Jain">4.2 Jainism</h3>

<p>
Originating with Mahāvīra, who lives around the same time as
Siddhārtha Gautama, the founder of Buddhism (sixth century BCE),
Jainism is known for its emphasis on language’s representational
limitations. This is because of its view that reality is multi-faceted
(<em>anekāntavāda</em>) and any single description will
necessarily involve some apparent contradiction, due to the fact that
it is incomplete (Balcerowicz 2001).
Without relativization to a standpoint (<em>naya</em>), the sentences
“<em>o</em> is <em>P</em>” and “<em>o</em> is
not-<em>P</em>” are contradictory. To address this, Jainas
propose that there are seven ways to characterize any purported fact,
each one preceded by a marker of uncertainty, <em>syāt</em>. Any
object <em>o</em> and its property <em>P</em> can be described as:</p>

<ol>

<li><em>o</em> is <em>P</em>.</li>

<li><em>o</em> is not-<em>P</em>.</li>

<li><em>o</em> is both <em>P</em> and not-<em>P</em>.</li>

<li><em>o</em> is beyond words.</li>

<li><em>o</em> is beyond words and <em>P</em>.</li>

<li><em>o</em> is beyond words and not-<em>P</em>.</li>

<li><em>o</em> is beyond words and both <em>P</em> and
not-<em>P</em>.</li>
</ol>

<p>
This seven-fold schema is found in many Jaina texts, from the early
works of Kundakunda (3<sup>rd</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> centuries) up to
the to the important <em>Flower Garland of Conditional
Predication</em> (<em>Syādvādamañjarī</em>) of
Malliṣeṇa (13<sup>th</sup> century CE). While some, like
Priest (2008), have argued that this
seven-fold classification scheme lends itself to a
 <a href="../logic-paraconsistent/">paraconsistent</a>
 (and perhaps also
 <a href="../dialetheism/">dialethic</a>)
 formalization, it need not be, as within the scheme, each of the
seven standpoints follows the law of non-contradiction, though within
a many-valued truth-system (Ganeri 2002;
Schang 2013). On this interpretation,
the truth of an utterance is relativized to a particular context, in
the sense that each standpoint restricts the context, as Balcerowicz
argues, through indices such as space, time, convention, and so on
(Balcerowicz 2001). (Balcerowicz also
questions whether modern formalization is an eisegetical enterprise,
reading into the text conceptions of axiomatization which were not
present; see Balcerowicz 2015.)
Minimally, according to Siddharṣigaṇi (ca tenth century
CE), one must include in one’s analysis of any given utterance
the speaker’s intention and the relevant linguistic connections
(Clerbout, Gorisse, &amp; Rahman 2018).
The schema, further, is hierarchically ordered, so that each
standpoint includes more indices than the prior, according to
Malliṣeṇa (Balcerowicz
2001).</p>

<p>
Emphasis on speaker’s intention is crucial for Jainas,
especially insofar as they hold to a division between two standpoints:
the ordinary standpoint (<em>vyavahāranaya</em>) and the
transcendent or ultimate standpoint (<em>niścayanaya</em>,
<em>pāramārthikanaya</em>). Ultimately speaking, language
cannot be said to have any inherent communicative power, but rather it
functions due to the speaker’s authority and position as having
unmediated access to the truth. In fact, the Jainas hold that
scriptures containing the words of Mahāvīra are not
efficacious due to the words themselves—a stark contrast to the
Mīmāṃsā view of an unauthored Veda—but due
to a unique suggestive power as well as the religious purity of the
listener. As a result of these principles, any single utterance is
susceptible to a number of different analyses. Flügel
(2010) distinguishes between four
kinds of analysis in Jaina thinking about language:</p>

<ol>

<li>Principles and criteria for religious speech</li>

<li>General rules and clauses for language usage</li>

<li>Context-sensitive rules for proper ways of speaking</li>

<li>Examples considering social implications</li>
</ol>

<p>
The existence of normative criteria governing language use, aiming at
the avoidance of harm (<em>ahiṁsā</em>) and the
preservation of truth (<em>satya</em>) can be compared to Gricean
conversational maxims, although the intentional flouting of these
principles does not lead to conversational implicatures. In fact,
Jaina doctrines discourage ambiguity and emphasize precise speech
(Flügel 2010).</p>

<h3 id="PraaMiim">4.3 Prābhākara Mīmāṃsā</h3>

<p>
In their explanation of word-meaning, Prābhākara
Mīmāṃsakas emphasize the relationship of words with
one another in a token utterance. Śālikanātha (ca.
7<sup>th</sup> century CE), in his <em>Monograph in Five Chapters</em>
(<em>Prakaraṇapañcikā</em>), argues that, to avoid
multiplying denotative capacities for words in different contexts, one
should posit the ability for words to denote meanings-in-relation.
This position is called “denotation of what is related”
(<em>anvitābhidhāna</em>) and it is opposed to the
Bhāṭṭa Mīmāṃsā analysis
discussed earlier (<em>abhihitānvaya</em>). The principle of
parsimony is central to Prābhākara arguments. On the
Bhāṭṭa view, there are multiple levels of meaning and
a complex process of moving from a word to a word meaning to a unified
sentence which connects those meanings. Śālikanātha
argues that it would be better to explain the resultant connections
(<em>anvaya</em>) among word meanings as being understood directly
from the word. The idea that the same operation is responsible for
unifying the word meanings into a sentence anticipates, to a degree,
Frege’s idea of word meanings as unsaturated entities, although
Śālikanātha is not thinking in the same ontological
terms (see the discussion of semantic power and the reduction of
semantic properties in the entry on
 <a href="../early-modern-india/#SemPowRedSemPro">analytic philosophy in the entry on early modern India</a>,
 and Siderits 1991).</p>

<p>
Prābhākara thinkers deny that the meaning of a
“cow” is a universal and that indication is necessary to
shift the generic referent of the noun to a particular.
Śālikanātha argues that while it may be true that
something the same is remembered in each case when someone says
“cow,” this remnant of memory is not the same thing as a
word meaning (PS: 381ff, Ollett
2020b). Meaning has to do with the role
that a word’s cognition plays within a sentence. Further, he
argues that a word conveys the universal and the particular together,
since the first cannot be understood without the second. So, while he
agrees with the Bhāṭṭas that a series of universals
cannot be connected together in a qualificative relationship, he
concludes that this is a reason to reject the view that words
primarily communicate generalities (<em>sāmānya</em>),
arguing that they must communicate a qualified thing
(<em>viśeṣana</em>).</p>

<p>
However, Śālikanātha does leave room for the
distinction between primary and secondary meaning in cases like
“The village is on the Ganges” and “The boy is a
lion.” He argues that where the ordinary meaning of words cannot
form a connective relationship then there is recourse to secondary
meaning. So in the case of words like “Ganges” and
“lion,” the meaning–in–relation which is in
connection with other word meanings is the secondary meaning, not the
primary meaning. Despite this allowance for a distinction, the
Prābhākara view is often touted as a radically contextualist
approach. For instance, Abhinavagupta, who lived after the highly
influential Śālikanātha, characterizes the
Prābhākara position as one on which there is no distinction
between primary meaning, secondary meaning, or suggestion. He says
that their view is that the meaning of the word is simply its final
result (1.4b <em>The Eye</em>, DL). He
points, however, out that the Prābhākara
Mīmāṃsā must accept different kinds of statements
in the Vedas for exegetical purposes—some more direct than
others—and thus they should have no problem in principle
allowing for suggested meaning.</p>

<p>
Prābhākaras emphasize three concepts in their account of
word and sentence meaning: expectancy
(<em>ākāṅkṣā</em>), cognitive proximity
(<em>sannidhi</em>), and semantic fittingness (<em>yogyatā</em>).
Depending on the word’s role in a sentence, it will have
different expectancies. This expectancy also varies depending on which
word meanings are presented to the subject’s mind as candidates
for connection—or which meanings have cognitive proximity (these
may not be words which uttered in sequence, as a connected subject and
verb may be separated by a dependent clause). Finally, the goal of a
sentence is to convey something meaningful, so the word meanings in
relation must work together semantically: a sentence such as
“Sprinkle the garden with fire” would fail to have
semantic fittingness. These three criteria determine what the
meaning-in-relations are which result in a sentence. Secondary meaning
is resorted to when there is no relation possible
(<em>anvayānupapatti</em>), such as when the word
“village” cannot be related to “on the
Ganges,” since this expression would lack semantic fittingness.
These three concepts are not restricted to Prābhākaras,
however, but are discussed and refined in various ways by nearly all
of the intellectual traditions treating language (see
 <a href="#SentMean">section 5.1</a>).</p>
 
<h3 id="SphoTheo">4.4 <em>Sphoṭa</em> Theory</h3>

<p>
In his <em>Treatise on Sentences and Words</em>, the grammarian
Bhartṛhari (ca. 450 CE) takes up the distinction between primary
and secondary meaning in more detail than previous grammarians such as
Pāṇini and Patañjali. His work is difficult—he
is aware of, and engages with, Buddhist, Jaina, and
Mīmāṃsā views of language, but not in a
straightforward dialectical manner, as is the style of many other
Indian thinkers. This causes controversy over his established views
(for discussion of which see Cardona 1999). In terms of his position
on the division between primary and secondary meaning, the
interpretive debate centers on the implications of the
<em>sphoṭa</em>-theory for the possibility of such a
distinction.</p>

<p>
In Bhartṛhari’s work, the term <em>sphoṭa</em>,
meaning “burst,” refers to the indivisible nature of the
utterance—it is a sound which carries meaning, and which cannot
be subdivided into words or particular phonemes. (One might think here
of Wittgenstein’s <em>Philosophical Investigations</em>, e.g.,
1953 [2001]: 191, and the idea of grasping meaning in a
“flash”—and indeed, this connection has been
explored in Bhattacharyya 2002 and
elsewhere.) On one prevailing understanding of <em>sphoṭa</em>,
Bhartṛhari is committed to a kind of linguistic monism, which
not only denies the divisibility of utterances into grammatical
categories, but asserts the identity of speech and reality. Thus any
apparent distinctions between categories—letters, words,
semantic powers—are illusory. He uses common examples of
illusion in Indian philosophy to underscore this point: from far away,
a large tree may look like an elephant; at a glance, a rope may appear
to be a snake. However, these are misperceptions, as are the putative
semantic distinctions we make (Raja
1969).</p>

<p>
Jan E.F. Houben, in his translation of the “Exposition on
(Semantic) Relationship” (<em>Sambandhasamuddeśa</em>)
chapter of the <em>Treatise</em>, which treats figurative language
extensively, argues that Bhartṛhari does distinguish between
primary and secondary meaning, but on pragmatic grounds (Houben
1995). Houben thinks that
Bhartṛhari is a linguistic perspectivist, in the sense that his
concern is not to argue against any particular philosophical position,
but to show the limits of formal analysis itself. On this view, when
Bhartṛhari appeals to the analogy with perceptual illusion, it
is merely to dismantle the commitment to a certain theory of
reference: that which presupposes words refer to external reality.
Recently, Tzohar has argued that Bhartṛhari holds a
“pan-figurative” account, on which all words
“figuratively signify” (Tzohar
2018: 70). On this view, word reference does not require a
relationship with external referents. In contrast, all language use is
“figurative” in the sense that it does not require
correspondence. This interpretation incorporates but goes beyond
Houben’s perspectivism, drawing out implications for the limits
of language in connecting with reality.</p>

<p>
On the linguistic monism view, Bhartṛhari is anticipating later
Advaita Vedānta monism, on which empirical reality is illusory
and Brahman, without having any genuine properties, is the basis for
this illusion. His linguistic analysis, however, need not rely on
these metaphysical assumptions in order to underscore the centrality
of the sentence for meaning. Saying that grammatical categories and
stable word-meanings are constructed (<em>kalpita</em>) based on
theoretical needs, is to observe the priority of ordinary use and the
role of context for actual communication. The perspectivist
interpretation emphasizes the epistemic elements in
theory-construction, understanding the analogical argument from
illusion as less concerned with error than the pragmatic grounds to
our judgments.</p>

<h2 id="ImplDist">5. Implications of the Distinction</h2>

<p>
Different positions on the distinction between primary and secondary
meaning have implications for related philosophical topics. In the
realm of philosophy of language, theories of sentence meaning depend
on how word meaning is understood. Within philosophy of religion,
scriptural hermeneutics is also contingent upon approaches to meaning.
Finally, there are normative implications for speaking and producing
works of poetry, given the distinction.</p>

<h3 id="SentMean">5.1 Sentence Meaning</h3>

<p>
While much of the discussion about primary and secondary meaning is
centered on words, there are significant implications for sentence
meaning. Among those who accept the genuine compositionality of
sentences, <em>contra</em> the <em>sphoṭa</em> theorists above,
there are two theories of how words combine in context to convey a
unified meaning which differ over the role of secondary meaning.</p>

<p>
On the “connection of denoted meanings” view
(<em>abhihitānvāya</em>) accepted by Bhāṭṭa
Mīmāṃsakas, words convey their meanings, and then, in
conjunction with three conditions, these meanings are related together
through secondary meaning (<em>lakṣaṇā</em>). The
three conditions mentioned in
 <a href="#PraaMiim">section 4.3</a>
 are expectancy of connections
(<em>ākāṅkṣā</em>), semantic fit
(<em>yogyatā</em>), and cognitive contiguity
(<em>āsatti</em> or <em>sannidhi</em>). Expectancy of connections
is defined either syntactically or in terms of a hearer’s
psychological state of desiring words to fit together. Semantic fit is
the requirement that the sentence makes sense, <em>prima facie</em>,
and contiguity is the requirement that words are uttered in a
temporally adjacent sequence or that they are closely related in the
hearer’s mind. The view that the meaning of a sentence is due to
the secondary signification of words is not necessarily connected to
Bhāṭṭa view that words denote universals, as
Vācaspati, in his <em>Drop of Truth</em> (<em>Tattvabindu</em>),
defends this position despite elsewhere subscribing to Nyāya
theories of meaning. Vācaspati argues explicitly that indication
is responsible for the relationship (<em>anvaya</em>) between
word-meanings and argues that it is commensurate with a Naiyāyika
position (Sastri 2014; Phillips
2015).</p>

<p>
In favor of this view, its defenders observe that there must be some
common word-meaning among sentences such as “Bring the
cow,” “See the cow,” “Bring the sheep,”
and “See the sheep” in order for hearers to understand
what is being communicated. What we learn as language-users, through
trial and error and association of these various sentences with the
world, is the invariable meaning of the words. Against this
“connection of denoted meanings” view,
Śālikanātha and other Prābhākara
philosophers, as discussed earlier, argue that what is remembered on
hearing an individual word does not constitute a genuine meaning
without its being connected to the other words—emphasizing the
inferential element of meaning. Their view, the “designation of
meanings-as-connected” (<em>anvitābhidhāna</em>),
rejects the role of secondary meaning as a sentence-unifier.</p>

<p>
Jayanta Bhaṭṭa, a Nyāya philosopher, takes up a third
position, on which word-purport (<em>tātparya</em>) plays the
unifying functional role. This sense of <em>tātparya</em> is
different from later uses of the term to mean speaker intention. His
theory of word-purport is accepted by Abhinavagupta who includes it in
<em>The Eye</em> 1.4 among his list of functions
(<em>vṛtti</em>-s) of language: the primary, secondary,
word-purport, and suggestion (Graheli
2016). For both Jayanta and Abhinavagupta, the idea that the
secondary meaning function is also responsible for sentential unity
was unacceptable. Abhinavagupta summarizes the four capacities and
their characteristics as</p>

<ol>

<li>Primary meaning (<em>abhidhā</em>) – conveys the
individual word-meanings in their ordinary sense, according to
convention</li>

<li>Purport (<em>tātparya</em>) – conveys the entire
sentence meaning which would not otherwise be intelligible</li>

<li>Secondary meaning (<em>lakṣaṇā</em>) –
along with factors like blocking the ordinary sense, conveys another
meaning</li>

<li>Suggestion (<em>dhvani</em>) – along with the hearer’s
imaginative abilities, based on the first three powers, it suggests
another meaning.</li>
</ol>

<p>
The crucial distinction between the “connection of denoted
meanings” view and the two others is whether the secondary
meaning function has a role to play before the sentence meaning is
understood. Abhinavagupta explicitly says that it is not possible to
have an obstacle for primary meaning without first understanding the
syntactical connections among words. Thus secondary meaning can only
occur after the capacity of purport. He distinguishes between
nonsensical but syntactically acceptable sentences such as
“There are a hundred elephants on the tip of my finger”
and phrases which are syntactically faulty, “Ten pomegranates,
six pancakes” (DL: 1.4b L, page
86).</p>

<p>
Finally, Mukula Bhaṭṭa identifies a theory, most likely
his own, which he calls “the combined view” (Keating
2019). It takes secondary meaning to
apply both before and after sentence meaning. His understanding of
secondary meaning is broader than both Śālikanātha and
Abhinavagupta, as it does not always replace the primary meaning. So
it can play the role of purport and can also encompass the function of
suggestion. Thus, where the division between primary and secondary
meaning is made, and how secondary meaning is characterized has
important consequences for all these views of sentence meaning.</p>

<h3 id="ScriHerm">5.2 Scriptural Hermeneutics</h3>

<p>
Primary and secondary meaning, and the boundaries between them,
figured significantly in discussion over scriptural interpretation.
The topic is implicated in general discussions about how to approach
hermeneutics, in particular by Mīmāṃsā and
Vedānta philosophers. Particular doctrinal or philosophical
positions presented in, for example, the Upaniṣads or the Vedas,
are subject to scrutiny based on whether they should be taken
literally or not. The Mīmāṃsā system of
hermeneutics, as Rajendran (2001) and
McCrea (2008) have shown, subsequently
comes to influence the analysis of poetic meaning.</p>

<p>
While he is not a Mīmāṃsaka (he is called a
<em>sarva-tantra-sva-tantra</em>, someone for whom all systems are his
own), even Vācaspati, in his <em>Drop of Truth</em> mentioned
above, takes up the question of the impact of theories of secondary
meaning on the interpretation of the Vedas. He is a proponent of the
view that indication acts as “glue,” metaphorically
speaking, and secures the relationship between word-meanings—but
this might threaten the possibility that the Vedas convey meaning
secondarily, since indication requires appeal to speaker intention to
make sense. This, says his opponent, threatens Vedic authority. While
Vācaspati’s initial dry remark is to say, well, so much for
Vedic authority, he steps back by postulating that the ordinary use of
elders (<em>vrddhavyavahāra</em>) lets us understand, lacking a
genuine person who authors the words. He thus preserves the principle
that Vedic and ordinary language are cut from the same cloth, as both
require indication for sentence meaning (Sastri
2014; Phillips 2015).</p>

<p>
In the <em>Thorough Investigation of Truth</em>
(<em>Tattvasamīkṣā</em>), a commentary on
Maṇḍana Miśra’s <em>The Demonstration of
Brahman</em> (<em>Brahmasiddhi</em>), Vācaspati argues for the
truth of the Upaniṣadic claim of non-duality between self and
reality, against an interlocutor who would interpret the
Upaniṣads in a figurative manner. At stake is the role of
language in relationship to other sources of knowledge. The opponent
objects to the conflict between sense perception and the putatively
ordinary meaning of the Upaniṣads, since this would entail that
sense perception—which delivers knowledge of a world apart from
the self—is flawed. They argue that, when such conflicts arise,
perception should prevail, and a figurative meaning should be
preferred. Vācaspati objects on a number of grounds, first noting
that there must be a relationship between a primary and secondary
meaning (one cannot simply leap to a secondary meaning when it is
convenient). Then he appeals to the principle already described in
detail—when it is not possible to interpret the ordinary meaning
in a sensible manner, this is the impetus for secondary meaning.
Conflict with other knowledge sources is not the catalyst for
figurative interpretation
(Vācaspatimiśra, VT:
29–32).</p>

<h3 id="NormImpl">5.3 Normative Implications</h3>

<p>
In addition to contentful philosophical implications, the distinction
between primary and secondary meaning has an impact on how philosophy
is done. For instance, NS 1.2.10ff, in outlining the appropriate terms
of philosophical debate, defines the flaw of casuistry
(<em>vimāṃsa</em>) as misusing words to mislead one’s
opponent. There are a number of types of casuistry, one of which is
figurative. Vātsyāyana, in his commentary (NBh 1.2.14),
cites one of the stock examples of secondary meaning of the indicative
type: “The stands are shouting.” Here, where the meaning
is that people seated on wooden structures are shouting, it would be
casuistry to reply, “No, the stands are not shouting, but the
people are shouting.” This overly literal interlocutor pretends
to misunderstand the speaker’s intention, and makes there to be
conflict when there is none. Whether or not this kind of debate flaw
is an importantly unique kind of casuistry (there is some discussion
about this in the commentaries), Nyāya philosophers emphasize
that verbal hair-splitting without charity towards one’s debate
opponent constitutes a condemnable manner of intellectual speech (NS
1.2.2, Todeschini 2010).</p>

<p>
We have already seen in
 <a href="#Jain">section 4.2</a>
 that Jainas emphasize careful speech using the ordinary, not
figurative, meanings of words. Mīmāṃsā has a
similar emphasis on correct speech, especially in the context of Vedic
rituals. The utterances of mantras—parts of the Veda which
accompany ritual practice—had to be performed precisely in order
to guarantee the efficacy of the procedure (and mispronunciation in a
ritual context was equal to sinful lying). Thus the study of
grammatical rules was important, as these included pronunciation and
modification of words to fit a new context (declining nouns into the
plural, adjusting utterances to incorporate different deity names, and
so forth). Further, grammar was a corrective to ordinary use, which is
only an imperfect a guide to correct interpretation of Vedic words.
Distinguishing between commands in the primary sense of words and
figurative language exhortations was also crucial for
Mīmāṃsā, since the proper interpretation of the
latter was relevant for the performance of the ritual. For example,
the exhortation, “The grass-bedding is the ritual patron”
(TV 1.4.13) is a case of secondary meaning of the qualitative type
(<em>gauṇavṛtti</em>), which praises the central role of
the ritual patron. Kumārila observes that misunderstanding this
meaning would lead to absurdity, since the grass-bedding (a woven mat
of grass on which ritual implements are placed) is burned up—and
taking the phrase literally would mean putting an early stop to the
ritual process if the patron himself were burned (Harikai
2017).</p>

<p>
Finally, Aesthetics interweaves normative implications throughout.
Poetry is not merely for pleasure, but incorporates moral figures (one
is instructed to be like Rāma, the hero of the
<em>Rāmāyaṇa</em>, and not like Rāvaṇa, the
evil demon) and presupposes an entire moral structure. Abhinavagupta,
in his independent works, takes up the theory of suggestion into the
philosophy of Kashmir Śaivism, a tantric tradition which devotes
itself to the deity Śiva. For Abhinavagupta, <em>rasa</em> is not
merely an aesthetic phenomenon, but it is a profound sense of unity
with transcendent reality, found in the <em>rasa</em> of peacefulness
(<em>śānti</em>) which encompasses all others. Still, one
need not go so far as Abhinavagupta’s work to see the normative
dimension in Aesthetics, since even in Ānandavardhana’s
more ordinary understanding of <em>rasa</em>, there are certain
emotions which are appropriate to bring into existence, and others
which ought to be avoided. What is appropriate is dependent on the
character’s social position, gender, and so on. These norms also
constrain the interpretive possibilities of suggested meaning,
providing a conventional basis for the creative use of language.</p>
