## Drill Down Mode
    Search Term is Centered on screen
    Outgoing Links are below, and lines descened with arrows pointing down from the bottom of the node 
    Incoming links are above, and lines with arrows ascend up from the top of the node 
        - The incoming links are only those that are not linked out from the bottom

    Everytime you click on a node, the same pattern forms and redraws

## Explore Mode 

    This starts similar to drill-down mode, but:
        - whenever a new node is clicked, the node pops out another set of nodes
        - the new node is centered, and its links are highlighed, but the original set of nodes stays on screen, but is pushed back
