Get All links 
if links have a UL element, only get the html from <li> to <ul>. How? 

an li can have four main elements: 
1. "see as " text / placeholder text
2. the <a> link text</a>
3. author text 
4. a <ul> with all of the same 

for each link:
    is the first element text or an href:
        if the first element is text, is it placeholder text or see as text:
